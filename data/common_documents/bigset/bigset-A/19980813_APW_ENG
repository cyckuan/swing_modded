Cambodian king prepared to host talks between rival parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday
he is prepared to host talks between rival political parties aimed
at ending a post-election stalemate and forming a working
government, but only if he is formally asked.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a
slight majority in the National Assembly in a July 26 election, but
not the two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ immediately
spurned offers by Hun Sen to form a coalition government, alleging
rampant fraud in voting and ballot-counting.
	   The two opposition parties have threatened to boycott parliament
unless their complaints are properly investigated. So far all of
their concerns have been called ``baseless'' by the National
Election Committee, comprised mainly of Hun Sen's appointees.
	   The king, who offered to host the negotiations at his residence
in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, stressed Thursday that
he is not seeking an audience with the rival parties. But he said
he is willing to act as a conciliator if asked.
	   ``I have made clear that I have stayed and will stay in Siem
Reap at the disposal of the Cambodian People's Party, of Funcinpec
and of the (Sam Rainsy Party) if at least two of the three large
parties would like to have an informal meeting,'' he wrote.
	   Ranariddh and Rainsy expressed interest in the idea in a
joint-statement. Hun Sen's CPP also said over state-run radio
Wednesday it ``welcomes and supports the humble mediating role'' of
the king.
	   So far, however, no formal request has been made.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense
dual premiership formed after the U.N-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
they eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid
lost after his takeover.

Thredbo instructor believes he spoke to Americans tapped in rubble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A ski instructor told an inquest
Thursday he believes he spoke to his two American friends for about
an hour as they were buried under last year's fatal Thredbo ski
resort landslide.
	   Martin Thomas told Coroner Derrick Hand he believes he heard
Michael Sodergren saying ``Help me, I don't want to die'' and
Mariam (Mim) Sodergren calling out ``Hello,'' both with American
accents.
	   The ski instructors from Tahoe City, California, were two of the
18 people killed when the Alpine Way road collapsed and swept two
lodges down a hillside on July 30 last year.
	   Thomas told the inquest into the deaths that he maintained
contact with the two for an hour and was prepared to dig and rescue
his friends, but was ordered by rescuers to leave the area.

Markets mixed, but long-term gloom dominates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock prices were mixed in early trading
Thursday after a rebound on Wall Street, but the prevailing mood
remained sour because of weakness in Japan and a variety of local
troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei average managed to scratch out a small gain by
midday after eight straight days of losses. The threat of central
bank intervention prevented the dollar from rising against the yen.
	   However, none of that changed the region's fundamental gloom,
which was reflected in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere. Even
where stock prices and currencies rebounded on Thursday, there was
no confidence that things were turning for the better.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, already at a five-year low, slumped
more than 3 percent in morning trading. It was 214.19 points down
to 6,645.29. The Hang Seng already is down 16 percent this month.
	   As it has for the last week, the Hong Kong index closely
followed the fortunes of banking giant HSBC Holdings, which was
headed south again Thursday. HSBC, which accounts for about 30
percent of the index, shed about 4.5 percent by midmorning
Thursday.
	   HSBC was one of several major Hong Kong corporations that
reported poor first-half earnings last week, sending the market
steeply lower.
	   Analysts, echoing comments Wednesday by Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, blamed the fall in the Hong Kong market on the
weakness of the yen. Japan's economic troubles are causing
investors to worry that Hong Kong will be unable to keep its direct
link to the U.S. dollar, and that China will be forced to devalue
its yuan currency.
	   Both Chinese and Hong Kong officials insist that won't happen.
	   Japan's weakness unsettled markets throughout the region, which
also face new worries about the U.S. economy. Asian economies that
traditionally are focused on exports need a strong U.S. market to
help them out of their troubles. But volatility on Wall Street in
the past week has raised questions whether a long period of strong
growth is coming to a close.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index, fell to a
ten-year low, losing 1.9 percent to 976.75. One trader predicted it
would reach 900 by the end of the month unless the Japanese
government intervened in markets to support the yen.
	   Malaysia's market was down 2 percent because of profit taking
after gains Wednesday. Analysts cited local economic weakness and
uncertainty over whether Japan will turn around economically
anytime soon.
	   In Taiwan and the Philippines, markets were up, but even in
those markets there was little to break the gloom.
	   The Manila index had lost 14 percent of its value in the five
previous sessions, and traders regarded Thursday's advance as
largely a technical rebound. In Taipei, traders said the rebound
would be limited by Japan's weakness and worries about first-half
earnings reports that are due out by the end of August.

<TEXT>
	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ The bodies of 10 Americans killed in
the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya left Germany for the United
States on Thursday accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   The Air Force C-17 transport plane carrying the bodies took off
from Ramstein Air Base about 0415 GMT, headed for Andrews Air Force
Base in Maryland. There was a brief, private ceremony under an
overcast sky at Ramstein just before takeoff, with about 70 people
including a mixed honor guard of Marines, Army and Air Force.
Albright made no statement before boarding the plane.
	   Albright visited Wednesday with some of those wounded in the
bombing. After talking with nine patients in a U.S. military
hospital for about an hour, Albright said, ``I told them we'd do
everything to support them.''
	   She also thanked the hospital staff for doing what she called
``an amazing job here in raising their spirits.''
	   ``I am bringing home very brave people and they deserve the
support of the American people,'' she told reporters outside the
hospital, a few minutes from the base in southwest Germany.
	   She also repeated the determination of the United States to find
and punish those responsible for the blast in Kenya and an almost
simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and more than 5,500
wounded in the attacks.
	   Earlier Wednesday, six Air Force guards gently loaded the
flag-draped coffin of one American killed in Nairobi onto a
military aircraft for her final journey home.
	   Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was returning to
her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Her coffin
went back before the others at the request of her family.
	   The 12th American victim was to be buried in Kenya.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base on
Wednesday for Andrews. One American and 12 Kenyans remained
hospitalized in Germany.

17 killed, 26 injured as train rams into bus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A speeding train rammed a bus at a
railway crossing in southern India Thursday, killing 17 people and
injuring 26, domestic news agencies reported.
	   The bus apparently stalled after crashing though a closed gate
at the crossing, and was unable to move when the train approached,
the Press Trust of India reported. All the victims were passengers
of the bus which was packed to capacity.
	   No one on the train was killed or injured. The train engine was
slightly damaged, PTI said.
	   The accident occurred near the town of Karur, 2,000 kilometers
(1,200 miles) south of the Indian capital New Delhi.

Ailing former trader Leeson applies for early release from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Former trader Nick Leeson has applied for early
release from a Singapore prison following a cancer operation
earlier this week, a British official said Thursday.
	   Leeson, 31, underwent the operation last Monday in a Singapore
hospital to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon. He has served
more than 2 1/2 years of a 6 1/2 year prison sentence for fraud and
forgery that led to the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank, Britain's
oldest merchant bank.
	   ``We don't know how long it will take'' for Singapore
authorities to answer Leeson's plea, Martin Rickerd, first
secretary of the British High Commission in Singapore, told the
Associated Press.
	   Constitutionally, pleas for early release on compassionate
grounds are decided by President Ong Teng Cheong. Ong himself is
suffering from a recurrence of lymphoma, a kind of cancer.
	   After a short recovery in the hospital's intensive care unit,
Leeson moved back to the prison ward of New Changi Hospital.
	   He was ``awake and talking'' when last visited by British
consular staff, Rickerd said.

Thai rice exports up over previous year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's rice exports increased by
37.5 percent during the first seven months of 1998 compared with
the same period the previous year, the Ministry of Commerce said
Thursday.
	   Rice exports totaled 3.81 million tons from January to July,
compared to 2.77 million tons for the same seven months in 1997, a
ministry spokesman said.
	   Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Its most popular
variety is Jasmine Fragrant Rice.
	   Thailand's main competitors in the rice market, China, India and
Pakistan, all exported less rice through the first half of the
year, the ministry said. Floods had hurt China's output.
	   As a result, countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America and
Africa were importing more Thai rice.

Indonesian opposition figure prepares for political career
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent government critic said
Thursday he would resign as head of Indonesia's second largest
Muslim group before launching a political party.
	   Amien Rais, one of the most vocal opponents of former President
Suharto, has said he will set up a party to run in general
elections scheduled next year.
	   New President B.J. Habibie is promoting democratic reform and
dozens of political parties have sprouted since political and
economic upheaval forced Suharto to quit in May.
	   In an interview, Rais said he did not know when he would form a
party. But he said that before doing so, he would relinquish
authority over the Muhammadiyah movement, which represents 28
million Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country.
	   ``Automatically, I will resign from my position as general
chairman of Muhammadiyah if I join and set up a political party,''
Rais said by telephone from his home in the Java island city of
Yogyakarta.
	   Rais, who has offered himself as a presidential candidate, has
often said religion and politics should be separate.
	   Some of Rais' supporters have said he would set up a party on
Aug. 17, Indonesia's independence day.
	   However, rumors are rife that any demonstrations on that day
will trigger rioting and the military is deploying thousands of
soldiers in Jakarta as a precaution. In May, about 1,200 people
were killed in rioting in the capital and thousands of homes and
stores were looted or burned.
	   Rais, a pro-democracy activist, has no formal political
experience. A lecturer who earned a political science doctorate at
Chicago University, he is popular among students whose daily
demonstrations helped force Suharto from power.
	   Rais' Muslim group is moderate and a rival of the larger
Nahdlatul Ulama, a 30-million-member Islamic organization.

Report: Third person nabbed for spreading riot rumors on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A third person has been arrested
for allegedly using the Internet to spread rumors about rioting
which prompted panic in the capital last week, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A special police team investigating how rumors were spread last
Friday arrested a 30-year-old bank employee on Wednesday, the Star
newspaper said.
	   On Tuesday, a Malaysian man and woman, both in their 20s, were
arrested under the Internal Security Act after police enlisted
Internet service providers and technology experts to track their
on-line activities.
	   Investigators said they had discovered the origin of the
Internet messages which sparked panic shopping for food in many
parts of Kuala Lumpur, the Star said.
	   ``We don't really know how many messages are floating. However,
we believe there are only a few original ones,'' the daily quoted
Muhammed Awang Lah, vice president of service provider Mimos, as
saying.
	   The three suspects could be detained for up to 60 days without
trial and face a two-year prison term.
	   Kuala Lumpur has been rife with rumors, spread via the Internet
and then by word of mouth, that Indonesians have been amassing
knives and machetes.
	   On Friday evening, word spread that Indonesian illegal
immigrants in a downtown neighborhood had begun to riot in protest
against an Aug. 15 deadline to deport foreigners who had not
applied to renew their work permits.
	   The panic subsided when police opened a hotline to answer public
concerns and after national radio and television broadcast messages
from officials.

Chinese police detain seven dissidents seeking protest march
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seven dissidents who had planned a march to
protest the jailings of two other activists were detained late
Wednesday and early Thursday morning, a human rights group said.
	   Those detained were part of a group of 40 dissidents who had
requested permission to demonstrate in Changsha, in southern
China's Hunan province, Human Rights in China said.
	   They are demanding the release of Zhang Shanguang, a labor
rights advocate detained July 22, and of Wang Youcai, who was
arrested last month after trying to organize an opposition party.
	   Tan Li, Zhang Fan, and Li Jinhong were taken from the home of
another dissident, Zhou Peifu, by police officials who refused to
present identification or provide any explanations, the New
York-based group said.
	   Police detained dissidents Xie Changfa, Hu Diaoyi and his wife
later that evening. Also missing and believed detained was
dissident Liu Jian'an, the group said.
	   Hu and his wife were released later Wednesday night and Xie was
released Thursday morning, it said. The whereabouts of the
remaining five were unknown, the group said.
	   Even seeking police permission to demonstrate, as legally
required, carries the risk of arrest or of police harassment. The
dissidents had declared they would register an appeal, as allowed
by law, after the authorities rejected their protest request.
	   Police also searched the belongings of the people detained and
interrogated them, the human rights group said.

	   The five robbers shot the victims in the head or neck and then
took their belongings in the attack in the town of Sara in Iloilo
province Wednesday night, police Chief Superintendent Ricardo de
Leon said.
	   Six of the victims were forced out of their vehicles, lined up
on the side of the road and shot, a radio news report said, quoting
witnesses.
	   Police and U.S. Embassy officials identified the Peace Corps
volunteer as Robert Bock of New York. Police said Bock, who was on
the way to a meeting with a former town mayor, was shot in a van.
	   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement that it ``strongly condemns
this senseless act of violence.'' It said there was no indication
Bock or the United States was specifically targeted.
	   Bock, 33, was helping the provincial government in fisheries
management. He was assigned to Iloilo last year and was one of four
American Peace Corps volunteers working there, the U.S. Peace Corps
office in Manila said.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   De Leon said the robbers attacked at least four vehicles passing
on the road. The father of the group's leader tried to stop them
but was also fired on by the group, he said. The father was not
injured.
	   After the attack, the men went to a nearby village and opened
fire on a house without causing injuries, police said.
	   ``They went on a rampage apparently because of drugs,'' police
Chief Inspector Camilo Cascola said.
	   Police said the men belong to a kidnapping and robbery gang
operating in metropolitan Manila and some central provinces.
	   Iloilo is 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

North Korea again threatens to reactivate its nuclear program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea said Thursday it may be
forced to take the ``undesirable option'' of unfreezing its nuclear
program unless the United States lifts economic sanctions against
it.
	   It was the latest in a series of threats by the communist nation
to reactivate a nuclear program frozen under an agreement with the
United States in 1994 after it was suspected of being used to
develop atomic weapons.
	   An unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Pyongyang's decision hinged on a scheduled mid-August meeting in
New York between Charles Kartman, a U.S. ambassador-at-large, and
Vice North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Gye Kwan.
	   At issue, the spokesman told the North's official Korean Central
News Agency, is Washington's continued hostility and its failure to
promptly fulfill its part of the 1994 agreement.
	   ``We hope the two sides will settle the problems smoothly at the
upcoming ... talks lest we should take an undesirable option,'' the
spokesman was quoted as saying.
	   In return for shutting down a reactor capable of producing
weapons-grade plutonium, North Korea was promised two less
threatening nuclear reactors, an annual supply of 500,000 tons of
fuel oil and a gradual easing of U.S. economic sanctions.
	   ``In fact, all our nuclear activities have been frozen and the
safekeeping of spent fuel rods has reached a final stage ... but
the U.S. side has not taken substantial steps for lifting
sanctions,'' the spokesman said.

Cubs rout Giants 10-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Henry Rodriguez homered twice and drove in
five runs, and Steve Trachsel pitched seven strong innings, as the
Chicago Cubs defeated the skidding San Francisco Giants 10-2
Wednesday.
	   Sammy Sosa went homerless for the Cubs, going 1-for-3 with a
single, two walks and two runs scored. Sosa has 46 homers, one
behind Mark McGwire for the major league lead.
	   Rodriguez hit a two-run shot in the fourth and added a three-run
blast, his 30th of the season, into the upper deck in right field
in the seventh. It was the 11th multi-homer game of his career and
third this season.
	   Scott Servais hit a two-run homer, his sixth, and Jeff Blauser
added a solo shot, his third, as the Cubs scored five runs on three
homers in the fourth off Kirk Rueter (12-8).
	   Chicago added five more in the seventh on Rodriguez's second
homer, an RBI single by Lance Johnson and an error.
	   Trachsel (12-6), who has won six of his last seven decisions,
allowed two runs on seven hits. He has allowed two earned runs or
fewer in 12 of his 24 starts this season.
	   With the win, the Cubs temporarily moved into a tie with the New
York Mets in the race for the NL wild-card spot. The Mets were to
play Wednesday night at St. Louis. The Giants, who have lost seven
of nine, fell three games behind the Cubs.
 &UR; Astros 3, Brewers 0
	   In Houston, even the great Nolan Ryan had to see Randy Johnson
pitch in person.
	   A lively crowd of 40,217 _ including Ryan sitting behind home
plate in owner Drayton McLane's box _ saw Johnson pitch his second
straight shutout, striking out 13 as the Houston Astros beat the
Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Johnson (3-0) also singled for his first major league RBI in
leading the Astros to their sixth straight win.
	   Making his third start since Houston got him in a trade with
Seattle, Johnson gave up five hits in lowering his ERA to 0.72 for
the Astros.
	   Johnson's 13 strikeouts were the most by a Houston pitcher this
season. He also tied Sandy Koufax for second place on the career
list for 10-plus strikeout games with 97 _ Ryan leads with 215, and
he joined in a standing ovation for Johnson at the final out.
	   Brad Woodall (5-7) pitched five innings for the loss.
 &UR; Rockies 3, Expos 2
	   In Denver, Vinny Castilla hit his 36th homer, a three-run shot
that sent Pedro Astacio and the Colorado Rockies over the Montreal
Expos for a three-game sweep.
	   Castilla, who drove in four runs Tuesday night, homered for the
first time in 15 games and 54 at-bats. Colorado managed only six
hits, but claimed its third three-game sweep of the year.
	   Astacio (11-11) allowed two runs and seven hits in seven
innings. Jerry Dipoto got his 15th save in 18 chances.
	   Javier Vazquez (3-12), the fourth straight rookie to start for
Montreal, remained winless in six road decisions.
 &UR; Phillies 7, Diamondbacks 4
	   In Phoenix, Bob Abreu wrapped up a big series with two hits,
including a bases-loaded double, and Mark Parent drove in three
runs with his first homer in nearly two years as the Philadelphia
Phillies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Mike Grace (4-5) survived a shaky start in which he hit three of
the first 10 batters. Mark Leiter pitched the ninth for his 21st
save.
	   Abreu had his third consecutive 2-for-4 night. The Phillies
tagged Brian Anderson (8-11) for three runs in the fifth inning and
four in the sixth.
 &UR; Pirates 5, Reds 4
	   In Cincinnati, Jason Schmidt earned his first victory since June
1 and Jason Kendall homered and drove in three runs as the
Pittsburgh Pirates held off the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Pittsburgh withstood the Reds' four-run rally in the ninth
inning and won consecutive games at Cinergy Field for the first
time since 1996.
	   Schmidt (9-9) gave up six hits, and left with a 5-0 lead after a
single and walk to start the ninth.
	   Mike Williams gave up a two-run double to Bret Boone, and
Ricardo Rincon relieved. Reggie Sanders hit a two-run single before
Rincon retired Barry Larkin on a long fly for his 13th save in 13
chances.
	   Kendall and Freddy Garcia hit solo homers _ Kendall has one in
each of his last three games _ and Kendall doubled home two more
runs in a three-run seventh off Mike Remlinger (6-13) to get
Schmidt out of the rut.
	    &UR; Padres 5, Braves 1
	   In San Diego, Andy Ashby outdueled Greg Maddux to become the
NL's first 16-game winner and Ken Caminiti hit a two-run homer as
the Padres beat Atlanta for their second straight win in the series
between the NL's top two teams.
	   The Padres won their first home series against Atlanta in 10
years and pulled within one game of the Braves in the race for
home-field advantage should these teams meet in the NL championship
series. The three-game series concludes Thursday afternoon.
	   Playing before a crowd of 40,597, Ashby (16-6) got out of a jam
in the top of the sixth, then the Padres put Maddux (15-6) in
trouble in the bottom of the inning.
	   With two out, the bases loaded and the Padres leading 2-1, Wally
Joyner's sharp grounder skipped off the heel of first baseman
Andres Galarraga's glove and rolled into right field for a two-run
single.
	   Ashby allowed one run on five hits in seven innings, struck out
eight and walked four. Randy Myers pitched a perfect eighth and
Donne Wall retired all three Braves batters in the ninth.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Mets 4, 14 innings
	   In St. Louis, after blowing a three-run lead in the ninth, the
Cardinals recovered and beat the New York Mets on Ray Lankford's
RBI single in the 14th inning.
	   Lankford's one-out line drive up the middle off John Franco
(0-7) scored Brian Jordan, who appeared to cramp up after sliding
head first into home plate to easily beat the throw from center
fielder Brian McRae.
	   Lankford's third hit of the game came after left fielder Tony
Phillips dropped Lankford's fly in foul territory just before
running into the wall.
	   John Frascatore (2-3) pitched one perfect inning for the
victory.
	   New York trailed 4-1 with two outs in the ninth before Jorge
Fabregas and Mike Piazza hit consecutive homers to tie it.

Mahathir gets stronger even as economy slides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is
getting politically stronger even as the economy in his Southeast
Asian nation slides into recession.
	   After Mahathir's deputy publicly declared that he would not
challenge him, provincial leaders chimed in their commitments of
support, all but ensuring that the region's longest-serving ruler
will remain prime minister even after the next general election,
news reports said Thursday.
	   A nagging threat of a challenge from the deputy prime minister
was eliminated Tuesday when Anwar Ibrahim bowed out of a future
contest, saying Mahathir was like his father.
	   ``Mahathir is a seasoned leader. ... If I compare myself with
him, I'm just a student. I'm aware I can't go against teachers,
what's more against a father,'' Anwar said.
	   He pledged to work for Mahathir's victory in the 1999 party
election, saying that all 11 provincial districts of the United
Malays National Organization would back Mahathir's nomination as
president, a post he has held for 17 years. The UMNO leader is
traditionally the prime minister as well.
	   The statements could end months of talk about a rift in the
nation's top leadership, seen by some analysts as germs of
political instability.
	   General elections have never brought about leadership changes in
Malaysia because UMNO incumbents have always won. Leaders have
changed mostly because of internal party wrangling.
	   ``If talk is rife about an impending battle between the top two
leaders, it can become a source of political instability,'' Rahim
Mohamad Ghouse, an UMNO leader in Penang state was quoted as saying
in Thursday's Star daily.
	   An apparent rift between Mahathir and Anwar surfaced openly in
June during the UMNO annual convention. Many party leaders saw
Anwar's involvement in a campaign for political reform that was
spearheaded by a youth leader.
	   But Mahathir moved quickly, crushing the youth leader and
forcing him to reverse his earlier comments about cronyism and
nepotism among UMNO leaders. Since then, no party member has
publicly voiced concerns about the tangled links between top
politicians and businessmen.
	   ``Dr. Mahathir has proven that he is in control. Any attempt by
Anwar to push him out of office will only result in a reverse
situation,'' the Star quoted an unidentified UMNO leader as saying.
	   Despite denials by Anwar, talk of the rift had even triggered
rumors that he was about to resign as Malaysia's finance minister
and that his position had been diluted by Mahathir's inclusion of a
long-time confidant as a special Cabinet Minister in charge of
economic recovery.
	   In recent weeks, Mahathir and Daim Zainuddin, the economic
adviser, have won a political victory by loosening monetary policy
and easing credit curbs in place of the tight policy and high
interest rates Anwar had implemented.
	   With an early general election likely, UMNO can ill-afford to
remain divided. Mahathir is touring the nation now, exhorting UMNO
districts to remain united.
	   Observers say Mahathir may be forced to call a vote well ahead
of April 2000, when the Parliament term expires, so that he can
ensure his mandate before economic depression possibly turns to
political anger.
	   Malaysia is heading toward recession, widespread job losses and
rising food prices.
	   ``Since Anwar has made his stand clear, party members should
stop harping on the issue and concentrate on building the party and
nation, especially during the slowdown,'' provincial UMNO leader,
Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad, told the New Straits Times.

Hundreds leave Pakistani schools to join Afghan Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Not even out of his teens, Bacha Gull
is ready to die to help build a Taliban Islamic state in his
homeland of Afghanistan.
	   ``I am going back because I am needed there,'' Gull told
Associated Press Television Wednesday as he hitched a ride on a
busy street of Pakistan's northern city of Peshawar, barely 40
kilometers (25 miles) from the Afghan border. Like hundreds of
others students of the strict Islamic schools in and around
Peshawar, he was on his way to register at the Taliban's Peshawar
office to assist in the war effort.
	   The Taliban Islamic militia has scored victory after victory on
the battlefield in recent days and is pushing to seize the last
bits of Afghan territory from a loose coalition of opponents. The
Taliban promise to bring peace and unity to a country plagued for
decades by strife and civil war.
	   To help, the Islamic schools known as madarsahs have suspended
classes.
	   Afghan students must go, but Pakistani students can only go if
they have written permission from their parents to join the
conflict. Any young man who can grow a beard is considered old
enough to help.
	   ``They won't be sent to the front lines but will help in
maintaining peace in newly conquered areas and assigned
administrative tasks,'' said Maulvi Abdul Qadeer, head of the
Taliban's Peshawar office. He spoke in a telephone interview.
	   At least 200 students came to enroll in just two hours
Wednesday.
	   ``It is up to our leadership. On whichever front they send us
... we will be happy to serve anywhere,'' said Abdul Ghani.
	   In 1994, the Taliban movement sprang from schools like the one
Ghani attends in Pakistan. The Taliban, whose name means ``students
of Islam,'' preach an austere version of their religion, barring
most women from work and girls from school, banning music,
television, and movies, and demanding that men wear beards.
	   Most of the schools are run by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam of
Pakistan, a fundamentalist political party with a big following
among the people of the northern Pakistani province that includes
Peshawar. The students of Jamiat schools include a large number of
Afghans, many of them born in refugee camps in Pakistan.

Tibetan team to scale Lhotse Peak, world's fourth tallest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Tibetan team that hopes to scale the world's 14
highest mountains plans to tackle the fourth tallest, 8,516-meter
(28,103-foot) Lhotse Peak, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Lhotse, located on China's border with Nepal, would be the ninth
of the 14 peaks, the report said. The team was to leave the Tibetan
capital, Lhasa, on Friday, it said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A state of emergency has been imposed in part of
southern Siberia because of flooding caused by heavy rain, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   About 70 towns and villages in the Chita region have been
flooded and more than 8,000 people injured, the agency said, citing
Sergei Trukhin, acting head of the emergency commission in Chita.
	   Nearly 4,000 homes, 60 bridges and 500 kilometers (300 miles) of
road have been damaged, Trukhin said. No deaths have been reported.
	   Chita is about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow.

Yangtze flood surge passes, averting need to blow dikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY112, XIN102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Surging flood waters safely passed a crucial
stretch of the Yangtze River on Thursday, averting plans to blast
dikes and inundate farm areas to protect cities downstream.
	   State-run China Central Television said a flood crest hit Shashi
in central Hubei province at 44.8 meters (147 feet), just 20
centimeters (eight inches) short of the level that would have
required levees to be blasted and the homes and fields of up to
330,000 residents flooded.
	   The reportedly uneventful passage of the latest flood crest, the
fifth this summer, was only a slight reprieve for millions of
soldiers and volunteers struggling to save sodden dikes from the
pummeling of the worst floods in 44 years.
	   Yet another flood crest, triggered by heavy rains, was forming
up river in southwestern Sichuan province, CCTV reported.
	   Residents in areas due to be flooded have strongly protested
plans to divert water to protect the industrial center of Wuhan,
with a population of 7 million.
	   Authorities reportedly have reduced the size of the area that
could be deliberately flooded, but the number of people who might
be affected remains unclear.
	   President Jiang Zemin and a bevy of other top officials arrived
to inspect flood defenses around the crucial Jingjiang dike, near
Shashi, early Thursday, in an indication of the gravity of the
floods, which have killed more than 2,000 people and left millions
homeless in China.
	   So far, the government has only breached lesser levees. On
Sunday, a dike was dynamited at Jianli, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
downstream, flooding a 180-square-kilometer (70-square-mile) swath
of farmland and forcing the evacuation of some 50,000 people, many
of whom protested vehemently.
	   High waters also raged on the Songhua river in northeastern
Heilongjiang province, threatening Harbin city, the provincial
capital and major center of heavy industry and grain production.
About 2.5 million people are guarding the city's levee, but no
major breaches were reported, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Also in Heilongjiang, workers at Daqing, China's largest oil
field, were scrambling to repair levees after the Nen River
overflowed on Tuesday, the report said.
	   Officials estimate direct economic losses due to the flooding
could reach as high as U.S. dlrs 24 billion, shaving one half of a
percent off the economic growth rate for 1998.
	   Looting and other crimes plague flood regions. The Supreme Court
has ordered judicial officials to ``make examples'' of those caught
destroying public facilities, stealing or assaulting flood victims,
profiteering, neglecting official duties or embezzling relief funds
and supplies, Xinhua reported Thursday.
	   Previous directives warned police to guard against food riots or
fights over distribution of relief supplies, and deputized
civilians have been organized into safety patrols. State media have
reported several arrests for livestock stealing and burglary in
flooded areas and several Communist Party officials were punished
for dereliction of flood prevention duties.
	   Millions of flood victims have been stranded for weeks in
makeshift shelters in sweltering heat with scarce drinking water,
food or medicine. But diseases have mostly been limited to
dysentery and infections from polluted water, Red Cross officials
say.
	   The flooding has been blamed in part on a weather pattern
similar to that seen in 1954, when 30,000 people died in floods
along the Yangtze.

Chinese find files of Japanese World War II military plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Files documenting Japanese military strategies
and plans for drafting slave labor and setting up battlefield
brothels during World War II have been unearthed in Inner Mongolia,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The files, which were marked ``secret'' and ``top secret,'' had
been partially burned and hastily buried on the eve of Japan's Aug.
15, 1945, surrender, the report quoted an official of the Cultural
Relics Department as saying.
	   It said the files also recorded Japanese espionage activities in
the region in north central China. They were found two meters (6.6
feet) underground, at a construction site in the Inner Mongolian
city of Hohhot.
	   Atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army earlier this
century remain a sore point between the two countries. The Japanese
government has allowed few documents to be released and the newly
discovered ones could help clarify the army's role in forcing
Chinese, as well as other Asians, to serve as laborers and sex
slaves for soldiers.

Philippine stocks end mixed; index at new low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed
Thursday as some investors, mostly foreigners, cashed in on gains
made early in the session, while others hunted for bargains among
oversold issues, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index slipped 4.01
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,303.29, a fresh 5 1/2 year low.
Gainers, however, outnumbered decliners 41 to 37, while 47 issues
were unchanged.
	   The index fell 65.89 points, or 4.8 percent, on Wednesday.
	   With Thursday's decline, the index has fallen a total of 221.46
points over the past six sessions, bringing it close to its
previous low of 1,295 points in December 1992.
	   Trading on Thursday started on an upbeat note, with the main
index gaining as much as 31.19 points on overnight gains on Wall
Street and relatively stable currency markets. However, the rally
proved short-lived as investors, mostly foreigners, who bought
shares at bargain levels quickly cashed in on gains.
	   ``The early market rebound was expected after the losses in past
sessions, but it was artificial in nature since the volume of
trades when the rally took place was thin,'' said Astro del
Castillo, analyst for A and A Securities Inc.
	   With the overall economic picture in the Philippines and in the
region still bleak, investors were too edgy to hold on to Manila
shares for long, he said.
	   Traders said investors are concerned over conflicting signals
from the government, such as in the area of interest rates. The
Bureau of Treasury on Monday rejected all bids during its weekly
treasury bill auction to keep interest rates down. That same day,
the central bank raised its key overnight rates to shield the peso
from speculative attacks which swamped regional currencies early
this week.
	   Despite the higher overnight interest rates, the peso weakened
against the dollar in morning trading as the Japanese yen lost
ground.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.448 pesos, up from 43.393 pesos
on Wednesday.
	   The peso hit a seven-month low of 44.790 pesos per dollar on
Monday.

Pressure mounts for release of foreign activists in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pressure was building on Myanmar's
military regime Thursday to release 18 foreign pro-democracy
activists from custody for passing out anti-government leaflets.
	   Ten leading Thai democracy activists, lawyers and academics
requested visas to enter Myanmar and visit fellow activists, while
the brother of a detained Australian was to fly to the region with
the goal of securing the release of his sister.
	   Myanmar has said that the detainees, who belong to groups
opposed to the government, have not cooperated with investigations
into their leafleting attempt Sunday, thus prolonging their
detention.
	   No decision has been made on whether the activists will be
deported or charged and tried for crimes, the government has said.
	   The detainees _ six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Philippines citizens and an Australian
_ have been visited once by their diplomats in five days.
	   They are being held at police guest houses or at the Yangon
police headquarters and have told their diplomats they have been
well-treated and are receiving Chinese vegetarian food.
	   The U.S. Embassy has pressed for the prompt release of its
citizens. So has the Philippines. Thailand has said the
investigations must be allowed to finish but urged the government
to ensure the safety of Thai citizens.
	   Government television Wednesday showed U.S. diplomats meeting
with the six Americans a day earlier, plus the Indonesian
ambassador meeting the Indonesians.
	   The detainees looked cheerful during the meetings, though the
Americans were described by diplomats as worried about their fate.
They said they were being well-treated.
	   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who has a constituent,
Michele Keegan, 19, among the detained activists, plans to visit
Myanmar, but it was unclear whether he would be granted a visa.
	   The Thais were led by the human rights lawyer Thongbai Thongpao.
The mother of detainee Chanakarn Disthapichat, 22, was among their
delegation.
	   Thongbai said she wished to see with her own eyes that her
daughter was well treated and in good health. He hoped the visas
would be granted Friday.
	   The government accuses the activists of attempting to incite
unrest. The leafleting followed the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule that was eventually
crushed by troops, causing the deaths of an estimated 3,000 people.
	   The leaflets urged people to remember the anniversary and not
give up. It came two weeks before an Aug. 21 deadline set by the
country's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, for the government
to finally convene a parliament that was elected in 1990.
	   The military, which has ruled the country since 1962, refused to
honor the result and the parliament has never met.

Votes on government bills in Parliament back Shipley's government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
reaffirmed her hold on power Thursday as Parliament dealt with two
controversial bills, a day after a split in the ruling coalition
threw the government into crisis.
	   However, continued support for Shipley's National Party is not
guaranteed as a bitter dispute over the sale of Wellington's
airport continues.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters led an unprecedented
walkout from a Cabinet meeting Wednesday night by the four
ministers of minority coalition partner New Zealand First, leaving
Shipley clinging to power with a minority government.
	   Shipley's National party holds 44 votes in the national
Parliament of 120 members. It has a formal coalition agreement with
NZ First to add 16 votes, and informal support from minor party ACT
New Zealand, with eight votes, and two independent legislators.
	   Both Shipley and NZ First leader Winston Peters on Thursday
insisted that the government coalition was so far still intact.
	   Their statements were backed on the floor of Parliament, where
two government bills survived preliminary procedural votes with the
votes of all members except those of the 49-member Labor
Opposition.
	   ``The public can have confidence in the fact that the coalition
is still intact and ministers still have their warrants of
office,'' Shipley said.
	   Shipley has indicated she will not call snap elections to
resolve the dispute, saying she is prepared to continue to rule
over a minority government.
	   National's party managers believe that if NZ First withdraws its
16 votes from the coalition, it could woo back at least the seven
it needs to continue in office.
	   But Shipley said she will try to settle the dispute with NZ
First using special dispute resolving provisions of the coalition
agreement.
	   Under the agreement, the coalition is intact on the crucial
issues of monetary bills and votes of confidence for seven days if
a breakdown occurs.
	   NZ First opposes the government's plans to sell 66 percent of
Wellington's airport to a private sector buyer. Peters says
retaining control of strategic assets is fundamental to his party.
	   Labor opposition leader Helen Clark told Parliament the
coalition's popularity was falling ahead of elections due by
October next year, and both sides now want out.
	   ``New Zealand First faces electoral oblivion ... and has used
this issue as a reason for getting out of the coalition,'' Clark
said.
	   In a statement designed to calm financial markets, Finance
Minister Bill Birch said the country's economic and fiscal
framework would not be affected by the crisis.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has detained several
people in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and
U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects.
	   The detentions were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing,
which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   Police in Tanzania earlier this week said they arrested 14
people in the almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in
Dar es Salaam, which took 10 lives. A Somali-born Australian was
subsequently released, presidential spokesman Geoffrey Nkulu said
Thursday.

Malaysians worry dispute with Singapore could boil over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As heads of state and political
pundits take jabs at one another across the Malaysia-Singapore
border, the average man on the street here worries the
deteriorating relations could hurt him.
	   Some fear the neighbors could come to blows over long-standing
disputes that flared again when Singapore moved an immigration
checkpoint closer to its border with Malaysia.
	   Their concerns grew when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
recently warned Singapore: ``We do not have a big army to attack
anyone. We have tried to be good neighbors. But don't take us for
granted.''
	   Others wonder why two members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, a regional brotherhood originally founded to fight
communism, are at each other's throats instead of aiding each other
through tough economic times.
	   ``Being a member of ASEAN, I think Singapore should solve and
not exaggerate problems,'' said Sharifah Mohammad Khan, an
unemployed businesswoman.
	   Businessman Hussein Ahmed believes Malaysia would lose the
current tit-for-tat in the end because Singapore is stronger and
more advanced than Malaysia. Both countries _ former British
colonies and one-time national partners _ are behaving childishly,
he said.
	   ``Malaysia loves to point fingers and say Singapore is arrogant
_ but what about Malaysia?''
	   Malaysians are furious at Singapore's decision to move its
railway immigration checkpoint, saying Malaysia had a right to stay
put with its own checkpoint on land belonging to the Malaysian
railroad in Singapore.
	   Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said Singapore
discussed moving the checkpoint with Malaysian officials for nearly
a decade and that after agreeing to the move, Malaysians suddenly
changed their minds.
	   When Singapore moved its checkpoint to the Woodlands station on
Aug. 1, Malaysian immigration officials stayed where they were at
Tanjong Pagar. Passengers now must go through two checkpoints.
	   Nevertheless, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Saturday that the trains were running smoothly.
	   ``That speaks for itself,'' he said.
	   Singapore has tried to tread lightly because it gets roughly
half its water from Malaysia and hopes to renew water pacts with
its northern neighbor that will expire in 2011 and 2061.
	   During Mahathir's recent speech in Johor Bahru, on the Singapore
border, thousands of supporters chanted, ``Cut! Cut! Cut!''
referring to the water pipeline.
	   But Malaysia also depends on the city-state, which is Malaysia's
third-largest trade partner. More than 200,000 Malaysians cross
over to Singapore to work each day.
	   Other recent issues that have triggered high-level exchanges
include:
	   --Singapore media were accused of exaggerating problems at the
new Kuala Lumpur airport in an effort to keep business at
Singapore's international airport.
	   --A Singapore minister has threatened to go to the World Trade
Organization over Malaysian efforts to encourage domestic companies
to use Malaysian ports.
	   --Malaysian ministers argue that Singapore banks are tempting
Malaysians to use their banks by offering higher interest rates on
deposits of Malaysian ringgit.
	   Still, Singapore insists it wants to work with, not against, its
northern neighbor.
	   ``Anyone who says Singapore wants to undermine our neighbors
does not understand reality,'' Singapore Parliamentary Secretary
Chan Soo Sen said Wednesday.
	   ``We want our neighbors to do well so that we will also do
well,'' he said. ``However ... we must stand by our principles. We
cannot allow others to push us around.''
	   There has never been any love lost between the two.
	   Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia in 1963, an experiment
that ended in divorce two years later after bitter feuds between
Kuala Lumpur's Malay-led government and the predominantly ethnic
Chinese in Singapore.
	   Other issues that have driven the countries apart include
conflicting claims over the Pedro Branca island in the South China
Sea; suggestions in the 1980s that ethnic Malay citizens of
Singapore weren't loyal enough to pilot Singapore military jets;
and separate official visits to Singapore in 1986 by former Israeli
President Chaim Herzog and Pope John Paul II, which Malaysians felt
were insensitive to their predominantly Muslim culture.

Sony modifies video camera models because of `see through' use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sony Corp. said Thursday it has modified five
models of its popular Handycam video camera because they can be
used with a special filter to ``see through'' some kinds of
clothing.
	   The modifications were ordered after a popular men's magazine
carried an article showing the Handycam's infrared technology can
be used to see through light colored clothing or some bathing
suits, said Sony spokesman Hiroaki Komatsu.
	   ``We never imagined such a use would be possible,'' he said.
	   The Takarajima magazine reported in its Aug. 5 issue that a
filter costing only 1,000 yen (less than dlrs 7) can enable users
of the Handycam to see the underwear of lightly dressed people or
beneath swimsuits when the camera's ``night shot'' mode is
activated during daytime.
	   ``Our tests later showed that it is possible to see through
clothing with the use of a filter,'' Komatsu said. He said the
video camera's infrared technology was intended for taking pictures
of nocturnal animals or birds.
	   The company this week started selling modified Handycams to
prevent abuse of the infrared mode, Komatsu said. He refused to
explain how the cameras are being modified.
	   Sony has sold 1.08 million Handycams with the infrared mode
worldwide, including 180,000 in Japan, 400,000 in North America and
290,000 in Europe.

Hingis spoils Majoli's birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Top-seeded Martina Hingis
spoiled Iva Majoli's birthday Wednesday when she beat the l997
French Open champion 6-3, 6-3 in the second round of the Acura
Classic women's tennis tournament.
	   Majoli, who turned 21, made Hingis work for the victory, keeping
the world's No. 1 player on the Manhattan Country Club court for 71
minutes.
	   ``I didn't want to spoil her birthday, I just wanted to win the
match,'' Hingis said of her Croatian opponent. ``I was running more
than her. The match went real fast.''
	   Earlier, defending champion Monica Seles, ailing back and all,
breezed to a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Austria's Barbara Paulis in her
second-round match and third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario pulled
out a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 win against a tenacious Ai Sugiyama of Japan.
	   The Sanchez Vicario-Sugiyama match, which lasted 2 1/2 hours,
ended when Sugiyama, serving to get even at 5-all in the final set,
netted a backhand at match point. Sanchez Vicario won only two more
points than Sugiyama.
	   ``I had my chances in the first set and I guess I lost my
concentration,'' Sanchez Vicario said. ``There were some close
games, but I played well at the end and that's all that matters.''
	   Seles, seeded fourth, needed 49 minutes to eliminate Paulus in
the dlrs 450,000 tournament.
	   No. 5 seed Nathalie Tauziat of France defeated countrywoman and
doubles partner Alexandra Fusai 6-3, 6-3.
	   Temperatures on court during the Seles-Paulus match reached the
mid-90s, which apparently helped Seles. She lost only eight points
on her serve in the match.
	   ``My back is a lot better. The heat today helped,'' Seles said.
``I played solid tennis. With Barbara, it's hard to know what
she'll do because she hits heavy top spin from either side of the
court.''
	   Seles received treatment after the Toshiba Tennis Classic last
week where she lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Lindsay
Davenport.
	   In a first-round match, Elena Tartarkova of the Ukraine rallied
to beat Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Tartarkova
replaced Mary Pierce, who withdrew with a strained groin muscle
suffered last week.

Political turmoil hits Indian rupee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Turmoil within the ruling coalition
pushed the Indian rupee to a record low, prompting the central bank
to pump dlrs 100 million into the foreign currency market to try to
stem the slide.
	   The rupee hit an all time low of 43.35 to the dollar on
Wednesday before the bank's intervention steadied the market. The
rupee closed at 43, down from 42.92 at the opening of trading.
	   The depreciation followed massive dollar purchases by
corporations worried over threats by a powerful regional ally to
withdraw from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government.
Talks to end the crisis ended inconclusively late Wednesday.
	   The rupee has fallen steadily since India conducted underground
nuclear tests in May and incurred international sanctions. Credit
rating agencies lowered India's credit rating, affecting its
borrowing capacity and growth rate.
	   The Reserve Bank of India may not intervene much further to prop
up the rupee, the Economic Times newspaper reported Thursday. The
government is not averse to the rupee settling at a lower market
rate, especially due to the depreciating currencies of India's main
export rivals in Southeast Asia.

Drug-sniffing police dog gets a taste of the high life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A police dog on a drug-detection
exercise got too deep into her work and accidentally lapped up some
heroin that fell out of a container with a loose lid, a newspaper
said Thursday.
	   ``She tripped out. Her eyes rolled back in her head,'' the Daily
Telegraph quoted Police Senior Sgt. Russ Moore as saying in
Melbourne.
	   Roxy, a 3-year-old female rottweiler, was rushed to a
veterinarian to get a shot of narcan to counteract the heroin after
the incident happened Wednesday, the paper said.
	   Roxy had sniffed out a hidden batch of heroin and playfully
tossed the container up in the air, it said. The lid came off and
some of the drug sprinkled on her tongue.
	   She responded almost immediately to the antidote and recovered,
the paper said.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stock prices post modest rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday,
lifted by renewed concern about the Russian currency. Tokyo stock
prices closed slightly higher.
	   The dollar bought 146.99 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.07
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
rate of 146.44 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency's strength against the yen came after it
gained ground overnight against the German mark in New York trading
amid concern about a possible devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa
Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, said the currency market was ``very nervous
about Russia.''
	   In Russia, the stock market's main index lost 1.6 percent on
Wednesday, following a 9 percent plunge on Tuesday, and the Russian
ruble sank against the dollar.
	   Traders shrugged off hints from the Japanese Finance Ministry's
vice minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, that
Japan would intervene to prop up the yen, noting the slight
prospects for a rapid recovery in Japanese economic fundamentals.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced slightly as
improved sentiment stemming from gains on Wall Street Wednesday
offset persistent concern over the outlook for the Japanese
economy, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,552.96 points on
Wednesday, up 90.11.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose a
modest 3.05 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 15,382.02 _ the
first gain in nine trading days. On Wednesday, the average closed
down 28.02 points, or 0.18 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed up 1.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,181.71.
The TOPIX fell 6.88 points, or 0.58 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.195 percent compared with Wednesday's
finish of 1.185 percent. Its price fell to 111.79 yen, down from
111.87 yen the previous day.

Riots, looting in several towns ahead of Indonesian independence
</HEADLINE>
day &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with looting at shrimp pond on Sumatra Island &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots after
hundreds of people looted several Chinese-owned shops and burned a
discotheque and motorcycles in western Java Island, newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Hundreds of miles (kilometers) away, police on Sumatra Island
reportedly shot and wounded one man and arrested two others this
week as a mob looted a shrimp pond.
	   The unrest this week came as the government sought to quell
rumors that riots would break out in Jakarta on Aug. 17,
Indonesia's independence day. Thousands of soldiers are being
deployed in the capital.
	   Many people fear any demonstrations planned on that day will
degenerate into deadly riots like those in May that helped oust
President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Millions of Indonesians are enduring the worst economic hardship
in three decades, and riots over price increases have erupted in
cities and many small towns this year.
	   In Labuan, 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Jakarta, mobs
looted three shops Wednesday after a customer argued with a
storekeeper over the price of cigarettes, the newspaper Kompas
reported.
	   The shops were owned by ethnic Chinese, a minority which is
often targeted for its relative wealth and has been made the
scapegoat for Indonesia's economic ills.
	   The same day, a crowd in the nearby town of Serang burned a
hotel discotheque suspected of harboring prostitutes and ransacked
hotel rooms.
	   Rioters also burned three motorcycles and attacked a military
car, the newspaper Merdeka reported. Soldiers fired warning shots
to scare off the mob, but there were no arrests or reports of
injuries.
	   Last month, crowds attacked more than a dozen discotheques in
the resort town of Puncak near Jakarta, alleging they were dens of
prostitution and drug dealing.
	   Prostitution is forbidden in predominantly Muslim Indonesia, but
it is widely condoned in hotels and nightclubs.
	   In other violence, looters raided a shrimp pond Tuesday but were
thwarted by police in the Sumatran town of Deliserdang, 1,400
kilometers (875 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The price of shrimp, a popular item for export, has tripled
since Indonesia's economic crisis began last year.

Indonesia's former leader to lose presidential security guards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government is scaling back
security for former President Suharto, the target of near-daily
student protests before he quit in May.
	   Most of the 540 presidential guards who protect Suharto and his
family, including his six children, will be removed next week, an
official said Thursday.
	   Jakarta's military command will take over security for the
Suharto clan on Aug. 17, Indonesia's independence day, said E.
Sutarto, head of presidential security.
	   ``The situation does not any longer need a special force like in
the past to guard the president,'' Sutarto said.
	   Suharto, an autocrat who led Indonesia for 32 years, was forced
out of office by economic and political upheaval.
	   About 1,200 people died in riots in Jakarta a week before he
stepped down. Returning from an overseas trip at the time, Suharto
was escorted to his home by dozens of military vehicles, including
armored cars.
	   The 77-year-old former army general has made few public
appearances since his resignation. Many Indonesians accuse him of
corruption that contributed to the nation's economic crisis.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, took the decision
to strip his old mentor of presidential security. The local
military is likely to provide fewer guards.

	   FBI special agent Sheila Horan told a news conference that the
FBI may have identified parts of the vehicle containing the bomb.
	   ``We are literally sifting through tremendous piles of debris,''
she said, adding that the FBI has had some success ``in identifying
parts of the delivery vehicle.''
	   She said the work was painstaking.
	   ``I can't emphasize enough, we are sifting and we have had some
success,'' Horan said.

Cambodian king prepared to host talks between rival parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hun Sen interview in grafs 7-9, edits to conform;
changes FUNCINPEC to upper case thruout for style &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday
he is prepared to host talks between rival political parties aimed
at ending a post-election stalemate and forming a working
government, but only if he is formally asked.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a
slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly in the July 26
election, but not the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ immediately
spurned offers by Hun Sen to form a coalition government, alleging
rampant fraud in voting and ballot-counting.
	   The two opposition parties have threatened to boycott parliament
unless their complaints are properly investigated. So far, all of
their concerns have been called ``baseless'' by the National
Election Committee, comprised mainly of Hun Sen's appointees.
	   The king, who offered to have the negotiations at his residence
in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, stressed Thursday that
he is not seeking an audience with the rival parties. But he said
he is willing to act as a conciliator if asked.
	   ``I have made clear that I have stayed and will stay in Siem
Reap at the disposal of the Cambodian People's Party, of FUNCINPEC
and of the (Sam Rainsy Party) if at least two of the three large
parties would like to have an informal meeting,'' he wrote.
	   In an interview with the U.S. government radio station Voice of
America late Wednesday, Hun Sen urged the three main political
parties to join in asking the king for an audience.
	   ``All the three parties ought to request an audience with the
king at the same time, so he can offer us good advice,'' Hun Sen
said. ``I think that will be a good opportunity.''
	   He added that he and CPP president Chea Sim already had plans to
seek an audience with the king after official election results are
announced in late August.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy also expressed interest in the idea in
a joint statement.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense
dual premiership formed after the U.N-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid
lost after his takeover.

NAIROBI: Horan said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Horan refused to comment when asked whether the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kampala, Uganda had received a warning of an attack two
weeks before nearly simultaneous bombings of the U.S. Embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania which a total of 257 people
dead and over 5,000 injured.
	   Joint FBI and Kenyan teams are interviewing thousands of people
in the area where the bomb went off.
	   Horan said it was ``a massive'' number of interviews, but a
necesssary step in the investigation. ``A small detail could be
very valuable,'' she said.
	   In an opening statement, Horan said that Kenya had pledged and
delivered full cooperation and was sharing its resources with the
FBI.
	   On behalf of the FBI, she offered ``the deepest sympathy and
compassion'' to Kenyans and members of the diplomatic community who
had suffered losses as a result of the bombing.

Official: No plans to internationalize Singapore dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Stressing that the government has no plans to
make the Singapore dollar freely available on the global market,
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Thursday the country
would ease some restrictions for overseas use of the currency, even
by foreigners.
	   ``As a small and open economy, we cannot afford to have our
currency subject to manipulation or speculation,'' said Lee, who is
also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country's
de facto central bank.
	   He said there was no plan in the foreseeable future to make the
Singapore dollar an international currency.
	   The most important change announced by Lee is that foreign
companies will be able to issue Singapore dollar-denominated stocks
and bonds more easily.
	   Also, companies that are partly owned by foreigners now can
borrow more Singapore dollars for overseas projects, if they
convert the loan to a foreign currency and if the project is
approved by Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry or the
Economic Development Board.
	   At the same time, MAS will retain tight control over the use of
Singapore dollars through a number of measures.
	   The new policy has retained a 5 million Singapore dollar (dlrs
2.9 million) credit limit for non-residents wanting to invest in
Singapore shares, bonds, deposits and commercial properties without
MAS approval.
	   It also prohibits loans to non-residents for speculating in the
Singapore dollar and interest rate markets, financing trade not
involving Singapore, and buying shares not listed on the Stock
Exchange of Singapore or financing any activities outside Singapore
without MAS approval.

Malaysia upset over U.S. statement on threat to embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia expressed concern
Thursday that Washington's assessment of threats to U.S. interests
in the Southeast Asian nation could scare away foreign investors.
	   The U.S. statement could be misinterpreted by foreign investors,
tourists, and overseas sports enthusiasts planning to travel to the
Commonwealth Games next month, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was
quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Operations at the U.S. Embassy came to a halt Monday after the
State Department ordered missions in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen
closed for fear of terrorist attacks. ``This could include attacks
on buildings,'' the department said in a statement.
	   Car-bomb explosions at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
Friday killed at least 250 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad also protested the
U.S. view that its embassy in Kuala Lumpur could be attacked by
terrorists.
	   ``As far as we can see, there has been no sign of any terrorist
activity in Malaysia,'' the prime minister said, adding that U.S.
interests would nonetheless receive full protection from the
government if they felt endangered.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, was due in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed by a day a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   The state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's allegation that
Butler was working on behalf of the United States to prolong the
sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's ruling Baath party,
said in a front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts
to raising doubts and accusations that are not based on any
facts.''
	   It added: ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the
committee will come up with others, and it will turn into a game
with no end.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   But the New York Times on Thursday said that the long-term
monitoring program also was being impeded because Iraq is not
allowing U.N. inspectors to act on any violations their equipment
detect. And, the Times said, Iraq has suspended its participation
in technical talks aimed at uncovering the full history of Iraq's
weapons development.

	   ``We will pursue this investigation to its conclusion,'' Horan
said, repeating the pledge a second time for emphasis.
	   She was asked if she knew the kind of explosive used or who was
to blame.
	   ``If I did, we wouldn't be here today,'' Horan replied.
	   More than 20 joint Kenyan-U.S. investigating teams have only
deployed in the past few days and ``we have conducted limited
amounts of investigations until this date,'' she said.
	   Investigators are collecting information on explosives and
possible bombers, she said.
	   Horan was asked if there was any evidence linking the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam bombs.
	   She replied that because both occurred ``at just about the same
time there is a temptation to link the two bombings. I'm not
prepared at this time to give any further information on that.''
	   The investigating teams in Kenya and Tanzania are sharing
information, she said.

Former Chinese leader appeals 16-year corruption sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The most senior Chinese leader caught in a
campaign against rampant graft has appealed a 16-year prison
sentence handed down for his part in China's largest corruption
scandal, a court spokeswoman said Thursday.
	   Chen Xitong, the former mayor and Communist Party boss of
Beijing, appealed to China's Supreme People's Court, said the
spokeswoman for the Higher People's Court in Beijing, which
sentenced Chen on July 31.
	   Chen's sentence for corruption and dereliction of duty
underscored the ruling Communist Party's fears that simmering
public anger over official graft is menacing its monopoly on power.
Hundreds of thousands of officials have been punished in a
5-year-old anti-corruption campaign that has seen many, including
Chen's own son, jailed or even executed.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen was one of 20 members of the party's
elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. He was the
highest party official to face criminal prosecution since the
notorious Gang of Four were tried for political crimes following
the calamitous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
	   Chen, 68, was brought down in a massive graft scandal that may
have cost Beijing as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2
billion).

Tunnel fire knocks out utilities for thousands of Moscow residents

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire broke out in an underground tunnel in
southern Moscow, cutting off power, water, and phone services for
an entire section of the city, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   The fire started Wednesday night in the Chernatovo district in a
tunnel filled with utility pipes and wiring, the Interfax news
agency said, citing officials from Moscow's City Hall. Firefighters
blamed a short circuit.
	   Firefighters fought the blaze throughout the night and rescue
workers freed over 30 people who were stuck in elevators because of
the power outage.
	   No injuries were reported in the blaze.
	   The fire left 23 apartments buildings without water and 49
without power, and cut phone service from thousands of residents,
Interfax reported.
	   By Thursday morning the fire was put out and city workers had
restored most utilities to the area, though some residents remained
without water or power later in the day.

Flood of refugees brings hunger and death to Sudanese town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY108 &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WAU, Sudan (AP) _ At the cemetery, the deaths are dutifully
recorded in a cardboard-covered ledger, one page per day: on
Tuesday, 115. Wednesday, 57. Thursday, 53. Friday, 74. Saturday,
77. Sunday, 60. Monday, 44.
	   Death shouldn't happen with such frequency in a town the size of
Wau _ about 100,000 inhabitants. But the population has swollen by
70,000 with refugees from famine who have come to sit, beg for
relief and, too often, die.
	   Most of the refugees are women and children, and they are
desperate. A hungry woman snatches a handful of porridge from a
child. A photographer takes a picture of a tiny boy who is little
more than bones and graying skin _ then hears a small gasp that is
the child's last breath.
	   Two women truss up a dead friend in a blanket, sling the blanket
over a pole and carry her body unceremoniously to the burial
ground.
	   Aid workers and officials described the suffering in Wau to
diplomats and reporters on a government-organized visit earlier
this month. The diplomats were from Europe and Japan, among the
biggest donors to the relief effort in Sudan.
	   ``What we have noticed is that whenever rain comes, the second
day deaths increase drastically,'' said aid worker Mustafa Ajong,
explaining that the weak are hit hardest by damp and chill.
	   International aid agencies have estimated 1.5 million people
face starvation across southern Sudan, about half in Bahr al-Ghazal
state where Wau sits on a plain of grass and bush, 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles) south of the capital, Khartoum.
	   Famine is nothing new in Sudan's civil war. For 15 years, rebels
have fought for more autonomy for the South _ whose people are
largely African, Christian and animist _ from a north ruled by
Muslims and Arabs. Fighters have often looted or burned stores of
food and farmers' fields and cattle.
	   In fact, no one is sure how many of the 1.5 million deaths so
far came from fighting and how many from starvation.
	   Most of the hungry now are in rebel areas. But Wau is in
government hands, and the governor of the state, Charles Golo, told
the diplomats that the influx of sick and hungry was well beyond
Bahr al-Ghazal's meager means.
	   ``Look, we only have one lorry to carry food from the airport
and air-drop areas and also to carry the dead to the burial
ground,'' he said. ``We are really hard up. ... We cannot handle
this problem on our own.''
	   Golo said aid workers from a half-dozen U.N. and private relief
agencies were dealing with food, but that problems were developing
with drinking water, sanitation and shelter.
	   The hungry who have trekked to Wau from outlying villages are
jammed in everywhere. Some have climbed into trees for shelter.
Others sit or lie in the streets, in outdoor markets, in any public
space.
	   Golo said his biggest fear was disease spreading from the lack
of sanitation facilities. There are few latrines, and many of the
tribal people crowding into Wau won't use them.
	   ``In such a situation ... with people doing everything in the
open, we fear the outbreak of epidemics anytime,'' Golo said.
	   Many of the displaced villagers arrive too weak to feed
themselves.
	   ``Some of these people told me they ate no proper food for three
days. They were eating grass and roots,'' said Dr. Michael Millet
Hossin of the Bahr al-Ghazal Health Ministry.
	   The U.N. World Food Program lists 21,300 children under age 5
among the estimated 72,000 displaced in Wau. The WFP is feeding
about 2,500 children.
	   In a bare ward of Wau's hospital, the Dutch branch of Doctors
Without Borders also is feeding about 500 of the most threatened
youngsters. Bony-faced babies with swollen bellies lie on plastic
sheets spread on the floor. Aid workers run from one child to
another trying to quiet their cries.
	   Many of the refugees are from the Dinka tribe, which runs the
main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. But some
Dinka refugees complained their food was stolen by SPLA fighters
earlier this year.
	   ``Our homes have been looted. ... (The SPLA) took away
everything,'' said Dinka tribal chieftain Madet Anjong.
	   There is plenty of blame to go around for southern Sudan's sad
state.
	   From their base in neighboring Kenya, aid workers accuse Sudan's
government of blocking relief flights or backing looting parties in
rebel areas in an effort to undercut the SPLA's base of support.
	   Bishop Rudolf Deng Majak of the Roman Catholic Church diocese in
Wau used an African proverb to describe the plight of civilians in
the fighting, calling them crushed grass beneath the hooves of
battling elephants.

Suu Kyi's van moved to bridge; party says government responsible

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party expressed fears for her safety after her van was moved to a
small wooden bridge Thursday, the second day of her latest roadside
standoff against the military government.
	   The party urged the government to allow Suu Kyi, stopped
Wednesday at a checkpoint 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital, to proceed to the western city of Bassein to meet
supporters.
	   ``It is the responsibility of the government if the bridge
breaks under the heavy weight of the van,'' the National League for
Democracy said in a statement. ``The prevention ... amounts to
restricting the organizational activities of the party.''
	   The van was presumably moved to clear traffic, which was backed
up for kilometers (miles) Wednesday. The bridge, built for
ox-carts, held Suu Kyi's smaller car during her six-day standoff at
the same checkpoint two weeks ago.
	   A government spokesman said in a faxed statement to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, that Suu Kyi had not spoken
to anyone and that all the windows were rolled up.
	   ``A medical team is on standby should she need one and an
appropriate number of security personnel has been provided in case
she and her companions choose to stay by the roadside,'' it said.
	   The government said it would be ``unsafe'' to let her travel
farther.
	   Suu Kyi, however, appeared ready for a long confrontation, to
raise pressure ahead of the Aug. 21 deadline she has set for a
parliament elected in 1990 to be convened.
	   Her National League for Democracy overwhelmingly won the
election, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as
Burma, since 1962, never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is severely
restricted in her movements and political activities. Recently, she
has been staging confrontations with the government by trying to
meet supporters outside the capital.
	   The last standoff drew international condemnation of the
government. International pressure is one of the few tools at Suu
Kyi's disposal to try to force change.
	   The government spokesman reported that there were no
disturbances anywhere in the country.
	   In Bangkok, about 40 exiled students from Myanmar, staging a now
week-old protest, denounced Myanmar's government.
	   ``The military cannot prevent her from seeing her friends and
followers,'' said Gaw Minth, a protest spokesman. ``It is the
second time now, and we condemn it.''
	   Official newspapers criticized Suu Kyi, daughter of independence
hero Aung San, as a tool of powerful countries.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi has been given many awards by superpowers for
her anti-government activities,'' a commentary said. ``She has to
prove herself worthy of those awards by opposing the state.''
	   The authorities ended last month's showdown by seizing Suu Kyi's
car and driving her back to her home in Yangon. She recovered from
fever and dehydration but vowed to press the government to open a
dialogue with her.
	   The van can carry more food and water than the sedan used last
time. Again traveling with her is Hla Pe, 75, a member of the NLD's
central executive committee, and two drivers.
	   Meanwhile, pressure mounted for the release of 18 foreign
activists detained Sunday for passing out leaflets the government
said were intended to incite unrest on the 10th anniversary of a
failed uprising against military rule.
	   Sympathizers and family members were attempting to travel to
Myanmar to visit the detainees, who include six Americans, three
Indonesians, three Malaysians, three Thais, two Filipinos and an
Australian.
	   Among those seeking entry was U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, a New
Jersey Republican, who has a constituent among the detainees.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As the threat of war, imprisonment and worse
grew around his family, Joseph Sapir and many other Jews sent their
money to a Swiss bank for safekeeping, expecting to retrieve it
later.
	   ``Later'' was much further away than they could have imagined.
For years, Swiss bank officials claimed they could not find
accounts or demanded death certificates for account holders who
died in the Holocaust.
	   More than 50 years after the end of World War II, Swiss banks
agreed Wednesday to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors to
settle their claims for their assets.
	   ``This is not charity from the Swiss,'' said Sapir's daughter,
Estelle Sapir. ``My father deposited money there. It is my money.''
	   Miss Sapir, whose father died in the Maidanek concentration camp
in 1943, in May reached an individual settlement with Credit
Suisse. That ended her participation in a class action lawsuit
representing tens of thousands of Holocaust victims who deposited
money in Swiss banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe.
	   Still, she came to the Brooklyn federal courthouse on Wednesday
to celebrate the agreement, which calls for the money to be paid
out over three years.
	   In return, the plaintiffs will release all claims against two
commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ plus the Swiss
National Bank, other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss
industry, said Marc Cohen, a lawyer for the banks.
	   ``The banks look forward to continuing their cooperation with
the Volcker Committee's effort to identify dormant accounts,'' bank
officials said in a statement, referring to former U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's panel, which searches for assets of
Jews killed by the Nazis.
	   Survivor Gizella Weisshaus originally sued the banks on Oct. 2,
1996. Litigation grew into class-action suits representing 31,500
plaintiffs worldwide after Swiss bank employee Christoph Meili in
January 1997 rescued Holocaust-era documents from a shredder room
at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich.
	   Meili said he was inspired to come forward after seeing the film
``Schindler's List,'' which detailed a German industrialist's
rescue of Jews.
	   On June 19, Jewish leaders rejected an offer by the Swiss banks
to pay dlrs 600 million to settle the claims. Jewish leaders
claimed at the time that was far less than the dlrs 1 billion-plus
the banks should be paying.
	   A number of U.S. cities and states had threatened to impose
sanctions on UBS AG and the Credit Suisse group if they did not
agree to an acceptable settlement.
	   The first payment of dlrs 250 million will be made 90 days after
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman grants his approval. Korman
did not indicate when that would be. The next payments, of dlrs 333
million, will be paid on the first, second and third anniversary of
Korman's approval.
	   The judge and the plaintiffs' lawyers will develop a
distribution plan to determine how the money will reach the
plaintiffs and others.
	   ``The settlement finally puts to rest some of the sad and ugly
past of the Swiss,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith. ``The immediate funds
will go to those in need; most are in Eastern Europe.''
	   Ed Fagan, who brought the original lawsuit on behalf of
Weisshaus, said the process of parceling out the money will be
complicated.
	   Although more than 31,000 survivors have been identified as
plaintiffs in the lawsuit, more could come forward to seek
restitution, making it impossible to predict how much each
beneficiary will get.
	   ``This money does not belong to the Jewish people. It belongs to
Holocaust survivors and their descendants,'' Fagan said. ``This is
not over.''

Thai army to cooperate in probe of ammunition haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai military will cooperate with a
police investigation of an army officer arrested for possessing
more than half a million rounds of small-arms ammunition, a
television news report said Thursday.
	   Police found at least 600,000 rounds of ammunition worth more
than 12 million baht (dlrs 290,000), as well as an M-16 assault
rifle and an air gun, in a raid Wednesday on a Bangkok house owned
by Lt. Col. Thatchapong Thanapatarathaweewong, an officer attached
to the army's Special Warfare Center.
	   It was the second discovery of a large arms cache in the capital
in two weeks.
	   Thatchapong told police he had been legally importing ammunition
for the Thai army for nearly 10 years. He said the seized
ammunition was legally brought in from the Czech Republic and was
to be delivered to an army base near Bangkok.
	   Police, however, said he failed to show proper documents, and
the army disputed the suspect's claims, saying it was not connected
with his business, Thai TV Channel 7 said.
	   Army Secretary-General Lt. Gen. Pongthep Theppratheep was quoted
as saying the seized ammunition was neither from the army nor
ordered for the army.
	   He said the army was ready to cooperate with police to
investigate the case, and would not try to protect the officer if
he was found guilty.
	   On July 29, police found two rocket-propelled grenade launchers
with four rockets, seven M-72 grenades, about 50,000 rounds of
small-arms ammunition and 1,026 rounds of 12.7 mm anti-aircraft
ammunition at another house in Bangkok.
	   Police suspected at least some of the arms had come from Thai
army stores.
	   The owner of the house, a former army sergeant who had been
court-martialed in 1994 for illegally selling weapons, claimed he
had rented it to ethnic Karen guerrillas who are fighting the
military government of neighboring Myanmar.

Markets mixed, but long-term gloom dominates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to update with closing Nikkei, Hang Seng
volatile, yen down sharply; UPDATES grafs 10-11 with sharp falls in
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock prices were mixed Thursday after a
rebound on Wall Street, but the prevailing mood remained decidedly
sour because of weakness in Japan and a large collection of local
troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index scratched out a tiny gain, finishing 3.05
points higher at 15,382.02, after eight straight days of losses.
The threat of Central Bank intervention initially kept the dollar
in check, but the fears receded and the dollar advanced strongly in
late trading to break through 147 yen.
	   Japan's weakness left the entire region gloomy. Even where stock
prices and currencies rebounded Thursday, there was no confidence
that things were turning for the better.
	   Hong Kong's volatile Hang Seng index, already at a five-year
low, fell 275 points to 6,585.24 by midday but rebounded almost 100
points near closing time. The Hang Seng already is down 16 percent
this month.
	   As it has for the last week, the Hong Kong index closely
followed the fortunes of banking giant HSBC Holdings, whose stock
was declining again Thursday. HSBC, which accounts for about 30
percent of the index, had plunged about 4.5 percent by midmorning
Thursday.
	   HSBC was one of several major Hong Kong corporations that
reported poor first-half earnings last week, sending the market
steeply lower.
	   Analysts, echoing comments Wednesday by Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, blamed the fall in the Hong Kong market on the
weakness of the yen. Japan's economic troubles are causing
investors to worry that Hong Kong will be unable to keep its direct
link to the U.S. dollar, and that China will be forced to devalue
its yuan currency.
	   Both Chinese and Hong Kong officials insist that won't happen.
	   Japan's weakness unsettled markets throughout the region, which
also face new worries about the U.S. economy. Asian economies that
long have focused on exports need a strong U.S. market to help them
out of their troubles. But volatility on Wall Street in the past
week has raised questions whether a long period of strong growth is
coming to a close.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index, which is at a
10-year low, dropped 2.9 percent to 966.98. One trader predicted it
would reach 900 by the end of the month unless the Japanese
government intervened in markets to support the yen.
	   Malaysia's market was down 5.3 percent. Analysts cited local
economic weakness and uncertainty over whether Japan will turn
around economically anytime soon.
	   In Taiwan and the Philippines, markets were up, but even in
those markets there was little to break the gloom.
	   The Manila index had lost 14 percent of its value in the five
previous sessions, and traders regarded Thursday's advance as
largely a technical rebound. In Taipei, traders said the rebound
would be limited by Japan's weakness and worries about first-half
earnings reports that are due out by the end of August.

 &UR; Kenya says about five people have been arrested
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series and UPDATES with name of chief Kenyan
investigator, new quotes, edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. and Kenyan investigators said
Thursday they are interrogating ``about five people'' in connection
with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and are making some
progress in identifying the bomb vehicle.
	   At their first news conference since last Friday's embassy
bombing, top investigators from both countries pledged to cooperate
until the bombers are tracked down.
	   ``We will pursue this investigation to its conclusion,'' FBI
Special Agent Sheila Horan said, repeating the pledge a second time
for emphasis.
	   Kenya's deputy police commissioner Peter Mbuvi, of the Criminal
Investigation Department, said Kenyan-American teams were
questioning a number of people in Nairobi whose detentions were
announced Wednesday night.
	   ``There are about five of them. We are talking to them, we are
questioning them, we are interrogating them,'' he said. ``We have
detained them for questioning ... because of suspicious
activities.''
	   The suspects have been taken into custody ``gradually since
Friday,'' Mbuvi said, adding that one suspect ``was pointed out by
an American to the police and is still with us.''
	   ``We have not yet decided whether we should charge them or not
because the investigations are still at the initial stage,'' he
said.
	   A U.S. law enforcement source in Washington said two of those
detained in Kenya were considered suspects. They were from a
country other than Kenya, but their nationalities could not be
determined immediately, the source said.
	   Mbuvi and Horan refused to comment on the nationalities of those
detained.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the bombings, including one from a previously unknown Islamic
group.
	   Horan was asked if intelligence agencies had recently received
any particularly credible threats against U.S. targets.
	   ``I would very much like to answer the question, but I am not
going to. I cannot at this time respond to that. I'm sorry,'' she
replied.
	   More than 20 joint investigating teams have embarked on the
painstaking process of sifting debris and interviewing ``a
massive'' number of people in connection with the bombing, Horan
said.
	   ``We are literally sifting through tremendous piles of debris,''
she said, adding that the FBI has had some success ``in identifying
parts of the delivery vehicle.''
	   Horan said the investigators had to be meticulous in the search
for clues.
	   ``A small detail could be very valuable,'' she said. ``I can't
emphasize enough, we are sifting and we have had some success.''
	   Horan refused to comment when asked whether the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kampala, Uganda had received a warning of an attack two
weeks before nearly simultaneous bombings of the U.S. Embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania which a total of 257 people
dead and over 5,000 injured.
	   In an opening statement, Horan said that Kenya had pledged and
delivered full cooperation and was sharing its resources with the
FBI.
	   On behalf of the FBI, she offered ``the deepest sympathy and
compassion'' to Kenyans and members of the diplomatic community who
had suffered losses as a result of the bombing. While 12 Americans
were killed, the other 235 victims in the Nairobi bombing were
almost exclusively Kenyans.
	   Horan was asked if she knew the kind of explosive used or who
was to blame.
	   ``If I did, we wouldn't be here today,'' Horan replied.
	   The investigating teams have only deployed in the past few days
and ``we have conducted limited amounts of investigations until
this date,'' she said.
	   Investigators are collecting information on explosives and
possible bombers, she said.
	   Horan was asked if there was any evidence linking the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam bombs.
	   She replied that because both occurred ``at just about the same
time there is a temptation to link the two bombings. I'm not
prepared at this time to give any further information on that.''
	   The investigating teams in Kenya and Tanzania are sharing
information, she said.
	   Police in Tanzania earlier this week said they arrested 14
people in the Dar es Salaam bombing, which took 10 lives. A
Somali-born Australian was subsequently released, presidential
spokesman Geoffrey Nkulu said Thursday.
	   Some of the suspects in Dar es Salaam ``may have had a hand'' in
the attack, said Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim
Nyang'anyi.
	   Calling the security inadequate, Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
had several times requested a new embassy in Nairobi, Assistant
Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   Kennedy said State Department officials shared her concern but
that ``unfortunately we lacked the money to respond.''
	   At midday Wednesday, a bulldozer removed what could be a vital
piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by
the force of the blast and which may have carried the explosives.
	   Along with other mangled vehicles, the blackened, shredded
wreckage was hauled across the street to a parking lot the U.S. FBI
has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   According to Kenya Television Network, a black pipe was found at
the site, and a source suggested it could have detonated the car
bomb.
	   U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents and other investigators are in
Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   At an emotional ceremony Wednesday evening before a symbolic
small pyramid of concrete rubble, the rescue officially ended.
Those who spent five days trying to save lives honored the dead.
	   Several wreaths were laid against the concrete pyramid, on which
Bushnell scattered roses. And after the ceremony, Bushnell, her lip
stitched and hand bandaged from bomb injuries, walked to the barbed
wire coil surrounding the embassy holding a single rose. She wept,
her shoulders shuddering.

Two more ethnic party members killed as violence escalates in
</HEADLINE>
Karachi &QL; 
 &UR; BY ZAHID HUSSAIN
 &UR; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot dead two
members of an ethnic political party in Karachi on Thursday,
raising the death toll to 14 in the port city's latest surge of
factional violence, police said.
	   Police said gunmen pulled two members of a breakaway faction of
the Mohajir Quami Movement from a public bus in eastern Karachi and
killed them, then fled. No further details were immediately
available.
	   Police said the latest killings could have been in retaliation
for Wednesday's killing in central Karachi of nine supporters of
the mainstream Mohajir Quami Movement. Three more people were
killed in other shootings Wednesday.
	   Both the MQM _ which is a partner in Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's coalition government _ and the breakaway faction speak for
the rights of the Urdu-speaking people who migrated from India in
1947 after India and Pakistan gained independence from colonial
Britain.
	   The MQM blamed the breakaway faction for Wednesday's killings.
The faction denied the accusation and in turn charged the
mainstream movement in Thursday's shootings.
	   Paramilitary rangers with heavy machine guns mounted on their
vehicles patrolled the troubled areas in an effort to stifle the
ethnic, political and sectarian violence that has killed more than
500 people in Karachi so far this year. About 400 people were
killed in all of 1997.

Hotel offers Diana's last ride....in a black Mercedes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Paris hotel is offering to take tourists for a
ride _ the last route Princess Diana took from her hotel to the
crash site and ending at the hospital where she was pronounced
dead.
	   To make it a bit more real, the Hotel Odeon on the Left Bank is
even offering special tours in a black Mercedes, the same make of
car Diana crashed in nearly one year ago. The tours in a van start
this weekend, free of charge to Odeon guests and 150 francs (dlrs
25) for anyone else.
	   The tour goes first to the Hotel Ritz in the swanky Place
Vendome on the Right Bank, where Diana got in the black Mercedes
with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, driver Henri Paul and bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones on Aug. 31.
	   It then takes the route along the Seine River where Paul drove
at high speed to try to evade press photographers and stops at the
Place de l'Alma where admirers still leave bouquets.
	   Underneath is the Pont de l'Alma tunnel where the Mercedes
crashed into a pillar. The visit ends outside the Pitie-Salpetriere
Hospital on the Left Bank, where Diana was pronounced dead. Fayed
and Paul also were killed.
	   ``We get as many questions as to how to find the Eiffel Tower
and Arc de Triomphe as the Ritz Hotel and the Place de l'Alma,''
hotel manager Emile Cacciari told Europe 1.
	   Cacciari said all the money made from the tours would be given
to the Diana Foundation. There was no immediate comment from
Foundation officials.
	   Meanwhile, the crash remains under investigation. Police say
among possible contributing factors were Paul's state of
drunkenness and the high speed of the Mercedes.
	   The daily Le Parisien said it hoped that all the tour's drivers
``would be sober.''

Amid concern over ruble, Russian Central Bank imposes new
</HEADLINE>
restrictions &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As concern grew over the stability of the Russian
ruble, the Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency
trading by commercial banks. Frightened bankers temporarily halted
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was halted on Russia's main stock exchange after
the first 40 minutes of trading because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent.
	   The new banking rules, adopted Wednesday night, were not
considered very significant, but the fact that the Central Bank
felt the need to take new measures contributed to a climate of
foreboding in the Russian markets.
	   Concern is growing that Russia will devaluate the ruble despite
an influx of cash from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF
loan was intended to bolster the beleaguered currency, which has
been under siege since the Russian economy began to backslide
earlier this year.
	   International stock market declines in the past week have helped
push the Russian stock exchange into a sharp decline and
intensified pressure on the ruble.
	   The ruble continued to fall against the U.S. dollar and the
German mark on Thursday. On the interbank market, foreign exchange
trading failed to start as usual Thursday morning, with bankers too
frightened by the shaky situation to risk transactions.
	   The quick plunge on the stock market prompted officials to halt
trading, citing regulations that call for a suspension when a
decline exceeds 10 percent during the first hour of trading.
	   Some blue-chip stocks fell by as much as 30 percent in the early
trading.
	   Stock exchange officials said they would consider reopening
later in the day.
	   The new rules adopted by the Central Bank restrict dollar-buying
by commercial banks for their own purposes. However, the Central
Bank said commercial banks could continue to buy dollars for
clients.
	   ``The rights of people to continue buying dollars will continue
as always,'' said a spokesman for the Central Bank, Alexei Nitko.
``When banks buy foreign currency, they must show they are doing it
for clients.''
	   Nitko said he didn't know if the restrictions applied to foreign
banks operating within Russia. However, Western bankers said the
new rules had not so far affected them.
	   The situation in the Russian markets appears to have been
complicated by the fact that many of the top officials in the
Central Bank and the government are on vacation.
	   On Wednesday, the deputy chief of the Central Bank, Sergei
Aleksashenko, announced that the bank was limiting trading with
some unidentified banks that it considered troubled.
	   Later in the day, he made some vaguely-worded statements that
the central bank would place greater controls on foreign-exchange
buying of commercial banks, apparently referring to the rules
imposed later that night. However, the statements contributed to a
general sense of dread among traders.

Australia wants full-strength India at Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board said
Thursday it will urge the game's governing body to ensure that
India sends a competitive team to next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   Australia is in the same group as India, Antigua and Canada for
the limited-overs tournament in Kuala Lumpur.
	   With only the top team from the group advancing to the
semifinals, India was expected to be Australia's toughest opponent.
	   But the Australian Cricket Board said India failed to name its
team by Wednesday's deadline, saying the team was committed to a
one-day series against Pakistan in Toronto.
	   However the Indian Olympic Association has demanded that the
Board of Cricket Control in India send its full-strength team to
Malaysia.
	   ACB chief executive Mal Speed was sympathetic to the Indian
position Thursday but said it should ensure the team it eventually
sent to the games was a strong one.
	   ``We're seeking an update on this from the Indians and we have
raised the issue with the ICC (International Cricket Council),''
Speed said. ``We would certainly like them to be there.''
	   The Commonwealth Games tournament has already been weakened by
the failure of England to send a team while Pakistan and South
Africa are also likely to be represented by under-strength sides.
	   In addition, the West Indies side will be broken up with
Jamaica, Barbados and Antigua sending separate sides. (djp)

Officials looking into complaints over city shut down on Hiroshima
</HEADLINE>
anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When Hiroshima city offices closed for observances
of the 53rd anniversary of the world's first atomic bomb attack,
janitors at city hall fielded dozens of angry phone calls, Kyodo
News said Thursday.
	   Callers ridiculed the ``big fuss'' over the anniversary and
asked if garbage was going to be picked up, Kyodo said.
	   Hiroshima officials were trying to confirm the complaints with a
security guard on duty that day, but could not comment now, said
city hall spokesman Masaharu Motoyama.
	   City offices shut down every year for the anniversary, and
Motoyama said he was aware of similar complaints about the shutdown
of city business last year.
	   Major observances are held each Aug. 6 to commemorate the
140,000 people killed in 1945 by the U.S. atomic bombing that
devastated the southwestern Japanese city, and to pray for peace.
	   Earlier this week, an unemployed man was arrested for allegedly
setting fire to thousands of folded paper cranes commemorating the
bombing in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park.

Robbers kill U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, nine others in central

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying Bock's van was used by attackers to
escape, police mount manhunt, set up roadblocks, other details

<TEXT>
	   ILOILO, Philippines (AP) _ Robbers armed with assault rifles
shot at the occupants of several vehicles on a road in the central
Philippines, killing 10 people, including a U.S. Peace Corps
volunteer, police said Thursday.
	   The five robbers shot the victims in the head or neck and then
took their belongings in the attack in the town of Sara in Iloilo
province Wednesday night, police Chief Superintendent Ricardo de
Leon said.
	   Six of the victims were forced out of their vehicles, lined up
on the side of the road and shot, a radio news report said, quoting
witnesses.
	   Police and U.S. Embassy officials identified the Peace Corps
volunteer as Robert Bock of New York. Police said Bock, who was on
the way to a meeting with a former town mayor, was shot in a van.
	   The U.S. Embassy strongly condemned the attack, which it called
a ``senseless act of violence.'' It said there was no indication
Bock or the United States was specifically targeted.
	   Bock, 33, was helping the provincial government in fisheries
management and the conservation of coral reefs. He was assigned to
Iloilo last year and was one of four American Peace Corps
volunteers working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila
said.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   De Leon said the robbers, armed with M-16 assault rifles and
pistols, attacked at least four vehicles passing on the road. The
father of the group's leader tried to stop them but was also shot
at by the group, he said. The father was not injured.
	   A man driving a van saw the attack in progress and tried to back
away, but the robbers saw him and shot at the vehicle, shattering
its windshield and injuring the driver.
	   Police said the robbers escaped in Bock's van and drove to a
nearby village, where they opened fire on a house but caused no
injuries. The van later fell into a shallow canal and was abandoned
by the men, the police said.
	   ``They went on a rampage apparently because of drugs,'' police
Chief Inspector Camilo Cascola said.
	   Provincial police director Pedro Sanchez said more than 70
policemen were scouring several nearby villages and manning
roadblocks.
	   Sanchez said a man who was drinking with the robbers prior to
the attack was being questioned, but it was not clear whether he
took part in the shooting.
	   Police said the men belong to a kidnapping and robbery gang
operating in metropolitan Manila and some central provinces. The
reported leader, Ricky Braga, has pending murder and homicide cases
in Iloilo, about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.
	   Despite on-and-off government crackdowns, crimes like robbery
and kidnapping remain rampant in the country.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who took office in June, has pledged
to make an anti-crime drive a cornerstone of his administration.

Zimbabwe willing to help Kabila says Defense Minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe is willing to give further
military assistance to President Laurent Kabila's government in
Congo if requested, the defense minister here told the official
news agency ZIANA Thursday.
	   ``Congo is a member of SADC (the 13-nation Southern African
Development Community) and it would be in the interest of the
region to make sure there is peace in that country,'' the official,
Moven Mahachi, told Ziana.
	   Assistance so far had been limited to a small team of officers
sent to draw up a plan for logistics and organization, said
Mahachi, and reports of deployment of combat forces were ``only
imaginations of the press''.
	   Mahachi said Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge would
shortly lead a four-nation SADC fact-finding mission to Congo to
look into Kabila's allegations that Rwandan forces were assisting
an army mutiny. Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia will also take part.
	   Reports from Kinshasa Thursday said Zambian cabinet minister
Eric Siluwamba had already arrived to begin an investigation into
Kabila's charges Rwanda and Uganda were embroiled in the war.

Rwanda calls for action to stop persecution of Tutsis in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rwanda has called for international help to
prevent the persecution of ethnic Tutsis by authorities in the
Congo, Radio Rwanda said Thursday.
	   ``The government protests against the persecution of Rwandans
and other Congolese nationals,'' Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana
said in a statement broadcast on the state-run radio.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of backing a
rebellion to topple President Laurent Kabila, and authorities have
rounded up hundreds of ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of aiding the
rebels.
	   Foreign diplomats in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, have also
called on Kabila's government to protect the Tutsis living in
Congo, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   Rebel commanders and Rwandan officials said Congolese
authorities had formed Hutu soldiers and militiamen from the former
extremist Rwandan Hutu government into killing squads. The former
soldiers were among those who fled into what was then eastern Zaire
after the 1994 genocide in Rwnda in which at least half a million
people, most of them minority Tutsis, were killed.
	   On Wednesday, Congolese human rights minister Leonard She
O'Kitundu told journalists in Kinshasa the government would begin
allowing the Red Cross to visit an unspecified number of detainees
rounded up in the capital on suspicion they were either rebel
sympathizers or spies.
	   In Bunia, in government-controlled northeastern Congo, a radio
broadcast monitored by the BBC on Aug. 8 called on people to kill
all Tutsis.
	   ``It should be stressed that people must bring a machete, a
spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric
irons, barbed wire, stones and the like, in order, dear listeners,
to kill the Rwandan Tutsis,'' the radio said.
	   ``Wherever you see a Rwandan Tutsi, regard him as your enemy. We
shall do everything possible to free ourselves from the grip of the
Tutsis,'' the radio said.
	   Last week, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu accused Kabila of
having trained at least 10,000 former Hutu fighters to use against
the rebels.
	   On Wednesday, a rebel commander in Goma said the Hutu fighters
were involved in combat against his units around Bukavu, at the
south end of Lake Kivu from Goma, and in the Masisi forests, north
of Goma. He did not elaborate.
	   Gasana said that Rwandans have been victims of beatings,
lootings, and executions committed by Kabila's supporters, both
military and civilian.
	   Gasana appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross
and the United Nations to intervene and save the lives.
	   The U.S. State Departement too has condemned the persecutions in
the capital Kinshasa and elsewhere.
	   The rebels include ethnic Tutsis and other Congolese groups who
say they are fighting to overthrow Kabila whom they accuse of
mismanaging the country and promoting tribalism.
	   Rwanda denies it is supporting the rebels. But many ethnic
Tutsis living in eastern Congo have close ties with their Tutsi
brethren in Rwanda.
	   Relations between Congo and Rwanda and Uganda _ who backed an
eight-month rebellion that ousted long-time dicator Mobutu Sese
Seko and installed Kabila in power in May 1997 _ have been
gradually deteriorating.
	   The Hutu soldiers and militiamen are using bases in eastern
Congo for launching attacks inside Rwanda.
	   The rebel Congolese soldiers complain they have not been paid
for eight months and claim incompetent bureaucrats, some of them
relatives or fellow Baluba tribesmen of Kabila, are running the
armed forces.
	   The rebels claim their 60,000 troops control most of eastern
Congo as well as towns near the Atlantic coast west of Kinshasa and
were closing in on the capital.

Daring plan: Government pins re-election hopes to new taxes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, edits to trim and conform &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Thursday launched a plan to overhaul Australia's tax system,
gambling on it as the centerpiece of his government's strategy for
looming national elections.
	   The plan introduces a new broad-based 10 percent consumption
tax, which was overwhelmingly rejected in 1993 by Australian voters
who shunned the campaign of Howard's conservative predecessors.
	   It would have to be approved by voters in the upcoming election,
and even then would not take effect until July 1, 2000.
	   To sweeten the new tax deal, it also includes personal income
tax cuts and streamlined social security payments worth more than
U.S. dlrs 7.8 billion (13 billion Australian dollars).
	   The government also exempted health, child care, education,
nursing home services, local taxes and charity contributions from
the new 10 percent tax.
	   Most European governments have had similar consumption taxes
since the 1970s, and neighboring New Zealand introduced one in
1986.
	   Public reaction to the package is considered crucial because of
the timing of national elections, which Howard can call at any time
but which must be held by May next year.
	   Many political analysts expect elections in October, following a
government-funded U.S. dlrs 6 million (10 million Australian
dollar) TV ad campaign to promote the new tax package.
	   The opposition Labor Party has called that promotion a
taxpayer-funded political boondoggle for Howard's re-election
campaign.
	   The new tax plan ``is above all a great investment of faith and
hope in the future of our country,'' Howard told reporters as he
arrived at Parliament House.
	   The government's goal was to give Australia a stronger, more
secure, more optimistic move into the 21st century, he said.
	   Howard and other proponents say the plan makes tax cheating and
avoidance impossible, minimizes tax distortions on a wide range of
goods, and lifts the tax burden on exports.
	   But skeptics say it will be inflationary, boosting all prices 10
percent; is unfair to the poor, who have less discretionary income
than the rich; and that pensioners and others on fixed incomes will
see little benefit from tax cuts.
	   Howard promised to offset the new tax with generous compensation
payments to help Australia's retired people, poor and unemployed
meet the higher cost for food and services.
	   A recent poll found some 85 percent of voters surveyed feared
future governments might increase the consumption tax above the
introductory 10 percent to raise more revenue.
	   On Thursday, Howard promised the rate will not rise unless all
state and territory leaders agree.
	   After slumping to a 2 1/2-year low two months ago at 34 percent
support in the polls, 11 points behind Labor, Howard's government
has rebounded.
	   A new Newspoll published earlier this week showed Howard's
conservative coalition has risen to tie the Labor Party in
popularity at 39 percent each, with the right-ring populist One
Nation party polling 11 percent.
	   The rebound in the polls for Howard's party is another sign he
will choose an early election date, in October, rather than wait.
	   Howard's program strikes deep into the heartland of his populist
rival Pauline Hanson by offering tax breaks worth U.S. dlrs 2.1
billion (3.5 billion Australian dollars) to farmers, mainly through
cheaper diesel fuel.
	   Both Hanson and Howard's formal opposition, the Labor Party,
strongly oppose the consumption tax.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that U.N. weapons inspectors are not treating it fairly.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, was due in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of neighboring
Kuwait, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed by a day a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear weapons
capability.
	   Iraq's state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Baghdad's allegation that
Butler was working on behalf of the United States to prolong the
sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's ruling Baath party,
said in a front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts
to raising doubts and accusations that are not based on any
facts.''
	   It added: ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the
committee will come up with others, and it will turn into a game
with no end.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   But the New York Times on Thursday said that the long-term
monitoring program also was being impeded because Iraq is not
allowing U.N. inspectors to act on any violations their equipment
detect. And, the Times said, Iraq has suspended its participation
in technical talks aimed at uncovering the full history of Iraq's
weapons development.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As concern grew over the stability of the Russian
ruble, the Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency
trading by commercial banks. Frightened bankers temporarily halted
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was halted on Russia's main stock exchange after
the first 40 minutes of trading because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent. The exchange reopened 35 minutes later.
	   The new banking rules, adopted Wednesday night, were not
considered very significant, but the fact that the Central Bank
felt the need to take new measures contributed to a climate of
foreboding in the Russian markets.
	   Concern is growing that Russia will devalue the ruble despite an
influx of cash from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF loan
was intended to bolster the beleaguered currency, which has been
under siege since the Russian economy began to backslide earlier
this year.
	   International stock market declines in the past week have helped
push the Russian stock exchange into a sharp decline and
intensified pressure on the ruble.
	   George Soros, the American investor whose moves are closely
watched on international markets, was quoted by Britain's Financial
Times as saying it was time to devalue the ruble and establish a
currency board in Russia.
	   The ruble continued to fall against the U.S. dollar and the
German mark on Thursday. On the interbank market, foreign exchange
trading failed to start as usual Thursday morning, with bankers too
frightened by the shaky situation to risk transactions.
	   The quick plunge on the stock market prompted officials to halt
trading for the second time this week. They cited regulations that
call for a suspension when a decline exceeds 10 percent during the
first hour of trading.
	   Some blue-chip stocks fell by as much as 30 percent in the early
trading.
	   The new rules adopted by the Central Bank restrict dollar-buying
by commercial banks for their own purposes. However, the Central
Bank said commercial banks could continue to buy dollars for
clients.
	   ``The rights of people to continue buying dollars will continue
as always,'' said a spokesman for the Central Bank, Alexei Nitko.
``When banks buy foreign currency, they must show they are doing it
for clients.''
	   Nitko said he didn't know if the restrictions applied to foreign
banks operating within Russia. However, Western bankers said the
new rules had not so far affected them.
	   The situation in the Russian markets appears to have been
complicated by the fact that many of the top officials in the
Central Bank and the government are on vacation.

Teen-ager arrested in theft of poisonous chemical from school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 16-year-old boy was caught stealing a dangerous
chemical from a school science lab and told investigators he wanted
to use it to scare people, police said Thursday.
	   The case follows two recent poisoning cases in Japan _ the death
of four people from eating curry laced with cyanide and arsenic,
and the hospitalization of 10 people who drank tea containing a
toxic sodium compound.
	   The boy broke into a junior high school in central Japan
Wednesday evening and stole a bottle of ammonium sulfate, a
fertilizer made with sulfuric acid and ammonia, said a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A security guard caught the boy.
	   Police said the teen-ager had little knowledge of chemicals but
told officers that he wanted ``to show the bottle to people I don't
like to scare them.''
	   The recent poisoning cases sent shockwaves through Japan and
prompted police to be on guard against copycat crimes.
	   Japan has become especially nervous about poisonings since a
religious cult carried out a nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways
in 1995, killing 12 people.

Wedding guests hospitalized with food poisoning in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A wedding celebration turned sour when 39
guests, including seven children, were hospitalized with food
poisoning, officials said Thursday. It was the second such incident
in Ukraine in recent weeks.
	   The guests were taken to a hospital Tuesday after they ate bad
food at a wedding celebration in the western village of Yavoryv,
said the Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   Earlier this month, a wedding feast in the eastern city of
Poltava ended with 47 of the 63 celebrants, including the bride and
groom, hospitalized with salmonella. The illnesses were caused by
food provided by the bride's relatives, and included meat prepared
at an unhygienic shop.
	   Food poisoning and salmonella cases have mounted in recent
months in the former Soviet republic, where many people buy their
food at uncontrolled outdoor markets.

Miner clearers report drop in number of Cambodian land mine
</HEADLINE>
injuries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The number of Cambodians injured or
killed by land mines each month has dropped by more than 60 percent
in the past five years, a result of increased public awareness,
mine clearing officials said Thursday.
	   ``Mine-related injuries and deaths have decreased to between
100-150 per month, compared to 300-400 per month five years ago,''
said Sam Sotha, national director of the Cambodian Mine Action
Center. ``This is thanks to mine awareness programs.''
	   Two decades of war and lingering civil unrest have turned
Cambodia into one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
An estimated 4 million to 6 million of the lethal weapons have been
laid in Cambodian soil.
	   Mine clearers are working their way slowly through the
countryside, spending hours to locate and detonate each mine.
	   Sam Sotha predicted that it could take them another quarter of a
century to clear land in Cambodia to the point where most areas are
inhabitable.
	   In the 4 1/2 years that CMAC has been operating, 34 of its mine
clearers have lost limbs while removing mines, and one was killed
by an explosion when he apparently fainted in a mine field.
	   The government drafted a law late year that bans the use of
antipersonnel land mines and calls for the destruction of mine
stockpiles within one year.
	   The draft law, which prohibits the use, production, possession
and trade of all kinds of antipersonnel land mines, has yet to go
to the National Assembly for approval.
	   Cambodia is one of 121 nations that signed a treaty to ban
antipersonnel land mines worldwide in Ottawa late last year. The
country will hold an international conference on land mines in late
October, Sam Sotha said.

Muslim rebels ask Philippine government to postpone peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim rebels asked the Philippine
government Thursday for a one-week postponement of peace talks
scheduled next week, to give them more time to prepare after a
half-year suspension.
	   Al-haj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, said they asked for the extension after the government panel
proposed the signing of an ``agreement of intent'' to be part of
the start of talks.
	   The agreement would stop the rebels and the military from
conducting offensive operations during the talks.
	   A similar agreement was signed under former President Fidel
Ramos but clashes continued, with each side accusing the other of
violating the pact. The rebels want assurances that Ramos'
successor, Joseph Estrada, will pursue the peace negotiations.
	   The peace talks, suspended for the May 11 national elections,
were scheduled to resume next Tuesday. The government is likely to
agree to postpone the start to Aug. 25.
	   Government spokesmen said no substantive issues are to be
discussed at the first meeting but it is expected that the
remaining agenda of the talks would be finalized.
	   The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the government
since last year, is the bigger of two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National
Liberation Front, signed a peace pact in 1996.
	   Estrada has said he wants to conclude the peace talks in 18
months.

Syria criticizes Israel for resisting nuclear inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria on Thursday denounced Israel's
renewed reluctance to put its nuclear facilities under
international inspection, saying its weapons posed a threat to the
region.
	   Al-Baath newspaper, published by the ruling party, charged in an
editorial that Israel wants to be an ``exceptional case, above the
international agreements and laws.''
	   On Tuesday, Israel agreed to join talks on a treaty banning the
production of material used to make nuclear weapons.
	   But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision, made
under pressure from the United States, ``does not imply adoption of
a position on the agreement or its contents,''
	   It was a reference to Israel's refusal to confirm the existence
of its nuclear weapons program or to open it to international
inspection.
	   Israel, widely believed to have several hundred nuclear weapons,
is the only country in the region with such weapons.
	   Israel's arsenal, Al-Baath said, ``poses a menacing threat to
the security of the region and that of the whole world.''
	   The paper criticized the United States' for not insisting that
Israel open up to inspections, saying: ``The silence has given a
chance for other exceptions in various areas of the world.''
	   It added: ``The United States, which winks at Israel's nuclear
arsenal, has no right to ask other countries to stand having their
hands tied behind their backs and not to posses legitimate means
for self-defense.''
	   The paper called for reining in Israel's ``nuclear mutiny'' to
prevent a catastrophe in the region.

Markets mixed, but long-term gloom dominates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 4-5 with Hang Seng and HSBC closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock prices were mixed Thursday after a
rebound on Wall Street, but the prevailing mood remained decidedly
sour because of weakness in Japan and a large collection of local
troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index scratched out a tiny gain, finishing 3.05
points higher at 15,382.02, after eight straight days of losses.
The threat of Central Bank intervention initially kept the dollar
in check, but the fears receded and the dollar advanced strongly in
late trading to break through 147 yen.
	   Japan's weakness left the entire region gloomy. Even where stock
prices and currencies rebounded Thursday, there was no confidence
that things were turning for the better.
	   Hong Kong's volatile Hang Seng index, already at a five-year
low, fell another 2.9 percent, closing at 6,660.42. The Hang Seng
is down 16 percent this month.
	   As it has for the last week, the Hong Kong index closely
followed the fortunes of banking giant HSBC Holdings, whose stock
was declining again Thursday. HSBC, which accounts for about 30
percent of the index, fell 3.8 percent Thursday.
	   HSBC was one of several major Hong Kong corporations that
reported poor first-half earnings last week, sending the market
steeply lower.
	   Analysts, echoing comments Wednesday by Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, blamed the fall in the Hong Kong market on the
weakness of the yen. Japan's economic troubles are causing
investors to worry that Hong Kong will be unable to keep its direct
link to the U.S. dollar, and that China will be forced to devalue
its yuan currency.
	   Both Chinese and Hong Kong officials insist that won't happen.
	   Japan's weakness unsettled markets throughout the region, which
also face new worries about the U.S. economy. Asian economies that
long have focused on exports need a strong U.S. market to help them
out of their troubles. But volatility on Wall Street in the past
week has raised questions whether a long period of strong growth is
coming to a close.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index, which is at a
10-year low, dropped 2.9 percent to 966.98. One trader predicted it
would reach 900 by the end of the month unless the Japanese
government intervened in markets to support the yen.
	   Malaysia's market was down 5.3 percent. Analysts cited local
economic weakness and uncertainty over whether Japan will turn
around economically anytime soon.
	   In Taiwan and the Philippines, markets were up, but even in
those markets there was little to break the gloom.
	   The Manila index had lost 14 percent of its value in the five
previous sessions, and traders regarded Thursday's advance as
largely a technical rebound. In Taipei, traders said the rebound
would be limited by Japan's weakness and worries about first-half
earnings reports that are due out by the end of August.

Suspected extremists kill three Christian farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Suspected Muslim extremists shot and killed
three Coptic Christian brothers on their farm in southern Egypt,
police officials said Thursday.
	   The attack by three gunmen took place Wednesday night near the
the village of Damshir in Minya province, which is 190 kilometers
(120 miles) south of Cairo.
	   The victims were identified as Farag Gabr Shehata and his
brothers Yaaqoub and Wahib. Police said that two other farmers who
had been with the Shehata brothers fled when the shooting started
and were safe.
	   The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal
security, issued a statement late Wednesday saying the attackers
were being sought.
	   Muslim extremists have waged a campaign since 1992 to try to
overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with Islamic
rule. Their targets have included Coptic Christians, foreign
tourists and police.
	   Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police
and extremists.

International Cycling Union to establish long-term checks for drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cracking down on doping, the head of the
International Cycling Union said Thursday that his organization
will establish a ``medical follow-up'' on cyclists since testing
during races can't always detect forbidden drugs.
	   ``We're not even going to increase the number of checks'' during
races, ``because the problem is with non-detectable products,'' UCI
President Hein Verbruggen told Europe 1 radio from Lausanne,
Switzerland, where the federation is based.
	   But, he said, ``let's at least guarantee the health of the
riders.'' Verbruggen said that during the Tour de France, when the
current doping scandal broke out, the UCI announced ``there would
be a system of medical follow-up, that we force cyclists to be
tested.''
	   The federation was to announce details of its anti-doping
measures later Thursday, following the meeting it held in Lausanne
Tuesday with the sport's top officials and riders.
	   Verbruggen said the French probe of doping during the three-week
Tour, which ended Aug. 2, ``was excellent in the sense that they
did something we couldn't do.''
	   But he questioned some of the tactics, asking ``if it is
necessary to put team directors in prison for 20 days.'' Justice
officials ``waited five months and did nothing. Why do it now,
during the Tour de France?''

Syrian hanged for murder of Syrian family in Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Syrian convicted of murdering a Syrian
family in Jordan because of a financial dispute was executed on
Thursday, prison officials said.
	   They said Fateh Galasi was hanged at dawn in Swaqa Prison, 100
kilometers (60 miles) south of the Jordanian capital Amman. He was
in his late 40s, the officials said.
	   A criminal court sentenced Galasi to death earlier this year for
killing Jamal Abdo Majzub, his wife Manal, and their 2-year old
son, Khaled, in June 1997.
	   Galasi confessed to police that he killed the family because
Majzub's father was pressing him to repay a debt of 7 million
Syrian pounds (dlrs 155,000).

Japanese stocks edge higher, dollar gains in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices,
aggregate stock trading statistics and currency range; ADDS trader
quote in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices edged higher Thursday, ending
an eight-session losing streak, but traders said it was not the
start of a rally. The dollar rose against the yen.
	   In its first gain since July 31, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average rose 3.05 points, just 0.02 percent, closing at
15,382.02. On Wednesday, the average had slipped 28.02 points, or
0.18 percent.
	   The gain was spurred by a late bout of short-covering, traders
said. A rise in stock futures prices on suspected buying by
government pension and postal funds also pulled the market higher,
they added.
	   And improved sentiment following gains on Wall Street Wednesday
helped offset persistent worries about Japan's economy. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 90.11 points Wednesday to 8,552.96.
	   Still, some traders said no genuine rally in Tokyo stock prices
was likely any time soon.
	   ``This is not the start of a genuine market rebound,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities Co.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section edged up 1.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,181.71. It had
fallen 6.88 points, or 0.58 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 333 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 427 million the previous day. Advances
outnumbered declines 744 to 395, with 142 stocks closing unchanged.
	   Shares of many construction companies rallied after the Cabinet
approved a budget plan late Wednesday to speed spending on public
works projects. General contractor Kajiyama Corp. rose 3.2 percent
to 350 yen (dlrs 2.38).
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 146.56 yen in late afternoon, up
0.64 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York rate of 146.44 yen overnight. It traded as high as 147.16 yen
and as low as 145.86 yen.
	   The U.S. currency's strength against the yen followed its gains
against the German mark in New York trading overnight amid concern
about a possible devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa
Bank Ltd., said the currency market was ``very nervous about
Russia.''
	   The Russian stock market's main index lost 1.6 percent
Wednesday, following a 9 percent plunge Tuesday, and the Russian
ruble sank against the dollar.
	   Traders shrugged off hints from the Japanese Finance Ministry's
vice minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, that
Japan would intervene to prop up the yen, noting the slight
prospects for a rapid recovery in Japanese economic fundamentals.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond closed at 1.185 percent, unchanged from Wednesday. Its price
was steady at 111.87 yen.

Next mission blasts off for Mir space station

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The second to last crew of the
Russian space station Mir blasted off Thursday from the former
Soviet cosmodrome in this Central Asian nation.
	   The Soyuz TM-28 ship was launched as scheduled at 1:43 p.m.
(0943 GMT) and is expected to dock with the station on Saturday. It
carries a three-man crew consisting of former presidential adviser
Yuri Baturin, flight commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer Gennady
Padalka.
	   Like other state organizations, the Russian space agency has had
cash problems that were so severe that earlier this summer
officials were even talking about abandoning the Mir after the
current crew of Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin returns in
August.
	   The government has been slow to pay the dlrs 600 million it owed
for Mir's operations last year, forcing the state-controlled
Energiya company to turn to commercial credits to finance
Thursday's launch.
	   It was postponed for 10 days because of the cash problems, which
prevented Russian space officials from paying electricity bills to
local authorities. They responded by turning off power to the
cosmodrome for two weeks. The blackout delayed preparations for the
launch.
	   Russian space officials felt uneasy about the launch date
because of the common superstition about the number 13 and even
considered changing it. Eventually, they overcame their fears.
Thursday was the most convenient day this week for bringing the
Soyuz to a designated flight path and the launch couldn't be
postponed any further.
	   ``There is nothing terrible about 13 _ after all, it doesn't
fall on Friday,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Deputy Mission
Control chief Viktor Blagov as saying.
	   Having to endure the launch on the 13th, the crew meticulously
followed numerous other rites, including leaving autographs on the
door of their hotel room and drinking a glass of champagne before
the departure without toasting each other. Another less-publicized
tradition obliges cosmonauts to urinate on the wheel of a bus
carrying them to the launch pad.
	   When asked by a Russian newspaper whether he was prepared to
share that practice too, the 48-year-old Baturin _ a former
national security advisor _t responded that he would honor all the
established rites.
	   The current crew will return to Earth along with Baturin on
August 25. No further extension of the current team's stay is
possible because the service lifetime of their escape capsule ends
in late August.
	   ``Sure, we're waiting for them. We have nowhere to retreat,''
Mir's commander, Talgat Musabayev, joked during a radio exchange
with the crew on Thursday.
	   The new crew is to stay on the Mir until February. However,
Avdeyev, the flight commander, may remain on the orbiter until next
June, when the Mir is to be discarded and lowered to Earth.
	   The last crew, consisting of a Russian commander along with a
French and a Slovak astronaut, are also expected to visit the Mir
before it is abandoned.

Hotel offers Diana's last ride....in a dark Mercedes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES color of Mercedes, adds details, byline
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Left Bank hotel is giving tourists a chance to
relive Princess Diana's last moments as she made her way from the
Ritz Hotel to the crash site and, finally, the hospital where she
was pronounced dead.
	   To make it a bit more dramatic, the Hotel Odeon at Saint-Germain
des Pres is even offering private tours in a dark Mercedes, the
same make of car which spun out of control and slammed into a
concrete pillar in a tunnel nearly one year ago.
	   ``We get as many questions as to how to find the Eiffel Tower
and Arc de Triomphe as the Ritz Hotel and the Place de l'Alma,''
hotel manager Emile Cacciari said Thursday in a telephone
interview.
	   Cacciari said the tour was part of a promotional package to
boost hotel business which he said is always slow in August.
	   Van tours start this weekend, free of charge to Odeon guests and
150 francs (dlrs 25) for anyone else.
	   Cacciari said all the money made from the tours would be donated
to the Princess Diana Memorial Fund. But a fund spokeswoman said
Thursday the fund would not accept the money.
	   ``(The tour) is not an approved fundraising activity,'' the
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Paris Tourism Office, the Ritz Hotel and Buckingham Palace
have declined to comment.
	   The tour goes first to the Hotel Ritz in the swanky Place
Vendome on the Right Bank, where Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed
dined before getting in the car with driver Henri Paul and
bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones on Aug. 31.
	   It then takes the route along the Seine River where Paul drove
at high speed trying to shake press photographers, and stops at the
Place de l'Alma _ spontaneously transformed into a Diana memorial
by countless thousands of visitors drawn to the site over the past
year.
	   Nearly a year after Diana's death, mourners continue lay
flowers, pictures, drawings and poems at the foot of the gilded
Flame of Liberty _ a replica of the Statue of Liberty's flame
donated to the city of Paris several years ago to commemorate the
100th anniversary of the International Herald Tribune.
	   The visit concludes outside the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital on
the Left Bank, where Diana was pronounced dead. Fayed and Paul also
were killed.
	   Meanwhile, the crash remains under investigation. Police say
among possible contributing factors were Paul's state of
drunkenness and the high speed of the Mercedes.
	   The daily Le Parisien said it hoped that all the tour's drivers
``would be sober.''

Hong Kong share prices pulled down by battered yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices, already at five-year
lows, were pulled still lower Thursday by the sell-off of a market
heavyweight and the weakness of the battered Japanese currency.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell steadily until about 30
minutes before the close, when it recovered some ground as the yen
strengthened slightly.
	   The index closed 2.9 percent, or 199.06 points, lower at
6,660.42 after trading as low as 6,544.70, erasing Wednesday's 1.2
percent gain. The index has dropped 16 percent this month.
	   Turnover was 5.14 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 659
million), down from Wednesday's 5.55 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 712 million).
	   The sell-off of market heavyweight HSBC, which accounts for
about 30 percent of the index and until recently had helped support
the beleaguered market, pulled down the index Thursday, traders
said.
	   The sell-off came after Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd.
released a report Wednesday predicting HSBC Holdings shares would
sink to 120 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 15.38), said Nelson Wong,
sales director at Celestial Asia Securities.
	   HSBC slid 3.8 percent to 151 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
19.35), after hitting a low earlier in the session of 149 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 19.10), a level not seen since October 1997,
when the Asian crisis first hit here.
	   Francis Lun, an analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.,
said fund managers have been madly dumping Hong Kong shares since
the index fell below the 7,000 psychological support level, which
triggered a loss of confidence.
	   Traders said worries about the yen continued to plague the
market. Investors worry that the weak yen will force China to
devalue the yuan, which in turn will prompt Hong Kong to abandon
the currency's peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang reiterated Thursday that
officials are prepared to deal with speculators ``very decisively''
to protect the currency link.
	   He added that the stock and securities markets have been working
smoothly and have ``sufficient liquidity to meet anybody's needs.''
	   Among losers, HSBC's affiliate Hang Seng Bank dropped 0.2 Hong
Kong dollars to 36.80, property giant Cheung Kong Holdings shed
1.05 to 28.85, and China Light and Power Holdings lost 0.80 to
28.85.
	   But China Telecom bucked the market trend, closing 0.30 higher
at 9.30.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A speeding train rammed a bus at a
railway crossing in southern India Thursday, killing 19 people and
injuring 24, domestic news agencies reported.
	   The bus apparently stalled after crashing though a closed gate
at the crossing, and was unable to move when the train approached,
the Press Trust of India reported. All the victims were passengers
sitting near the front of the bus, which was packed to capacity.
	   No one on the train was killed or injured. The train engine was
slightly damaged, PTI said.
	   The accident occurred near the town of Karur, 2,000 kilometers
(1,200 miles) south of the Indian capital New Delhi.
	   Survivors said the train's engine pushed the bus 500 meters
(yards) before stopping.

Opposition says government responsible for Suu Kyi as van moved

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party expressed fears for her safety after her van was moved to a
small wooden bridge Thursday, the second day of her latest roadside
challenge to the military government.
	   The party urged the government to allow Suu Kyi, stopped
Wednesday at a checkpoint 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital, to proceed to the western city of Bassein to meet
supporters.
	   ``It is the responsibility of the government if the bridge
breaks under the heavy weight of the van,'' the National League for
Democracy said in a statement. ``The prevention ... amounts to
restricting the organizational activities of the party.''
	   The van was presumably moved to clear traffic, which was backed
up for kilometers (miles) Wednesday. The bridge, built for
ox-carts, held Suu Kyi's smaller car during her six-day standoff at
the same checkpoint two weeks ago.
	   A government spokesman said in a faxed statement to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, that Suu Kyi had not spoken
to anyone and that all the windows were rolled up.
	   ``A medical team is on standby should she need one and an
appropriate number of security personnel has been provided in case
she and her companions choose to stay by the roadside,'' it said.
	   The government said it would be ``unsafe'' to let her travel
farther.
	   Suu Kyi, however, appeared ready for a long confrontation, to
raise pressure ahead of the Aug. 21 deadline she has set for a
parliament elected in 1990 to be convened.
	   Her National League for Democracy overwhelmingly won the
election, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as
Burma, since 1962, never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is severely
restricted in her movements and political activities. Recently, she
has been staging confrontations with the government by trying to
meet supporters outside the capital.
	   The last standoff drew international condemnation of the
government. International pressure is one of the few tools at Suu
Kyi's disposal to try to force change.
	   The government spokesman reported that there were no
disturbances anywhere in the country.
	   In Bangkok, 40 exiled students protesting in front of Myanmar's
embassy condemned the restriction on Suu Kyi. So did the National
Council of the Union of Burma, an umbrella for ethnic minorities.
	   ``The military cannot prevent her from seeing her friends and
followers,'' said Gaw Minth, a protest spokesman. ``It is the
second time now, and we condemn it.''
	   Official newspapers criticized Suu Kyi, daughter of independence
hero Aung San, as a tool of powerful countries.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi has been given many awards by superpowers for
her anti-government activities,'' a commentary said. ``She has to
prove herself worthy of those awards by opposing the state.''
	   The authorities ended last month's showdown by seizing Suu Kyi's
car and driving her back to her home in Yangon. She recovered from
fever and dehydration but vowed to press the government to open a
dialogue with her.
	   The van can carry more food and water than the sedan used last
time. Again traveling with her is Hla Pe, 75, a member of the NLD's
central executive committee, and two drivers.
	   Meanwhile, 18 foreign activists arrested for passing out
anti-government leaflets Sunday were grouped together in a single
police facility for the first time, but there was still no decision
on whether they would face trial.
	   Pressure built for their release. Sympathizers and family
members were attempting to travel to visit the detainees, who
include six Americans, three Indonesians, three Malaysians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   Among those seeking entry was U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, a New
Jersey Republican, who has a constituent among the detainees.
	   U.S. Embassy officials were allowed to meet the Americans for
the second time.

Big four set to dominate but Hammers may strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian Wright in a West Ham shirt. Marcel Desailly
lining up for Chelsea. Paul Gascoigne back in the Premier League.
	   English soccer has a different look for the new season kicking
off this weekend but the same names are likely to come out at the
top.
	   Defending champion Arsenal, runner-up Manchester United,
third-place Liverpool and fourth-place Chelsea are likely to fill
the top four places again when the season ends in May.
	   But in which order?
	   If last weekend's Charity Shield is a guide, Arsenal still
appears to have the measure of United after a 3-0 victory at
Wembley. The Gunners beat the Reds at home and away last season as
they wiped out United's 12-point lead to clinch the title.
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has barely made a change to his
lineup, only adding unheralded David Grondin to the growing list of
French players on his roster.
	   But Wenger did sell Wright to West Ham on the basis that the
34-year-old striker _ Arsenal's all-time leading scorer _ wouldn't
have been guaranteed a starting place because of the form of Dutch
World Cup star Dennis Bergkamp and French forward Nicolas Anelka.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was annoyed at seeing
the league title slip away last season after four triumphs in five
years but was even more furious that his team tumbled out of the
Champions Cup at the quarterfinal stage.
	   So Ferguson spent 10 million pounds (dlrs 16.5 million) on Dutch
World Cup player Jaap Stam, a world record for a defender, and
added Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist.
	   But Ferguson was turned down by AC Milan's Patrick Kluivert and
is still chasing Aston Villa's Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke, priced
by the Birmingham club at 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.4 million).
	   Liverpool's biggest and most surprising recruit was former
French national team coach Gerard Houllier. The Merseyside club,
whose last of a record 18 league titles was back in 1990, named
Houllier to work alongside current manager Roy Evans, who came in
for criticism last season.
	   With 18-year-old striker Michael Owen still getting rave reviews
for his standout World Cup performances, Liverpool has the
potential to win the title. But the Anfield club has spent several
seasons promising much but achieving little.
	   Cup Winners Cup holder Chelsea had another busy summer in the
transfer market and has added some more big names to its already
powerful roster. Danish striker Brian Laudrup, French World Cup
star Desailly, Spanish defender Alberto Ferrer and Italian striker
Pierluigi Casiraghi have joined the Blues, and Denis Wise might
find himself the only Englishman on the team.
	   Newcastle, a major flop last season after finishing runner-up
the previous two, doesn't look any stronger despite the arrival of
French World Cup player Stephane Guivarc'h. Many critics say the
fans may lose patience with manager Kenny Dalglish if the club
doesn't make the top six, especially since the Magpies went close
to relegation last season.
	   The same applies to Everton and Tottenham, two big clubs which
are expected to be in the top six instead of the bottom six.
	   Everton now has experienced former Glasgow Rangers manager
Walter Smith at the helm and he has recruited John Collins from
Monaco. But Spurs, still with Christian Gross in charge, has been
very quiet in the transfer market.
	   The surprise of the season could be West Ham.
	   The arrival of Wright, Liverpool's Neil Ruddock and Chilean
World Cup defender Javier Margas has strengthened a team which
performed well last term to finish eighth under Harry Redknapp.
	   Leeds manager George Graham has barely altered his squad which
looks unlikely to improve on last season's fifth-place finish,
although former England international winger Lee Sharpe is back
after virtually a year out with injury.
	   Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson has to justify spending 7 million
pounds (11.5 million) on Kevin Davies despite the striker's
spectacular goals for Southampton last term, and will do well to
repeat last season's sixth place.
	   Aston Villa finished in such good form it gained a UEFA Cup
place. Although Yugoslav striker Savo Milosevic and Irish defender
Steve Staunton have gone, Villa places much faith in its young
signing from Bolton, Andy Thompson, and John Gregory's team is
capable of repeating last season's seventh place.
	   Derby County, under veteran Jim Smith, and Leicester, guided by
one of the most promising managers in the game, Martin O'Neill,
can't afford to be among the big spenders and have made few
changes. Both are likely to repeat their mid-standings positions,
although Derby's elusive and unpredictable Costa Rican forward
Paolo Wanchope could push his team close to a top-six place while
Leicester may struggle to hang on to talented striker Emile Heskey.
	   Coventry, also expected to be among last season's strugglers,
played impressively and wound up 11th under Gordon Strachan. It has
added talented Croatia defender Robert Jarni to the squad while
letting go of Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan.
	   Of the newcomers, division one Nottingham Forest will struggle
to survive, especially if it winds up playing without its 58-goal
strike partnership of Kevin Campbell and Pierre van Hooydonk.
	   Manager Dave Bassett sold 24-goal Campbell to Turkish club
Trabzonspor and that prompted 34-goal Van Hooydonk to refuse to
play for the club.
	   Big-spending Middlesbrough flopped in its last promotion to the
top flight and there will be huge pressure on manager Bryan Robson
not to repeat the club's 1996-97 disaster. Gascoigne, playing
Premier League soccer for the first time since 1991, will hog the
spotlight especially after missing a World Cup place on fitness
grounds.
	   The third promoted club, Charlton, is already a strong favorite
to go back down. The south London team gained its Premier League
place through the playoffs and, like Barnsley last season, will
struggle to restrict the powerhouse teams to less than three or
four goals.
	   Other teams likely to be fighting relegation are Sheffield
Wednesday, even with highly-rated former Barnsley manager Danny
Wilson in charge; Southampton, despite hiring experienced Mark
Hughes and Stuart Ripley, and cash-strapped Wimbledon, which has
virtually the same roster as last season.

Egyptian lawyer says he warned U.S. of possible attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A lawyer who formerly defended Egyptian
extremists said Thursday that he warned American diplomats earlier
this year of ``grave consequences'' if the United States continued
its hostile policies towards Islamic activists.
	   The lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, told The Associated Press that
he met the American diplomats in his office in Cairo last March.
	   He said he cautioned them that American policy which is
``hostile to Arabs and Muslims ... will have grave consequences.''
	   He added: ``I warned them that it's difficult for America to
make fighting Islam and animosity to Islamists its priority without
this leading to hatred and violence.''
	   Asked if his warnings were based on specific threats, el-Zayat
said ``No, they were general.''
	   His warning was revealed on Thursday in an article in the
London-headquartered Al-Hayat daily.
	   More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured on
Friday in bombings against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   El-Zayat announced last January that he would no longer defend
Muslim extremists in cases brought by the Egyptian government. This
decision followed his failed attempt to negotiate a truce between
the government and Egypt's main militant group, al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group.

Ukrainian opposition newspaper journalist faces trial for draft
</HEADLINE>
dodging &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have detained a
journalist who works for an opposition-minded newspaper and want to
put him on trial for draft dodging, a news report said Thursday.
	   Andriy Yavetsky of the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti was detained
Tuesday and freed a day later. Yavetsky was ordered not to leave
town, and faces up to 3 years in prison if convicted, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Some Ukrainian media have charged that the action against
Yavetsky, known for his coverage of protests by unpaid Ukrainian
miners earlier this summer, was intended as revenge by the
authorities.
	   The reports noted that draft dodging is widespread, and that
President Leonid Kuchma has ordered a temporary halt to the
military draft in June to provide for a planned reduction of
military personnel.
	   About 18,000 youths in Ukraine presently are evading the draft.
In 1997, 140 draft dodgers went on trial, but nobody was punished,
Interfax said.
	   In June, Kievskiye Vedomosti lost two court battles against
Ukrainian officials. It was ordered to pay 5 million hryvna (dlrs
2.5 million) to the country's interior minister for falsely
accusing him of corruption, and 2,000 hryvna (dlrs 1,000) for
harming the dignity and professional reputation of Kiev city
authorities.
	   The centrist newspaper is appealing both verdicts, which it said
were politically motivated.
	   Critics of Kuchma often accuse the Ukrainian authorities of
attempting to silence opposition media in the former Soviet
republic.

Foreign minister unsympathetic toward arrested Malaysians

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's foreign minister said
Thursday he could not sympathize with the three Malaysians who were
among 18 foreign democracy activists arrested in Myanmar for
passing out anti-government leaflets.
	   ``Frankly it's difficult to sympathize with our people who go to
other countries and create trouble or breach the law, especially if
they knowingly do it and are aware that they may face problems,''
Abdullah Badawi said.
	   ``If they have violated that country's law and it has taken
action ... what can we do?'' Bernama news agency quoted him as
saying. Malaysia too would take action against any foreigner who
broke the country's law, he said.
	   The three Malaysians _ See Chee How, Chong Kok Ywei and Ong Ju
Lin _ could, however, approach the Malaysian Embassy in Yangon for
assistance.
	   Myanmar has said that the detainees, who belong to groups
opposed to the government, have not cooperated with investigations
into Sunday's protest, thus prolonging their detention.
	   The protests followed the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule that was eventually crushed by
troops, causing the deaths of an estimated 3,000 people.
	   No decision has been made on whether the activists will be
deported or charged and tried for crimes, the government has said.
	   Among the detained are six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Philippines citizens and an Australian.

Government considers building special housing for pedophiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alarmed by a public backlash against its policy of
resettling convicted pedophiles in the community, the government is
considering building special centers to house them on their release
from jail.
	   A Home Office committee set up after notorious child-killer
Robert Oliver was released in September is considering ``a range or
different options'' to allay public fears, a Home Office spokesman
said Thursday.
	   ''One of them is the possibility of specially built
establishments to house convicted sex offenders and where they can
be kept under surveillance,'' said the spokesman, speaking with
customary anonymity. ''But no decision has been taken yet.''
	   Oliver, 43, was released after serving 10 years of a 15-year
sentence for the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old youth in
1988.
	   He is among 150 sex offenders due to be released over the next
few years who are legally entitled to live without supervision
because they were convicted before 1991, the year a new law was
passed allowing surveillance in such cases.
	   Laws since then say released sex offenders must register with
the police and be supervised by parole officers.
	   When the authorities tried to house Oliver, they ran into
objections from residents in several towns and were eventually
forced to place him in a privately-run clinic where he has remained
under police guard.
	   This week, a halfway house hostel run by the probation service
in northern England said it was not prepared to take Oliver because
he refused to accept surveillance.
	   Parents' groups picketed a London jail in May when one of
Oliver's three accomplices, Sidney Cooke, 70, was released after
serving nine years of a 16-year sentence. News reports said he is
unrepentant and dangerous.
	   The Home Office spokesman said other options being considered by
the committee are ``better use of existing (probation-run) hostels
and trying to reassure the public about the level of surveillance
and security that surrounds'' those sentenced since 1991.
	   Some community groups have welcomed the idea of special housing.
	   But Dee Murray, spokeswoman for the charity Justice for
Children, said it ``is not good enough.''
	   ''Pedophiles should not be let out so soon in the first place,
there should be much stricter sentencing,'' she said.

Report: Third person nabbed for spreading riot rumors on Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from human rights group, grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A third person has been arrested
for allegedly using the Internet to spread rumors about rioting
that led to panic in the capital last week, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A special police team investigating how rumors were spread last
Friday arrested a 30-year-old bank employee Wednesday, the Star
newspaper said.
	   On Tuesday, a Malaysian man and woman, both in their 20s, were
arrested under the Internal Security Act after police enlisted
Internet service providers and technology experts to track their
on-line activities.
	   Investigators said they had discovered the origin of the
Internet messages that sparked panic shopping for food in many
parts of Kuala Lumpur, the Star said.
	   ``We don't really know how many messages are floating. However,
we believe there are only a few original ones,'' the daily quoted
Muhammed Awang Lah, vice president of service provider Mimos, as
saying.
	   The three suspects could be detained for up to 60 days without
trial and face a two-year prison term.
	   A Malaysian human rights group, SUARAM, condemned local
authorities for using the dreaded ISA to ``drive fear into the
hearts and minds of thinking citizens'' who use the Internet.
	   ``We urge that the ... individuals be allowed to have their case
heard in open court,'' Elizabeth Wong, coordinator for SUARAM, said
in a faxed statement. ``Otherwise, we will never know if they are
guilty or mere pawns detained without a single shred of evidence
and proof.''
	   Kuala Lumpur has been rife with rumors, spread via the Internet
and then by word of mouth, that Indonesians have been amassing
knives and machetes.
	   On Friday evening, word spread that Indonesian illegal
immigrants in a downtown neighborhood had begun to riot in protest
against an Aug. 15 deadline to deport foreigners who had not
applied to renew their work permits.
	   The panic subsided when police opened a hot line to answer
public concerns and after national radio and television broadcast
messages from officials.

Ukraine wants Russia to help complete two nuclear reactors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian premier Valery Pustovoitenko has
appealed to Russia to help build two new nuclear reactors that
Ukraine needs to close down the ill-fated Chernobyl nuclear power
plan, a news report said Thursday.
	   Pustovoitenko said he wrote a letter to his Russian counterpart,
Sergei Kiriyenko, asking him that Moscow allocate funds for the
construction in its 1999 state budget.
	   ``We are awaiting this assistance because we have set a goal of
finishing the construction in 1999,'' Pustovoitenko said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   The question also was discussed at talks in Kiev on Wednesday
between Ukrainian officials and a Russian delegation headed by
Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov.
	   Pustovoitenko said the sides agreed that Russia would provide
equipment and fuel for the two planned reactors at the Khmelnytsky
and Rivne plants.
	   Ukraine says it needs the reactors to compensate for energy that
would be lost when it closes down the Chernobyl plant, the site of
the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. Only one reactor
currently remains operational at Chernobyl.
	   The government and President Leonid Kuchma have pledged to close
Chernobyl by 2000, but officials said recently that the plant would
not be closed unless Ukraine gets international aid to build the
new reactors and provide social compensation to Chernobyl workers.
	   The government estimates the losses at about dlrs 1.2 billion,
and it has been trying to secure the aid from international donors.
The two planned reactors are about 85 percent ready, according to
nuclear officials.

Aug. 21, 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea said Thursday it may be
forced to take the ``undesirable option'' of unfreezing its nuclear
program unless the United States lifts economic sanctions against
it.
	   It was the latest in a series of threats by the communist nation
to reactivate a nuclear program frozen under an agreement with the
United States in 1994. The program was suspected of developing
atomic weapons.
	   An unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Pyongyang's decision hinged on a scheduled mid-August meeting in
New York between Charles Kartman, a U.S. ambassador-at-large, and
Vice North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Gye Kwan.
	   At issue, the spokesman told the North's official Korean Central
News Agency, is Washington's continued hostility and its failure to
promptly fulfill its part of the 1994 agreement.
	   ``We hope the two sides will settle the problems smoothly at the
upcoming ... talks lest we should take an undesirable option,'' the
spokesman was quoted as saying.
	   In return for shutting down a reactor capable of producing
weapons-grade plutonium, North Korea was promised two less
threatening nuclear reactors, an annual supply of 500,000 tons of
fuel oil and a gradual easing of U.S. economic sanctions.
	   ``In fact, all our nuclear activities have been frozen and the
safekeeping of spent fuel rods has reached a final stage ... but
the U.S. side has not taken substantial steps for lifting
sanctions,'' the spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, South Korean officials said the New York talks were
scheduled to begin Aug. 21.

Vajpayee gets a breather when ally defers decision to leave
</HEADLINE>
coalition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's shaky coalition got a breather
Thursday when a recalcitrant ally, who had threatened to pull down
the government, decided to hold off for now.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, leader of the All Indian Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazagham, met with her supporters to decide if they should
show displeasure with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee by
withdrawing support for his government.
	   After the meeting, party spokesman V.K. Ramamurthy told
journalists: ``The question of withdrawal of support does not arise
now,'' according to the Press Trust of India.
	   Jayalalitha is upset at the way Vajpayee's government handled a
30-year dispute over the sharing of water from the Cauvery River in
southern India.
	   The Cauvery originates in Karnataka state and flows into Tamil
Nadu. Each state blame the other for taking too much water from the
river, and Vajpayee recently persuaded the southern states to agree
to decide how to share the resource.
	   Jayalalitha, who leads the opposition in Tamil Nadu, called the
decision a sellout to her political foes in her state and had
announced she would pull out of the national government.

Two young World Cup players under the microscope this season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer's two young superstars, Michael
Owen and David Beckham, will be the center of attention as the
Premier League kicks off this season.
	   But the public interest in the two players is generated by
vastly different reasons.
	   England was struck by ``Owenmania'' following the 18-year-old
striker's dynamic performances at the World Cup in France. The
Liverpool forward is feted whereever he goes and has sponsors
lining up to use his name.
	   In stark contrast, Beckham became a villain and the target of a
hate campaign mounted by fans who blamed him for England's World
Cup exit. He has been forced into keeping a very low profile.
	   The pair were controversial omissions from Glenn Hoddle's
starting lineup early in the World Cup. But they dominated the
headlines once they were given their chances.
	   Owen was an instant hero, scoring one of the best goals of the
tournament and thrilling crowds with his pace and flair.
	   Beckham scored a brilliant goal on a free kick against Colombia
but then one moment of foolishness ruined everything.
	   The 23-year-old Manchester United midfielder, the highest paid
player in the Premier League last season, suddenly turned from hero
to villain when he was sent off in a crucial match.
	   Beckham was sent off for kicking an Argentine player during
England's second-round World Cup loss. His dismissal left England
one man short for 70 minutes of the match. England tied 2-2 after
extra time but was ousted in a penalty shootout.
	   Beckham, the golden-haired boy with the celebrity Spice Girl
fiance, Victoria Adams, was the obvious fall guy.
	   He rushed off to the United States when the team arrived back in
England and returned weeks later under a veil of secrecy.
	   He did apologize through the Sun newspaper but has not come
forward to speak publicly about his sending-off _ his side-stepping
tactics have sunk his popularity even further.
	   Beckham was hung in effigy outside a London pub, his family
received threats and fans promised to taunt him wherever he plays
this season.
	   He was jeered by Arsenal fans whenever he touched the ball
during last weekend's Charity Shield game against Manchester United
at Wembley.
	   Ted Beckham said his son could have been driven out of English
soccer due to the hate campaign.
	   ``He's made one mistake and been absolutely slaughtered for
it,'' Ted Beckham said just before David Beckham returned to
pre-season training with Manchester United. ``He's feeling very
low. He knows he has got to come back and face up to it some
time.''
	   On the other hand, Owen could have been forced out of England by
the sheer size of some of the offers coming from European teams.
But Liverpool had already secured his services.
	   The Merseyside club also wanted to ensure him for 60 million
pounds (dlrs 100 million) against illness or injury, but was still
having difficulty finding an insurance company to deal with.
	   Owen has been described as the brighest young star to emerge
from British soccer since George Best in the 1960s and has been
mobbed by fans whenever his team travels.
	   ``I must admit that I am already getting fed up with it all, but
it's the price you have to pay for the position you are in,'' he
said. ``People want to know about me...it's something I have got to
live with.
	   ``I know it will be like this now for probably the next 10
years, maybe longer. It's going to be like this for the rest of my
career and there's nothing I can do about it.''

Lost firefighting plane hurts Croatian battle against blazes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Efforts to contain wildfires ravaging
Croatia's southern coastline suffered a blow Thursday, when one of
the nation's few firefighting planes had to be abandoned at sea.
	   One of the country's three AT-802 Air Tractors ran out of fuel
while battling blazes on an island off the Adriatic resort town of
Dubrovnik. The pilot, Danijel Conjar, 42, was forced to eject
himself from the cockpit before the aircraft plunged into the sea.
	   The plane sank upon impact, about four kilometers (2.5 miles)
short of the closest airport. Conjar suffered scratches on his face
and arms, state-run HINA reported.
	   Dozens of homes have been razed and two people killed in more
than 200 fires that have burned out of control, sweeping the south
of the country in the past two weeks, the interior ministry said.
	   While authorities say the worst of the fires are largely under
control, several blazes continue to burn across Dalmatia,
especially on the island resort of Korcula, where flames were
spreading precariously close to urban dwellings.
	   More than 1,500 firemen from across the country have convened in
the south to combat the fires, which have so far destroyed roughly
2,700 hectares (acres) of forest and brush.
	   The loss of a plane was a significant setback for Croatia's
small fleet, that has only two Canadair firefighting aircraft and
three helicopters. The government was forced to solicit air support
from France, Italy and NATO forces stationed in neighboring Bosnia
to combat this season's fires.
	   On Wednesday, the interior ministry announced plans to beef up
firefighting equipment and public awareness.
	   Dalmatia in southern Croatia is a sparsely populated region with
small coastal towns separated by long stretches of dry land, dotted
with forest and brush growth. The region is highly susceptible to
fires during the summer, when temperatures soar and the population
swells with tourists, who are often careless.
	   Five German tourists suspected of setting off a fire on the
mid-Adriatic island of Zlarina were brought in for questioning on
Wednesday. According to eyewitnesses, they shot a rocket flare from
their speedboat onto the island, sparking the blaze.
	   If proven guilty, they face a hefty fine and deportation from
the country.
	   The blazes are often aggravated by gale-force winds that can
quickly whip a fire out of control and turn huge forests into
tinderboxes.

Russia accuses Pakistan of helping Taliban victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian diplomat on Thursday accused
Pakistan of sending its troops and combat aircraft to help the
Taliban movement crush its opponents in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban military success has become possible because of the
``active involvement of Pakistan's army units and air force,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said at a news conference.
	   Pakistan is sympathetic to the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic
movement that controls most of Afghanistan. Many countries have
said that Pakistan supplies weapons to the Taliban, though Pakistan
denies the charge.
	   On Wednesday, the Pakistani embassy in Moscow issued a statement
denying involvement in the latest developments.
	   Pastukhov also said that the government had already taken steps
to reinforce the Russian military deployed in the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan that borders Afghanistan.
	   ``In our own security interests, we will take further efforts to
strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border,'' Pastukhov said, according to
Russian news reports.
	   Russia has for years had 25,000 army troops and border guards in
Tajikistan, where they help prop up the hardline government facing
the mostly Islamic opposition.
	   Moscow is opposed to the Taliban because it fears that a radical
Islamic state in Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and
weapons into the former Soviet republics of Central Asia and
threaten its own stability.
	   Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, who now serves
as governor of the Krasnoyarsk region in central Siberia, lashed
out at the Russian government for failing to provide effective
support to the anti-Taliban alliance in the north.
	   ``The failure to take the necessary steps has led to the present
developments in Afghanistan. And the Taliban victory today would
mean Islamic extremism hitting Russia right below the belt,'' Lebed
said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``The situation is
extremely unpleasant.''
	   The New York Times, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported
last month that Russia had become a major weapons supplier to the
Afghan factions opposing the Taliban. Russian officials at the time
denied the accusations as they had in the past.
	   However, some Russian analysts said that Moscow was providing
covert assistance _ and that it was going to the very groups that
fought against the Soviet army when it occupied Afghanistan from
1979-89.
	   They specifically mentioned Afghan rebel leader Ahmed Shah
Massoud, who, ironically, was the most effective rebel leader in
the 1980s when he led resistance to the Soviet forces in
Afghanistan.
	   Lebed said that Moscow should have backed Massoud despite his
record of battling the Russians. ``I once fought against Massoud,
but in this situation we could have opposed the Taliban using his
military force,'' said Lebed, a retired paratroop general. ``Our
leadership lacked resolution to do that.''

South Korean group welcomes new U.N. report on Japan's sex slavery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A civic group on Thursday praised a
U.N. report holding Japan legally responsible for the sexual
enslavement of thousands of Asian women during World War II.
	   ``We welcome the new report. There was a similar report, but
this one points at Japan's legal obligations more clearly and
specifically,'' said Yang Mi-kang, a spokeswoman for the Korean
Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.
	   Kang demanded that Japan immediately admit its responsibility
and compensate the elderly survivors among those who were forced
into sexual slavery in the 1930s and 40s.
	   South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it had
no immediate comment.
	   In a 62-page report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva, U.N. special rapporteur Gay McDougall said Japan must
recognize its legal responsibility for ``systematic rape, sexual
slavery and slavery-like practices'' by its soldiers during World
War II.
	   ``The Japanese government remains liable for grave violations of
human rights and humanitarian law, violations that amount in their
totality to crime against humanity,'' the report said.
	   A copy of the report was obtained from the South Korean Foreign
Ministry.
	   McDougall, a U.S. lawyer, said in her report that the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights should work with Japanese officials
for the prosecution in Japan of those responsible for establishing
what the Japanese euphemistically called ``comfort women'' camps
for their front-line soldiers.
	   She also asked Japan to set up an official fund to compensate
victims, because the private Asia Women's Fund, set up in 1995,
does not satisfy the responsibility of the Japanese government.
	   The Asian Women's Fund, backed by the Japanese government,
operates with private donations. The fund's offer of dlrs 17,000 to
each surviving victim was rejected by most South Koreans, who
demanded that any compensation come directly from the Japanese
government.
	   McDougall's report also said the Japanese government should be
required to submit a report to the U.N. secretary-general at least
twice a year detailing progress in its efforts to identify and
compensate victims and bring perpetrators to justice.
	   ``The failure to settle the claims more than half a century
after the cessation of hostilities is a testament to the degree to
which the lives of women continue to be undervalued,'' the report
said.
	   In 1996, Radhika Coomaraswamy, a U.N. special investigator,
urged the Japanese government to pay damages and apologize to
former sex slaves in the first major U.N. condemnation of Japan for
World War II atrocities.
	   ``The first report made it clear that the Japanese government
was morally and legally responsible for the crime. This report by
McDougall is more advanced because it specifies what actions should
be taken,'' Yang said.
	   Historians estimate as many as 200,000 women from Korea and
other Asian nations were taken to Japanese army brothels during
World War II. Some 150 South Koreans are registered as former sex
slaves.
	   Japan refuses to compensate the women with government funds,
saying that all reparation claims were settled under a 1965
normalization treaty with Seoul.
	   South Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.

Pressure mounts for release of foreign activists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede BANGKOK &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with activists grouped together
in police guest house, new consular visits, Malaysia foreign
minister unsympathetic, `peace and love' quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime gathered 18
detained foreign democracy activists in a single police facility
Thursday and allowed new visits by diplomats as pressure mounted
for their quick release.
	   U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weidemann and other officials
visited six Americans among the detainees, the second meeting
allowed since the activists were apprehended Sunday passing out
anti-government leaflets.
	   A U.S. congressman was on his way to the region and the U.S.
Embassy has pressed for the prompt release of the Americans, whose
detained colleagues include three Indonesians, three Malaysians,
three Thais, two Philippines citizens and an Australian.
	   But Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was less
sympathetic. The detained Malaysians belong to a group that has
often criticized the Malaysian government for lack of democracy.
	   ``Frankly, it's difficult to sympathize with our people who go
to other countries and create trouble or breach the law, especially
if they knowingly do it and are aware that they may face
problems,''' Abdullah Badawi said.
	   The activists had been held at two or three separate facilities
since Sunday. Myanmar authorities have been interrogating them, but
have not decided yet whether to bring charges and try them.
	   Myanmar's government had said that some of the detainees were
not cooperating, thus prolonging their stay, but a spokesman said
Thursday in a faxed statement to The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, that ``only a very few are uncooperative.''
	   ``All 18 of them are now put up together at the police guest
house and their respective embassies are being granted access as
well,'' the spokesman said.
	   In Bangkok, 10 leading democracy activists, lawyers and
academics requested visas to enter Myanmar and visit the Thais,
while the brother of the detained Australian also planned to fly to
the region with the goal of securing the release of his sister.
	   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, whose constituent Michele Keegan,
19, of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, is among the detainees, was
flying to Bangkok but it was unclear if he would get a Myanmar
visa.
	   Smith, a Republican, chairs the House International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee.
	   In Duluth, Georgia, the mother of detainee Nisha Marie Anand, a
university student, said her daughter was ``very much into peace
and love.''
	   The government accuses the activists of attempting to incite
unrest. The leafleting followed the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule that was eventually
crushed by troops, causing the deaths of an estimated 3,000 people.
	   The leaflets urged people to remember the anniversary and not
give up. It came two weeks before an Aug. 21 deadline set by the
country's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, for the government
to finally convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The military, which has ruled the country since 1962, refused to
honor the result and the parliament has never met.

Fergie to host TV chat show

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sky confirms deal, changes overline to suit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her British television debut, the Duchess of
York will host her own talk show on Sky TV, the station said
Thursday.
	   Starting Oct. 5, the former Sarah Ferguson, or ''Fergie,'' will
present 10 one-hour programs on Sky One provisionally entitled
''Surviving Life,'' Sky said.
	   The 50,000 pounds (dlrs 80,000) she earns will go to her
favorite charities, it said.
	   ''We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with Sarah
and for Sky One to be the home of her British television debut,''
said Elisabeth Murdoch, general manager of broadcasting at Sky.
	   ''Having been through so much in her own life, Sarah has a
unique ability to connect with other people by sharing
experiences.''
	   Recording begins in September and the duchess will be dealing
with different topics in each show in front of a small studio
audience.
	   Fergie, who was divorced from Prince Andrew in 1996, has
frequently appeared in TV commercials in the United States and on
chat shows.
	   In a statement, the duchess said her show ''will be about people
and the real problems that they face in society today.''
	   ''This is a new venture for me and I am greatly looking forward
to the challenge,'' she said.
	   Hailed at the time of her marriage as a breath of fresh air for
the royal family, Fergie's exuberant nature and love of luxury soon
won her criticism. As her marriage crumbled, Britain's tabloid
newspapers published pictures of her dallying with other men.
	   Since her divorce, she has presented herself as a hard-working
single mother to her two daughters Beatrice, 10, and Eugenie, 8.
	   To help pay off a massive overdraft, she made commercials,
became a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers and has recently started
interviewing celebrities for Hello!, a European weekly that
features the lives of the stars.

Taliban's policy on aid groups unchanged despite accord with U.N.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ International aid groups must move
their operations to war-ravaged dormitories in Kabul after all, the
Taliban religious militia said Thursday. The decision came as a
setback to an apparent compromise reached earlier with the United
Nations.
	   A U.N. negotiator had said Wednesday that the issue of where the
aid groups should be based was still open for discussion. The
disagreement had triggered Taliban's expulsion last month of most
foreign aid workers from Afghanistan.
	   ``There has been no change in our policy towards foreign aid
groups,'' Qari Din Mohammad, the Taliban planning minister, said
Thursday.
	   A U.N. official had no immediate comment.
	   Taliban officials expelled about 200 aid workers and 38 agencies
on July 20, after the foreigners refused to move their homes and
offices to a university campus heavily damaged in Afghanistan's
long civil war. Aid workers said the dormitories were unsafe and
uninhabitable.
	   The dispute capped a long period of friction between aid groups
and Kabul's Taliban rulers.
	   Mohammad spoke one day after the United Nations said aid groups
could resume operations in their old offices while negotiating with
the Taliban about whether they had to move to the dilapidated
dormitories.
	   But on Thursday, the Taliban insisted that it had not modified
its position and ordered the groups to move to the buildings and
pay to renovate them.
	   Mohammad said the aid groups could work in other places until
the dormitories were inhabitable, adding that they should apologize
for stopping their work in Kabul in the meantime.
	   The United Nations was not among the agencies the Taliban
expelled from the country.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since their forces captured Kabul in 1996, barring girls from
school and confining most women to their homes.
	   International aid groups say the Taliban rules hamper their
efforts to provide education and other services, while the Taliban
accuse the groups of flouting the country's laws and traditions.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It's a painful task for a president: welcoming
home the bodies of Americans killed overseas.
	   President Bill Clinton, who in six years as head of the nation
has presided over several solemn ceremonies for American victims of
terrorism abroad and at home, was doing so again Thursday. He was
meeting an Air Force plane carrying the remains of 10 of 12
Americans killed last week in the bombing of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   ``It's obviously an event that I think weighs heavily on him,
but he believes it's important for him in his role as president to
speak for the country,'' said Joe Lockhart, a presidential
spokesman.
	   The flag-draped coffins were arriving Thursday about 1215 GMT at
Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, just outside Washington. The body
of an 11th victim, Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds,
40, was flown to Florida on Wednesday at her family's request.
Another American, Jean Dalizu, 60, will be buried in Kenya, her
adopted homeland where she married.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who like the president
has vowed to bring to justice those responsible for the twin
terrorist attacks last Friday, accompanied the diplomats,
government workers and members of the military who were killed
almost half a world away.
	   Albright on Wednesday was in Germany to visit nine Americans who
were injured in the blasts at embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
and Nairobi, Kenya. Besides the 12 Americans and more than 250
Africans killed, 5,000 people were injured, mostly in the Kenyan
capital.
	   Those killed included Consul General Julian Bartley, 55 and his
20-year-old son, Jay, Marine Sgt. Jesse Aliganga, 21, Army Sgt.
Kenneth Hobson II, 27, Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, Prabhi Kavaler, 45,
who was born in Amritsar, India, Arlene Kirk, 50, Louise Martin,
45, Michelle O'Connor, 36, and Tom Shah, 38.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 9 grafs with Shah arriving, quotes in last 2
grafs from U.N. inspector in Baghdad. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed by a day a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's ruling Baath party,
said in a front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts
to raising doubts and accusations that are not based on any
facts.''
	   It added: ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the
committee will come up with others, and it will turn into a game
with no end.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   But the New York Times on Thursday said that the long-term
monitoring program also was being impeded because Iraq is not
allowing U.N. inspectors to act on any violations their equipment
detect. And, the Times said, Iraq has suspended its participation
in technical talks aimed at uncovering the full history of Iraq's
weapons development.
	   Asked about the New York Times report, Maj. Gen. Nils Carlstrom,
who oversees the U.N. inspection program in Baghdad, said long-term
monitoring activities were going on normally.
	   ``I don't know what they are talking about,'' he said.

Plague of caterpillars in northern Guatemala follows drought and
</HEADLINE>
fires &QL; 
 &UR; AP photos NY107,109 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA WIDES &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CENTRAL CAMPESINO, Guatemala (AP) _ First came the drought. Then
came the fires. Now a plague of caterpillars is finishing off much
of the corn crop that survived a disastrous year in Guatemala's
northern rainforest.
	   ``There are families that eat some days and other days do not,''
said Nery Mendoza, a farmer in the village of Central Campesino,
300 miles (500 kilometers) north of Guatemala City.
	   The caterpillar, spodophthera frugiperda, eats the entire corn
plant: stalks, leaves and ears. Since May, it has destroyed 40
percent of the crops in eastern Peten state.
	   There is little relief in sight.
	   About 20 communities have requested government assistance. Peten
state is nearly dlrs 100,000 in debt from the fires, according to
state Governor Efrain Oliva. And Agriculture Ministry spokesman
Israel Martinez said the federal government has no funds available.
	   ``The government does not have a program for this situation. We
are looking for help,'' Oliva said.
	   The three disasters in Peten are related: The drought began in
the fall, destroying most of the corn planted in September. Dry
vegetation made for ripe fire conditions, and wildfires spread
across the region in May, charring more than 400,000 acres (160,000
hectares).
	   The caterpillars have been thriving since the fires, which
destroyed many of their natural predators, said biologist Claudio
Mendez of the development aid group Conservation International.
	   The caterpillar, which is native to the area, eats corn and lays
its eggs on corn sprouts, then turns into a giant black moth.
	   ``In some of the fields where the caterpillar came through, it
left the ground just bare,'' said farmer Arcadio Garcia, surveying
broken, half-eaten corn leaves. ``Last week a black cloud of moths
covered everything.''
	   The caterpillar also devours grass, causing cattle ranchers
significant losses.
	   Corn is the main staple of rural Guatemalans' diet, and for the
farmers of the Peten it also provides what is usually their only
source of cash. At least once a harvest, Peten farmers take sacks
filled with corn on the 12-hour bus ride to the capital, where they
sell it to buy clothes and other basic supplies for their families.
	   Mendez said some farmers are using highly toxic and illegal
pesticides to combat the caterpillar. But Mendoza, the farmer,
noted that many can't afford to buy pesticides because of their
losses from the drought.
	   The plague has hit a region that is poor in the best of times,
where farmhand jobs _ always hard to come by _ pay only the minimum
wage of of 20 quetzales (dlrs 3.17) a day.
	   The crop losses have driven corn prices to triple in Peten in
the last month. That makes it even harder for farmers accustomed to
growing their own corn to buy enough to feed their families _ and
makes buying other things impossible.

Indonesian Cabinet minister is afraid to talk to media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior Indonesian official said
Thursday that new press freedoms had made some Cabinet ministers
wary about talking to the media.
	   Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid said the ministers worry
that their statements could be misquoted or manipulated.
	   ``I've become frightened and worried about whether my statements
are understood and written as they are, without being changed by
the press,'' Syarwan said. ``My other fellow Cabinet ministers are
also frightened to talk to the press.''
	   He made the remarks at police headquarters after filing a
lawsuit against a number of media organizations. Police said at
least two weekly tabloids, Detak and Sinar, as well as the daily
newspaper Merdeka, were sued.
	   Syarwan said the media ignored the presumption of innocence in
reporting that he was allegedly involved in a 1996 raid on the
headquarters of opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   At least five people were killed and more than a dozen reported
missing in riots that broke out after the raid.
	   Syarwan, who is an army lieutenant general, was the military's
chief of staff for social and political affairs at the time. He has
denied involvement in the raid.
	   ``It should be the courts, instead of the press, that rule
whether anyone is wrong or not,'' he said.
	   Newspaper, magazines and television stations have enjoyed new
freedom after years of censorship under former President Suharto,
who resigned in May. New President B.J. Habibie has said media
freedom is crucial to democratic reform.

Farmers block road to protest grain policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Farmers on Thursday removed a dozen
tractors and farming machines they used to block a major Polish
road for 24 hours to demand that the government increase purchases
of Polish grain.
	   The protesters in Pyrzyce, a town on the road from the Baltic
port of Szczecin in the north to Warsaw, 520 kilometers (320 miles)
to the southeast, want their grain purchased under a
government-sponsored program that began Aug. 6.
	   But the local company that would handle such a purchase, Elstar,
says it can buy grain at lower prices on the free market than the
government prices of dlrs 150 per ton of wheat and dlrs 106 per ton
of rye.
	   After the farmers began their protest Wednesday, the
government's Agency for Agricultural Market said it was looking for
another local company to handle the purchase.
	   Police opened detours along local roads to help drivers avoid
the blockade.
	   Last week, farmers blocked 20 roads and some city halls across
the country to protest foreign grain imports and demand government
intervention. The government then started its previously announced
grain purchase program and has bought 159,000 tons the first week,
according to news reports.
	   Polish agriculture remains hobbled by small, poorly equipped
farms unable to compete with larger, more modern farms in Western
Europe. Calls for reforms to consolidate farms and make them more
efficient in preparation for Poland's bid to join the European
Union have been resisted by farmers, who fear losing control of
their land and having to work for others.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock prices were mixed Thursday after a
rebound on Wall Street, but the prevailing mood remained decidedly
sour because of weakness in Japan and a large collection of local
troubles. Tokyo's Nikkei index scratched out a tiny gain, finishing
3.05 points higher at 15,382.02, after eight straight days of
losses. The threat of Central Bank intervention initially kept the
dollar in check, but the fears receded and the dollar advanced
strongly in late trading to break through 147 yen. Hong Kong's
volatile Hang Seng index, already at a five-year low, fell another
2.9 percent, closing at 6,660.42. The Hang Seng is down 16 percent
this month. As it has for the last week, the Hong Kong index
closely followed the fortunes of banking giant HSBC Holdings, whose
stock was declining again Thursday. HSBC, which accounts for about
30 percent of the index, fell 3.8 percent Thursday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As concern grew over the stability of the Russian
ruble, the Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency
trading by commercial banks. Frightened bankers temporarily halted
their foreign exchange trading. Trading also was halted on Russia's
main stock exchange after the first 40 minutes of trading because
the main index had dropped more than 10 percent. The exchange
reopened 35 minutes later. The new banking rules, adopted Wednesday
night, were not considered very significant, but the fact that the
Central Bank felt the need to take new measures contributed to a
climate of foreboding in the Russian markets. Concern is growing
that Russia will devalue the ruble despite an influx of cash from
the International Monetary Fund. The IMF loan was intended to
bolster the beleaguered currency, which has been under siege since
the Russian economy began to backslide earlier this year.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Turmoil within the ruling coalition
pushed the Indian rupee to a record low, prompting the central bank
to pump dlrs 100 million into the foreign currency market to try to
stem the slide. The rupee hit an all time low of 43.35 to the
dollar on Wednesday before the bank's intervention steadied the
market. The rupee closed at 43, down from 42.92 at the opening of
trading. The depreciation followed massive dollar purchases by
corporations worried over threats by a powerful regional ally to
withdraw from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government.
Talks to end the crisis ended inconclusively late Wednesday. The
rupee has fallen steadily since India conducted underground nuclear
tests in May and incurred international sanctions. Credit rating
agencies lowered India's credit rating, affecting its borrowing
capacity and growth rate. (INDIA-RUPEE)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Stressing that the government has no plans to
make the Singapore dollar freely available on the global market,
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Thursday the country
would ease some restrictions for overseas use of the currency, even
by foreigners. ``As a small and open economy, we cannot afford to
have our currency subject to manipulation or speculation,'' said
Lee, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore,
the country's de facto central bank. He said there was no plan in
the foreseeable future to make the Singapore dollar an
international currency. The most important change announced by Lee
is that foreign companies will be able to issue Singapore
dollar-denominated stocks and bonds more easily. Also, companies
that are partly owned by foreigners now can borrow more Singapore
dollars for overseas projects, if they convert the loan to a
foreign currency and if the project is approved by Singapore's
Ministry of Trade and Industry or the Economic Development Board.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia expressed concern
Thursday that Washington's assessment of threats to U.S. interests
in the Southeast Asian nation could scare away foreign investors.
The U.S. statement could be misinterpreted by foreign investors,
tourists, and overseas sports enthusiasts planning to travel to the
Commonwealth Games next month, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was
quoted as saying by Bernama news agency. Operations at the U.S.
Embassy came to a halt Monday after the State Department ordered
missions in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen closed for fear of terrorist
attacks. ``This could include attacks on buildings,'' the
department said in a statement. On Wednesday, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad also protested the U.S. view that its embassy in
Kuala Lumpur could be attacked by terrorists. (MALAYSIA-US)

category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. and Kenyan investigators said
Thursday they are interrogating ``about five people'' in connection
with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and are making some
progress in identifying the bomb vehicle. At their first news
conference since last Friday's embassy bombing, top investigators
from both countries pledged to cooperate until the bombers are
tracked down. Deputy Police Commissioner Peter Mbuvi, of Kenya's
Criminal Investigation Department, said Kenyan-American teams were
questioning a number of people in Nairobi whose detentions were
announced Wednesday night. A U.S. law enforcement source in
Washington said two of those detained in Kenya were considered
suspects. They were from a country other than Kenya, but their
nationalities could not be determined immediately, the source said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations

Council will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from
the country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The second to last crew of the
Russian space station Mir blasted off Thursday from the former
Soviet cosmodrome in this Central Asian nation. The Soyuz TM-28
ship was launched as scheduled at 1:43 p.m. (0943 GMT) and is
expected to dock with the station on Saturday. It carries a
three-man crew consisting of former presidential adviser Yuri
Baturin, flight commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer Gennady
Padalka. Like other state organizations, the Russian space agency
has had cash problems that were so severe that earlier this summer
officials were even talking about abandoning the Mir after the
current crew of Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin returns in
August. The government has been slow to pay the dlrs 600 million it
owed for Mir's operations last year, forcing the state-controlled
Energiya company to turn to commercial credits to finance
Thursday's launch. (RUSSIA-MIR)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party expressed fears for her safety after her van was moved to a
small wooden bridge Thursday, the second day of her latest roadside
challenge to the military government. The party urged the
government to allow Suu Kyi, stopped Wednesday at a checkpoint 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital, to proceed to the
western city of Bassein to meet supporters. The van was presumably
moved to clear traffic, which was backed up for kilometers (miles)
Wednesday. The bridge, built for ox-carts, held Suu Kyi's smaller
car during her six-day standoff at the same checkpoint two weeks
ago. A government spokesman said in a faxed statement to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, that Suu Kyi had not spoken
to anyone and that all the windows were rolled up. (MYANMAR)
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Adventurer Steve Fossett's quest to fly a
balloon nonstop around the world was in danger of becoming stalled
by calm weather. Fossett had to drop his hot-air-and-helium balloon
to a lower altitude, while his ground crew worked on a solution to
the problem. The Chicago millionaire and his Solo Spirit balloon
were about 2,400 miles (3,862 kilometers) off the coast of
Australia early Thursday, flying east over the Indian Ocean at 60
mph (97 kph), according to his control center at Washington
University in St. Louis. He had traveled 8,700 miles (14,000
kilometers) from his starting point in Argentina on his fourth
attempt to circle the globe. Fossett's control center said he was
on track toward Australia but might be in danger of getting caught
in a high-pressure zone. (US-BALLOON QUEST)

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait is sending food and medicine to help the
victims of the twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, Al-Watan daily reported Thursday.
	   Kuwaiti air force planes will deliver the goods, the paper said.
It did not give details on the size of the donation, which was
ordered by Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
	   Volunteers from the Kuwait Red Crescent Society will accompany
the material to help with distribution in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, where the explosions killed at least 250 people and injured
some 5,000, the paper said.
	   In nearby Bahrain, the U.S. Navy on Thursday sent 2,250
kilograms (5,000 pounds) of medical supplies and equipment to Kenya
to help victims of the bombing.
	   A C-130 Hercules transport aircraft left Bahrain with medical
supplies, including intravenous fluids, bandages and syringes, said
Lt. Brenda Malone, spokeswoman for the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.
	   The 5th Fleet earlier sent about 60 people, most of them
Marines, to assist in security and humanitarian activities in
Kenya.

Thai Central Bank prepares for possible bank runs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank has prepared a
large amount of cash in case of a run on commercial banks Friday
after the government announces a financial reform package, a senior
bank official said.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Monday that Thailand
will lose some of its weaker banks, possibly through mergers with
stronger institutions, but refused to say if any would be closed
outright.
	   So far, the Bank of Thailand has received no report of any
unusual withdrawals at any of the banks, deputy governor Kitti
Patpongpibul told reporters Thursday.
	   Thailand's Cabinet is due to decide Friday on reforms aimed at
easing the crisis of the country's debt-laden banking system.
	   An effective plan is considered essential for reviving the
recession-bound economy.
	   Share prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand ended slightly
lower in moderate trading Thursday ahead of the expected banking
announcement.
	   Dealers said investors expect the central bank may write down
capital of some weak banks as it did with four other commercial
banks earlier this year. They said investors were buying into banks
with adequate capital that are unlikely to be adversely affected by
Friday's announcement.
	   A dealer at Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said some
investors would rather wait to buy shares of strong financial
institutions Friday when market sentiment is expected to be
depressed.
	   Central bank deputy governor Kitti said the Financial
Institutions Development Fund, the country's bank rescue fund,
would be ready to ``inject liquidity'' into the system if
commercial banks have problems with their cash flow.
	   ``The FIDF has prepared liquidity several times larger than the
money usually circulated daily in commercial banks,'' he said.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Many analysts now expect the government to
step in.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout initiated after Thailand's financial
system all but collapsed in mid-1997.

	   Police refused to release the names of the victims.
	   Authorities said they had received several distress calls from

Torrential rains threatening populous southern coastal regions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death tolls in grafs 1-2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Flood warnings were issued for
populous southern coastal regions Thursday as a storm front that
left 17 people dead in central South Korea drifted southward.
	   The latest deaths brought to 198 the number killed in eight days
of floods and mudslides triggered by torrential rains in the
central and northern parts of the nation.
	   Property damage has been estimated at up to dlrs 2 billion.
	   A week earlier, flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the
southern tip of the Korean Peninsula killed 67 campers and left 29
missing.
	   As the frontal system moved south Wednesday, storms flooded
Boun, Sangju and three other counties in central South Korea. More
than 5,000 homes there were inundated, forcing 18,000 people,
mostly farmers, to run to higher ground, officials said.
	   On Thursday, the rains threatened the southern coastal regions,
including Pusan, the nation's second largest city. Weather reports
predicted up to 13 centimeters (5.2 inches) of rain in the region.
	   A flood warning was issued for millions of people living along
the rapidly rising Nakdong River, which flows through the
southeastern corner of the peninsula.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Shah arriving, quotes from U.N. inspector in
Baghdad. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq renewed allegations Thursday that it
is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he brought a message
from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed a day after a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, published by Saddam's ruling Baath party, said in a
front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts to raising
doubts and accusations that are not based on any facts.''
	   It added: ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the
committee will come up with others, and it will turn into a game
with no end.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   But the New York Times on Thursday said that the long-term
monitoring program also was being impeded because Iraq is not
allowing U.N. inspectors to act on any violations their equipment
detect. Also, Iraq has suspended its participation in technical
talks aimed at uncovering the full history of Iraq's weapons
development, it said.
	   Asked about the New York Times report, Maj. Gen. Nils Carlstrom,
who oversees the U.N. inspection program in Baghdad, said long-term
monitoring activities were going on normally.
	   ``I don't know what they are talking about,'' he said.

Fierce fighting in along Jaffna highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Army troops attacked rebel positions
on the outskirts of a major town in northern Sri Lanka, launching a
fierce battle that left 136 dead, mostly rebels, a military
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The casualties from Wednesday's fighting were among the heaviest
in Kilinochchi since the rebels were driven from the town in June
1996. Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon said 110 guerrillas were killed,
while government casualties were 26 dead and 22 wounded.
	   Tennekoon declined to give details of the battle, saying it
would compromise military strategy. But he said the soldiers went
on an offensive against rebel bunkers and positions pinpointed by
intelligence information.
	   ``Our forces went for the massive attack and we succeeded,'' he
said. The guerrilla casualty toll was gleaned from rebel radio and
reports from ground troops, he said.
	   Kilinochchi, about 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of Colombo,
is near the northern end of a highway that the government has been
trying to capture for the past year to open an overland supply line
to the Jaffna Peninsula on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island.
	   A 27-kilometer (17-mile) stretch of the highway south of
Kilinochchi is under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
	   Another battle took place Wednesday near the town of Mankulam,
farther south on the highway, where five rebels were killed,
Tennekoon said in a weekly military briefing.
	   Jaffna City is the former rebel stronghold captured by the army
two years ago. Since then, its half million residents have had to
rely on air and sea deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   Rebels among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils have waged a war
against the government for 15 years, demanding a separate homeland.
The rebels accuse the Sinhalese majority of oppressing the Tamil
minority.

Philippine stocks end mixed; index at new low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed
Thursday as some investors, mostly foreigners, cashed in on gains
made early in the session, while others hunted for bargains among
oversold issues, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, was dragged down against the U.S. dollar by
a renewed weakness in the Japanese yen, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index slipped 4.01
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,303.29, a fresh 5 1/2-year low.
Gainers, however, outnumbered decliners 41 to 37, while 47 issues
were unchanged.
	   The index had fallen 65.89 points, or 4.8 percent, Wednesday.
	   With Thursday's decline, the index has fallen a total of 221.46
points over the past six sessions, bringing it close to its
previous low of 1,295 points in December 1992.
	   Trading Thursday started on an upbeat note, with the main index
gaining as much as 31.19 points on overnight gains on Wall Street
and relatively stable currency markets. However, investors who
bought shares at bargain levels quickly cashed in on gains.
	   ``The early market rebound was expected after the losses in past
sessions, but it was artificial in nature since the volume of
trades when the rally took place was thin,'' said Astro del
Castillo, analyst for A and A Securities Inc.
	   With the overall economic picture in the Philippines and in the
region still bleak, investors were too edgy to hold on to Manila
shares for long, he said.
	   A few gritty players, however, found some stocks too cheap to
resist.
	   Del Castillo said the absence of comforting news from the
government inaugurated on June 30 is fueling investors' desire to
unload Manila stocks.
	   ``It has been said that the Philippines will be the first to
rebound in the event Asian economies start to recover. But this was
anchored on the ability of the new administration to sustain the
reforms instituted by former President Fidel Ramos,'' del Castillo
said.
	   Traders said investors are concerned over conflicting signals
from the government, such as in interest rates. The Bureau of
Treasury on Monday rejected all bids during its weekly treasury
bill auction to keep interest rates down. That same day, the
central bank raised its key overnight rates to shield the peso from
speculative attacks that swamped regional currencies early this
week.
	   Despite the higher overnight interest rates, the peso weakened
against the dollar Thursday as the Japanese yen lost ground.
	   The dollar averaged 43.456 pesos for the day, up from
Wednesday's 43.393 pesos. The dollar was last traded at 43.210
pesos, its low for the day.
	   Although commercial dollar requirements were minimal, most banks
actively purchased dollars, preferring to remain long on the U.S.
currency in case the yen falls lower.
	   But the peso remained relatively stable compared to recent days,
partly because of the central bank's decision to keep its overnight
borrowing rate high at 18 percent.
	   The peso fell to a seven-month low of 44.790 pesos to the dollar
on Monday on concerns over the yen's weakness and fears of a
possible devaluation of the Chinese yuan.

Egyptian lawyer says he warned U.S. of possible attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A lawyer who formerly defended Egyptian
extremists said Thursday that he warned American diplomats earlier
this year of ``grave consequences'' if the United States continued
its hostile policies towards Islamic activists.
	   Montasser el-Zayat told The Associated Press that he met the
American diplomats last March in his office in Cairo, where he
cautioned them that American policy, which is ``hostile to Arabs
and Muslims ... will have grave consequences.''
	   More than 250 people were killed and some 5,000 injured on
Friday in bombings against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   ``I warned them that it's difficult for America to make fighting
Islam and animosity to Islamists its priority without this leading
to hatred and violence,'' said El-Zayat, whose warning was revealed
Thursday in an article in the London-headquartered Al-Hayat daily.
	   Asked if his warnings were based on specific threats, el-Zayat
said ``No, they were general.''
	   El-Zayat announced last January that he would no longer defend
Muslim extremists in cases brought by the Egyptian government. This
decision followed his failed attempt to negotiate a truce between
the government and Egypt's main militant group, al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group.

Students begin outlawed festival in South Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of riot police were deployed
in Seoul Thursday against militant students planning to march to
the border for a rally with their North Korean counterparts.
	   About 2,000 students gathered at a Seoul campus for a three-day
pro-unification festival that will culminate in the march on
Saturday, the 53rd anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese
colonial rule in 1945.
	   Communist North Korea has invited South Korean students to the
border rally, an annual event in recent years. But as in the past,
South Korea has outlawed any attempts by students to attend.
	   In a rally at Seoul National University, students sang songs and
shouted slogans demanding the abolition of South Korea's draconian
national security laws and the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. soldiers
from South Korea _ demands the government views as pro-communist
and seditious.
	   The rally was organized by Hanchongryon, South Korea's largest
student activist group.
	   In the 1980s and early '90s, attempts by students to march to
the border resulted in massive street clashes. But Hanchongryon has
lost most of its members in recent years and the number of students
joining the march has declined sharply.
	   However, as it has also done in the past, the student group
defied a government ban and sent two representatives to Pyongyang
this year to join in North Korea's Independence Day celebrations.
They arrived last week.
	   Soon after its liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end
of World War II, the peninsula was divided into communist North
Korea and capitalist South Korea.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.
	   Korean Independence Day is one of the few holidays celebrated by
both Koreas.

Most stock markets down; long-term gloom dominates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to indicate most markets ended down; UPDATES thruout
with closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock prices fell Thursday despite a
rebound on Wall Street, and the prevailing mood was sour because of
weakness in Japan and a large collection of local troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index scratched out a tiny gain, finishing 3.05
points higher at 15,382.02, after eight straight days of losses.
	   The threat of Central Bank intervention initially kept the
dollar in check, but the fears receded and the dollar advanced
strongly in late trading.
	   The dollar bought 146.56 yen in late afternoon, up 0.64 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
146.44 yen overnight. It traded as high as 147.16 yen and as low as
145.86 yen.
	   Japan's weakness left the entire region gloomy. Even where stock
prices and currencies rebounded, there was no confidence that
things were turning for the better.
	   Hong Kong's volatile Hang Seng index, already at a five-year
low, fell another 2.9 percent, closing at 6,660.42. The Hang Seng
is down 16 percent this month.
	   As it has for the last week, the Hong Kong index closely
followed the fortunes of banking giant HSBC Holdings, whose stock
was declining again. HSBC, which accounts for about 30 percent of
the index, fell 3.8 percent Thursday.
	   HSBC was one of several major Hong Kong corporations that
reported poor first-half earnings last week, sending the market
steeply lower.
	   Analysts, echoing comments Wednesday by Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, blamed the fall in the Hong Kong market on the
weakness of the yen. Japan's economic troubles are causing
investors to worry that Hong Kong will be unable to keep its direct
link to the U.S. dollar, and that China will be forced to devalue
its yuan currency.
	   Both Chinese and Hong Kong officials insist that won't happen.
	   Japan's weakness unsettled markets throughout the region, which
also face new worries about the U.S. economy. Asian economies that
long have focused on exports need a strong U.S. market to help them
out of their troubles. But volatility on Wall Street in the past
week has raised questions whether a long period of strong growth is
coming to a close.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index dropped 3
percent to 965.74, a new 10-year low. One trader predicted it would
reach 900 by the end of the month unless the Japanese government
intervened in markets to support the yen.
	   Malaysia's Composite Index was down 4.5 percent at 326.73
points. Analysts cited local economic weakness and uncertainty over
whether Japan will turn around economically anytime soon.
	   In the Philippines, the key Philippine Stock Exchange Index
closed 0.3 percent down at 1,303.29, a fresh 5 1/2-year low. It had
lost about 14 percent of its value in the five previous sessions.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices ended slightly lower in moderate
trading ahead of the announcement of a government plan to fix the
battered Thai banking sector. The key index fell 3.27 points to
230.87.
	   SEOUL: South Korean shares ended mixed on lingering worries over
the weakened yen, with the key index falling 2.34 points to 303.01.
	   TAIPEI: The main index rebounded 0.15 percent to 7,362.55
points, but traders said the rebound would be limited by Japan's
weakness and worries about first-half earnings reports that are due
out by the end of August.
	   WELLINGTON: Local political uncertainty over the future of the
coalition government and a rise in short-term interest rates forced
the New Zealand market to its lowest closing level in more than 3
1/2 years. The key index closed at 1,913.72, down 38.67 points.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower for the seventh
consecutive day on the Hong Kong market's fall and uncertainty
surrounding the impact of the government's new tax package, dealers
said. The key index closed at 2,541.2, down 9.8 points.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply lower because of the
uncertain Indonesian political situation and declines in other
regional markets. The JSX composite index fell 5.694 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 402.941.

Azerbaijan's President Aliev cleared to seek re-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The Central Election Commission has
officially registered President Geidar Aliev's re-election bid,
which appears likely to go forward without any real opposition.
	   The commission on Wednesday also registered two more of the nine
people seeking to run in the Oct. 11 presidential election.
However, all candidates support the policies of Aliev's government.
	   The two are Etibar Mamedov, leader of the National Independence
Party, and Nizami Suleimanov, head of the Independent Azerbaijan
Party.
	   The opposition has boycotted the elections so far, saying the
situation in the country was undemocratic and the election would
likely be unfair.
	   The National Front and the Musavat Party plan rallies around the
country on Saturday to protest preparations for the elections.
	   Aliev has recently been trying to improve his democratic
credentials and last week issued a decree abolishing most forms of
censorship in the oil-rich former Soviet republic of 7 million
people on the Caspian Sea.
	   Aliev was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss. He came
to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.

Hindu activists battle police in anti-Pakistan protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police with batons and water cannons
battled stone-throwing Hindu activists Thursday outside the
Pakistan embassy where the activists accused Pakistan of
involvement in a series of massacres in the disputed territory of
Kashmir.
	   Demonstrators tried to break through a police cordon, but were
forced back by tear gas and powerful streams from water cannons.
Several policemen were hurt by stones.
	   Some 4,000 members of the Banjrang Dal and World Hindu Council
gathered outside the walls of the Pakistan High Commission. Many
shouted ``Death to Pakistan,'' and some urged India to send its
troops across the border to destroy what is commonly believed here
to be training camps for separatist rebels in Kashmir.
	   Later Thursday, five representatives from the group were allowed
to present a memorandum to the Pakistan High Commission.
	   A nine year insurgency has been raging in Kashmir where several
militant groups and are fighting for Kashmir's independence from
India. New Delhi accuses Pakistan of fomenting the militancy, a
charge Pakistan denies.
	   Over the last two months, Kashmiri militants have targetted
Hindus who are a minority in Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority
state. Earlier this month, suspected Kashmiri guerrillas killed 34
sleeping construction workers in two attacks. Last month, 20 Hindus
were killed, all in remote mountainous villages in Kashmir.

Robbers kill U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, nine others in central
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president's reaction, 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ILOILO, Philippines (AP) _ Robbers used assault rifles to shoot
at the occupants of vehicles on a road in the central Philippines,
killing 10 people, including a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, police
said Thursday.
	   The five robbers shot the victims in the head or neck and then
took their belongings in the attacks in the town of Sara in Iloilo
province Wednesday night, police Chief Superintendent Ricardo de
Leon said.
	   Six of the victims were forced out of their vehicles, lined up
on the side of the road and shot, a radio news report said, quoting
witnesses.
	   Police and U.S. Embassy officials identified the Peace Corps
volunteer as Robert Bock of New York. Police said Bock, who was on
the way to a meeting with a former town mayor, was shot in a van.
	   The U.S. Embassy strongly condemned the attack, which it called
a ``senseless act of violence.'' It said there was no indication
Bock or the United States was specifically targeted.
	   Bock, 33, was helping the provincial government in fisheries
management and the conservation of coral reefs. He was assigned to
Iloilo last year and was one of four American Peace Corps
volunteers working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila
said.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   ``The perpetrators of this inhuman crime should not be allowed
to menace society again,'' President Joseph Estrada said in a
statement, adding that he would ensure the killers are quickly
caught and punished.
	   De Leon said the robbers, armed with M-16 assault rifles and
pistols, attacked at least four vehicles passing on the road. The
father of the group's leader tried to stop them but was also shot
at by the group, he said. The father was not injured.
	   ``They went on a rampage apparently because of drugs,'' police
Chief Inspector Camilo Cascola said.
	   A man driving a van saw the attack in progress and tried to back
away, but the robbers saw him and shot at the vehicle, shattering
its windshield and injuring the driver.
	   Police said the robbers escaped in Bock's van and drove to a
nearby village, where they opened fire on a house but caused no
injuries. The van later fell into a shallow canal and was abandoned
by the men, the police said.
	   Provincial police director Pedro Sanchez said more than 70
policemen were scouring nearby villages and manning roadblocks.
	   Sanchez said a man who was drinking with the robbers prior to
the attack was being questioned by police but it was not clear
whether he took part in the shooting.
	   Police said the men belong to a kidnapping and robbery gang
operating in metropolitan Manila and some central provinces. The
reported leader, Ricky Braga, has pending murder and homicide cases
in Iloilo, about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.
	   Despite on-and-off government crackdowns, crimes like robbery
and kidnapping remain rampant in the country.
	   Estrada, who took office in June, has pledged to make an
anti-crime drive a cornerstone of his administration.

Germany bans two left-wing extremist Turkish groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany banned two rival left-wing Turkish
extremist groups Tuesday as threats to domestic security, citing
growing violence and criminal activity aimed particularly at
Germany's Turkish residents.
	   The splinter groups of the previously outlawed Turkish extremist
organization Devrimci Sol must cease all activity in Germany
immediately, including meetings and publication of propaganda.
	   The Interior Ministry said the rival Karatas and Yagan wings
both finance their activities largely by blackmailing Turkish
residents and businesses, and have for years used violence and
murder to gain dominance in Germany, home to some 2 million Turks.
	   The groups, which splintered from Devrimci Sol in 1992 and have
about 1,300 members combined, both adopted Devrimci Sol's goal of
overthrowing the Turkish government to replace it with a Marxist
regime, the ministry said.
	   An Interior Ministry report on the groups said they both appear
to be experiencing financial problems, triggering a rise in threats
and violence against Turkish residents and businesses that refuse
to give money.
	   ``An end to the conflict is not in sight,'' the report said.
	   The violence reached a critical point last summer when members
of both gangs were seriously injured in shootouts in Hamburg and
Frankfurt, according to the ministry report.
	   ``The ban is a direct response to the serious criminal activity
of two left-wing extremist Turkish criminal groups that have not
hesitated to commit murder on open streets,'' Interior Minister
Manfred Kanther said in a statement.
	   The Interior Ministry action comes several weeks after federal
authorities arrested several Karatas members on charges of
blackmail, murder and attempted murder.
	   Prosecutors at the time said the leader of the Karatas wing
ordered members to attack and sometimes kill members of the rival
Yagan wing and Turks unwilling to contribute money. They also blame
the group for arson attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany.
	   Germany banned Devrimci Sol in 1983.

General Motors to launch Japan version of Chevrolet Blazer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ General Motors Corp. will launch a version of its
Chevrolet Blazer built especially for Japan this fall as it tries
to expand sales in a slumping auto market, an advertising executive
said Thursday.
	   GM aims to launch the new version of its popular sport utility
vehicle in October, Matthew Dodds, a senior vice president with the
McCann-Erickson advertising agency, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The new Blazer will have its steering wheel on the right to
accommodate driving on the left side of the road, side mirrors that
retract for parking in tight spaces or squeezing through narrow
streets, and other modifications to accommodate Japanese drivers,
said Dodds, who oversees the advertising account in Japan for GM's
Chevrolet division.
	   The Blazer will be the second GM vehicle to be sold in Japan
with right-hand drive. A similarly modified Cadillac Seville went
on sale here last year.
	   U.S. trade officials have long blamed low exports to Japan on
trade barriers, but critics have countered that U.S. automakers
haven't done enough to modify their cars for the Japanese market.
	   U.S. automakers trail well behind European manufacturers in
sales to Japan. Mercedes-Benz, for example, sold more cars in Japan
last year than all U.S. car makers combined.
	   The Blazer already does better in Japan than many other GM
vehicles.
	   GM says it sold 1,895 Blazers in the first seven months of the
year, 26 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   Few models have done so well as the sluggish economy and rising
unemployment have taken a heavy toll on car sales in Japan. July
marked the 16th straight month of decline for domestic automakers,
while sales of imported vehicles dropped 20 percent to 25,145.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo and Rwanda traded accusations on
Thursday, charging one another with carrying out ethnic attacks on
Tutsi and Hutu civilians as a grim byproduct of fighting between
rebels and loyalist government forces.
	   The Rwandan government called on international agencies to
intervene and save ethnic Tutsis it says are being persecuted by
the Congolese authorities, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   In Kinshasa, human rights minister replied with similar charges
against Rwandan troops who he said were attacking ethnic Hutus
living in Congo's east.
	   ``There is indescribable suffering and torture, deportations and
deprivation of liberty as a result of this oligarchic political and
military adventure by Rwanda,'' State Minister for Human Rights
Leonard She O'Kitundu said.
	   Both Rwanda and Congo have called on the International Committee
of the Red Cross and the United Nations to monitor the human rights
situation and help ward of ethnically-motivated attacks by the
warring sides.
	   Mary Robinson, the head of the United Nations Human Rights
Commission earlier called on Kinshasa to protect the lives of all
its citizens. The U.S. State Department in Washington made a
similar appeal.
	   Congo accuses Rwanda and neighboring Uganda of helping and
fighting alongside insurgents who launched a rebellion earlier this
month in a bid to topple President Laurent Kabila's 14-month-old
regime.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement in the revolt.
	   Rebel forces in the west near the Atlantic coastline have been
reinforcing their positions around the village of Kitona and say
they are in the process of taking the river port town of Matadi.
	   The government reported heavy fighting in the region, but did
not elaborate.
	   The rebels say they are fed up with Kabila's rule, which they
allege has been tainted by mismanagement, corruption and nepotism.
	   Kabila's government places blame for the rebellion on Rwandan
and Congolese Tutsis, triggering growing rage against this minority
ethnic group.
	   Kabila's government dismisses charges it is persecuting Tutsis
in Kinshasa and elsewhere, but authorities in the capital
acknowledge that a number of civilians have been arrested on
suspicion of complicity with the rebels.
	   Aid workers and foreign diplomats who spoke on condition of
anonymity, however, said hundreds and perhaps thousands of Tutsis
had been rounded up in Kinshasa and elsewhere. Some remained in
detention, others have been beaten.
	   ``The government protests against the persecutions of Rwandans
and other Congolese nationals,'' Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase
Gasana said in a statement.
	   Gasana said that Rwandans have been victims of beatings,
lootings, and executions committed by Kabila's supporters, both
military and civilian.
	   Tutsis, with their distinctive physical features, have gone into
hiding in Kinshasa. Calls on state radio to massacre the enemy have
only fueled a growing sense of rage against all Tutsis _ Rwandan,
Congolese or otherwise.
	   A government-controlled radio broadcast in eastern Congo's town
of Bunia called on people to kill all Tutsis.
	   ``It should be stressed that people must bring a machete, a
spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric
irons, barbed wire, stones and the like, in order, dear listeners,
to kill the Rwandan Tutsis,'' the radio said.
	   ``Wherever you see a Rwandan Tutsi, regard him as your enemy. We
shall do everything possible to free ourselves from the grip of the
Tutsis,'' the radio said.
	   From the rebel side, however, commanders and Rwandan officials
said Congo was using former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen as
killing squads. The Rwandan Hutus fled to Congo for fear of
reprisals for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 Tutsis.
	   Last week, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu accused Kabila of
having trained at least 10,000 former Hutu fighters against the
rebels.
	   Relations between Congo and neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which
helped remove long-time Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from
power and install Kabila in May 1997, had been gradually
deteriorating before the rebellion erupted.

Cambodian king prepared to host talks between rival parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition appeal to constitutional council in
grafs 5-8; edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday
he is prepared to host talks between rival political parties aimed
at ending a post-election stalemate and forming a working
government, but only if he is formally asked.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a
slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly in the July 26
election, but not the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ immediately
spurned offers by Hun Sen to form a coalition government, alleging
rampant fraud in voting and ballot-counting.
	   The two opposition parties have threatened to boycott parliament
unless their complaints are properly investigated.
	   On Thursday, they took the complaints to the Constitutional
Council, the country's highest legal body, after the National
Election Committee dismissed their protests as ``baseless.''
	   The more than 800 complaints range from improper counting to
intimidation and human rights violations.
	   But the Sam Rainsy Party expressed doubt that the Constitutional
Council, which like the election committee is stacked with
supporters of Hun Sen's ruling party, would provide a fair hearing.
	   ``We expect to see the rubber stamp in action,'' the party said,
adding that the council also lacked the resources and staff to
handle the mammoth task.
	   King Sihanouk, who offered to have informal negotiations at his
residence in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, stressed
Thursday that he is not seeking an audience with the rival parties.
But he said he is willing to act as a conciliator if asked.
	   ``I have made clear that I have stayed and will stay in Siem
Reap at the disposal of the Cambodian People's Party, of FUNCINPEC
and of the (Sam Rainsy Party) if at least two of the three large
parties would like to have an informal meeting,'' he wrote.
	   In an interview with the U.S. government radio station Voice of
America late Wednesday, Hun Sen urged the three main political
parties to join in asking the king for an audience.
	   ``All the three parties ought to request an audience with the
king at the same time, so he can offer us good advice,'' Hun Sen
said. ``I think that will be a good opportunity.''
	   He added that he and CPP president Chea Sim already planned to
seek an audience with the king after official election results are
announced in late August.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy also expressed interest in the idea in
a joint statement.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense
dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid
lost after his takeover.

Doctors say King Fahd recovering well from surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd is recovering
well after undergoing an operation to remove his gall bladder, a
doctor said Thursday.
	   The monarch was visited by his family on Wednesday just hours
after a medical team led by a U.S. surgeon successfully removed the
monarch's gall bladder, the doctor at the King Faisal Specialist
Hospital. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Other well-wishers were turned back, he said, to ensure that the
king got adequate rest after the 75-minute operation.
	   The king is expected to spend up to one week more in the
hospital, the doctor said.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was operated on by Dr. Ted Pappas
of Duke University in North Carolina and Saudi surgeons.
	   Fahd was admitted to hospital last week. Wednesday's operation
followed consultations with a number of specialists who were
brought to the kingdom from the United States, France, Italy and
Germany.
	   Consultations also were conducted via satellite with the
renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which recommended
that the operation be carried out.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995. Two months later, he
temporarily handed over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   Since the stroke, Fahd has used a wheelchair and is able to take
a few steps or stand up to meet visitors only with the help of a
cane.
	   The stroke also left him with short-term memory loss and the
inability to concentrate for any stretch of time. In addition, Fahd
has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.

 &UR; Vajpayee gets a breather as ally defers decision to pull out of
coalition &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by regional leader, ADDS byline,
background. &QL; 
 &UR; By K.N. ARUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ India's shaky coalition got a breather
Thursday when a recalcitrant ally, who was threatening to pull down
the government, decided to hold off.
	   Unfavorable public reaction and internal disagreements may have
prompted southern politician Jayaram Jayalalitha from bringing down
the minority government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
	   Jayalalitha's All Indian Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham and four
local allies together have 30 lawmakers whose support is crucial
for Vajpayee's government in the 545-member federal Parliament.
	   Jayalalitha huddled Thursday with the lawmakers to discuss if
they should topple the government to convey their anger over an
accord Vajpayee brokered recently on sharing the waters of the
Cauvery River.
	   The river flows from the state of Karnataka into Tamil Nadu and
has been a major political and emotive issue between the two
neighbors for decades.
	   After the meeting, lawmaker V.K. Ramamurthy told journalists
they authorized Jayalalitha to ``take appropriate action at the
appropriate time.''
	   ``The question of withdrawal of support does not arise now,''
said Ramamurthy, who is the lone lawmaker of his party and needs
Jayalitha's support for winning local elections.
	   The decision to stay in the government may have been prompted by
differences among the allies, said an AIADMK leader, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said some did not want to bring down the
four-month government or quit their ministerial jobs.
	   Tamil Nadu insists on a certain share of the river water.
Karnataka says the demand will mean it will have to scale back
future irrigation projects. It also rejects a quota, saying a poor
monsoon could affect its own needs.
	   A tribunal in 1991 ordered Karnataka to release 5.8 billion
cubic meters of water to downstream Tamil Nadu. Karnataka refused
to accept the decision and the dispute went to the Supreme Court,
which is still hearing the case.
	   The court asked the federal government to notify the tribunal's
decision by this week. Vajpayee then got all four southern states _
two of them also fall in the river basin _ to agree to set up an
authority to decide how to share the river's waters.
	   Jayalalitha described the decision as a sellout to her political
foe who is in power in her state. She then announced that she would
pull out of the government.
	   Jayalalitha has been in touch with opposition leaders, including
Sonia Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, to form
another coalition. But media reports suggest that Gandhi is not
keen to upset the current arrangement and is wary of tying up with
Jayalalitha, who is widely considered a maverick politician.
	   Jayalalitha could announce her decision after the Supreme Court
rules next week on the case. She also would have to consider her
rising unpopularity because of her stand on the river dispute.

Jayasuriya ruled out of the series opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ World Cup cricket champions Sri Lanka
suffered a major setback Thursday when dashing opener Sanath
Jayasuriya was ruled out of Friday's triangular series opener
against South Africa at Trent Bridge.
	   Jayasuriya, one of the key figure in Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup
success, has a badly bruised right hand after being repeatedly hit
during the one-day match against Kent on a dangerous pitch. The
game was subsequently abandoned.
	   The explosive left hander, who has set new benchmarks for
one-day cricket with fellow opener Romesh Kaluwitharana, complained
of pain while batting in the nets.
	   ``He is in extreme pain and it is very unlikely he will play,''
said a dejected skipper Ranatunga. ``It's tough luck.''
	   Russel Arnold, another talented left hander, will take
Jayasuriya's place in a strong line-up that is expected to include
at least seven players from the side that beat Australia in the
World Cup final at Lahore in March 1996.
	   Jayasuriya will undergo further x-rays but team physiotherapist
Alex Kountouri expects Sri Lanka's most valuable player to be fit
for the match against England at Lord's on Sunday.
	   The triangular series will serve as the final dress rehearsal
For Sri Lanka before England hosts the International Cricket
Council's World Cup in 1999.
	   ``That's one reason we decided to come here,'' Ranatunga said.
``We've heard the white balls move around a great deal here
compared with other countries, so this tournament is part of the
acclimatization process.''
	   ``We have been very successful in the subcontinent, but I would
like to see how we perform here,'' Ranatunga added.
	   This is Sri Lanka's first international in England since winning
the World Cup. Sri Lanka has only played 12 limited-overs matches
in England since 1975, winning just two match _ both in World Cup
tournaments _ against India in 1979 and against New Zealand in
1983.
	   Ranatunga, Sri Lanka's longest serving international player,
said the pressure was on England to win the triangular series after
its new found success in the recent test series against South
Africa.
	   ``Normally the pressure is on the World Cup winner to win any
tournament it participates in. But I think this one will be
different,'' Ranatunga said.
	   England won its first major test series in 12 years Monday,
wining the fifth and final test to clinch a 2-1 series win over
South Africa.
	   ``The home expectancy will be high and the crowd will want them
to win everything from now onwards,'' Ranatunga said.
	   Sri Lanka has won all five of its county one-day games leading
up to the triangular, but Ranatunga sees South Africa as the main
threat in this short series.
	   ``South Africa is undoubtedly a far superior side compared with
England. They bowl well and field brilliantly. For England, the
only advantage they have is playing at home,'' Ranatunga said.
	   South Africa has been the top one-day side since the 1996 World
Cup, winning 44 out of its 57 matches, closely followed by Sri
Lanka, 36 out of 58. England has 15 wins from 29 games.
	   Teams:
	   South Africa: Mike Rindel, Gary Kirsten, Jacques Kallis, Daryll
Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock, Pat
Symcox, Mark Boucher, Steve Elworthy, Allan Donald.
	   Sri Lanka (from): Romesh Kaluwitharana, Russel Arnold, Marvan
Atapattu, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Hashan
Tillakaratne or Mahela Jayawardene, Chandika Hathurusingha, Kumara
Dharmasena, Muttiah Muralidharan, Pramodaya Wickramasinghe, Suresh
Perera.

Policeman pays price for interrupting lovers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The call came in from Vistahermosa, which
means 'beautiful view.'
	   The view was one of people crowding around a dark blue Mercedes,
watching a man and a woman have sex in the back seat. The lovers
were stark naked. The spectators were said to number as many as 50.
	   One of the neighbors complained. Two police officers responded
to the call last Saturday night in Vistahermosa, a nightlife
district in the southern beach resort of Puerto de Santa Maria.
	   The officers waded through the crowd, up to the car and asked
the couple to, well, knock it off and put their clothes back on.
	   ``They were offending people,'' a Puerto de Santa Maria police
spokesman insisted Thursday.
	   The lovers got out of the car -- ``they had covered themselves
up,'' the spokesman added -- but proceeded to hurl verbal abuse and
fisticuffs at the police. One of the officers was thrown to the
ground.
	   The altercation turned violent enough for nightclub bouncers to
rush over and help subdue the suspects.
	   Reinforcements showed up and the couple -- a 42-year-old man and
an 18-year-old girl -- were taken away in handcuffs.
	   They both suffered slight injuries, as did one of the arresting
officers, the spokesman said.

Estrada welcomes effort to change Greek dictionary definition of
</HEADLINE>
Filipino women &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Thursday
welcomed efforts by the Greek government to persuade a scholar to
change a recently published dictionary that defines Filipino women
as housemaids.
	   ``I am glad that the Greek government, while taking into account
the right of every individual to exercise freedom of expression,
has assured our government that it will exercise moral persuasion
to correct this inaccurate definition,'' Estrada said.
	   On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said Greece
expressed regret over the definition, which has stung many
Filipinos.
	   Siazon said the Greek government has given assurances it will
try to persuade the author, George Babiniotis, to change the
definition, which Philippine officials said demeaned Filipino
women.
	   The dictionary defined ``Filipineza'' as a ``domestic worker or
a person who performs non-essential auxiliary tasks.''
	   The Philippine government sent a diplomatic note asking Greek
authorities to encourage Babiniotis to delete the entry.
	   More than 6 million Filipinos work overseas, many as maids or
entertainers, because of a shortage of job opportunities at home.
The money they send home is the country's biggest source of foreign
exchange.
	   Many endure daily indignities ranging from verbal abuse to
sexual advances from their employers. But Filipinos at home
generally see them as privileged for being able to work overseas
for higher wages.
	   In 1997, overseas Filipino workers sent home dlrs 5.7 billion
through official channels and much more through other means,
helping soften the effects on the Philippines of the Asian currency
crisis.

Cargo handler: Cargo services to be back to normal levels Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's main cargo handler says it is
confident air cargo services will be back to normal levels by
Friday, more than a month after serious computer glitches crippled
air cargo transport at the territory's brand new airport.
	   Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals announced Thursday it will remove
all restrictions on cargo exports at the new airport at midnight,
two days before schedule, making it possible to match its previous
levels of service.
	   But imported cargo, apart from emergency and perishable items
and that carried on flag-carrier Cathay Pacific Airways, will
continue to be handled at the old Kai Tak airport until the end of
the month, a company statement said.
	   Computer glitches halted air cargo services almost immediately
after the new airport opened July 6. The company split import and
export handling between its old Kai Tak airport facility, where
flights no longer operate, and the new terminal. It has been slowly
lifting restrictions as its processing capacity increases.
	   The company had pledged to resume full handling capacity using
both airports by mid-August, and using only the new airport by this
month's end. The new terminal would handle up to 80 percent of
operations Friday, the statement said.
	   Government officials estimated the cargo problems could shave
0.35 percentage point off the this year's gross domestic product,
at a time when the first year of economic shrinkage in more than
two decades is looming.
	   Cathay Pacific Airways, which last week reported its first ever
loss, said the cargo problems cost it 250 million Hong Kong dollars
(dlrs 32 million) in revenue in July alone.
	   The airport problems sparked serious public criticism against
both government officials and the company. The company said it was
under extreme pressure from officials to open even before it was
ready.
	   Three separate investigations are under way to find out what
went wrong and who's responsible.

Korean president quietly celebrates his `second birthday'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung attended a
Roman Catholic Mass Thursday, quietly observing what he calls his
``second birthday'' 25 years ago.
	   It was on Aug. 13, 1973, that Kim, battered and bruised, was set
free near his home in Seoul after being kidnapped from a Tokyo
hotel room by South Korean intelligence agents.
	   A longtime opposition leader, Kim spent 16 years in prison or
house arrest under military governments in the 1970s and 1980s. He
was elected president in December.
	   Kim was kidnapped on Aug. 8, 1973, while in Japan in
self-imposed exile. His kidnappers were thwarted in the act of
trying to drown him, then released him six days later.
	   Kim made no direct mention of the ordeal Thursday but his chief
spokesman, Park Ji-won, said the president has forgiven all those
involved in the case.
	   Lee Hu-rak, a former government spy chief who allegedly ordered
the kidnapping, is living outside Seoul. The president has said he
will not seek revenge against Lee and others involved.
	   ``The president already forgave all of them a long time ago but
he still believes that all truth must be brought to light,'' the
spokesman told reporters.
	   Although full details have yet to be disclosed, it's generally
known that the kidnapping was the work of the government's main spy
agency, then known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.
	   Presidential aides said full details may never be known because
most government documents on the case were destroyed after Kim was
elected president.

Indonesian chamber of commerce opposes foreign investment in banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The head of the Indonesian Chamber of
Commerce, Trade and Industry urged the government Thursday to sell
stock in state-owned banks only to Indonesians and not to foreign
investors.
	   Indonesia's banking sector has been hit hard by a dramatic fall
in the value of the rupiah, which triggered the nation's worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Many banks have been made insolvent.
	   Under an International Monetary Fund-sponsored economic bailout,
the government is to introduce legislation to support the ultimate
goal of full privatization of all state banks. Foreign strategic
partners are to be sought under the proposal.
	   Originally, the government had planned to put the legislation
before Parliament in June. But this has not yet been done.
	   ``The government has to sell its stake in the state-owned
banking companies to Indonesians, not foreigners,'' the chamber's
chairman, Aburizal Bakrie, told reporters after a meeting with
President B.J. Habibie.
	   Meanwhile, Bakrie repeated a call for a form of foreign exchange
control.
	   Bakrie said his association wants exporters to go to the central
bank to exchange their hard currency, thus providing a means for
the bank to obtain badly needed foreign exchange.
	   ``A free foreign exchange regime would still be in place, but
exporters would have to park their hard currency at the central
bank,'' said Bakrie, who is the chairman of the Bakrie Group, the
country's largest indigenous Indonesian-controlled conglomerate.
	   He added that the central bank could raise about dlrs 50 billion
if such a system was implemented.
	   While Habibie has promised to explore such suggestions, he has
consistently rejected plans to implement foreign exchange controls.

Burmese activists urge Japan to pressure military regime

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five democracy activists from Myanmar urged the
Japanese Foreign Ministry Thursday to put further pressure on the
Myanmar government to stop what they called human rights violations
against opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Outside the Myanmar Embassy in Tokyo, more than 20 other
activists staged a protest, condemning the military regime's recent
treatment of Suu Kyi and calling for freedom.
	   Their action came as Suu Kyi was engaged in her latest roadside
standoff against the military government just outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, was stopped
Wednesday at a checkpoint 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital as she tried to travel to the western city of Bassein to
meet supporters.
	   ``We condemn such unnecessary measures that violate individual
and political rights of Aung San Suu Kyi,'' said Win Khet, vice
president of the National Council of the Union of Burma. ``We
demand they remove the restrictions immediately.''
	   On Tuesday, Japan joined the United States, Australia and four
other countries condemning Myanmar's military regime for its recent
treatment of Suu Kyi and called for a dialogue between the two
sides.
	   Foreign Ministry officials said recent developments in Myanmar,
also known as Burma, will be discussed by Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura in his meetings with senior U.S. officials in Washington
later this week.
	   Win Khet said daily midafternoon protests outside the Myanmar
Embassy will continue until Aug. 21, the deadline Suu Kyi has set
for a parliament elected in 1990 to be convened.

Iraq hopes to host 12,000 Iran pilgrims a month from Saturday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first batch of Iranian pilgrims to
cross the Iran-Iraq border in 18 years is scheduled to arrive in
Iraq on Saturday, an official of the Endowments and Religious
Affairs Ministry said Thursday.
	   The pilgrims will number no more than 220, according to the
Iranian authorities, but Iraq hopes the quantity will soon rise to
the 12,000 per month that has been agreed between the two states.
	   ``All holy shrines in Iraq are well-prepared for the Iranian
pilgrims,'' Alladin al-Qaisi, adviser to the Religious Affairs
Minister, told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   ``We will empty the shrines so they can pray without
disturbance,'' he added.
	   Iraq hopes that the pilgrims, who by tradition deliver gifts to
the shrines, will help reverse its desperate shortage of foreign
currency. Pilgrimage tourism is one of the few forms of
international trade that Iraq is allowed to engage in under the
sweeping U.N. sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its Shiite Muslim people to have
access to the Shiite shrines in Baghdad, Samara, Karbala and Najaf.
	   Yet, despite the common interest in such pilgrimages, Iran and
Iraq took about nine months to negotiate the opening of their
border and the quota of pilgrims. Such was the residue of mistrust
from the eight-year Iran-Iraq War. More than a million people were
killed or wounded in the war, which quickly put an end to
pilgrimages when it started in 1980.
	   In choosing its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran has pointedly
given preference to what it calls ``parents of the martyrs of the
sacred defense'' _ parents of those killed during the war.
	   The head of the Iranian Martyr Foundation, Hojatoleslam
Rahimyan, told Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency that
the group would leave Tehran on Friday and would visit the shrines
at Karbala and Najaf, both south of Baghdad.
	   To receive them, Iraq has had to rebuild Al-Muntheriya border
post, which was destroyed during the war.
	   Housing and Reconstruction Minister Maan Abdullah Sersem told
Iraqi newspapers that the government had spent 1 billion dinars
(dlrs 580,000) on the border complex, which offers restaurants, a
telecommunications center, a health center, a mosque and, of
course, an enormous portrait of President Saddam Hussein.
	   Once they arrive, the pilgrims will be shepherded around by a
government-appointed company, Al-Huda, whose buses will take them
from the border to the shrines, their hotels and back to the border
according to a fixed program.
	   There will be no free-traveling pilgrims and very little
opportunity for Iranians to socialize with Iraqis.
	   Iraqi regulations do not allow the pilgrims to offer gifts at
the shrines. But this Islamic tradition runs deep, as al-Qaisi
observed of the Iranians who have already visited the shrines via
Jordan and Syria.
	   ``Some pilgrims bring expensive rugs, vacuum cleaners and other
items. When we tell them we are not allowed to receive the items,
they turn their backs and leave the items in one of the corners of
the shrines,'' he said.
	   The gifts, which can include gold jewelry, are removed by
officials of the Religious Affairs Ministry.

Yugoslavia to demand extradition of a Muslim from Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia will ask Germany to
extradite a Muslim warlord suspected of harassing and killing 63
Serbs during the Bosnian war in Sarajevo, Belgrade's prosecutor
office said Thursday.
	   Ismet Bajramovic, also known as Celo, is said to be living in
Germany. Belgrade authorities started proceedings against him after
some 80 Serbs who lived in the Bosnian capital during the 1992-95
war, testified against him, the prosecutor's office said.
	   Bajramovic, 32, was an underworld figure before the war started.
He had been sentenced to 11 years in prison for rape, but his
sentence was cut short as ethnic tensions rose in 1990. During the
war he served as a paramilitary leader loyal to the Muslim-led
Bosnian authorities.
	   Belgrade now claims he was responsible for deaths of at least 63
Serbs, some of whom he killed himself, and some who died from heavy
beating in Bajramovic ``prison camp,'' which he allegedly led.
	   Bajramovic reportedly also killed and robbed a number of wealthy
Sarajevo Serbs by bursting into their apartments during the war, on
the pretext of searching for snipers who operated in the city
during the war.
	   The multi-ethnic Bosnian capital was under constant Bosnian Serb
shelling and siege during the war. The city's defense was organized
mostly by Muslims and Croats some of whom reportedly harassed and
killed a number of Serbs who stayed in the city.
	   Bajramovic's name is not on the public list of suspected war
criminals issued by the U.N. War Crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands. The U.N. court also has a list of secret indictments.

Police question child abuse suspect on 2nd anniversary of Dutroux
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HULDENBERG, Belgium (AP) _ On the second anniversary of a child
sex and murder scandal that shocked Belgians, police questioned a
suspected child molester Thursday after closing down a camp for 19
youngsters he ran just by himself.
	   Details of abuse by the unnamed suspect were sketchy and added a
sinister touch to Thursday's second anniversary of the scandal
surrounding Marc Dutroux.
	   Dutroux was arrested Aug. 13, 1996, and charged with kidnaping,
abusing and murdering girls in a cellar of his house.
	   On Thursday, police closed a camp for 18 boys and girl in this
town just east of Brussels after three boys were found wandering in
the dark of the night in nearby woods.
	   Police spokesman Gilbert Libert said they were returned to the
camp that accommodated children aged 8 to 14 run and was run by one
supervisor, a 35-year-old man.
	   A computer check showed him to be a suspected child molester.
Police called in the children's parents, shut down the nine-tent
camp on a wooded campground and began questioning the camp leader.
	   The VTM television network said the man behaved inappropriately,
among others by showering with youngsters.
	   Libert said the camp's paperwork was in order as were all
identity papers but what was suspicious was that when the three
children were returned to the man ``no one was very happy,'' said
Libert.
	   That sort of alert police work stood in sharp contrast to the
sloppy investigation of Dutroux.
	   In that case, investigators allowed a convicted child rapist _
Dutroux was sentenced to 13 years in 1989 _ to abuse children
without raising suspicions though he was well-know to police.
Police at one point even visited his house and heard the screams of
young girls, yet left.
	   Dutroux is to go on trial next year. His case has led to a major
restructuring of the Belgian police and justice system.

Hong Kong's Chan outlines medical, management proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong's civil service chief, Anson Chan,
proposed Thursday to convene a forum later this year for
Asian-Pacific nations to share public sector management techniques.
	   Noting the competition between Hong Kong and Singapore for
business, she said, ``Ultimately the success of our cities depends
more on Asia as a whole succeeding than on beating each other.''
	   ``There is much to be gained from sharing experience of how to
manage the civil service effectively,'' Mrs. Chan said.
	   ``Singapore, for instance, has made strides in financial
autonomy for executive agencies. Australia has advanced on human
resources issues. I believe we (in Hong Kong) have much to offer on
managing for results.''
	   She said early responses had been positive toward the creation
of a Public Sector Management Forum for the Asia-Pacific. Hong Kong
would be willing to play host to the first meeting later this year
to discuss how this cooperation can be achieved, she said in a
lecture to the Singapore-Malaysia Congress of Medicine.
	   Describing Hong Kong's shift to ``managing for results,'' she
told the audience of physicians and medical school professors,
``This will mean focusing less on how much is spent or how many
patients are treated and more on reducing illness and suffering and
improving health.
	   ``It will mean taking responsibility for the health of the
community rather than just the needs of patients,'' she said. ``It
will mean establishing which health care services offer the maximum
health gain. The resource allocation process will no longer reward
he or she who shouts loudest but invest taxpayers' money where it
will do the most good.''

Amid concern over ruble, Russian Central Bank imposes new
</HEADLINE>
restrictions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, Zyuganov signaling parliament may
meet next week on stabilization program, details on proposed
currency board. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As concern grew over the stability of the Russian
ruble, the Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency
trading by commercial banks. Frightened bankers temporarily halted
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was halted on Russia's main stock exchange after
the first 40 minutes of trading because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent. The exchange reopened 35 minutes later.
	   The only potentially positive news for the government was
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov's indication that he would,
after all, agree to a special parliamentary session next week to
consider legislation required for Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's
economic stabilization program.
	   Zyuganov said the party's legislative leaders would consider
calling the session at their meeting Monday, the Interfax news
agency reported. Late Wednesday, senior parliamentarians including
Zyuganov had said that the lower chamber, the State Duma, wouldn't
convene unless called by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``An absolutely urgent situation has arisen,'' Zyuganov said.
``If there is devaluation of the ruble, a collapse of banks and the
impoverishment of the people will follow.''
	   Kiriyenko tried to calm investors with assurances the government
would follow through with its austerity plan. He told reporters
that the only ``normal response'' to the panic on the markets was
the ``strict implementation of the government's stabilization
program.''
	   The new banking rules, adopted Wednesday night, were not
considered very significant, but the fact that the Central Bank
felt the need to take new measures contributed to a climate of
foreboding in the Russian markets.
	   Concern is growing that in spite of the government's statements
to the contrary, Russia will devalue the ruble despite an influx of
cash from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF loan was
intended to bolster the beleaguered currency, which has been under
siege since the Russian economy began to backslide earlier this
year.
	   George Soros, the American investor whose moves are closely
watched on international markets, said in a letter to Britain's
Financial Times that it was time to devalue the ruble and establish
a currency board in Russia.
	   Such a board would be intended to fight inflation by tying
domestic money supply to foreign currency reserves through a fixed
exchange rate and prohibiting the Central Bank from printing money
to cover fiscal deficits.
	   The ruble continued to fall against the U.S. dollar and the
German mark on Thursday. On the interbank market, foreign exchange
trading failed to start as usual Thursday morning, with bankers too
frightened by the shaky situation to risk transactions.
	   The quick plunge on the stock market prompted officials to halt
trading for the second time this week. They cited regulations that
call for a suspension when a decline exceeds 10 percent during the
first hour of trading.
	   Some blue-chip stocks fell by as much as 30 percent in the early
trading.
	   The new rules adopted by the Central Bank followed rumors that
Russian banks had started defaulting, which caused panic selling of
ruble-denominated assets Wednesday.
	   The rules restrict dollar-buying by commercial banks for their
own purposes. However, the Central Bank said commercial banks could
continue to buy dollars for clients.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada was about to
comment to reporters Thursday about the killing of 10 people,
including a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, in the southern Philippines
when he remembered he wasn't supposed to talk to them.
	   ``I forgot, I am not supposed to answer your questions,'' he
said, walking away as his bodyguards held back the crowd.
	   A day earlier, Estrada announced he would no longer allow
``ambush'' or curbside interviews and would appoint a spokesman
instead.
	   Estrada, a college dropout and former movie star, has held few
formal press briefings. Instead, he has made frequent off-the-cuff
comments in ambush interviews that have raised eyebrows and led to
criticism in the local press.
	   Estrada, who has admitted to womanizing in the past, once said
he was glad to hear reports that his wife did not like living in
the presidential palace because he could then live on his own.
	   Last week, answering reporters' questions, Estrada said he was
unaware of a joint Philippine-U.S. military exercise that had been
held the previous day.
	   On Monday, he said he could not remember if he had already
approved a crucial human rights accord with Communist rebels, which
he had done three days earlier.
	   Estrada said having a spokesman will allow him to concentrate on
his job.
	   Since taking office June 30, Estrada has complained that his
statements are often twisted by local newspapers.
	   He was stung by one newspaper report that his cash-strapped
administration plans to spend 100 million pesos (dlrs 2.3 million)
to repair a guest house in the palace compound where he will live
with his family. Of that, 10 million pesos (dlrs 232,500) would go
to spruce up the kitchen, it said.
	   Estrada escorted palace reporters around the guest house Tuesday
and insisted that repairs for the entire building would cost only
one-tenth the reported amount.
	   The new presidential spokesman, Jerry Barican, a lawyer and
former student leader, said Estrada ``wants to focus on what he
promised in the campaign'' _ improving agriculture and the economy
and curbing crime _ and ``not presidential kitchens.''
	   Appealing for cooperation from the press as the country attempts
to recover from the Asian currency crisis, Barican said: ``You
know, it's no longer regular times. You hit the president really
hard in normal times, I suppose, it's all right. But you hit the
president very hard now, it's the whole Philippines that's getting
hit.''

Two people dead and one missing after boat of Scottish tourists

capsizes &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with police identifying tourists as Scottish, not
German; one more dead found &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMONE, Italy (AP) _ Two Scottish tourists were found dead and a
third was missing Thursday after their motor boat capsized on Lake
Garda during a wind storm.
	   Workers cleaning the lake early Thursday managed to rescue four
others who had set out on the boat Wednesday afternoon. Police
first said the group was from Germany but later said they were
residents of Scotland.
	   Officer Massimo Belizzari identified the dead as Richard Harris
and a six-year-old boy whose name was not immediately known. He
said several vessels were searching for a missing 13-year old who
was presumed dead.
	   The survivors said they were out on the lake when the wind
suddenly picked up, creating huge waves, according to Belizzari. He
said the seven were separated after the boat capsized.
	   The tourists had rented the motor boat at a local shop.
	   Authorities said they had received several distress calls from
other vessels in trouble on the lake Wednesday due to the rough
water and high winds.
	   The lake, situated about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of
Milan, is a popular tourist site for swimming and boating.

Hoddle takes a swipe at Manchester United boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Not content just to pick on Gazza, England soccer
coach Glenn Hoddle has also used his autobiography to take a swipe
at Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson.
	   Hoddle's book, ``The 1998 World Cup Story,'' which is being
serialized in the Sun newspaper, was branded ``pathetic'' after
details revealing how Paul Gascoigne went berserk when he was cut
from the England squad were published Monday.
	   However, Hoddle had another target in excerpts published in
Thursday's paper, ripping Ferguson for his comments on the England
coach's treatment of David Beckham.
	   Ferguson had accused Hoddle of forcing Beckham to face the media
after the 23-year-old Manchester United star was surprisingly
relegated to the bench for England's World Cup opener against
Tunisia.
	   ``Ferguson chose the day before a crucial World Cup game to go
public on how I'd treated David Beckham,'' Hoddle said in his book.
``It was exactly the sort of behavior Alex would have gone
ballistic about if he'd been on the receiving end.
	   ``It was crazy of Alex to say what he did the day before such a
big game _ however strongly he felt. I was dreadfully disappointed.
In fact, deep down, I was furious.''
	   ``His (Ferguson's) response was wrong and gave us a headache we
could do without. He must have known that with all his
experience.''
	   Hoddle defended his revelations about Gascoigne Wednesday by
saying he was forced into publishing his version because the player
had already gone public about it himself.
	   Through his agent, Hoddle said he couldn't write a book on the
World Cup without mentioning the controversial axing of Gascoigne.
	   So what has he have in store for Beckham?
	   Beckham, who was sent off during England's World Cup exit
against Argentina, has been subjected to a hate campaign by fans
who blame him for England's loss. He can probably expect a chapter
in Hoddle's book.
	   Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon
Taylor said Hoddle had been unprofessional for launching attacks on
England players and Ferguson.
	   ``A manager's relationship with his players should be like a
doctor with his patient,'' Taylor said. ``Players in the squad will
be very wary of Glenn now and I don't think it is going to help his
relationship with them,'' he said.
	   ``They will be worried that their discussions are going to
reappear somewhere down the line. This is not the sort of thing we
should expect from the England coach,'' Taylor was quoted saying in
the Express newspaper.

Yangtze surge passes, but northeast China inundated

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Surging floodwaters safely passed a crucial
stretch of the Yangtze River on Thursday, but another deluge in
northeast China left tens of thousands of people homeless and
forced the city of Harbin on to high alert.
	   Water levels on the Yangtze at Shashi city in central Hubei
province crested at 44.8 meters (147 feet), state television said.
That was just 20 centimeters (eight inches) short of the level
state media said might have prompted officials to dynamite levees
to divert water into an area where hundreds of thousands of people
live, deliberately flooding their homes to safeguard cities
downstream.
	   But even as the flood peak passed, dangers remained: Another
crest of high waters triggered by heavy rains was forming on the
Yangtze's upper reaches, state television said.
	   In the northeastern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began Saturday and already
have destroyed 410,000 people's homes, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   The floods have caused outbreaks of disease, with more than 600
people suffering dysentery, typhoid, cholera, skin rashes and eye
diseases, Xinhua said.
	   Harbin city, capital of neighboring Heilongjiang province and a
major industrial and agricultural center, declared a flood alert
after the Songhua River rose to dangerously high levels, it said.
	   Market stalls and streets near a levee protecting the city were
closed off. Some 2.5 million soldiers, police and volunteers were
watching city levees for any leaks. Floodwaters also swept away
bridges and cut rail links in Heilongjiang.
	   President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials inspected flood
defenses near Shashi on the Yangtze, an indication of official
concern at the floods that have killed more than 2,000 people and
left millions homeless.
	   The floods could shave 0.5 of a percent off economic growth this
year, with economic losses predicted to reach U.S. dlrs 24 billion,
Xinhua said.
	   In flooded areas, residents try to carry on with life as best
they can. Near the village of Weijia, in the badly hit southern
province of Jiangxi, a family buried an elderly woman who died in
the floods.
	   The watery ceremony Thursday proceeded against a backdrop of
flooded homes and farms. Mourners in traditional white sackcloth
clothes and hats carried the heavy wooden coffin draped with red
cloth through water that was sometimes thigh deep. The funeral
party went by boat to the hill where the woman was buried, one of
the few dry spots in the area.
	   With looting and other crime plaguing flood regions, the Supreme
Court ordered judges to ``make examples'' of those caught
destroying public facilities, stealing, assaulting flood victims,
profiteering, neglecting official duties or embezzling relief funds
and supplies, Xinhua reported Thursday.
	   Previous directives warned police to guard against food riots or
fights over distribution of relief supplies, and deputized
civilians have been organized into safety patrols. State media have
reported arrests for livestock stealing and burglary in flooded
areas and several Communist Party officials were punished for
dereliction of flood prevention duties.
	   ``There have been a small number of party officials who failed
to stand the test at the critical juncture, some sneaking away
cravenly ... and some others refusing to execute orders for fear of
wronging powerful interests in their areas and disregarding the
good of the whole,'' the official People's Daily said.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9-10 with French criticism. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry said that
diplomat Aubin de la Messuziere, head of the French interest
section in Baghdad, had handed a letter to Aziz expressing French
concern about Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.

Hopes dim for 50 missing in Turkish flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Officials on Thursday ruled out any hope
of finding alive any of the 50 people missing six days after a
flood swept through a small Black Sea town.
	   The flooding killed at least seven people. Rescue workers were
searching the mud covered Beskoy town, 55 kilometers (34 miles)
south of Black Sea port city of Trabzon for bodies.
	   ``There is no hope for the rest,'' said Aydin Seyis, an official
in the neighboring town of Koprubasi.
	   The rushing rainwater collapsed some 50 one-story houses, a
mosque and a school in Beskoy.
	   Trabzon is 750 kilometers (470 miles) northeast of Ankara, the
capital.

Biggest-ever Catholic festival in Vietnam gets under way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA VANG, Vietnam (AP) _ Some came to pray for an end to their
ailments. Others had loftier goals in mind, like peace and
prosperity for their families and communities.
	   Mostly they came because they believe.
	   Vietnam's biggest-ever Roman Catholic gathering got under way
Thursday with an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 pilgrims on hand and
tens of thousands expected before the festival ends Saturday.
	   Nothing could keep them away from the 200th anniversary of an
apparition of the Virgin Mary _ neither steamy heat nor
government-fed rumors that they would face shortages of food, water
and accommodation.
	   ``When I first came here, I sat in front of that statue and
tears rolled down my face,'' said Bui Quang Dong, 45, referring to
a towering rendition of Mary holding the Christ child under three
tall trees.
	   Dong came with his family from Dong Ngai province in part to
pray for his undersized 10-year-old daughter to grow more rapidly.
	   The family arrived Monday and has been staying in a rough tent
village behind a church that still remains battered a
quarter-century after it suffered serious damage in some of the
fiercest fighting of the Vietnam War.
	   The crowd heard a message relayed from Pope John Paul II that
recalled the story of how the Virgin Mary appeared to a group of
needy travelers here 200 years ago, the only such apparition
recorded in Southeast Asia.
	   ``From that time when she appeared, she has given help to those
who need it, despite the ups and downs in this place,'' the pope
said.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, but an estimated 8
million of the 78 million people are Catholics.
	   The three-day festival was drawing some comparisons to
Woodstock, without the mud and sex. Actually, some mud would be
welcome because surrounding Quang Tri province is in the midst of
its worst drought in nearly a century.
	   Instead, with temperatures hitting the mid-30s Celsius (nearly
100 F), virtually every bit of shade was snatched up when the sun
emerged just as a procession of more than 1,000 faithful signaled
the festival's start.
	   The parade was an intriguing blend of Catholic and Vietnamese
traditions.
	   Leading 150 black-frocked priests were groups from each
archdiocese of young women in white ao dais, the elegant
tunic-over-pants outfit that slowly is being replaced in today's
culture by jeans and other Western wear.
	   Mixed in were men in brilliant red-and-gold outfits with
matching conical hats and leggings, along with a few members of the
Bana and Sedang ethnic minorities with long strands of beads
clacking as they walked.
	   A few participants were Vietnamese who now live in the United
States, Australia and elsewhere. Some said they were pleasantly
surprised that the government, which has a history of uneasy
relations with organized religions, was keeping its distance.
	   Police are handling only traffic on the one-lane road that runs
the two kilometers (1.25 miles) from Highway 1 to the site.
	   Security inside the church's six- to seven-hectare (17-acre)
compound was being handled by more than 1,000 orange-capped church
volunteers.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Curators of Germany's concentration camp memorials
have published an open letter against plans to build a national
Holocaust museum, saying resources should instead be dedicated to
preserving the former Nazi camps.
	   The group said that the camps and other existing exhibits and
research institutes already are dedicated to preserving remnants of
the Nazis crimes, and questioned the need for a separate museum.
	   ``It's our opinion that it is better to expand and secure
existing sites than to start a new project,'' nine members of an
umbrella group of concentration camp memorials, the Concentration
Camp Memorial Working Group, said in a letter on Tuesday.
	   A new foundation announced plans last week to create a national
Holocaust museum, saying that Germany needs a central location to
display research and exhibits about Nazi crimes. The museum
foundation is looking for sites for the museum, and has just
launched fund-raising efforts.
	   The research director of Berlin's Topography of Terror exhibit,
Reinhard Ruerup, called the plans ``an extremely vague conceptual
miscarriage,'' the Berliner Morgenpost reported.
	   Hans-Juergen Haessler, a Hanover University historian who heads
the foundation, attributed the criticism to professional rivalry.
	   It is ``tragic'' that such ``jealousies'' are being expressed at
a time of rising right-wing violence in Germany, Haessler told the
Morgenpost.
	   Haessler has said the museum would complement displays at
preserved concentration camps, and would not conflict with plans to
build a Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.

Environmental activist group paints gloomy picture post-2000

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Warning that 25,000 species could
die out before the new millennium, Greenpeace on Thursday renewed
its call to protect ancient forests and depleted fish stocks and
switch to cleaner energy.
	   The Earth's renewable resources are being exploited beyond their
natural capacity to regenerate, Greenpeace International director
Thilo Bode said in presenting the Amsterdam-based environmental
activist group's annual report.
	   ``Significant steps are needed before the year 2000 to reverse
these trends,'' Bode said.
	   Worldwide, 25,000 species of animal and plant life are at risk
of extinction before the turn of the millennium, and 20 million
hectares (50 million acres) of ancient forest will be damaged or
destroyed, Greenpeace said.
	   Not wanting to be doomsayers, the group said it preferred to
focus on finding solutions.
	   ``What motivates us is the beauty that is still left,'' said
Greenpeace chief spokesman Jonathan Wootliff.
	   Greenpeace made six ambitious demands to counter alarming
developments before the turn of the century, which it pointed out
was only 505 days away on Thursday.
	   It wants to ban the polluting plastic polyvinyl chloride, better
known as PVC; end licensing of new oil exploration; and phase out
nuclear energy and reprocessing of radioactive waste.
	   Other demands include ending industrial logging of ancient
forests; halving the large-scale industrial fishing fleet and
putting a stop to the wasteful killing and disposal at sea of
unwanted fish; and halting the commercial release of genetically
engineered crops.
	   These steps are ``an absolute minimum'' to protect the planet,
Bode said.
	   More than 115 tons of highly radioactive plutonium will be
produced, and another 35 million tons of PVC will have been
introduced into the environment with no waste solution in sight,
Greenpeace said.
	   Greenpeace also predicted the likely collapse of the Larsen B
ice shelf in Antarctica. In February, Greenpeace documented how
cracks have developed there and said it underscored how the burning
of fossil fuels has increased global warming.
	   Looking back on 1997, Bode highlighted some of Greenpeace's
achievements, including an award for its environmentally friendly
refrigerator and successful campaigns that helped realize the
Antarctic Protocol, which aims to protect Antarctica's fragile
ecosystem.
	   Despite those self-proclaimed victories, the group was hit by a
drop in income last year. The dip was partly due to lower income
from two key countries, the United States and Germany.
	   Total income from Greenpeace groups worldwide declined to dlrs
125.6 million in 1997 from dlrs 139.9 million a year ago.
	   Taking into account exchange rate fluctuations, the decline was
only dlrs 2 million, said Greenpeace.

Fresh floods hit Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Rains triggered fresh floods in
Bangladesh, where more than 66,000 people have been stricken with
fever and diarrhea, officials said Thursday.
	   Water, which flowed above the danger mark in all rivers,
inundated more areas, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in
capital Dhaka said.
	   Since July 15, floods have killed 4,000 people and washed away
mud-and-thatch huts of millionse.
	   Waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and viral fever affected
some 66,000 people across the nation, where sanitation is poor,
said Shamsul Islam, an official at the Disaster and Relief
Ministry.
	   At least 40 people have died in the past one month of waterborne
diseases, officials said.
	   Dr. Abdus Salam, a physician at a local hospital said about 500
people were treated Wednesday for diarrhea. The number of patients
with such problems increased in the last one week, he said.
	   Crops such as rice and lentils in 387,000 hectares (9.5 million
acres) across the country have been destroyed, an official at the
Agriculture Ministry said. The loss was estimated at 7,000 million
takas (dlrs 254 million). Bangladesh is already short of nearly 2
million tons of food grains.
	   The floods also damaged 540 kilometers (335 miles) of river
embankment, an official said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq renewed allegations Thursday that it
is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he brought a message
from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said diplomat Aubin de la
Messuziere, head of the French interest section in Baghdad, handed
a letter to Aziz expressing French concern about Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.

Unification Church signs tourism contract with North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean company owned by the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church said Thursday it has
signed a contract to send tourists to the scenic east coast of
North Korea.
	   This marks the second time the isolated communist state has
agreed to tourism deals with businesses in pro-Western South Korea.
In June, the giant Hyundai conglomerate won North Korean approval
to launch a cruise ship tour to Diamond Mountain, a major tourist
site on the North's east coast
	   On Thursday, South Korea's Tongil Business Group said it also
has signed an agreement to send up to 400 tourists a day to the
North Korean mountain resort.
	   Pak Po-hi, a top aide to Moon, said the Pyongyang government
approved Tongil's project during his eight-day visit to Pyongyang
that ended Tuesday.
	   Tongil will use high-speed ferries to carry tourists to and from
the north on day trips as early as September, Pak said. Hyundai
plans three- or four-day cruises on luxury liners.
	   Tongil is a South Korean business arm of the Unification Church.
Its subsidiaries are engaged in weapons making, newspapers,
fisheries, real estate, and soft-drink manufacturing.
	   Both Hyundai and Tongil must also obtain South Korean approval
for their North Korean projects. All business deals between the two
Koreas are sensitive to political tensions.
	   North Korea and South Korea fought a bloody three-year war in
the early 1950s that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
South Koreans are required to obtain government approval to visit
North Korea or contact North Koreans.

Ants invade pitch and halt cricket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALVECHURCH, England (AP) _ A bizarre pitch invasion by thousands
of flying ants forced the abandonment of an amateur league cricket
match in Worcestershire.
	   Players and officials from Alvechurch and Dominies Guild cricket
teams tried dousing the marauding invaders with boiling water but
still the insects refused to leave the pitch.
	   The game was finally abandoned with Dominies on 98 for five
chasing the home team's 240 for nine.
	   Warwickshire-based entomologist Bob Ellis said the hot weather
had brought on the ``mating swarm.''
	   He said the insects mate once a year in hot weather and the
swarm is later dispersed by the wind.
	   ``If you are a flying ant this is the big day of your life. The
females fly up to 500 feet and the males catch them,'' he said.
	   He said the ants did not bite and were totally harmless.
	   Worcestershire County Cricket Board secretary Alan Scrafton said
ants occasionally caused interruptions to cricket but it was, he
believed, the first time in cricket history that ants had brought a
permanent end to play.

Verdict on apartheid president delayed for a week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The verdict in the trial of
apartheid-era President P. W. Botha for snubbing a body probing
human rights abuses has been postponed for a week, a lawyer in the
case said on Thursday.
	   With final argument being heard on Monday, Magistrate Victor
Lugaju had originally said he would deliver his judgement on the
following day.
	   However, state prosecutor Bruce Morrison told The Associated
Press that the verdict will now be given on Aug. 24 to allow Lugaju
sufficient time to consider the evidence.
	   ``It was a bit optimistic to think he could give a verdict so
quickly,'' Morrison said.
	   Botha, 82, faces charges of refusing to obey a legal summons to
appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body set
up in 1995 to uncover the facts about apartheid atrocities.
	   The ageing hardliner claims the commission is out to humiliate
him by forcing him to appear personally when he has already given
more than 1,700 pages of written answers to commission questions.
	   During the trial Botha, who has not testified, has been
confronted with evidence that a security body he headed sanctioned
the killing of anti-apartheid activists.
	   The trial is taking place in George, a coastal town about 240
miles (390 kilometres) east of Cape Town and near Botha's
retirement home at Wilderness.
	   If found guilty of contempt, Botha faces up to years in jail or
an unspecified fine. A fine is considered more likely due to
Botha's age and frail health.

Turkmenistan, Iran discuss gas transportation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ Iran failed to secure an agreement
for transporting Turkmenistan's gas to world markets, as a visiting
Iranian minister and the Turkmen president could not agree on the
price during a meeting Thursday.
	   Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi offered Turkmen President
Saparmurat Niyazov dlrs 32 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. But
Niyazov refused, adding that Turkmenistan has even rejected
Russia's offer of dlrs 36 per per 1,000 cubic meters.
	   Transporting Turkmenistan's gas through Iran is the shortest and
cheapest route. However, the United States strongly opposes the
plan, because it considers Iran unreliable, and favors pipeline
routes to Turkey.
	   Turkmenistan, eager to end its poverty through lucrative gas
sales, is considering both routes.
	   But so far, it has failed to agree to a pipeline to Turkey
either. On Thursday, Niyazov said that his country first wants to
settle a dispute with Azerbaijan _ a country through which the
pipeline to Turkey would pass _ over Caspian oil fields.
	   Of the five nations bordering the Caspian, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into
national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores.
	   But Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan both have claims on the same oil
fields.
	   Russia and Iran, which have little or no oil near their coasts,
want the sea's resources to be shared by all.
	   Kharrazi is to travel to Kazakstan on Friday.

Thai central bank prepares for possible bank runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS planned time for announcement and other details;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the government due Friday to
announce a major plan to help Thailand's debt-laden commercial
banks, the country's central bank said it has prepared a large
amount of cash in case of a run by nervous depositors.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda and Bank of Thailand
Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul were to announce the plan in a
nationally televised news conference at 6 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday,
after expected approval from the Cabinet.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Monday that Thailand
will lose some of its weaker banks, possibly through mergers with
stronger institutions, but refused to say if any would be closed
outright.
	   An effective plan is considered essential for reviving the
recession-bound economy. Thailand's financial sector all but
collapsed last year after a slowdown in the economy exposed
insolvency in companies in many sectors of business.
	   Local television stations reported Thursday that small
depositors had rushed to withdraw their money from some of the four
commercial banks taken over by the central bank earlier this year.
But the reports said major clients of those banks did not join the
move.
	   So far, the Bank of Thailand has received no report of any
unusual withdrawals at any banks, central bank deputy governor
Kitti Patpongpibul told reporters Thursday.
	   Kitti said the central bank has asked commercial banks not to
create panic among their depositors by spreading rumors about
closure of their rivals. He said he had heard that branches of
commercial banks in provincial areas had been spreading such rumors
to draw away rivals' depositors.
	   ``There will be no closure of any banks,'' he said.
	   Kitti said the Financial Institutions Development Fund, the
country's bank rescue fund, would be ready to ``inject liquidity''
into the system if commercial banks have problems with their cash
flow.
	   Share prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand ended slightly
lower in moderate trading Thursday ahead of the expected banking
announcement.
	   Dealers said investors expect the central bank may write down
capital of some weak banks as it did with four other commercial
banks earlier this year. They said investors were buying into banks
with adequate capital that are unlikely to be adversely affected by
Friday's announcement.
	   A dealer at Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said some
investors would rather wait to buy shares of strong financial
institutions Friday when market sentiment is expected to be
depressed.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Many analysts now expect the government to
step in and assume their liabilities.
	   Domestic political pressure is rising on the government, with
unemployment expected to hit almost 3 million this year, up from 1
million last year.
	   Opposition politicians have accused the government of committing
billions to prop up financial institutions owned by rich families,
while the poor suffer from factory closures and rising food prices.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to help rescue Thailand's economy.

Israel satisfied with Swiss banks-Holocaust survivors settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel expressed satisfaction Thursday over the
dlrs 1.2 billion settlement reached between Jewish groups, Swiss
banks and lawyers for Holocaust survivors.
	   ``We consider this a step forward in recognition that many
countries and institutions must face their moral obligation and
this... must be resolved everywhere,'' said Bobby Brown, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser on diaspora affairs.
	   Brown added that while ``perfect justice,'' was impossible to
achieve, the settlement over claims to assets lost during World War
II, ``goes a long way.''
	   A spokesman for the World Jewish Restitution Organization _
which has been waging a battle against lower Swiss settlement
offers _ was more tepid in his response, saying the agreement would
have to be examined before he could pass judgment on it.
	   ``All I can say is that the agreement will be brought to our
board for a review where we will study its content and meaning,''
said Yoram Dori, the spokesman.
	   The organization's chairman, Avraham Burg, was unavailable for
comment.
	   There are more than 300,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel, and
thousands have claimed their unpaid assets. Several Holocaust
survivors, while quick to express satisfaction that a deal had been
made, added that they hoped that the more needy survivors would
actually benefit from the settlement.
	   ``The survivors are an aging population in terms of health and
welfare... these monies first and foremost must go to these people,
for psychological help, old age homes and home care,'' said
Jonathan Lemberger, head of AMCHA, a support organization for
Holocaust survivors.
	   The money will be paid out over four years for all claims,
including dormant account claims against two commercial banks _ UBS
AG and the Credit Suisse _ plus the Swiss National Bank, other
Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry, said Marc
Cohen, a lawyer for the banks.
	   Brown said the reparations would be divided between claimants
and needy Holocaust survivors, regardless of whether or not they
had accounts. Some of the money would also be passed along to
educational projects having to do with Holocaust studies, he said.
	   ``We are aging and want to see justice done,'' said Daniel
Chanouch, a 66-year-old Holocaust survivor.

Russian doctors test anti-HIV drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is running clinical tests on a new anti-HIV
drug, which is believed to be less toxic than treatments used in
other countries, a medical expert said Thursday.
	   The medicine, called phosphazide, is believed to have fewer
side-effects than either azidotimidine, which is used to treat HIV
victims in Russia now, or foreign treatments for the virus that
causes AIDS, said Professor Vadim Pokrovsky, head of the Russian
Center for the Prevention and Treatment of AIDS.
	   Doctors have yet to determine what combination of drugs might
make phosphazide more effective, and whether it can be used by
itself, Pokrovsky said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The report provided no other details.
	   Officials have said that 8,956 HIV cases have been registered in
Russia since 1987, with 4,399 of the cases registered last year
alone and nearly 2,000 new cases recorded already this year.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese truck drivers went on strike
Thursday to protest a government decision to curb trucks during the
tourist season.
	   In an unusual move for a government, a Cabinet minister has
welcomed the strike.
	   The strike was called by unions representing truck owners and
the quarrying industry to protest a decision by Mount Lebanon
Governor Mohammed Suheil Yammout to ban trucks from driving during
the morning rush hour and restricting them to certain roads after
that.
	   Yammout said the ban will continue until September 30.
	   Truck drivers have been blamed for aggravating Lebanon's long
traffic jams and for causing road accidents.
	   Environment Minister Akram Chehayeb has endorsed the strike.
	   Referring to the downing of tools by the quarrying union, which
began Wednesday, Chehayeb told national television: ``I really hope
that their strike lasts for a long period to give the country a
brief recess.''
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has decided to abandon its planned
rise in fuel prices, Oil Minister Sheik Saud al-Sabah said in
remarks published Thursday.
	   Sheik Saud told the Al-Watan newspaper that the government had
decided that the price hike of up to 50 percent, announced in May,
was inappropriate.
	   The policy-making Supreme Petroleum Council had recommended the
hike in what was seen as a first step to confront lower oil prices
and reduce the estimated budget deficit of 1.92 billion dinars
(dlrs 6.27 billion) in fiscal 1998-99, which started July 1.
	   The National Assembly asked the government to reconsider the
hike, saying it should save money by reducing wasteful expenditures
instead of reaching into ``the pockets'' of citizens.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has approved contracts
worth dlrs 18 million to sell spare parts to Iraq for its oil
industry, U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said Thursday.
	   The world body has also approved an allocation of dlrs 411
million to upgrade Iraq's electricity network, Falt said.
	   Delivering a weekly press briefing, Falt said the U.N. committee
which supervises the oil-for-food program has approved two
contracts worth 8.89 million to a German company to sell oil pipes,
valves and other pieces of equipment.
	   It has also approved a dlrs 9.3 million contract to a Chinese
company for a tugboat at Iraq's oil terminal. Falt did not name the
companies.
	   Turning to the money allocated to electricity, Falt said dlrs
123.5 million had been earmarked for three provinces in northern
Iraq. The money would be spent on the provision of mobile stations,
power transformers and generators.
	   The rest of the dlrs 411 million would be spent on power
projects in other parts of Iraq.
	   Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to bypass the
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell
limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell
1.73 percent this week, closing at 2,087.5 points, The National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report on the exchange, the company said trading was
selective and focused on stocks of Gulf and investment companies.
	   Some 334.70 million shares changed hands this week, down by
17.85 percent from last week's 407.44 million. The value of these
shares was 59.77 million dinars (dlrs 195.32 million), 33.33
percent lower than last week's value of 89.65 million dinars (dlrs
292.97 million).
	   Of the 75 companies listed, 43 closed lower, 13 closed higher,
and 12 were unchanged. The stocks of 7 companies were not traded,
the report said.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices firmed up but turnover slipped
on the Amman Stock Exchange this week, brokers said Thursday.
	   The market dealt almost exclusively in shares of commercial
banks and industrial firms, brokers said.
	   A stock market report said the 60-company general share prices
index rose by 2.6 percent to 183.6 points. The report was based on
activity during the four business days ending Wednesday.
	   It said shares of commercial banks increased by 3.45 percent,
industrial firms by 0.94 percent, the services sector by 0.03
percent. But shares of insurance firms dropped by 0.29 percent.
	   Turnover slipped by 71.4 percent to 4.59 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 6.5 million), it added.
	   Stocks of 93 firms were traded during the week.

	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, winner of four
tournaments including two majors in her rookie season, bogeyed six
holes and failed to make birdie once in an opening round 78 at the
Women's British Open Thursday.
	   The 20-year-old Korean, tipped to become one of the greats of
women's golf, struggled in the windy conditions at the tricky links
course at Royal Lytham.
	   Pak was seven strokes behind early clubhouse leader Brandie
Burton, winner of he Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, whose
1-under 71 was spoiled by a double bogey six at the 17th.
	   Burton drove into a fairway bunker, played her third shot into
deep rough under a tree and then hit a greenside bunker on the way
to a six. She then birdied the last for the first under-par round
of the day.
	   ``I'm very excited about getting in the red today,'' said the
American, who also birdied the fifth, eighth and 10th. ``Club
selection here was very trying and wore you down mentally.''
	   Dale Reid of Scotland moved level with Burton after 10 holes and
American star Betsy King birdied the seventh to also go 1-under but
most early starters failed to make par.
	   Pak almost made birdie at the tough 17th. Her second shot from
180 yards stayed on the right side of the green and her 35-foot
putt was barely an inch short.
	   ``The wind is really, really strong,'' said Pak, who also saved
par at the last by rolling in a 20-foot putt. ``But it is the same
for all players and I have got to learn and keep working.''
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, who is aiming to win
for the third time in four years, carded a 76, mixing three birdies
with seven bogeys and Liselotte Neumann, titlist here four years
ago, had two double bogeys and three bogeys in a birdie-less 79.
	   Other leading contenders, including big-hitting Briton Laura
Davies, Sweden's Annika Sorenstam and Americans Donna Andrews and
former titlist Emilee Klein, were out later in the day.
	   Pak says she knows it will take a long time before she becomes a
Nancy Lopez or a Betsy King.
	   ``I hear people say that I am one of the top players. I'm not
thinking about that,'' she said.
	   ``I have just started. I want to play for a long, long time and
become like the great players, such as Nancy Lopez and Betsy King.
	   ``To do that I have to keep learning and learning. I watch the
top players to see how they play and how they deal with things. I
don't have pressure because I am still learning.''
	   The Korean won the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Women's Open
and also collected the Jamie Kroger Classic and the Giant Eagle
Classic. Three of her titles came in a run of four events.
	   In comparison with Lopez, she's just about at level par. Winner
of three majors, Lopez won 17 LPGA tournaments in her first two
years as a pro. King didn't start winning until she was seven years
into her pro career but then wo 31.

Swiss banks, industry, Jewish groups welcome Holocaust settlement

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Bankers, Jewish groups and industry in Switzerland
and abroad cautiously welcomed Thursday the two big Swiss
commercial banks' agreement to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to settle
Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   ``We're happy the banks have come to an agreement after
difficult negotiations,'' Swiss Bankers Association spokeswoman
Silvia Matile said.
	   Matile described as ``understandable'' the banks' expectation of
a financial contribution from ``companies and institutions.''
	   The Swiss National Bank welcomed the out-of-court settlement
between the two major Swiss banks and its Jewish plaintiffs as
``positive,'' but said this was not the time to discuss any SNB
contribution.
	   Spokesman Werner Abegg said the bank, responsible for
maintaining the strength of Switzerland's currency, still didn't
have full details of the agreement reached. He said that in his
view, the banks had committed themselves to paying the agreed sum.
	   The question of a financial contribution from third parties has
been postponed to a later phase, he said, adding that the delay
would allow the agreement to be studied in detail without time
pressure. He didn't specify a date.
	   Credit Suisse spokesman Ulrich Pfister acknowledged that the
accord would meet some criticism in Switzerland. There were mixed
reactions from the main political parties.
	   A spokesman for the World Jewish Restitution Organization, which
campaigned for a large settlement, said it would have to examine
the agreement before commenting.
	   ``All I can say is that the agreement will be brought to our
board for a review, where we will study its content and meaning,''
spokesman Yoram Dori said.
	   Switzerland's main Jewish organization, the Swiss Confederation
of Hebrew Congregations, said it expected the accord would ease the
tension over the Holocaust issue.
	   ``We also hope it will establish a basis for a better
understanding between all those involved,'' said its general
secretary, Martin Rosenfeld.
	   Sigi Feigel, honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of
Zurich, said he was ``happy for the victims'' but felt ``personally
ashamed and humiliated'' over the ``exaggerated demands'' and
accusations that led to the accord.
	   In Paris, Serge Klarsfeld, president of the Association of Sons
and Daughters of Jews Deported from France, said the dlrs 1.25
billion to be paid by the Swiss banks was a good compromise.
	   ``It will improve the quality of life of a lot of Jews in
eastern Europe and will help those who lived during the Holocaust
to finish their lives in decent conditions,'' said Klarsfeld,
speaking on the France Info radio station.
	   In London, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said in a
statement it is ``looking to the Swiss banks and Swiss people for
the moral restitution which will come from absorbing the lessons of
the past two years.''
	   Switzerland's main industry body, Vorort, said the banks'
settlement was in the Swiss economy's interest. But its president,
Andres F. Leuenberger, said any contributions from industry would
have to be discussed.
	   A spokesman for engineering group Sulzer said it was ready to
financially contribute to the settlement.
	   Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis welcomed the
accord, saying they were ready for a dialogue with the banks, but
left open the question of a contribution.
	   On Swiss radio, leaders of Switzerland's main political parties
gave mixed reaction.
	   Socialist Party leader Ursula Koch said the agreement would
benefit all concerned. Adalbert Durrer, president of the
right-of-center Christian People's Party, agreed the accord was
good news.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
he regretted the combination of legal action and sanction threats
had achieved its objective.
	   Ueli Maurer, president of the right-of-center Swiss People's
Party, said his party was opposed to any financial contribution to
the settlement by the government or the Swiss National Bank.
	   The committee of independent historians set up to investigate
Switzerland's wartime past stressed its work continues. It expects
to publish a report on Switzerland's wartime refugee policy next
spring.

Centerfold still male ideal, but study offers sexiness surprise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: embargoed until 2301 GMT; time set by source &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It's hardly shocking: A new study has determined
men find a centerfold model's figure the most attractive shape.
But, surprisingly, scientists also found that women who aren't
Playboy material are sexier if they weigh more than a centerfold
rather than less.
	   It all relates subconciously to the perception of health and
fertility, according to the study of 40 male undergraduates
published in the latest issue of the Lancet, a weekly British
medical journal.
	   It turns out that the hourglass shape, while still the yardstick
of the female ideal, is actually a less important factor than the
overall size of a woman's body, according to the study's leader,
Martin Tovee, a psychologist at Newcastle University in northern
England.
	   Traditionally, the ratio of a woman's waist to her hips
determines how attractive she is, with a score of 0.7 _ which
includes the classic hourglass shape _ considered ideal because it
is thought to represent a fat distribution that leads to maximum
fertility, Tovee said.
	   Though some anorexic women also conform to the ratio, they can
be infertile, he said.
	   Tovee and his colleagues compared the importance of the
waist-hip ratio with that of body-mass index, which measures weight
relative to height. They showed a group of white, middle-class
university students 50 photographs of white women wearing identical
gray leotards and tights, with their faces and hair blocked out.
	   The students were asked to rank the bodies, which were divided
into five categories from underweight to obese. Various waist-hip
ratios were represented in each category.
	   The scientists found that the waist-hip rule correlated poorly
with attractiveness, while small changes in body-mass index could
alter the rank substantially.
	   ``The shape was only a secondary cue,'' Tovee said.
	   The students consistently chose an ideal with a body-mass index
of 18 to 20, the supermodel range, he said. But when the bodies got
heavier, the incremental decrease in attractiveness was slow
compared to when the figures got skinnier.
	   ``Even slightly below the ideal, it dropped hugely _ as does
fertility,'' Tovee said. ``It showed you're much, much better off
being too fat than too thin.''
	   The average woman has a body-mass index of 24 to 26.
	   On the body-mass index scale, a woman 5-foot-6 (1.5 meters) and
weighing 160 pounds would have a body mass index of 26, which some
experts consider overweight. At 185 pounds, she would have an index
of 30 and would be considered obese.
	   BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of
the person's height in meters. It also can be calculated by
dividing weight in pounds by height in inches squared, and
multiplying the result by 704.5.

Malaysia unveils its first world-class concert hall

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Thursday unveiled its
first world-class concert hall, soon to reverberate with the gongs
of Indonesian gamelan music and the strains of the Philadelphia
Orchestra.
	   Its benefactor, the state oil and gas company, Petronas, spared
no expenses building the 865-seat auditorium.
	   The warm, wood-trimmed hall is patterned along the traditional
shoe-box design of 19th century European concert halls. It features
an adjustable ceiling that flexes according to the acoustical
conditions required by a fully staffed orchestra or a solo pianist.
	   Echo-dampening panels line the walls and balconies. A 44-stop
pipe organ, stretching from floor to ceiling, towers over the
orchestra pit.
	   The entire hall rests on thick pads that cocoon it from the din
of shoppers striding through the country's largest shopping mall
next door. It sits at the foot of the 88-story Petronas Twin
Towers, the world's tallest buildings.
	   Petronas, which also built the massive skyscrapers, is undaunted
by the steep costs amid the looming recession.
	   ``It's been our long-term dream,'' said Azizan Zainul Abidin,
the chairman of Petronas, noting the concert hall would be a great
step in fulfilling Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's dream of
engineering a developed nation by the year 2020.
	   ``The people of Malaysia have waited for so long, we shouldn't
deny them the opportunity of listening to our own world-class
orchestra,'' he said.
	   Azizan said most of the costs were budgeted last year, before
the current Asian economic crisis shattered the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange and sent the local currency plummeting by more than 40
percent against the dollar.
	   ``The cost is substantial but small compared to Petronas'
revenue,'' the oil magnate said of the Fortune 500,
government-backed company.
	   ``The expenditure won't break the camel's back,'' he said,
though he wouldn't reveal how much Petronas spent.
	   Although the concert hall has been built, Petronas will still
have to dig deep into its pockets: the oil company is also
sponsoring the country's first professional orchestra, the 105-part
Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.
	   The musicians come from around the world, including the United
States, Hungary, Australia and the Czech Republic; there are six
Malaysians.
	   Director and Dutch conductor Kees Bakel will lead the MPO in its
inaugural performance Wednesday evening. The formal program, which
formally begins in September, features guest artists such as
conductor Yehudi Menuhin, pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and solo
percussionist Evelyn Glennie.
	   Interspersed between the Western classical music concerts will
be Asian musicians who will play Indonesian gamelan gongs and Malay
dance-drama performances.
	   The MPO's resident conductor, Malaysian Ooi Chean See, left her
homeland for Germany two decades ago because she couldn't eke out a
living as a professional musician in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``I'm ecstatic to be back,'' Ooi said. ``Now there are
opportunities for Malaysians to pursue a professional career here.
And I'm delighted that my fellow Malaysians will have music all
year round.''

Iraq hopes thousands of Iranian pilgrims will come starting
</HEADLINE>
Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first batch of Iranian pilgrims to
cross the Iran-Iraq border in 18 years is scheduled to arrive in
Iraq on Saturday, officials said Thursday.
	   The pilgrims will number no more than 220, according to the
Iranian authorities, but Iraq hopes that will soon rise to the
12,000 per month that the two states agreed on.
	   ``All holy shrines in Iraq are well-prepared for the Iranian
pilgrims,'' said Alladin al-Qaisi, adviser to the Religious Affairs
Minister. ``We will empty the shrines so they can pray without
disturbance.''
	   Iraq hopes that the pilgrims, who by tradition deliver gifts to
the shrines, will help reverse its desperate shortage of foreign
currency. Pilgrimage tourism is one of the few forms of
international trade that Iraq is allowed to engage in under the
sweeping U.N. sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its Shiite Muslim people to have
access to the Shiite shrines in Baghdad, Samara, Karbala and Najaf.
	   Despite their common interest in pilgrimages, Iran and Iraq took
about nine months to negotiate the pilgrimages _ such was the
residue of mistrust from the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. More than a
million people were killed or wounded in the war, which halted
pilgrimages when it started in 1980.
	   In choosing its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly gave
preference to ``parents of the martyrs of the sacred defense'' _
parents of those killed during the war.
	   To receive the pilgrims, Iraq has rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border
post, which was destroyed during the war.
	   Once they arrive, the pilgrims will be shepherded around by a
government-appointed company whose buses will take them from the
border to the shrines, their hotels, and back to the border
according to a fixed program.
	   There will be no free-traveling pilgrims and very little
opportunity for Iranians to socialize with Iraqis.

Sony modifies video camera models because of `see through' use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sony Corp. said Thursday it has modified five
models of its popular Handycam video camera because they can be
used with a special filter to ``see through'' some kinds of
clothing.
	   The modifications were ordered after a popular men's magazine
carried an article showing the Handycam's infrared technology can
be used to see through light colored clothing or some bathing
suits, said Sony spokesman Hiroaki Komatsu.
	   ``We never imagined such a use would be possible,'' he said.
	   The Takarajima magazine reported in its Aug. 5 issue that a
filter costing only 1,000 yen (less than dlrs 7) can enable users
of the Handycam to see the underwear of lightly dressed people or
beneath swimsuits when the camera's ``night shot'' mode is
activated during daytime.
	   ``Our tests later showed that it is possible to see through
clothing with the use of a filter,'' Komatsu said. He said the
video camera's infrared technology was intended for taking pictures
of nocturnal animals or birds.
	   The Takarajima article was accompanied by a dozen photos it said
were taken with the camera, including eight used to illustrate
results with different colors of clothing, wet or dry, on women
models.
	   In the photos, the most revealing effects did not achieve total
transparency, but were more like viewing through a thin curtain.
Certain areas usually hidden were apparent, but not clearly
defined.
	   In the United States, Bob Moisan, general manager of Newtonville
Camera and Video in Newton, Massachusetts, was quoted as saying in
Thursday's Boston Globe that he couldn't get any of the cameras in
his store to ``see through'' clothing.
	   ``It was sort of surrealistic and eerie looking,'' Moisan said.
``Everything had a washed-out look, but you had the illusion of
seeing flesh.''
	   The company this week started selling modified Handycams to
prevent abuse of the infrared mode, Komatsu said. He refused to
explain how the cameras are being modified.
	   Sony has sold 1.08 million Handycams with the infrared mode
worldwide, including 180,000 in Japan, 400,000 in North America and
290,000 in Europe.

Iranians demonstrate outside Pakistan Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A group of Iranians held a demonstration
outside the Pakistani Embassy Thursday to demand the release of
their relatives allegedly captured in Afghanistan, the official
news agency said.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the protesters were
relatives of 11 Iranians captured by the hard-line Taliban militia
in the northern Afghan city of Mazare-e Sharif, which the Taliban
overran on Saturday.
	   Tehran says that all in all 11 Iranian diplomats, an IRNA
correspondent and 32 Iranian truck drivers were seized by the
Taliban.
	   A similar protest was held on Wednesday outside the Pakistan
Embassy by IRNA colleagues of the agency's reporter in Mazar-e
Sharif.
	   Thursday's demonstrators carried placards demanding the
immediate release of the diplomats and chanted ``death to Taliban''
and ``Pakistan is responsible for the safety of diplomats.''
	   There were no reports of clashes. Scuffles erupted during
Wednesday's protest as scores of demonstrators tried to force their
way into the embassy compound.
	   Tehran has said it holds Islamabad responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Pakistan is widely believed to back the Taliban,
which is battling a northern-based opposition alliance.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran is widely believed to have supplied arms to the
anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan. Newspaper reports have quoted
Iranian officials as saying the captured truck drivers worked for
an international company transporting food to Mazar-e-Sharif. The
reports did not name the company.

Dutch insurance giant posts 45 percent profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Aegon NV, one of the world's top
10 insurance companies, said Thursday its net profit in the first
half of the year rose 45 percent to 1.31 billion guilders (dlrs 655
million), partly because of strong gains by U.S.-based Providian.
	   The results were at the low end of expectations, but were
nonetheless up sharply from the 906 million guilder (dlrs 453
million) net profit posted for the same period a year ago.
	   Aegon said its net profit for all of 1998 should increase by 25
percent and projected earnings per share for the year to rise by 20
percent.
	   Chairman Kees Storm said the company's positive outlook was
based on the group's continued growth in life and pension
insurances, as well as related financial services.
	   ``We are putting great effort into expanding these activities in
all group units,'' Storm said.
	   Providian, which Aegon acquired late in 1996, contributed 16
percent to the growth of income per share. Aegon began including
Providian's figures in its earnings in the third quarter of 1997.

Albanian official reportedly admits CIA operating in the country,
</HEADLINE>
even in the north near Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is
operating in Albania, helping rebuild the country's internal
security capability, the head of the Albanian Secret Service was
quoted Thursday as saying.
	   In an interview with the independent newspaper Shekulli, Fatos
Klosi said that relations between his Albanian Secret Service, or
SHIK, and the CIA ``were intensified in the last months'' and that
``CIA specialists'' were operating in the country.
	   ``They even have offices in the north,'' he added, referring to
the area near the border with Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, where
the Kosovo Liberation Army maintains sanctuaries.
	   ``They are assisting us in rebuilding of the SHIK,'' Klosi was
quoted by the newspaper, which is believed to have excellent
contacts in the country's security and defense establishment.
	   Efforts to contact Albanian officials or U.S. diplomats in
Tirana were unsuccessful.
	   Albania's secret police, as well as virtually all other
government institutions, collapsed last year during riots which
broke out following the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in
which many people lost their life savings.
	   A possible connection between American security authorities and
their counterparts in this former Communist country emerged
following the arrests of four Egyptians, who were reportedly
spirited out of Albania by Americans.
	   One day before the blasts at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the Arabic language newspaper al-Hayat published a letter
from the ``International Islamic Front for Jihad'' vowing revenge
against the United States for the arrests of several of its members
in Albania.
	   The letter was apparently referring to four Egyptians arrested
quietly in Tirana in June and July. Albanian sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they were wanted on terrorist charges
in Egypt, and U.S. agents took them out of the country.
	   Egypt has made no public comment on the case nor confirmed that
the four are in its custody.
	   Albanian sources said the four were sought in the October 1990
assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub, the speaker of the Egyptian
parliament, and an abortive attempt several years later to blow up
the Khan Khalili public market in Cairo.
	   Three of the four had been working for the Islamic Revival
Foundation, a private charity which helps poor Muslims in Albania.
The Albanian sources said they suspect some foreign charity groups
may be a cover for illegal activities, including weapons and drug
smuggling.
	   Al-Hayat said the fourth person arrested was a man identified as
a member of the Jihad group founded last year by Ayman al-Zawahry,
an Egyptian believed to be living in Afghanistan.
	   There is no known evidence indicating Islamic groups were
involved in the two bombings, which have drawn mixed reactions in
the Islamic world.

Ukraine's premier continues campaign against tax debtors

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Ukrainian prime minister has launched a
new crackdown on tax debtors, ordering authorities to seize
personal cars from directors of non-paying companies and to impose
severe fines on those who don't pay.
	   If these steps fail, the top executives of debtor organizations
will be prosecuted, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said in
comments cited Thursday by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``After fines we'll have to resort to criminal proceedings,'' he
said.
	   Pustovoitenko said police were ordered to help tax officials
seize vehicles from debtor businesses, while tax officials will
travel around the country to monitor payment of debts.
	   The latest order came Wednesday evening, after Pustovoitenko
summoned nearly 1,500 business executives and regional officials
from among the top debtors to a civil defense forest base near the
capital Kiev.
	   He said the debtors would live in tents and listen to lectures
on natural disasters until they agree to pay their overdue taxes.
	   Ukraine has been plagued with poor tax collection since
independence in 1991. The situation became critical this year, with
the government spending more than 90 percent of budget revenues to
cover foreign debts.
	   The government is currently owed 7 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.5
billion) in taxes, or about a third of annual budget revenues. The
debt to the state pension fund stands at 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.5
billion).
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said the financially
struggling government had no alternative.
	   ``It's extremely difficult for the government to work under
present circumstances,'' he told the Dyen newspaper. ``I think the
Cabinet has the right to carry out such actions.''
	   Apart from massive foreign debt obligations, the government
desperately needs money to pay back salaries, some of which date
back to 1997.
	   The prime minister's tax crackdown has yielded few results so
far.
	   The debtor executives, who were sent to the tent camp after
suffering heavy criticism at a government meeting in Kiev last
week, have so far channeled less than 100 million hryvna (dlrs 47
million) to the pension fund, and 63 million hryvna (dlrs 31.5
million) to the budget.
	   On Thursday, the Cabinet appealed to all government employees to
surrender 50 percent of their August salaries to the pension fund.

	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian army joined firefighters Thursday to
help tame a blaze in central Italy that has destroyed more than a
thousand hectares (2,400 acres) of forest and forced the evacuation
of 50 residents.
	   Workers used three planes and a helicopter to dump water on the
flames raging near the towns of Badia and San Martino in the region
of Abruzzo, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Rome.
	   Other fires continued to burn in the region of Liguria, Emilia

Freeport denies higher salaries were promised in labor dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A huge gold and copper mining company
in the Indonesian part of New Guinea denied Thursday that striking
workers had been promised bigger pay raises than they received.
	   ``The strikers' dissatisfaction over the compensation package is
based on unfounded rumors, instigated to agitate the company's work
force,'' said a statement from the Jakarta office of Freeport
Indonesia, a unit of the New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper
and Gold Inc.
	   About 5,000 workers of the company's mine in Timika, Irian Jaya,
began a strike Monday to demand pay raises bigger than the 10
percent recently granted.
	   The strike has resulted in a temporary suspension of all its
activities in the remote area in western New Guinea, 3,450
kilometers (2,160 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   Earlier reports quoted workers as saying the management in New
Orleans had promised a 50 percent increase, and the workers blamed
company officials in Jakarta and Timika for the smaller raise.
	   ``The Freeport-McMoRan management in New Orleans, Louisiana,
U.S.A., never made a promise of a 50 percent pay increase for the
workers,'' the Freeport Indonesia statement said.
	   The strike was launched by contracted employees. The company
said the workers cited reasons including economic and other
employment issues and a desire to become regular Freeport Indonesia
employees, who generally have higher wages and more attractive
benefits.
	   The statement quoted Adrianto Machribie, president of Freeport
Indonesia, as saying raises granted in four stages since October
have amounted to a 40 percent increase.
	   An officer in the company's mining town of Tembagapura said
Thursday the strike was continuing and offices were closed.
	   Negotiations were under way among company officials, workers,
union representatives and officials from Indonesia's Ministry of
Mines and Energy.

Two people dead and one missing after boat of Scottish tourists

capsizes &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with police identifying survivors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMONE, Italy (AP) _ Two Scottish tourists were found dead and a
third was missing Thursday after their motor boat capsized on Lake
Garda during a wind storm.
	   Workers cleaning the lake early Thursday managed to rescue four
others who had set out on the boat Wednesday afternoon. Police
first said the group was from Germany but later said they were
residents of Scotland.
	   Officer Massimo Belizzari identified the dead as Richard Harris
and a six-year-old boy whose name was not immediately known. He
said several vessels were searching for a missing 13-year old who
was presumed dead.
	   The survivors said they were out on the lake when the wind
suddenly picked up, creating huge waves, according to Belizzari. He
said the seven were separated after the boat capsized.
	   The tourists had rented the motor boat at a local shop.
	   Belizzari identified the survivors as Aberdeen residents, John,
Andrew and Alison Lilley, and Kathrine Harris. They were taken to a
hospital in the nearby town of Desenzano where they were being
treated for exposure after spending the night in the water.
	   Authorities said they had received several distress calls from
other vessels in trouble on the lake Wednesday due to the rough
water and high winds.
	   The lake, situated about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of
Milan, is a popular tourist site for swimming and boating.

Russia to limit caviar exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to protect its dwindling sturgeon
population, Russia will restrict caviar exports, a government
official said Thursday.
	   An order to introduce export quotas has been drafted and
presented to the Cabinet for approval, said Dmitry Sukhoparov, a
high-ranking official at the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Another ministry official, Marina Lvova, said the order was
aimed against the many sturgeon poachers in the country and would
not hurt legal producers ``because the size of the quota reflects
their potential possibilities.''
	   Officials did not say how big the quota would be, or when it was
likely to go into effect.
	   Russia has enacted stringent restrictions on fishing for
sturgeon, which are threatened by overfishing and pollution in the
Caspian Sea, but authorities continue to report poaching.
	   The Caspian, which laps the shores of Iran and the former Soviet
republics of Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan, is
home to most of the world's sturgeon.

Report: Third person nabbed for spreading riot rumors on Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from foreign minister, last two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A third person has been arrested
for allegedly using the Internet to spread rumors about rioting
that led to panic in the capital last week, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A special police team investigating how rumors were spread last
Friday arrested a 30-year-old bank employee Wednesday, the Star
newspaper said.
	   On Tuesday, a Malaysian man and woman, both in their 20s, were
arrested under the Internal Security Act after police enlisted
Internet service providers and technology experts to track their
on-line activities.
	   Investigators said they had discovered the origin of the
Internet messages that sparked panic shopping for food in many
parts of Kuala Lumpur, the Star said.
	   ``We don't really know how many messages are floating. However,
we believe there are only a few original ones,'' the daily quoted
Muhammed Awang Lah, vice president of service provider Mimos, as
saying.
	   The three suspects could be detained for up to 60 days without
trial and face a two-year prison term.
	   A Malaysian human rights group, SUARAM, condemned local
authorities for using the dreaded ISA to ``drive fear into the
hearts and minds of thinking citizens'' who use the Internet.
	   ``We urge that the ... individuals be allowed to have their case
heard in open court,'' Elizabeth Wong, coordinator for SUARAM, said
in a faxed statement. ``Otherwise, we will never know if they are
guilty or mere pawns detained without a single shred of evidence
and proof.''
	   Kuala Lumpur has been rife with rumors, spread via the Internet
and then by word of mouth, that Indonesians have been amassing
knives and machetes.
	   On Friday evening, word spread that Indonesian illegal
immigrants in a downtown neighborhood had begun to riot in protest
against an Aug. 15 deadline to deport foreigners who had not
applied to renew their work permits.
	   The panic subsided when police opened a hot line to answer
public concerns and after national radio and television broadcast
messages from officials.
	   Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi warned writers
and literary figures to be responsible social critics.
	   The government will tolerate people who ``criticize against what
they saw to be not right,'' he was quoted as saying by the national
news agency Bernama. ``But they must be prepared to face the
consequences for doing something which can spark an uproar.''

Fourteen persons killed in attacks in Kashmir

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Encounters between separatist guerrillas
and security forces and firing by Pakistani army soldiers on
Thursday killed 14 people and injured at least 10 others in
Jammu-Kashmir state, officials said.
	   Two Indian army soldiers were killed in continued exchange of
mortar and gun fire with Pakistani soldiers across their disputed
cease-fire line, which has raged for two weeks.
	   Details were not immediately available of the incident at Karna
in Kupwara sector, 130 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of state
capital Srinagar.
	   A land mine went off in Khandroo village in Anantnag district
when an army convoy was passing through, killing two soldiers,
injuring six others and destroying a truck, officials said. The
area is 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Srinagar.
	   In other encounters, three soldiers, six militants and a
civilian were killed and four soldiers were wounded, officials
said.
	   Militants have been fighting Indian soldiers since 1989 for
Kashmir's independence, a battle that has left more than 15,000
people dead so far.

Filipinos pelt U.S. Embassy with eggs to protest visiting forces

pact &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Demonstrators pelted the U.S. Embassy
with dozens of eggs Thursday to protest an agreement that would
allow U.S. troops to train in the Philippines.
	   About 500 protesters from several leftist groups marched to the
seaside U.S. Embassy, which has been guarded more heavily by Manila
police since last week's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   Police, however, allowed the protesters to stage a 30-minute
demonstration in front of the embassy. When the demonstration was
about to end, some protesters threw eggs at the embassy gates
before dispersing peacefully.
	   The pact, called the Visiting Forces Agreement, has already been
signed by the two sides, but must still be approved by the
Philippine Senate.
	   But the unequal handling of criminal jurisdiction under the pact
and a companion agreement covering Philippine troops in the United
States could potentially stall its ratification.
	   On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said that
Filipino troops who commit crimes during military exercises in the
United States will be subject to local law, unlike Americans who
break the law while training in the Philippines.
	   The criminal jurisdiction issue has been especially sensitive in
the Philippines, where many groups have opposed the pact.
	   Critics say the accord infringes on Philippine sovereignty
because it limits the Manila government's right to prosecute
American soldiers who commit crimes here.
	   They say the presence of foreign troops could also promote
prostitution.
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for
crimes committed here.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

Love Toys? Now you can buy the museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fancy a trip back into childhood? Or maybe you're
just nuts about toys?
	   Six million pounds (dlrs 10 million) buys the London Toy and
Model Museum, two Victorian houses containing some 7,000 toys, a
cafe, shop, garden and steam train.
	   The museum is in Bayswater, west London, a stone's throw from
the home of J.M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and five minutes
from Paddington Station, where the lovable bear of the same name
set down his suitcase with its ''Wanted on Voyage'' label.
	   The museum traces the social and commercial history of toys up
to the present day. Its collection spans 16 galleries on four
floors, themed according to subject rather than chronology.
	   There are moving displays, a library _ and a garden, which has a
steam train ride, several model railway layouts and a children's
carousel ride.
	   Since it was opened in 1982 by a group of private collectors,
the museum has grown rapidly, and now attracts some 120,000
visitors a year. It has won several awards.
	   The owners, an unidentified property and hotel group, are
selling the museum by private arrangement through auctioneers
Sotheby's.
	   A Sotheby's spokeswoman said it was most likely the museum would
be bought by an overseas firm perhaps looking for a business base
in Britain.
	   ``But there's no reason why a very rich individual who just
wants a huge private toy collection couldn't make an offer,'' she
said.

New members sworn in for Indonesian assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government appointed 38 new
members, including two senior military officers, to Indonesia's top
legislature Thursday.
	   The group was sworn in as members of the People's Consultative
Assembly, which is to convene Nov. 10 to set a timetable for
democratic reform in 1999, including the holding of parliamentary
elections, probably in May.
	   The 1,000-member assembly will also debate calls to reduce its
size before it selects a new president by December next year.
	   The official Antara news agency said the new members include
army chief of staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo and former Jakarta
military chief Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Syamsuddin.
	   Of the 38 new members, 21 are serving or retired armed forces
officers.
	   In Indonesia, the military has a constitutional duty to play an
active role in lawmaking.
	   All the new members were appointed by President B.J. Habibie,
who came to power in May after riots and protests led to the
resignation of Suharto.
	   With the end of Suharto's 32-year autocratic rule, Habibie has
pledged to institute political freedoms as the nation struggles
with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Habibie, who had been Suharto's vice president, has also
indicated that he will stand for the presidency when the assembly
decides the matter late next year.
	   So far, 154 members of the assembly have been replaced since
Habibie took power, including several of Suharto's relatives and
children.
	   Many of those who have left the assembly did so because of
allegations of nepotism.
	   The assembly, made up of 500 government appointees and 500
members of parliament, normally meets only once every five years.
	   Last time it came together, it unanimously voted Suharto to a
seventh consecutive five-year term as president.

Ukrainian officials threaten to freeze fleet's bank accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian officials threatened Thursday to
freeze bank accounts of the Black Sea Fleet's Russian portion
unless it pays its debts to the Crimean city of Sevastopol, a news
report said.
	   The Russian portion of the former Soviet fleet, based in
Sevastopol, owes about 5.5 million hryvna (dlrs 2.75 million) to
the city's communal services, Sevastopol municipal administration
chief Borys Kucher said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The powerful fleet long has been a sore point in relations
between the two former Soviet republics. Since the 1991 Soviet
collapse, they have argued over how to divide the fleet and its
infrastructure.
	   The sides finally signed an agreement on the fleet's division
last year, leaving Russia with 338 vessels and 106 aircraft served
by 25,000 military personnel, and Ukraine with about 120 vessels.
	   But the deal remains to be ratified by the two nations'
parliaments. In Russia, many hard-line legislators oppose the
treaty, feeling that it strengthens Kiev's hold on the mainly
ethnic Russian Crimea, part of Ukraine since 1954.

Juventus coach fires back at Zeman on doping accusations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus coach Marcello Lippi has fired back at AS
Roma coach Zdenek Zeman and denied accusations that his players
took performance-enhancing substances.
	   ``This is an act of cowardice,'' Lippi was quoted as saying in
Thursday's papers. ``I think it's a way to justify that the fact
the others win and he (Zeman) does not,'' he added.
	   Lippi, the coach of the Italian league champion Juventus,
contended that Zeman should be disqualified for five years.
	   The uproar stemmed from Zeman's remarks last week to the
newsweekly Espresso in which he said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of players including Alessandro Del Piero and
Gianluca Vialli.
	   The two players were summoned for questioning by Turin
porsecutor Raffaele Guariniello. The meeting with La Juve's Del
Piero was scheduled for Friday. Vialli, a former player of Juventus
and currently Chelsea's player-coach in the English Premier League,
will be in Turin early next week, news reports said.
	   Guariniello also questioned Zeman on Wednesday, a day after the
Czech coach had a meeting with the Italian Olympic Committee's
anti-doping commission. In both cases he stuck to his allegations.
	   ``I would do the whole thing all over again,'' Zeman was quoted
as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Vialli, Del Piero and Juventus have all announced that they are
suing Zeman for libel.

Dutch insurance giant posts 45 percent profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Aegon NV, one of the world's top
10 insurance companies, said Thursday its net profit in the first
half of the year rose 45 percent to 1.31 billion guilders (dlrs 655
million), partly because of strong gains by U.S.-based Providian.
	   The results were at the low end of expectations, but were
nonetheless up sharply from the 906 million guilder (dlrs 453
million) net profit posted for the same period a year ago.
	   Aegon said its net profit for all of 1998 should increase by 25
percent and projected earnings per share for the year to rise by 20
percent.
	   Chairman Kees Storm said the company's positive outlook was
based on the group's continued growth in life and pension
insurances, as well as related financial services.
	   ``We are putting great effort into expanding these activities in
all group units,'' Storm said.
	   Providian, which Aegon acquired late in 1996, contributed 16
percent to the growth of income per share. Aegon began including
Providian's figures in its earnings in the third quarter of 1997.

Pakistan umpire short changed?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Cricket Council defended its pay
scale for umpires Thursday after a British newspaper claimed Javed
Akhtar received only 158 pounds (dlrs 260) for umpiring the fifth
test between England and South Africa.
	   An ICC spokesman said the Pakistani umpire had received a
662-pound (dlrs 1,088) match payment plus 600 pounds (dlrs 986) for
expenses, a business-class airfare and accommodation.
	   Akhtar's match payment comprised what he would have received in
Pakistan, which was 12,000 rupees (dlrs 266), plus the maximum ICC
test fee of 500 pounds (dlrs 822).
	   The Daily Mail reported Aktar had received a minimal payment for
officiating in the five-day game while his English counterpart
received 2,755 (dlrs 4,529).
	   The disparity was highlighted after Akhtar gave seven
controversial decisions as England clinched the test series 2-1
with a 23-run win in the fifth test at Headingley.
	   England's Peter Willey, who shared the responsibilities in the
crucial test, picked up the basic salary for a professional umpire
adjudicating in a test plus a bonus for his 11th test appearance.
	   Britain's domestic news agency said Akthar would have earned
more money per day doing an eight-hour shift at burger-chain
restaurant McDonalds.
	   However, England's Umpires Association chairman Barrie
Leadbeater said Enlish umpires were paid more because they were the
only full-time officials making a living out of the game.
	   ``It is difficult to justify paying the others so much less but
if they were paid the same they would be rich men in their own
countries, where the living standards are lower,'' he said.
	   The ICC released a statement saying umpire fees vary from
country to country, as did players' fees, according to differences
in scale of cricket operations and variations in currency.
	   ``Recognising the differences in fee levels, the ICC fee is set
on a scale basis, ranging from 200 pounds (dlrs 330) per Test for
the highest paid umpires to 500 pounds (dlrs 882) for the lowest
paid. Pakistan umpires are at this level,'' the statement said.

Criticism surrounds Germany's new Berlin Wall Memorial
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany dedicated a freshly plastered, partially
rebuilt stretch of the Berlin Wall as its official memorial to the
country's postwar division Thursday, amid complaints that the
monument fails to convey the suffering surrounding the original.
	   Erected at a cost of 2.3 million marks (dlrs 1.3 million), the
70-meter (230-foot) long Berlin Wall Memorial includes one of the
few remaining segments of the original outer wall, patched up after
years of deterioration and the hacking of souvenir hunters.
	   A ``death strip'' of swept gravel fills the space between the
original wall and an reconstructed inner wall _ the one that faced
East Berlin _ with cracks just big enough for visitors to peer
through.
	   The walls are squared off by two even taller stainless steel
walls meant to serve as mirrors and give the impression that the
wall goes on indefinitely.
	   Most of the 43-kilometer (27 mile) long original wall was torn
down in the euphoria surrounding the end of the East German
communism regime in 1989-90, and some worry that memories of the
tragedies that surrounded it are also disappearing.
	   At the dedication ceremony, held on the 37th anniversary of the
day East Germany started building the wall, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen
said he would have liked to see more of the wall remain as a living
reminder to future generations.
	   The relatively small memorial ``can't nearly render the
perfected cruelty and inhumanity of the (East German) system,'' he
said ``However, it's necessary and correct to preserve in an
artistic way this little piece out of the history of the
dictatorship.''
	   Echoing a debate still raging about the city's planned Holocaust
Memorial, critics complain the wall memorial is too sanitized, with
no attempt made to educate visitors about the 255 people killed
trying to cross the wall, or how it tore families and friends
apart.
	   The memorial on Bernauer Street, which ran along the wall in
West Berlin, was the site of more escape attempts, many through
famed tunnels, than any other section.
	   But the former guard post there has been moved to the newly
opened Allied Museum in another part of the city.
	   The 5-meter (16-foot) tall stainless steel plates on either end
in fact look far more imposing than the wall itself, which is only
half as tall. And critics note the stainless steel must be polished
after every rain or it loses it reflective quality.
	   ``This artistic elevation has the effect of making the wall look
harmless,'' said Klaus-Peter Eich, who was shot in the back and
paralyzed in his attempt to cross the wall in October 1961. He
attended the dedication ceremony in a wheel chair.
	   ``Future generations won't get a real impression of how terrible
it was,'' he said.
	   Eich, representing a group of wall victims, fought to get the
inscription on the plaque changed to remember not only the division
of the city but also ``the victims of communist tyranny.''
	   He also wants the names of all known victims inscribed on the
back of the steel walls, and called on the federal government to
back a comprehensive Wall Museum dedicated to documentation and
academic research.
	   A church across the street has a small exhibit, and the
Checkpoint Charlie museum is a private initiative dealing mostly
with attempts to breach the wall and with German unification.
	   ``We have a duty to make sure that the crimes of the East German
communists are not disguised or forgotten,'' he said. Only by
coming to terms with the past can we ``hope for a world without
violence and terror in the future.''

The Hungarian GP could be decisive Formula One race

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Michael Schumacher spent the week
following the German Grand Prix test driving his Ferrari. Mika
Hakkinen did some testing, but also took a few days of vacation.
	   The different approach reflects the drivers' standings in the
Formula One championship: Hakkinen has a 16-point lead over
Schumacher.
	   Schumacher cannot allow Hakkinen to race away away with another
victory in Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix if he is to keep alive his
hopes of capturing his third title.
	   Hakkinen comes to Hungary bolstered by victories in the last two
races, in Austria and in Germany, on Schumacher's home circuit in
Hockenheim on Aug. 2.
	   Schumacher was only fifth in Hockenheim, after a frustrating
weekend that saw his Ferrari unable to keep up with the pace of the
McLaren-Mercedes cars driven by Hakkinen and David Coulthard.
Hakkinen and Coulthard finished 1-2 in both Austria and Germany.
	   ``We tested a lot last week,'' Schumacher said. ``Obviously, I
was disappointed by our performance in Germany, for the fans but
also because the car was not performing well.''
	   While Schumacher covered 1,200 kilometers (700 miles) in testing
on Ferrari's home track in Fiorano, Hakkinen savored his
back-to-back victories by taking a couple of days off before doing
some testing in Jerez, Spain.
	   ``The last two victories definitely give me confidence, but they
also made the team work harder,'' the Finn said. ``We tested for a
couple of days but the track there is different from the one here.
Only the temperature was similar.''
	   Budapest, like much of Europe, is going through one of the
hottest spells in memory.
	   ``It's tough, it's really very hard, not only for the drivers
but also for the cars,'' Hakkinenkkinen has 76 points. Schumacher has
four victories and 60 points.
	   ``The more points I lose, the farther away it gets,'' Schumacher
said. ``We have to make up some ground and this is the circuit to
do it.''
	   ``Our car should be good on this circuit,'' said Schumacher, who
won here in 1994 in a Benetton-Ford.
	   Unlike the high-speed Hockenheim, the Hungaroring outside the
Hungarian capital is a twisting track, where engine power is less
crucial than traction, driving skill and a good grid position.
	   Norbert Haug, the Mercedes sports chief, also thinks the Ferrari
may mount more of a challenge on the 3.9-kilometer (2.4-mile) track
here.
	   ``It's flatter and our aerodynamic advantage is less pronounced
here,'' Haug said. ``Ferrari's performance in Hockenheim was below
the norm, they will be better here.''
	   ``Overtaking here is very difficult. A good grid position is as
important as in Monaco. The pit stop strategy could be decisive,''
Haug said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry said that
diplomat Aubin de la Messuziere, head of the French interest
section in Baghdad, had handed a letter to Aziz expressing French
concern about Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed by a day a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's ruling Baath party,
said in a front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts
to raising doubts and accusations that are not based on any
facts.''
	   It added: ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the
committee will come up with others, and it will turn into a game
with no end.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   In his letter, however, Butler said Iraq was impeding the
long-term monitoring by restricting the number of sites that could
be monitored and not allowing inspectors to act on violations that
inspectors' equipment detect.
	   The letter was clearly intended to prod the Security Council
into taking a tougher response to Iraq's decision by making clear
that monitoring of already known sites isn't sufficient to ensure
Baghdad isn't rebuilding its weapons programs.

Government agrees on balanced budget proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's
government agreed on Thursday on a balanced budget proposal that
cuts government spending by 6 percent and predicts strong economic
growth.
	   The budget foresees economic growth of 5.5 percent this year,
and 4 percent in 1999.
	   According to Lipponen, the new budget ends the era of borrowing
tens of billions of markkaa (billions of dollars) each year. Some
of the measures taken were characterized by Lipponen as being
one-time cuts, but he added that they wouldn't cause problems for
succeeding governments.
	   Of the total 186.8 billion markkaa (dlrs 34.5 billion) proposal,
the budget leaves a surplus of 268 million (dlrs 50 million).
	   However, last week Lipponen said that further cuts may be
possible later in the fall if the economy shows signs of
overheating.
	   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had
issued a report earlier this month which claimed that the Finnish
economy is overheating.
	   To balance the budget, the government proposes roughly even cuts
in all major areas including government subsidized building
projects, the defense forces and infrastructure.
	   The proposal also predicts a large drop in unemployment, down to
9 percent by 1999. The consumer price index was expected to rise
slightly, by 1.5 percent this year, and by under 2 percent the next
year.

Analysts: Malaysia's markets likely to sink to new lows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's embattled financial
markets appear likely to sink below historic lows even as the
government continues to pump money into the slumping economy,
economists and dealers said Thursday.
	   In the day's trading on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, the key
index fell 15.46 points, or 4.5 percent, closing at 326.73, as
investors were spooked by continuing Malaysian corporate woes. At
one point, it fell as low as 322.28.
	   Most analysts say the stock market desperately needs foreign
investment to recover, but a raft of lingering business and
economic uncertainties are keeping investors away.
	   Since the Asian economic crisis over the last year pummeled
Malaysia's previously robust economy, market observers and traders
have been debating the wisdom of the government's loose monetary
policy to revive the stagnant economy.
	   However, nearly all agree that the country's ringgit currency is
likely to continue falling as the government lowers interest rates
and tries to spend its way out of an imminent full-blown recession.
	   Malaysia has projected that the economy could contract by up to
2 percent this year, but most private economists say 5 percent is
more realistic.
	   The currency, meanwhile, has lost 40 percent of its value
against the dollar, leading to rising unemployment and inflation
rates, as well as ballooning dollar-denominated debts held by banks
and Malaysian conglomerates.
	   To lessen the blow, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his
economics czar, Daim Zainuddin, plan to spend an additional 53
billion ringgit (dlrs 12.6 billion) that will help to recapitalize
the nation's ailing banks.
	   In addition to large cash injections, the central bank on Monday
cut interest rates to 10 percent from 10.5 percent, its second such
cut in less than two weeks.
	   The government has also been rapidly allowing banks to release
loans worth billions of ringgit (dollars) so that viable companies
can continue their businesses _ a move some analysts say will end
up widening the government's fiscal deficit.
	   Marshall Mays, regional strategist at Nikko Securities in Hong
Kong, said the government can't afford to provide liquidity to the
market and keep domestic interest rates down for too long since
there are higher rates available offshore.
	   Although it is illegal for Malaysians to hold offshore ringgit
accounts, the allure of 20 percent ringgit deposit rates in
Singapore banks has prompted some to circumvent the law.
	   Malaysian authorities have called for Singapore's government to
intervene.
	   Some analysts project that by the end of this year, the
Malaysian currency could drop as low as 5.00 ringgit against the
dollar _ a 50 percent plunge from July 1997, when the ringgit
traded at 2.50.
	   Late Thursday, the dollar was at 4.215 ringgit, up from 4.180
late Wednesday.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A local police commander and an officer
were injured by a land mine believed to have been planted by rebels
in southwestern Uganda, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Richard Ldyegu, the commander of Kasese District, and the
unidentified officer both lost right legs in the explosion outside
an army mess hall Wednesday, said the government-owned New Vision.
	   Kasese, about 380 kilometers (236 miles) west of Kampala, is
also the headquarters of a district of the same name. It borders
the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire.
	   Ugandan authorities said the mine was planted by the Allied
Democratic Forces who are seeking President Yoweri Museveni's
ouster.
	   The rebels include Ugandans, Hutus suspected of taking part in
Rwanda's genocide of 1994, and former Congolese soldiers in the
late Mobutu Sese Seko's army. They have bases in Congo and the
thickly forested Rwenzori mountains.
	   The rebels have been raiding villages and military posts and
patrols over the past two years. Last month, the rebels killed 30
people.
	   Uganda's army is also fighting a more serious rebellion in the
country's north and a minor one in northwestern Uganda.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The Pan Africanist Congress, a
small opposition party in Parliament, on Thursday charged that the
South African government has ignored Congolese opposition groups in
its current peace mediation efforts.
	   ``The PAC is calling, especially upon the South African
government, to see to it that all the political parties ... are
involved in resolving the problems of the Congo,'' said PAC deputy
president Motsoko Pheko in a statement.
	   Some of the groups _ including Etienne Tshisekedi's Union for
Democracy and Social Progress _ have approached the PAC for help in
gaining a voice.
	   In July, Congolese President Laurent Kabila lifted a 6-month ban
on Tshisekedi, who was arrested in February for criticizing Congo's
government.
	   South African officials met last week with Kabila, who has
accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of fighting alongside
insurgents trying to topple his 14-month-old regime.
	   ------
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ At least nine people were seriously
injured in a brawl that pitted Baptist church parishioners against
squatters living on a parcel of disputed church land, newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Several shacks were set ablaze and the church was extensively
damaged in Wednesday's clash.
	   The strife started when Yopougon Baptist Church leaders called
in bulldozers to destroy the squatters' shanties, the daily
Fraternite Matin reported.
	   Residents resisted by throwing stones at church members, who
retaliated by setting fire to the shacks and trashing residents'
belongings.
	   Police broke up the fight with tear gas and clubs, the daily
Info Soir reported.
	   Church leaders said the government had donated the land for a
hospital. But residents said they did not believe the church owned
the property.
	   ------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ President Charles Taylor's Liberian
government has renewed its accusations that one-time battlefield
foe, former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, had plotted an uprising.
	   Johnson, who returned to Monrovia on Monday following several
months of medical treatment in the United States, was planning
``clandestine'' operations aimed at destabilizing the country, a
government statement said Wednesday.
	   Johnson's former rebels threatened violent demonstrations
earlier this year after Johnson accused Taylor's armed bodyguards
of trying to kidnap him.
	   Taylor counter-charged that Roosevelt was planning an
insurrection.
	   Taylor started Liberia's war in 1989 in a bid to overthrow
President Samuel Doe. In the bloodshed that ensued, Johnson's
fighters captured Doe, cut off his ears and executed him.
	   More than 150,000 people died before fighting subsided in 1996.
Taylor was elected president last year.
	   ----
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ Presidential elections are slated for
December, but only a handful of minor candidates have registered
for the office, state radio said.
	   The two highest profile politicians _ President Omar Bongo and
his rival, opposition leader Rev. M'Ba Abessole, a Catholic priest
_ are expected to run, but have not yet signed up, the radio said
Wednesday.
	   Bongo has ruled this small central African country for 31 years
as a dictator and later as an elected leader. In the 1993
elections, he received 51 percent of the vote and Abessole won 27
percent.
	   ------
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ A convoy of Red Cross trucks has
crossed government lines to deliver food in rebel-held areas of
Guinea-Bissau where 250,000 people have taken refuge, Red Cross
officials said.
	   Some 80 tons of food _ rice, tinned meat and oil _ were
delivered by the convoy that originated in the government-held
capital of Bissau.
	   The food was destined for the towns of Mansoa and Canchungo,
held by rebels since fighting began in June, the International
Committee of the Red Cross said.
	   The warring sides have agreed to a cease fire pending another
round of peace talks, which have been postponed due to a debate
over who should broker them, the Portuguese news agency LUSA
reported Wednesday.
	   ----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Lack of trained personnel and widespread
poverty are the main factors hampering implementation of
environmental protection laws in Africa, a U.N environmental agency
official said Thursday.
	   Donald Kaniaru, head of the U.N.'s Environmental Program's
environmental law program, said although many African countries had
signed the World Convention on the Environment, they have not
initiated programs to implement them.
	   Kaniaru spoke at the presentation of a UNEP publication,
``Industry and Enforcement of Environmental Law in Africa,'' which
is intended to provide a framework for how to get ordinary citizens
and businesses to respect environmental legislation.
	   ``Some countries have done better in implementation, others have
not done much,'' Kaniaru said. ``The state has also to play its
role. We draft the law, they have to pass it in parliament.''

 &UR; Eds: ADDS more detail of Pak's round, Sorenstam joining leaders,
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, winner of four
tournaments including two majors in her rookie season, bogeyed six
holes and failed to make birdie once in an opening round 78 at the
Women's British Open Thursday.
	   The 20-year-old Korean, tipped to become one of the greats of
women's golf, struggled in the windy conditions at the tricky links
course at Royal Lytham.
	   Pak was seven strokes behind early clubhouse leader Brandie
Burton, winner of he Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, whose
1-under 71 was spoiled by a double bogey six at the 17th.
	   Burton drove into a fairway bunker, played her third shot into
deep rough under a tree and then hit a greenside bunker on the way
to a six. She then birdied the last for the first under-par round
of the day.
	   ``I'm very excited about getting in the red today,'' said the
American, who also birdied the fifth, eighth and 10th. ``Club
selection here was very trying and wore you down mentally.''
	   Dale Reid of Scotland was level with Burton after 14 holes,
American star Betsy King birdied the seventh to also go 1-under and
they were later joined by Annika Sorenstam, who birdied the ninth.
But most early starters failed to make par.
	   Pak almost made birdie at the tough 17th. Her second shot from
180 yards stayed on the right side of the green and her 35-foot
putt was barely an inch short.
	   The Korean's problems started at the first, when her 5-iron from
the tee overshot the green, she chipped short and missed a 6-foot
putt for bogey 4.
	   She three-putted from 15 feet at the sixth, missed another
6-footer at 12 and then bogeyed 14, 15 and 16.
	   After chipping out of a fairway bunker at 14, she three-putted
from 30 feet, drove her tee shot into the thick rough and was
forced to lay up at 15.
	   At the 16th, Pak dropped her second shot into a bunker just
short of the green, pitched out still short and had to play a
pitching wedge to make the green.
	   ``The wind is really, really strong,'' said Pak, who also saved
par at the last by rolling in a 20-foot putt. ``But it is the same
for all players and I have got to learn and keep working.''
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, who is aiming to win
for the third time in four years, carded a 76, mixing three birdies
with seven bogeys and Liselotte Neumann, titlist here four years
ago, had two double bogeys and three bogeys in a birdie-less 79.
	   Other leading contenders, including big-hitting Briton Laura
Davies, and Americans Donna Andrews and former titlist Emilee
Klein, were out later in the day.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq renewed its allegations Thursday that
it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced Aug. 5 that Iraq would no
longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged
with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and chemical
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said diplomat Aubin de la
Messuziere, head of the French interest section in Baghdad, handed
a letter to Aziz expressing French concern about Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed a day after a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, published by Saddam's ruling Baath party, said in a
front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts to raising
doubts and accusations that are not based on any facts.''
	   ``Even if Iraq shows these accusation to be false, the committee
will come up with others, and it will turn into a game with no
end,'' it said.
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify Iraq had complied with U.N. resolutions
calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   In his letter, however, Butler said Iraq was impeding the
long-term monitoring by restricting the number of sites that could
be monitored and not allowing inspectors to act on violations that
inspectors' equipment detect.
	   The letter was clearly intended to prod the Security Council
into taking a tougher response to Iraq's decision by making clear
that monitoring of already known sites was insufficient to ensure
Baghdad isn't rebuilding its weapons programs.

People flee from Afghan opposition areas

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Foreign aid workers and hundreds of
Afghan families fled territory controlled by the opposition
northern alliance Thursday as the Taliban closed in. Witnesses said
the airport in central Bamiyan was shelled during evacuations.
	   Even as some fled Bamiyan for the capital Kabul and other areas,
an aid worker said other displaced Afghans were pouring into
Bamiyan from Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in the north, which
the anti-Taliban alliance lost Saturday.
	   The worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the flight
from Mazar-e-Sharif meant humanitarian staffers were needed in
Bamiyan, but the security situation made it impossible for them to
work there.
	   Bamiyan is surrounded by the Taliban, which snapped their
opponents' only land supply route Wednesday by capturing Hayratan,
a town about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Kabul bordering
Central Asian countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.
	   The Iranian news agency reported fierce fighting near Hayratan
on Thursday, and quoted warlord Rashid Dostum, a member of the
anti-Taliban alliance, as claiming a large number of Taliban were
killed. There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.
	   The Taliban have in the past four years captured most of the
country, including Kabul. They appear on the verge of reaching
their goal of uniting all of Afghanistan under a strict version of
Islam that bars girls from school, confines most women to their
homes, and bans music, movies and television.
	   The Taliban have pledged to restore peace to a country that has
been plagued by armed revolts and strife since a series of military
and communist coups in the 1960s. They have rejected calls for
peace talks, intent on pursuing a military solution against enemies
they label ``evil and corrupt.''
	   The aid worker said people in the remaining areas controlled by
the northern alliance feared a major Taliban offensive any day.
	   A spokesman of the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia, a partner in the
anti-Taliban alliance that has its stronghold in Bamiyan, said
civilian areas were hit Thursday by Taliban bombing Thursday in a
town 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of Bamiyan. Two civilians
were killed and six others wounded, he said.
	   Refugees arriving in Kabul from Bamiyan said the Taliban shelled
the town's airport as a Red Cross evacuation plane sat on the
tarmac. There was no independent confirmation of the reports.
	   In northern Panjshir Valley, controlled by anti-Taliban
commander Ahmed Shah Masood, authorities have asked people to leave
because of the fear of an attack by the Taliban. Panjshir, like
Bamiyan, is also surrounded.
	   Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president the Taliban ousted from Kabul
along with his military chief Masood in 1996, said Thursday that a
guerrilla war against the Taliban would continue, the Iranian news
agency IRNA reported.
	   ``We will continue fighting off the Taliban,'' Rabbani was
quoted as saying from northern Badakhshan province. ``The Taliban
might rule by force ... but they know well that they have no
popular base.''

	   LIMONE, Italy (AP) _ Two British tourists were found dead and a
third was missing Thursday after their motor boat capsized on Lake
Garda during a wind storm.
	   Workers cleaning the lake early Thursday managed to rescue four
others who had set out on the boat Wednesday afternoon. Police
first said the group was from Germany but later said they lived in
Scotland.
	   Officer Massimo Belizzari identified the dead as Richard Harris
and a six-year-old boy whose name was not immediately known. He
said several vessels were searching for a missing 13-year old who
was presumed dead.
	   The British foreign office said Harris was an English citizen
although he and his family lived in Scotland.

Diplomatic team meets Museveni to discuss Congo situation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Three African foreign ministers have met
with President Yoweri Museveni to discuss the rebellion in the
neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, his spokeswoman said
Thursday.
	   ``They came to talk to different people in the hope of getting
ideas of how to solve the situation in the Congo,'' said Hope
Kivengere ... I have no agenda of their work.''
	   She did say T.B. Mudenge of Zimbabwe, who is leading the group,
Kelly Wallubita of Zambia and T.B. Gurirabu of Namibia were to have
left for Rwanda later Thursday where they would meet up with
Tanzanian foreign minister Jakaya Kikwete.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
backing a rebellion against his government and of sending troops
into various parts of the vast central African nation.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda helped Kabila overthrow Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997 after his own eight-month rebellion in the former
Zaire, but relations have gradually deteriorated.
	   The team was formed following a summit of the four nations last
weekend in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe to which Uganda, Rwanda and
Congo were also invited.
	   The team's initial mandate was to check out Congolese claims of
Ugandan and Rwandan participation in the rebellion and, later, to
try to arrange for a cease-fire.
	   But Ugandan officials avoided linking the mission to
investigation of the Congolese accusations.
	   Ugandan foreign ministry spokesman Edward Kwisenshonyi said the
mission was supposed to report their findings ``as soon as
possible.''

Soccer player Ilie Dumitrescu returns to play for Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After a disappointing career at
foreign clubs, popular Romanian soccer player Ilie Dumitrescu
signed a one-year contract with his former team Steaua Bucharest on
Thursday.
	   Dumitrescu, 29, agreed to drop his dlrs one million contract
with Mexican team FC America and he become a free player. He will
get a yearly salary of dlrs 150,000 a year at Steaua Bucharest.
	   Dumitrescu said he was disappointed by his performance at this
year's World Cup, where he played only 45 minutes in the game
against Tunisia. Romania drew 1-1 with Tunisia and was knocked out
by Croatia 1-0 in the next round.
	   Dumitrescu left Steaua in 1994 for a two-season contract with
Tottenham Hotspur in London.
	   Known in Romania for his love of fast cars and Italian
tailoring, Dumitrescu rose to fame in the 1994 World Cup, after he
scored two crucial goals against Argentina to advance Romania to
the next round.

Russia accuses Pakistan of helping Taliban victory

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian diplomat on Thursday accused
Pakistan of sending troops and combat aircraft to help the Taliban
movement crush its opponents in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban military success has become possible because of the
``active involvement of Pakistan's army units and air force,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said at a news conference.
	   Pakistan is sympathetic to the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic
movement that controls most of Afghanistan. Many countries have
said that Pakistan supplies weapons to the Taliban, though Pakistan
denies the charge.
	   On Wednesday, the Pakistani embassy in Moscow issued a statement
denying involvement in the latest developments.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Masoor Alam lashed out at Russia for
favoring anti-Taliban forces and failing to recognize the Taliban,
despite its recent victories.
	   ``Russia was completely in favor of the (anti-Taliban) Northern
Alliance, it continued to recognize Mr. (Burhanuddin) Rabbani as
the president of Afghanistan, even though he was ousted from Kabul,
and the Alliance's representative as the ambassador of the whole
Afghanistan,'' Alam was quoted as saying Thursday by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Moscow is opposed to the Taliban because it fears that a radical
Islamic state in Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and
weapons into the neighboring former Soviet republics of Central
Asia and threaten its own stability.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan _ a Central Asian
republic that does not border Afghanistan _ appealed to the warring
sides in Afghanistan ``not to leave the boundaries of their
country,'' and cross into former Soviet republics, Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Our troops are stationed there,'' Nazarbayev added.
	   Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, now governor of
the Krasnoyarsk region in central Siberia, lashed out at the
Russian government for failing to provide effective support to the
anti-Taliban alliance in the north.
	   ``The failure to take the necessary steps has led to the present
developments in Afghanistan. And the Taliban victory today would
mean Islamic extremism hitting Russia right below the belt,'' Lebed
said, according to Interfax. ``The situation is extremely
unpleasant.''
	   Russian officials have denied reports that Moscow is supplying
weapons to Afghan factions opposing the Taliban.
	   However, some Russian analysts said that Moscow was providing
covert assistance to the very groups that fought against the Soviet
army when it occupied Afghanistan from 1979-89.
	   They specifically mentioned Afghan rebel leader Ahmed Shah
Massoud, the most effective rebel leader in the 1980s when he led
resistance to the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

Nicholson has life drug ban lifted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An English soccer player who was given a life ban
for failing to submit to a random drug test in February had the ban
lifted Thursday by a Football Association disciplinary committee.
	   Shane Nicholson, who played for English league side West
Bromwich Albion, had the ban overturned after demonstrating his
commitment to rehabilitation.
	   The three-man commission made its decision after analyzing
reports of Nicholson's rehabilitation progress.
	   The 28-year-old defender was represented at the committee
hearing by Professional Footballers' Association deputy chief
executive Brendon Batson.
	   Batson said the reports showed Nicholson had shown his
``determination to overcome his problems and he was now in the last
chance saloon.''

Seven British tourists fined for possessing drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Seven British tourists escaped jail
sentences Thursday for importing and using drugs, but were fined a
total of 2,650 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 5,800) by a local court.
	   Five of the Britons had been in custody for eight days. They
were arrested last week after police searched their holiday
apartment in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa and found small
amounts of a variety of drugs, including cocaine, Ecstasy and
cannabis hidden in biscuit tins, shoes and kitchen drawers.
	   Judge Marios Georgiou said the use of drugs was a serious
offense in Cyprus. But he decided to be lenient and only impose
fines ``because the drugs were for their own use and not for
sale,'' he said.
	   The judge criticized the situation in Ayia Napa where he said
``anyone can find and use drugs.''
	   Hardly a day goes by without an arrest of a foreign tourist,
mainly British, by the Ayia Napa police for drug possession.
	   The fines given to the five, all of them Londoners, varied as
they had pleaded guilty to possessing different amounts and kinds
of drugs.
	   Florist Jonathan Wisbey, 23, was fined 700 Cyprus pounds (dlrs
1,540) for importing and possessing 14 Ecstasy tablets, eight grams
of cannabis and two grams of cocaine.
	   Student Joseph Xenophontos, 23, was fined 500 pounds (dlrs
1,100) for importing six grams of cocaine.
	   Printer Paul Cunningham, 24, was ordered to pay 500 pounds (dlrs
1,100) for importing 12 grams of cocaine.
	   Geoffrey Gurling, a 26-year-old warehouse manager, was fined 400
pounds (dlrs 880) for importing nine grams of cannabis.
	   Pub manager Martin Parish, 25, was fined 100 pounds (dlrs 220)
for personal use of the drug.
	   Two other tourists were also arrested in Ayia Napa earlier in
the week.
	   Colin Rich, 20, from Manchester, was fined 200 pounds (dlrs 440)
for receiving hashish in the mail and James Robb, 20, from
Birmingham, pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis. He was ordered
to pay 250 pounds (dlrs 550).

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As concern grew over the stability of the Russian
ruble, the Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency
trading by commercial banks. Frightened bankers temporarily halted
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was halted on Russia's main stock exchange after
the first 40 minutes of trading because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent. The exchange reopened 35 minutes later.
	   Late in the day, Moody's, the international credit rating
service, downgraded its rating for Russia's foreign debt, the
Interfax news agency reported. And The Fitch IBCA rating agency
said it had placed one Russian bank, SBS Agro, on what it called
rating alert negative. The firm said SBS Agro, which has many
depositors in Russia, was having trouble ``meeting margin calls on
its repurchase transactions.''

Court: Top club can fire manager for dating archrival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the cutthroat world of Dutch
soccer, getting too cuddly with the enemy has cost a top manager
her job.
	   A municipal court ruled Thursday that Rotterdam's Feyenoord
soccer club can dismiss director Nicole Edelenbos, who is dating
Maarten Oldenhof, who manages archrival Ajax of Amsterdam.
	   Dubbed the ``pillow talk case'' by the Dutch media, the lawsuit
heaped extra attention on the Netherlands' two top clubs, whose
annual clash is the highlight of the Dutch soccer season.
	   Fearful that Edelenbos might leak sensitive information to
Oldenhof, Feyenoord went to court to request the termination of her
labor contract.
	   The judge approved the request, but ordered the club to pay
Edelenbos 210,600 guilders (dlrs 105,300) in compensation, less
than the half-million guilders (dlrs 250,000) she had sought.
	   Edelenbos' lawyer told the Amsterdam daily Het Parool that she
had hoped to keep her job and considered Thursday's ruling
``contrary to her basic rights.''
	   Calls to Feyenoord went unanswered Thursday, and Ajax officials
declined to comment on the case.

Giants beat BayStars 6-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hideki Matsui drove in three runs with two homers
and a single Thursday, leading the Yomiuri Giants to a 6-4 victory
over the Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars at
Yokohama.
	   Matsui, who leads the league with 26 home runs, hit his latest
two in consecutive at-bats in the fourth and sixth innings. He also
singled home a run in the second as the Giants halted the BayStars'
winning streak at three.
	   At Nagoya Dome, the Chunichi Dragons' new Korean pitcher, Samson
Lee (1-0), threw a two-hitter over six innings while his teammates
pounded out 12 hits for a 9-0 victory over the Hanshin Tigers.
	   Lee struck out six with no walks. The Tigers managed only one
more hit in the last three innings as they suffered their ninth
loss in a row.
	   Leo Gomez, formerly of the Chicago Cubs, hit his 18th homer of
the season in the first inning.
	   The Hiroshima Toyo Carp and the Yakult Swallows were rained out.
	   In Pacific League action, Yasuo Fujii hit a solo home run in the
top of the eighth inning as the Orix BlueWave beat the first-place
Nippon Ham Fighters 3-1 at Tokyo Dome.
	   The victory extended the BlueWave's winning streak to five. The
Fighters suffered their third loss in four games, but remained six
games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who lost 3-2 to the Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks at Fukuoka.
	   Arihito Muramatsu scored the winning run for the Hawks in the
eighth inning on a passed ball by Buffaloes catcher Tetsuya
Matoyama.
	   At Seibu Dome, Kiyoshi Hatsushiba drove in the only run in the
top of the third inning as the Chiba Lotte Marines edged the Seibu
Lions 1-0.
	   Marines starter Juichiro Muto (4-4) gave up just five hits in
seven innings, and rookie reliever Soichi Fujita allowed no hits
and struck out four in the last two innings for his fifth save.

Hong Kong to train local people as domestics to ease unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A government-sponsored task force on Thursday
endorsed a program to train local people as domestic helpers to
ease Hong Kong's unemployment problem.
	   More than 150,000 Hong Kong families employ domestic helpers,
either as maids or to look after their children.
	   Hong Kong women for years have been employed in higher-paying
jobs, leaving domestic work to poorer foreigners, many of whom send
most of their earnings home to support their families.
	   However, Hong Kong no longer has the luxury of leaving such work
only to foreigners.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.5 percent and expected to
go higher. The territory has slipped into recession. Among the
hardest-hit sectors of the economy are retail trade, and the hotel
and tourism industries.
	   The government is searching for ways to create jobs for the
newly unemployed.
	   After a meeting of the government-sponsored employment task
force Thursday, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said a retraining
and job-matching program would be extended to domestic helpers and
child-care workers.
	   A government statement said a job-retraining service would
increase its number of places for domestic workers by at least 500
every three months.
	   The newspaper Hong Kong Standard quoted the executive director
of the retraining board, Chow Tung-shan, as saying that the Hong
Kong workers could temporarily take the place of foreigners when
they go on holiday.
	   ``Many working parents are left with no one to take care of
their offspring when their helpers go on their annual holiday,''
Chow was quoted as saying. ``Trained baby-sitters could offer
short-term assistance to these families.''
	   Chow was quoted as saying that the employment rate for Hong Kong
residents who had completed a one- to two-week retraining program
was 70-80 percent.

Germany unveils wage subsidies plan to cut joblessness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election-year plan
to push the country's long-term unemployed off welfare by
subsidizing low-paying jobs came under immediate fire Thursday from
unions, employers _ and even some in his own governing coalition.
	   The plan presented by Labor Minister Norbert Bluem subsidizes
wages for employers who take on the long-term jobless in order to
boost low pay to 73 percent of an employee's previous income.
Unemployment benefits, in contrast, pay out only 53 percent of
former income.
	   ``We needed a plan that would combat the situation in which jobs
either can't be financed by employers or aren't attractive because
they are too poorly paid for people to live on,'' Bluem said. ``It
isn't a subsidy for employers, but for employees.''
	   Some 1.35 million long-term unemployed _ out of a total of more
than 4 million _ would be eligible.
	   Unemployment _ at nearly 11 percent in July _ has been the core
issue ahead of Germany's Sept. 27 parliamentary election, with each
side arguing over the best way to bring it down.
	   The opposition Social Democrats called Kohl's new plan
``election-motivated nonsense,'' and it also came under fire from
unions, employers and the government's junior coalition partner,
the market-oriented Free Democrats.
	   The FDP, as well as many economists, have warned that the plan
might simply encourage employers to fire unsubsidized workers while
hiring subsidized employees. In addition, the scheme could
encourage businesses to reduce wages excessively at the expense of
the taxpayer.
	   The Green Party and German unions have criticized the scheme as
containing hidden subsidies for employers, while the Association of
German Employers blasted it as ``sidestepping the structural
mistakes'' of welfare and unemployment benefits.

Philippine president orders government offices to be ``millennium

bug-free'' by December &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
ordered officials Thursday to solve computer glitches by December
to prevent the potentially disastrous impact of the ``millennium
bug'' in the year 2000.
	   Estrada said there should be a comprehensive audit of computer
systems in all government offices to determine whether they are
susceptible to the bug.
	   Estrada said all offices should submit a report to him by Dec.
21 so he will know whether they have followed his directive.
	   The bug could cause computers that are set to read only the last
two digits of the year to malfunction when the calendar changes to
2000. Those that aren't fixed may not be able to sort dates,
calculate transactions or perform other operations.

Lower growth rate forecast for Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's economic growth will be reduced
by almost 1 percentage point because of the region's financial
crisis, state-run media reported Thursday.
	   Anticipated 1998 growth in Taiwan's gross domestic product will
fall from 6.2 percent to 5.5 percent in official figures to be
released Friday, the state-run Central News Agency reported.
	   The agency said the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics will also lower its growth forecast of 5.78 percent
for the second quarter, but did not provide details.
	   The lower growth forecasts were due primarily to the regional
financial crisis, the agency said, adding that increases in
consumer prices also will drop.
	   Though anchored by U.S. dlrs 83 billion in foreign currency
reserves, Taiwan is feeling the aftershocks of a crisis that has
already pulled down most of its neighbors.
	   Exports fell by 6.7 percent in the first four months of the
year, and in June the Taiwan dollar hit an 11-year low against the

Investigation into alleged police brutality clears officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two Albanian teenagers who claimed they
were beaten and burned by police were not abused while in custody
and ``wish to lie'' about their treatment, a government-ordered
investigation concluded Thursday.
	   Endrit Grizhaj and his cousin, Leonard Grizhaj, both 19, claimed
they were brutalized by police officers for two days after being
arrested on theft charges July 11 near Stylida, about 140
kilometers (87 miles) northwest of Athens.
	   A court convicted them of theft and sentenced them on July 13 to
three years in prison.
	   The Public Order Ministry ordered an investigation following
complaints by the Albanian embassy, which was reportedly notified
of the injuries by a prison guard.
	   The Albanians claimed local police beat them severely and
stubbed out cigarettes on their bodies.
	   They also claimed police poured rubbing alcohol on the stomach
of Endrit Grizhaj and set it on fire, threatening his cousin with
the same treatment if he did not confess.
	   ``In 30 years I have never seen a prisoner in such condition,''
the Athens daily Eleftherotypia quoted a prison director,
Haralambos Zagorakis, as saying after seeing the two.
	   But according to the investigation report, the first- and
second-degree burns on Endrit Grizhaj's stomach and leg were caused
before his arrest while he was ``cooking in a saucepan over a wood
fire,'' the ministry said.
	   The report found that the two ``beyond any doubt ... were not
abused by police of the Stylida department. On the contrary, they
received perfect treatment from all police officers who in any way
dealt with this case.''
	   The report said the origin of other minor injuries found by a
medical examiner cannot be determined ``as the only people who know
for sure are the prisoners themselves, who for the time being wish
to lie.''
	   Although police brutality is not widespread in Greece, some
human rights organizations have reported occasional beatings of
suspects, mostly Albanians.

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Turkish men were given a 30-day jail
sentence Thursday for entering Cyprus illegally.
	   Haci Barut, a 29-year-old car salesman and shopkeeper Enver
Salicu, 29 _ both from Ankara _ entered Cyprus through the port of
Kyrenia in the Turkish-occupied north of the island, a police
prosecutor told the court.
	   They crossed into the Cypriot government-controlled south of the
island by car on Wednesday where they were arrested.
	   The court also found them guilty of possessing large quantities
of duty free cigarettes and whiskey.
	   The Cyprus government considers ports and airports in the
occupied north as illegal. Foreigners entering the island through
these points are routinely detained and fined or imprisoned if they
cross to the south.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the north of the island in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece.

Bob Cottom joins England's Ashes touring party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England made several changes to its coaching staff
for the upcoming Ashes cricket tour of Australia following its
series win over South Africa at Headingley.
	   Former test fast bowler Bob Cottam replaces John Emburey as
David Lloyd's assistant coach for the tour.
	   Cottam, who was appointed England's bowling coach this summer,
will be Lloyd's deputy on England's winter tour.
	   Emburey will take over the England A side, which is touring
Zimbabwe and South Africa starting in January.
	   Former England captain Graham Gooch will take over as manager of
the England team on the Ashes section of the Australian tour, while
Phil Neale, who steered the England Under-19 team to World Cup
victory, will manage the top team for the Australian one day
series.
	   Team director Simon Pack said the switching of coaching and
management between the senior squad, the A squad the under-19s was
part of a long-term policy to broaden and capitalize on individual
expertise.

Canada cancels deportation of Filipinos entangled in stowaway case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Four Filipino sailors who accused
their ship's officers of killing stowaways were granted permission
Thursday to stay in Canada, reversing a deportation order that they
feared would endanger their lives.
	   The Immigration Department, responding to a last-ditch appeal of
the deportation, said the four will be allowed to remain in Canada
on compassionate grounds.
	   The men accused several officers on their Taiwanese cargo ship,
the Maersk Dubai, of murdering Romanian stowaways on two separate
voyages from Europe to Halifax in 1996.
	   A Nova Scotia judge said he didn't have the jurisdiction to hear
the murder case and set the Taiwanese captain and other officers
free.
	   The Filipinos said their families have been threatened back in
the Philippines, and contended they would be in danger if forced to
return home.
	   The sailors' lawyer, Lee Cohen, filed an appeal of the
deportation on July 21, accompanied by a 1,100-signature petition
and hundreds of supportive letters from citizens and church groups.
	   Cohen said the sailors _ Juanito Ilagan Jr., Ariel Broas,
Esmeraldo Esteban and Rodolfo Miguel _ believe thugs working on
behalf of the Maersk Dubai's Taiwanese owner, Yang Ming Lines, are
behind the threats to their families.
	   In a decision last November, an immigration panel said the
sailors could not be considered refugees because they weren't being
persecuted for political reasons. It also criticized them for vague
and inconsistent testimony during last summer's murder trial.
	   The men all work and live in Halifax. They received deportation
notices in May and were told to leave Canada by July 2. None
complied.
	   The sailors jumped ship in Halifax in May 1996, then told police
that six Taiwanese officers had forced three Romanian stowaways
over the side of the Maersk Dubai while at sea.
	   Justice Michael MacDonald of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled
he would have ordered the officers to stand trial on second-degree
murder and manslaughter charges but he had no jurisdiction because
the crimes happened in international waters.
	   All six officers still work for Dubai's owner and have yet to
face trial in Taiwan.

Nicholson has life drug ban lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds detail, background

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An English soccer player who was given a life ban
for failing to submit to a random drug test in February had the ban
lifted Thursday by a Football Association disciplinary committee.
	   Shane Nicholson, who played for English league side West
Bromwich Albion, had the ban overturned after demonstrating his
commitment to rehabilitation.
	   He was banned from ``all forms of the game'' by the Football
Association in April for failing to submit to a drug test. He had
already been fired by West Brom after admitting to being a regular
user of amphetamines.
	   The three-man commission made its decision after analyzing
reports of Nicholson's rehabilitation progress.
	   The 28-year-old defender was represented at the committee
hearing by Professional Footballers' Association deputy chief
executive Brendon Batson.
	   Batson said the reports showed Nicholson had shown his
``determination to overcome his problems and he was now in the last
chance saloon.''
	   The report said Nicholson, who has been training with second
division side Chesterfield, was fit to return to soccer and that he
had offered to help other players with a similar problem.
	   He will be subjected to random testing for an indefinite period
and faces a lifetime ban if he fails or refuses to comply with the
tests.
	   Nicholson had escaped punishment in October last year, after
traces of an amphetamine _ commonly known as speed _ was found in a
sample, when a friend admitting spiking his drink.

Bulgaria dismisses neighbor's fears about nuke plant safety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian officials dismissed Thursday
fears in neighboring Greece that Bulgaria's only nuclear power
plant in Kozlodui poses a threat.
	   ``The power station in Kozlodui is by no means at a lower safety
level than the other (such facilities) in Europe,'' claimed
Konstantin Shushulov, chairman of the National Electric Company
board.
	   ``One can't maintain that the Bulgarian nuclear plant poses a
threat to neighboring states,'' said Georgi Kaschiev, head of the
government Committee for Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy, an agency
in charge of nuclear safety.
	   The state news agency BTA said both officials reacted to a
report in Greece's daily Kathimerini which said the European Union
had assured Greece that it will keep exerting pressure on Bulgaria
to close four of all six reactors in the plant that are deemed to
be unsafe.
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, comprises four 440-megawatt pressurized water reactors
without safety encasement that were started up between 1974 and
1982.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units with encasement were installed in
1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as a safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and repeatedly balked at calls from the
West to close them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.
	   ``The Bulgarian nuclear plant is safe and necessary for
Bulgaria,'' Shushulov said.

Polish teams to boycott weekend matches in dispute over leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ All 18 teams in Poland's top soccer league
decided Thursday to continue boycotting games to demand the
resignation of the national soccer federation president, who has
refused to step down.
	   The boycott by First League teams, which canceled five games
last weekend, is intended to force federation president Marian
Dziurowicz to quit immediately because of alleged corruption and
mismanagement.
	   After a special meeting of the federation Wednesday, Dziurowicz
said he would continue as president until elections for new
federation leaders on Nov. 12. He said he would not seek
re-election then.
	   The Polish state news agency, PAP, reported Thursday that two of
the 18 First League teams wanted to play matches scheduled for this
weekend, but decided at a meeting Thursday to join the other sides
in extending the boycott a second week.
	   The boycott would end after a meeting next week between First
League officials meet with federation leaders, the teams decided.
Only Polish First League matches are affected by the boycott.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended the entire federation
leadership _ more than 20 people including Dziurowicz _ in May for
refusing to allow an investigation into alleged mismanagement. The
federation leaders claimed they were independent of the government
review.
	   Debski reinstated them Friday to avoid a suspension from
international matches by FIFA, the governing body of world soccer,
but only after the federation agreed to let state controllers
examine its books and records.
	   First League players then boycotted the five matches last
weekend to protest the reinstatement of Dziurowicz's
administration.
	   Poland's national team has failed to qualify for the World Cup
since 1982. Debski blames soccer officials for the general decline
of the sports.

Sudan protests Egypt's hosting meeting of opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's ruling party has protested
Egypt's decision to host a meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders,
a pro-government newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Egypt's role in the meeting, which began Tuesday in the Cairo
offices of President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party,
amounted to ``instigating the opposition against the Sudanese
people and their legitimate, constitutional institutions,''
Mohammed al-Hassan al-Amin, an official of Sudan's National
Congress Party, told the newspaper Alwan.
	   The Egyptian government called the meeting as it fears the civil
war in southern and eastern Sudan could lead to a division of the
country that would affect control of the Nile River, the main
source of Egypt's water.
	   Mubarak met the leaders on Wednesday and stressed the importance
of keeping Sudan united.
	   The leaders _ who include John Garang, the leader of the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army, former Prime Minister Sadiq
el-Mahdi and Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, the chairman of the
umbrella National Democratic Alliance _ were scheduled to continue
their meetings Thursday.
	   The opposition talks follow the failure last week of peace talks
between the SPLA and the government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the Christians and animists in the south from the Islamic
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.

	   The KLA and most Albanians want independence from Serbia, which
forms most of Yugoslavia. But the Yugoslav government, as well as
the United States and the Europeans, has rejected independence.
	   Instead, Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he
withdrew in 1989.
	   The decision to move forward was taken despite continued
fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Serb police Wednesday
fought their way into the former rebel stronghold of Glodjane
following two days of fierce fighting in which five Serb policemen
and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported that seven fighters from the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
were killed and 49 wounded in the fighting.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the KLA. The
village has been under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   Each side blamed the other for launching the attacks.
	   The rebels are fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90
percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Milosevic had promised European Union envoys that his forces
would not attack Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, speaking for the
EU, condemned the fighting around Junik and urged the Yugoslav
government to avoid actions that would worsen the ``already
unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   On Wednesday, Serbian state television broadcast an interview
with what it said were two captured KLA fighters. The two men,
dressed in fatigues, said they had come from Switzerland, where
they were working, to Albania, where they obtained weapons in the
northern Albanian town of Tropoja.
	   The two also claimed other KLA recruiters traveled by way of
Italy, where they bribed police to allow them to cross Italian
territory without visas.
	   The latest fighting raged despite calls by the U.N. Security
Council for a cease-fire and warnings by NATO that military
intervention to halt the conflict remained at option.
	   But those calls appear to have lost their effectiveness since
they have been made repeatedly _ and ignored _ by the combatants
since Milosevic launched his crackdown against Albanian
secessionists five months ago.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that up to
240,000 people have been displaced by the fighting. Tens of
thousands are hiding in forests and hills of Kosovo, fearful of
reprisals if they return home.
	   On Wednesday, a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity, warned that significant numbers of refugees must be
returned to their homes in time to harvest crops.
	   The harvest season begins in Kosovo in about three weeks and
unless significant numbers can return home by then, the diplomat
warned of a humanitarian disaster once winter begins in a few
months.

Sudan protests Egypt's hosting meeting of opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's ruling party has protested
Egypt's decision to host a meeting of Sudanese opposition leaders,
a pro-government newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Egypt's role in the meeting, which began Tuesday in the Cairo
offices of President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party,
amounted to ``instigating the opposition against the Sudanese
people and their legitimate, constitutional institutions,''
Mohammed al-Hassan al-Amin, an official of Sudan's National
Congress Party, told the newspaper Alwan.
	   The Egyptian government called the meeting as it fears the civil
war in southern and eastern Sudan could lead to a division of the
country that would affect control of the Nile River, the main
source of Egypt's water.
	   Mubarak met the leaders Wednesday and stressed the importance of
keeping Sudan united.
	   The leaders _ who include John Garang, the leader of the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army, former Prime Minister Sadiq
el-Mahdi and Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, the chairman of the
umbrella National Democratic Alliance _ were scheduled to continue
their meetings Thursday.
	   The opposition talks follow the failure last week of peace talks
between the SPLA and the government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the Christians and animists in the south from the Islamic
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ Three Russian cosmonauts, including
President Boris Yeltsin's former security adviser, blasted off
Thursday for the second-to-last mission to the Mir space station.
	   The Soyuz TM-28 ship was launched as scheduled at 1:43 p.m.
(0943 GMT) from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan and entered
its designated orbit nine minutes later.
	   The Soyuz is expected to dock with Mir on Saturday. It carries a
three-man crew consisting of former presidential advisor Yuri
Baturin, flight commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer Gennady
Padalka.
	   Baturin, a 49-year old former secretary of Yeltsin's security
and defense councils, is a space physicist by training. He
concentrated on preparation for the space flight after Yeltsin
ousted him earlier this year and even lost 12 kilograms (more than
26 pounds) to get himself into shape.
	   Speaking to space experts after the launch, Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov pledged that the government would support
the ailing industry, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The space agency's cash shortage was so severe that earlier this
summer officials were even talking about abandoning the Mir after
the current crew of Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin returns in
August.
	   The government has been slow to pay the dlrs 600 million it owed
for Mir's operations last year, forcing the state-controlled
Energiya company to turn to commercial credits to finance
Thursday's launch.
	   It was postponed for 10 days because of the cash problems, which
prevented Russian space officials from paying electricity bills to
local authorities who responded by turning off power to the
cosmodrome for two weeks.
	   Russian space officials felt uneasy about the launch date
because of the superstition about the number 13 and even considered
changing it. Eventually, they overcame their fears. Thursday was
the most convenient day this week for bringing the Soyuz to a
designated flight path and the launch could not be postponed any
longer.
	   The current crew will return to Earth along with Baturin on
August 25.
	   The new crew is to stay on Mir until February. However, Avdeyev,
the flight commander, may remain on the orbiter until June, when
the Mir is to be discarded and lowered to Earth.

Opposition says government responsible for Suu Kyi as van moved

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ State television broadcast several
official denunciations of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party Thursday night, an unusual public indication that Myanmar's
military regime may be taking seriously her latest political
challenge.
	   The party expressed fears for her safety earlier Thursday after
her van was moved to a small wooden bridge on the second day of her
latest roadside standoff with the government.
	   Myanmar's military government blocked a fresh attempt by Suu Kyi
on Wednesday to travel outside the capital to meet with members of
her political party, claiming the journey was ``unsafe.''
	   Meanwhile, 18 foreign activists arrested for passing out
anti-government leaflets Sunday were reunited in a single police
facility, but there was still no decision on whether they would
face trial.
	   U.S. Embassy officials were permitted to meet the six American
detainees and described them as being in ``good spirits,'' an
embassy spokeswoman said. The others include three Indonesians,
three Malaysians, three Thais, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   For a second night, state TV showed video footage of the
detainees, looking relaxed as they met with diplomatic
representatives of their countries.
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, when she
was stopped at the same roadblock where she had been held up for
six days last month, government and party sources confirmed.
	   The party urged the government to allow Suu Kyi to proceed to
Bassein from the checkpoint, 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital.
	   ``It is the responsibility of the government if the bridge
breaks under the heavy weight of the van,'' the party said in a
statement. ``The prevention ... amounts to restricting the
organizational activities of the party,''
	   The van was presumably moved to clear traffic, which was backed
up for several kilometers (miles) Wednesday. The bridge, built for
ox-carts, held Suu Kyi's smaller car during her standoff at the
same checkpoint two weeks ago.
	   A government spokesman said in a faxed statement to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, that Suu Kyi had not spoken
to anyone and that all the windows were rolled up.
	   ``A medical team is on standby should she need one and an
appropriate number of security personnel has been provided in case
she and her companions choose to stay by the roadside,'' it said.
	   State TV has not directly reported the confrontation, but
broadcast a series of reports showing senior officials from several
ministries condemning the National League for Democracy.
	   Deputy Home Minister Brigadier Myint Maung was shown telling a
meeting of businessmen that the league had stepped up attempts to
disrupt the peaceful condition of the country, and he urged them to
understand the ``true situation.''
	   The meeting was marked by the unusual presence of Col. Than Tun,
an army officer usually concerned with political affairs who has
served as the liaison officer between the government and Suu Kyi.
	   He said her party had taken on a confrontational role since she
was released from six years of house arrest in 1995, and accused
the group of acting with ``neo-colonialists'' and Western media in
trying to destabilize the country.
	   Similar warnings from the deputy transport minister and the
construction minister to their personnel were also reported.
	   Suu Kyi appeared ready for a long confrontation with authorities
to raise pressure ahead of the Aug. 21 deadline she has set for a
parliament elected in 1990 to be convened.
	   Her party overwhelmingly won the election, but the military,
which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962, never
allowed the parliament to meet.
	   The authorities ended last month's showdown by seizing Suu Kyi's
car and forcibly driving her back to her home in Yangon. She
recovered from fever and dehydration but vowed to press the
government to open a dialogue with her.
	   The van she is in this time can carry more food and water than
the sedan used last time. Again traveling with her is Hla Pe, 75, a
member of the NLD's central executive committee, and two drivers.

Central Bank says no Kenya banks lost cash in bomb blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Seeking to reassure nervous depositors,
Kenya's Central Bank said Thursday that no banks lost cash in the
U.S. Embassy bombing that tore through downtown Nairobi last week.
	   The bank's deputy governor, Nzioki Kibua, said all cash in the
banks' safes has been accounted for. In a statement, he appealed to
customers to be patient while several banking operations are being
relocated with the Central Bank's help.
	   Half a dozen commercial banks and bank branches are in the
immediate vicinity of the bomb blast, as is the Central Bank, which
itself was damaged.
	   The explosion last Friday morning went off befor many of the
banks collected their normal cash withdrawals from the Central
Bank, so many had minimum cash in their tills at the time in any
case, Kibua said.

Effort to keeps peace process alive continues despite reported
</HEADLINE>
clashes
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Peace talks between Angola's government
and the former rebel movement UNITA are still underway, despite
reported military offensives from both sides, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The negotiations to avert a return to civil war followed an
emergency visit from a special U.N. envoy to prevent what had
appeared to be the imminent collapse of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace
deal.
	   U.N. spokesman Ahmadou Toure said the two sides have met almost
daily over the last week in a ``genuine attempt'' to negotiate a
solution to the current crisis.
	   He said they were spurred to action because the envoy made it
clear that the U.N.'s patience was running thin.
	   ``The U.N. (peacekeeping force) is not going to stay here
forever,'' he said.
	   But away from what Toure referred to as the ``surprisingly
friendly'' atmosphere of the negotiating table, the government and
UNITA have been accusing each other of military offensives.
	   Earlier this week the government's chief negotiator Higino
Carneiro said in a radio interview that the country had been
plunged into ``total instability' because of UNITA offensives in
the northeast.
	   State-controlled radio has also accused UNITA of massacring 150
people in one attack at the weekend.
	   The government claims that UNITA maintains a 30,000-strong
residual army, and that all proposals to relaunch the peace process
are meaningless without a commitment to full demobilization.
	   Meanwhile, UNITA's chief negotiator Isaias Samakuva told
reporters that the group has already fully dismantled its military
structures and so cannot be held responsible for the reported
attacks.
	   Samakuva has said UNITA cannot fulfill promises made in the 1994
peace deal, such as moving its headquarters from the central
highlands to the capital Luanda, until the government ceases its
``hostile propaganda.''
	   The UNITA spokesman added that he had reports that an army
battalion was behind the reported fighting in the northeastern
province of Malanje because it was attacking diamond-digging
settlements.
	   The U.N. does not maintain a presence in the remote and unstable
area for security reasons, and does not have confirmation of the
reported heavy fighting, Toure said.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's civil war that broke out
immediately after independence from Portugal in 1975 and raged for
nearly two decades before the 1994 peace deal.
	   One of the most cited reasons for the chronic instability that
has plagued Angola's peace process is the struggle for control over
the country's abundant natural resources.
	   The vast Southwest African country boasts huge reserves of oil,
gas and diamonds, as well as hydroelectric and agricultural
potential.

kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Cairo, police said.
	   Police arrested 25 people on charges of hooliganism, obstruction
and incitement to riot.
	   Some 75 villagers took to the streets when the police arrived to
demolish about 20 illegal structures, a police spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The villagers threw stones at the police, who had to use tear
gas to disperse the mob, the spokesman said.
	   The police managed to demolish the homes and kiosks.

Amnesty granted to four ANC men who killed two policemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four members of the African
National Congress who kidnapped and murdered two policemen in 1993
received amnesty Thursday from a body probing apartheid-era human
rights abuses.
	   Mlungisi Nyembezi, Luzuko Sydney Mpiyakhe, Solomzi Theo
Nomashizolo and Luyanda Lizwi had attacked a police station in
October, 1993, near Kokstad in the Indian Ocean province of
KwaZulu-Natal.
	   In applying for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the four said they acted in revenge for an earlier army
raid by the white-run government into the Transkei black homeland
in which five young men were killed.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended apartheid,
the Truth Commission has the power to grant amnesty to people who
fully confess their crimes and prove a political motive.
	   ``The applicants were pursuing their political party's
objectives'' and made full disclosure, the commission said, adding
that ``there was no evidence they had acted on personal agendas,
for personal gain or out of personal malice.''
	   The widows of the policemen had opposed granting amnesty.

Vice Premier says Czechs want good relations with Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Vice Premier Egon Lansky dismissed
allegations Thursday that his government is interfering in
Germany's internal affairs, saying good relations between the two
countries are essential for the Czechs.
	   ``The Czech government never intended to influence the election
campaign in Germany,'' Lansky, who is in charge of the country's
foreign policy, told the news agency CTK. ``None of the Czech
government representatives is attempting to do that,'' he said.
	   Lansky's statement came just one day after strong criticism of
Czech Premier Milos Zeman by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Kohl said that Zeman's earlier
remarks that he hopes for better cooperation with a government led
by Social Democrats, now in opposition, were unacceptable.
	   ``There's never been such a type of interference by a prime
minister in Europe,'' Kohl said.
	   Lansky said his government would avoid comments on various
statements made in Germany during the election campaign to maintain
good relations between the two countries. The German elections are
scheduled for next month.
	   ``It is in the Czech interest to have better than standard
relations with Germany,'' the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Lansky
as saying.
	   Relations between the Czech Republic and Germany deteriorated
last month after Zeman spoke up against having Sudeten Germans as
members of a Czech-German dialogue forum.
	   Zeman said that panel member Franz Neubauer, leader of a Sudeten
German group, was opposed to a 1997 German-Czech declaration aimed
at easing bilateral tensions, as were the Czech Republic's
Communist and Republican parties whose members were not nominated
to the forum by the Czech side.
	   ``I believe that Germany's future Social Democratic government
will understand that for the smooth work ... of the forum, it would
be better if strong opponents of the declaration are not there,''
Zeman said.
	   Zeman's remark immediately provoked strong protests in Germany,
with Kohl saying that comparing exiled Germans to radical rightist
and communists is ``absurd and completely unacceptable.''
	   The forum, set up under the declaration, is aimed at reconciling
the two neighbors following decades of hard feelings caused by the
Nazi occupation during World War II and the subsequent expulsion of
some 2.5 million Germans from the Sudetenland region of
then-Czechoslovakia.

Hotel offers Diana's last ride .... in a dark Mercedes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Left Bank hotel is giving tourists a chance to
relive Princess Diana's last moments as she made her way from the
Ritz Hotel to the crash site and, finally, the hospital where she
was pronounced dead.
	   To make it more dramatic, the Hotel Odeon at
Saint-Germain-des-Pres even offers private tours in a dark
Mercedes, the same make of car which spun out of control and
slammed into a pillar in a tunnel nearly one year ago.
	   French tourism officials criticized the plan as being
``unfortunate and opportunistic.''
	   ``Every day for the past year, thousands of people have found
their way daily to the Pont de l'Alma all by themselves,'' said
Christian Mantei, director of the Paris Tourism Office, referring
to the site of the crash. ``They don't need a tour.''
	   Mantei said his office hadn't received a single request for
information related to Diana's death.
	   But Emile Cacciari, manager at the Hotel Odeon, said his guests
_ about 85 percent of them American _ are eager to visit the sites.
	   ``We get as many questions as to how to find the Eiffel Tower
and Arc de Triomphe as the Ritz Hotel and the Place de l'Alma,''
Cacciari said Thursday in an interview.
	   Cacciari said the tour was aimed at boosting business which he
said is always slow in August.
	   Van tours start next Monday, and run through Aug. 31, the first
anniversary of Diana's death.
	   They're free of charge to Odeon guests and 150 francs (dlrs 25)
for anyone else. A ride in a Mercedes will cost 400 francs (dlrs
67).
	   Cacciari said the money would be donated to the Princess Diana
Memorial Fund. But a fund spokeswoman said Thursday they would
refuse the money.
	   The Ritz Hotel and Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
	   The tour goes first to the Hotel Ritz in the swanky Place
Vendome on the Right Bank, where Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed
dined before getting in the car with driver Henri Paul and
bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.
	   It then follows the route along the Seine River where Paul drove
at high speed to shake off press photographers, and stops at the
Place de l'Alma.
	   Nearly a year after Diana's death, mourners still lay flowers,
pictures, drawings and poems there by the gilded Flame of Liberty _
a replica of the Statue of Liberty's flame which was donated to the
city several years ago to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
International Herald Tribune.
	   The visit ends outside the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital where
Diana was pronounced dead.
	   British tourist Jeanette Sawdon said the tour smacked of
commercialism.
	   ``Who would do that? That's sick,'' she said, standing by the
flame. ``There has to be a better way to remember Diana.''

Effort to keep peace process alive continues despite reported

clashes

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Peace talks between Angola's government
and the former rebel movement UNITA are still underway, despite
reported military offensives from both sides, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The negotiations to avert a return to civil war followed an
emergency visit from a special U.N. envoy to prevent what had
appeared to be the imminent collapse of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace
deal.
	   U.N. spokesman Ahmadou Toure said the two sides have met almost
daily over the last week in a ``genuine attempt'' to negotiate a
solution to the current crisis.
	   He said they were spurred to action because the envoy made it
clear that the U.N.'s patience was running thin.
	   ``The U.N. (peacekeeping force) is not going to stay here
forever,'' he said.
	   But away from what Toure referred to as the ``surprisingly
friendly'' atmosphere of the negotiating table, the government and
UNITA have been accusing each other of military offensives.
	   Earlier this week the government's chief negotiator Higino
Carneiro said in a radio interview that the country had been
plunged into ``total instability' because of UNITA offensives in
the northeast.
	   State-controlled radio has also accused UNITA of massacring 150
people in one attack at the weekend.
	   The government claims that UNITA maintains a 30,000-strong
residual army, and that all proposals to relaunch the peace process
are meaningless without a commitment to full demobilization.
	   Meanwhile, UNITA's chief negotiator Isaias Samakuva told
reporters that the group has already fully dismantled its military
structures and so cannot be held responsible for the reported
attacks.
	   Samakuva has said UNITA cannot fulfill promises made in the 1994
peace deal, such as moving its headquarters from the central
highlands to the capital Luanda, until the government ceases its
``hostile propaganda.''
	   The UNITA spokesman added that he had reports that an army
battalion was behind the reported fighting in the northeastern
province of Malanje because it was attacking diamond-digging
settlements.
	   The U.N. does not maintain a presence in the remote and unstable
area for security reasons, and does not have confirmation of the
reported heavy fighting, Toure said.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's civil war that broke out
immediately after independence from Portugal in 1975 and raged for
nearly two decades before the 1994 peace deal.
	   One of the most cited reasons for the chronic instability that
has plagued Angola's peace process is the struggle for control over
the country's abundant natural resources.
	   The vast Southwest African country boasts huge reserves of oil,
gas and diamonds, as well as hydroelectric and agricultural
potential.

Volleyball federation proposes anti-doping measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ All athletes wishing to compete in
the Olympics and other major competitions should be compelled to
sign a form declaring they don't use banned drugs, volleyball's
world governing body said Thursday.
	   The international volleyball federation (FIVB) submitted the
proposal to the International Olympic Committee in the wake of
recent doping scandals which have tarnished cycling, swimming,
track and field and other sports.
	   The IOC has called a special executive board meeting next week
in Lausanne to deal with the drug problem and prepare for a
worldwide anti-doping conference scheduled for next January.
	   In a letter to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, FIVB chief
Ruben Acosta of Mexico suggested the IOC set up a task force of
doctors and coaches to study the doping problem in team and
individual sports.
	   Acosta said the Olympic movement should establish an ``act for
drug-free sport'' that covers athletes, national and international
sports bodies and government authorities.
	   The proposal calls for new eligibility rules for the Olympics
and other major events.
	   Athletes would have to sign an official document declaring
``under oath that they have not had recourse to any forbidden
substance or training method to improve their physical or mental
peformance and do not intend to do so.''
	   The athletes would also agree to adhere to their sport's
anti-doping rules, subject themselves to drug tests and submit any
appeals to the Swiss-based International Court of Arbitration for
Sport.
	   Under the proposal, national bodies could enter only those
athletes who had signed the document and ``adhered to it
unreservedly.''
	   The FIVB also said the Olympic movement should push for a U.N.
resolution in which each member country agrees to adopt national
anti-doping legislation.
	   Each country would consider the use of illegal doping substances
as ``fraudulent conduct'' and allow its nationals to be prosecuted
for drug offenses by international sports organizations.
	   ``Laws against doping already exist and penalties have been
established by governmental and sports authorities in their
respective areas,'' Acosta said. ``The question now is to know who
is enforcing or really willing to enforce them with honesty and
care without going to extreme positions...''
	   Without naming any groups, Acosta acccused ``fundamentalists''
of waging a ``witch hunt'' against drugs while others took a
``laissez faire'' attitude.
	   ``Some others are now concocting scapegoats to hide their
personal failure or intentions,'' he said.
	   Acosta criticized Primo Nebiolo, president of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, for spreading ``misinformation'' about
anti-doping measures in volleyball and other sports.
	   Nebiolo had singled out volleyball, tennis and cycling as
international federations which had not signed an IOC accord for
unifying doping rules five years ago.
	   ``Our policy is in line with that of the IOC-IFs agreement on
anti-doping rules and ... our project goes even further, since we
do not only penalize the guilty athlete but also the whole team by
declaring it forfeiting the match in dispute,'' Acosta said.

U.S. House speaker finds his rebellious Irish roots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INCH ISLAND, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich dug
into his rebellious Irish roots Thursday, an experience he called
``far more emotional than I would have imagined.''
	   Nearing the end of his first weeklong tour through Ireland,
Gingrich toured the Inishowen peninsula, the windswept northernmost
tip of the Irish Republic, where his O'Dougherty ancestors ruled
until crushing defeat four centuries ago.
	   The surname _ variously spelled O Dochartaigh, O'Doherty,
O'Docherty or, as his maternal grandmother's family did,
O'Dougherty _ is derived from ``dochartach,'' which means
``hurtful'' in Gaelic. Local pronunciation favors ``daw,'' not
``dough.''
	   The clan ruled Inishowen from the 13th century until 1608, when
Sir Cahir O'Dougherty rebelled against his English overlords and
seized the nearby port of Derry. His rebellion was thwarted and he
was executed, paving the way for King James I's mass settlement of
Protestants from Scotland and the city's rechristening as
Londonderry.
	   ``I've got Scottish McPhersons in the family tree, too, and they
were the last of the Highlands clans to concede to English rule,''
Gingrich said. ``So it appears my rebelliousness has very deep
roots.''
	   At the geneology center on Inishowen's Inch Island, near the
stone ruins of the O'Dougherty fortress, Gingrich learned that
authorities are tracking more than 2 million namesakes worldwide.
	   Gingrich, an avid historian who holds a doctorate in Belgian
colonial history, said he'd long paid little heed to his Irish
bloodline.
	   ``When we were growing up, my dad was in the army, we moved all
over the world, and it never occurred to me to stop and look up my
roots,'' he said. ``I knew my mother was Irish, that's all. But
when you're standing at the ancestral castle ... it comes alive in
a way that, until you've done it, you can't appreciate.''
	   Gingrich had too packed a schedule to nail down how or when his
O'Doughtertys made it to America, but his aides took away a trove
of papers.
	   Gingrich also crossed the border to tour the walled city of
Londonderry, second-largest city of British-ruled Northern Ireland,
where local Protestants marched last weekend in an annual
celebration of its successful 1689 defense from Catholic forces.
	   He then traveled 40 miles (70 kms) southeast to the rural St.
James' Catholic church, one of 10 attacked by arsonists in July.
	   The church was gutted as part of hard-line Protestants' failed
efforts to force British authorities to allow a Protestant Orange
Order parade through a hostile Catholic district.

 &UR; Serb attacks continue, raising fears about food supply
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Rugova making his announcement; US
comment; background; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's main Albanian leader
announced his team Thursday to negotiate the future of the province
with the Yugoslav government but without representatives of rebels
fighting for independence.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said the Kosovo Liberation Army refused his offer
to participate, as did two leading politicians with close links to
the guerrillas.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included,'' Rugova told a press conference. There was no
immediate response from the Yugoslav government, which has offered
to discuss restoring self-rule which President Slobodan Milosevic
withdrew in 1989.
	   But Milosevic's offer of autonomy, supported by the United
States and the Europeans, falls short of the KLA's goal of complete
independence from Serbia, the largest of two republics that form
Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill and other representatives of
the so-called Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy -- were on hand for the announcement to
show their support for Rugova. He also supports independence but
has renounced violence.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, welcomed
the announcement and said the team ``is prepared to resume the
process of negotiations'' -- broken off in May -- ``despite the
violence on the ground.''
	   Rugova and Western powers had hoped for a broad-based delegation
to represent the Albanian community, which forms 90 percent of the
province's 2 million population.
	   But the KLA, as well as politicians Adem Demaci and Mehmet
Hajrizi, declined to join, raising doubts about prospects for
success. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Rugova decided to go ahead without the others to move the
negotiating process off dead center.
	   The diplomats said they hoped that if the talks showed signs of
progress, the others might join.
	   But Albanian sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Demaci may be moving to establish a political wing of the KLA,
which could challenge Rugova's credentials as the leader of the
Albanian community.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian journalists, the
KLA said they had designed their own seven-member team to represent
them in any talks. Demaci was designated as head of the team on
condition he would give up his position in his Albanian Democratic
Movement.
	   Others included KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi and Bardhyl
Mahmuti, the head of KLA's support organization in Switzerland.
	   Rugova's position among Albanians has been seriously undermined
since his non-violence approach failed to halt both the five-month
Serb crackdown on Albanian extremists or achieve goals of
self-rule.
	   A diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the process of forming a team was made
more difficult because ``evidence never came that anyone ... could
control the KLA.''
	   The rebels remained firm despite recent setbacks on the
battlefield.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Serb police Wednesday
fought their way into the former rebel stronghold of Glodjane
following two days of fierce fighting in which five Serb policemen
and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported that seven rebels were killed and 49 wounded in the
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the KLA. The
village has been under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   Each side blamed the other for launching the attacks.
	   Milosevic had promised European Union envoys that his forces
would not attack Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, speaking for the
EU, condemned the fighting around Junik and urged the Yugoslav
government to avoid actions that would worsen the ``already
unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that up to
240,000 people have been displaced by the fighting. Tens of
thousands are hiding in forests and hills of Kosovo, fearful of
reprisals if they return home.
	   On Wednesday, a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity, warned that significant numbers of refugees must be
returned to their homes in time to harvest crops.
	   The harvest season begins in Kosovo in about three weeks and
unless significant numbers can return home by then, the diplomat
warned of a humanitarian disaster once winter begins in a few
months.

Foreign minister: Barbados will continue to strengthen ties with

Cuba &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Barbados will continue to strengthen
its ties with Cuba, the Caribbean island's foreign minister said.
	   Foreign Minister Billie Miller said Barbados had begun a policy
of ``constructive engagement with Cuba in an effort to help the
country fulfill its destiny as an integral part of the Caribbean
and wider Americas.''
	   Miller made the comments Tuesday during debate in the Barbados
House of Assembly.
	   She also criticized the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.
Caribbean countries have become increasingly critical of
international sanctions against their communist neighbor.
	   ``Cuba is one of the markets with which Barbados would want to
do business in the coming century in the same way we do business
with China and Japan and whoever,'' Miller said. ``We will do
business with Cuba.''
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro visited Barbados earlier this month
as part of a six-day tour that also included Grenada and Jamaica.
He met with business leaders and politicians, including Prime
Minister Owen Arthur.

Lesotho capital closes down for fourth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ In a stand-off between government and
opposition supporters, businesses and offices remained closed for
the fourth day on Thursday while security forces kept a low
profile.
	   Several hundred opposition demonstrators threw up barriers at
key roads leading into the city. Another 200 continued to gather
outside the palace of King Letsie III, where they have held watch
for more than a week, diplomatic sources said.
	   Police and soldiers have been ordered to keep a distance except
in life-threatening situations, sources said.
	   ``It's as though they are present, but passive rather than
reactive,'' British High Commissioner Peter Smith said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.
	   Frustrated by the lack of police intervention, ruling party
supporters have taken to the streets to harass opposition
demonstrators, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Unofficial reports said that since early last week, two people
have died and another four suffered gunshot wounds in scuffles
between supporters of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy and
opposition groups.
	   Government officials could not be reached for comment on the
reports.
	   The dispute centers on May's elections, when the Congress for
Democracy won all but one of the Parliamentary seats. Three main
opposition parties failed in their attempt to get the courts to
postpone the elections after they claimed irregularities in voter
registration.
	   More than 100 hundred international election monitors certified
that the polling was above board, diplomats said.
	   ``The elections proved a fair reflection of the wishes of the
Lesotho people,'' Smith said.
	   In Maseru, shops, banks and offices remained closed, although
some diplomatic personnel worked in their offices, and shortages of
cooking fuel and food were reported. Taxis were on strike and many
people turned back at sight of the roadblocks, witnesses said.
	   ``No one can get into the offices, people are blocking the
roads,'' said Elizabeth Kehoe, a British High Commission employee
in a telephone interview.
	   Lesotho's King Letsie III, who has ceremonial powers, on
Wednesday called the country's chiefs together in an effort to
mediate the conflict, an unnamed palace source told South African
Press Association on Thursday.
	   ``The British government deplores the present unrest in Maseru,
which is affecting the livelihood of poorer people,'' Smith said.
	   The tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million surrounded by South
Africa is plagued by a long history of political upheaval that has
seen power pass back and forth between military and elected
governments, and the royal family take opposite sides in the
struggles.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last three grafs with Iraq saying it has handed
videotapes of Aziz-Butler meeting to UN; Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday renewed its allegations
that it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weaponry.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Aug. 5 announced that Iraq would
no longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan.
	   He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
later Thursday ``to give him the message to the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry said that
diplomat Aubin de la Messuziere, head of the French interest
section in Baghdad, had handed a letter to Aziz expressing French
concern about Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed by a day a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the paper said.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's ruling Baath party,
said in a front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts
to raising doubts and accusations that are not based on any
facts.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   In his letter, however, Butler said Iraq was impeding the
long-term monitoring by restricting the number of sites that could
be monitored and not allowing inspectors to act on violations that
inspectors' equipment detect.
	   The letter was clearly intended to prod the Security Council
into taking a tougher response to Iraq's decision by making clear
that monitoring of already known sites isn't sufficient to ensure
Baghdad isn't rebuilding its weapons programs.
	   Meanwhile, Iraq said Thursday that it had turned over to the
United Nations two videotapes of Butler's Aug. 3 meeting with Aziz
which had been broadcast earlier this week on Iraqi television.
	   Clips of the video show, among other things, Aziz refusing to
turn over a document to Butler and Butler getting up to leave the
meeting.
	   Saeed Hasan, Iraq's deputy ambassador at the United Nations,
said in a letter to the Security Council that Baghdad was allowing
the United Nations and council members to view the tapes to inform
the international community of Butler's ``misrepresentations'' of
what occurred during the meetings.

Effort to keep peace process alive continues despite reported

clashes

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Peace talks between Angola's government
and the former rebel movement UNITA are still under way despite
reported military offensives from both sides, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The negotiations to avert a return to civil war followed an
emergency visit from a special U.N. envoy to prevent what appeared
to be the imminent collapse of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace deal.
	   U.N. spokesman Ahmadou Toure said the two sides have met almost
daily over the last week in a ``genuine attempt'' to negotiate a
solution because the envoy made it clear the U.N.'s patience was
running thin.
	   ``The U.N. (peacekeeping force) is not going to stay here
forever,'' he said.
	   The government and UNITA have been accusing each other of
military offensives.
	   Earlier this week, the government's chief negotiator Higino
Carneiro said in a radio interview that UNITA offensives in the
northeast have plunged the country into ``total instability.''
	   State-controlled radio also accused UNITA of massacring 150
people in a recent attack.
	   The government claims UNITA maintains a 30,000-strong residual
army.
	   However, UNITA's chief negotiator Isaias Samakuva said the group
has already fully dismantled its military structures, so it cannot
be held responsible for the reported attacks.
	   Until the government ceases its ``hostile propaganda,'' Samakuva
has said UNITA cannot fulfill promises made in the 1994 peace deal,
such as moving its headquarters from the central highlands to the
capital Luanda.
	   Samakuva added that he had reports that an army battalion was
behind the reported fighting in the northeastern province of
Malanje because it was attacking diamond-digging settlements.
	   The United Nations does not maintain a presence in the remote
and unstable area for security reasons, and does not have
confirmation of the reported heavy fighting, Toure said.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's civil war that broke out
immediately after independence from Portugal in 1975 and raged for
nearly two decades before the 1994 peace deal.
	   One of the most cited reasons for the chronic instability is the
struggle for control over the country's abundant natural resources.
The vast southwest African country boasts huge reserves of oil, gas
and diamonds, as well as hydroelectric and agricultural potential.

Swedish painter Philip von Schantz dies at 70
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Philip von Schantz, one of Sweden's
most noted painters and a former director of Stockholm's modern art
museum, has died at age 70, the news agency TT reported.
	   He died at a hospital in Norrtaelje, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Stockholm, after becoming ill on Wednesday, the
report said without giving details of the illness.
	   A documentary on his career was being shown on national TV the
same evening.
	   Von Schantz was known for his highly detailed still-lifes,
especially of mounds of berries and other fruits. His paintings
were widely shown throughout the world.
	   He was the head of the Moderna Museet in 1973-77 and president
of the Swedish Art Academy from 1987 to 1993.
	   There was no immediate information on survivors or funeral
arrangements.

Dutchman arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing 14 children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Police have arrested a Dutchman
suspected of sexually abusing 14 children aged 5 to 16 and have
seized child pornography at his home, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The arrest of the 40-year-old man occurred in May but was only
publicized Thursday ahead of a pre-trial hearing on Friday.
	   The case came to light just weeks after the discovery of a
Dutch-based international pedophilia ring that spread pornography
of children _ even infants _ via the Internet.
	   In that high-profile case, police found a large cache of child
pornography in the seaside town of Zandvoort which not only stunned
the country, but also neighboring Germany and Belgium. The case has
intensified protests against child pornography.
	   The identity of the latest suspect from the eastern town of
Zoetermeer, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Amsterdam,
was not released in line with Dutch police practice.
	   Prosecutor's office spokesman Frank Schroer said police found
1,400 pornographic pictures of children in the suspect's house.
They were downloaded from the Internet.
	   But the suspect apparently did not distribute any materials, he
added.
	   Authorities have also ruled out a link with the case in
Zandvoort.

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ American sprint star Marion Jones
will be part of the U.S. team competing at next month's World Cup
in South Africa, the sport's governing body said Thursday.
	   Jones, who is unbeaten this year in the 100 meters, won the
event in 10.77 seconds at Wednesday's prestigious Weltklasse meet
in Zurich. She also won the long jump.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the world in the
100 this year, hopes to win five gold medals at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics _ in the 100, 200, long jump and two relays.
	   Jones is one of four athletes still in the chase for a dlrs 1
million jackpot, shared by those who remain unbeaten in certain
events in the six Golden League meets and the Grand Prix final in
Moscow on Sept. 5.
	   The World Cup takes place in Johannesburg Sept. 11-13.

Daimler to build M-Class in Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Due to strong demand for its
Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility vehicle, Daimler-Benz said
Thursday it would begin producing them next year in Austria for the
European market.
	   Daimler-Benz expects to sign an agreement with its Austrian
partner, Steyr-Daimler-Puch-Fahrzeugtechnik AG &AMP; Co KG, in
September and start producing up to 30,000 vehicles annually in
Graz in mid-1999, said Juergen Hubbert, chairman of Daimler's
automobile division.
	   ``Since Chryslers are also assembled there, we can achieve
synergies and reach the expanded capacity quicker and at lower
cost,'' he said.
	   Daimler announced its intention to buy Chrysler earlier this
year. Chrysler produces minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokee for Europe
in Austria.
	   The Mercedes-Benz M-Class is currently built in Tuscaloosa,
Ala., where capacity is already increasing to 80,000 units for 1999
from 65,000 units.
	   Since the M-Class was introduced in North America in September
1997, about 50,000 have been sold in the U.S. and Canada, and more
than 3,000 have already been delivered to Europe in just three
months.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's main Albanian leader
announced Thursday that he has gathered a team to negotiate the
future of the separatist province with the Yugoslav government. But
they group lacked representatives of rebels fighting for
independence.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said the Kosovo Liberation Army refused his offer
to participate, as did two leading politicians with close links to
the guerrillas.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included,'' Rugova told a press conference. There was no
immediate response from the Yugoslav government, which has offered
to discuss restoring self-rule, which President Slobodan Milosevic
withdrew in 1989.
	   But Milosevic's offer of autonomy, supported by the United
States and the Europeans, falls short of the KLA's goal of complete
independence from Serbia, the largest of two republics that form
Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill and other representatives of
the so-called Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy _ were on hand for the announcement to
show their support for Rugova who also supports independence but
has renounced violence.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, welcomed
the announcement and said the team ``is prepared to resume the
process of negotiations'' broken off in May, ``despite the violence
on the ground.''
	   Rugova and Western powers had hoped for a broad-based delegation
to represent the Albanian community, which forms 90 percent of the
province's 2 million population.
	   But the KLA, as well as politicians Adem Demaci and Mehmet
Hajrizi, declined to join, raising doubts about prospects for
success. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they hoped that if the talks showed signs of progress, the
others might join.
	   But Albanian sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Demaci may be moving to establish a political wing of the KLA,
which could challenge Rugova's credentials as the leader of the
Albanian community.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian journalists, the
KLA said they designed their own seven-member team to represent
them in any talks. Demaci was designated as head of the team on
condition he would give up his position in his Albanian Democratic
Movement.
	   Others included KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi and Bardhyl
Mahmuti, the head of KLA's support organization in Switzerland.
	   Rugova's position among Albanians has been seriously undermined
since his non-violence approach failed to halt both the five-month
Serb crackdown on Albanian extremists.
	   A diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the process of forming a team was made
more difficult because ``evidence never came that anyone ... could
control the KLA.''
	   The rebels remained firm despite recent setbacks on the
battlefield, where Serbs have been making inroads into KLAa
territory.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 240,000
people have been displaced by the fighting. Tens of thousands are
hiding in forests and hills of Kosovo, fearful of reprisals if they
return home.
	   On Wednesday, a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity, warned that significant numbers of refugees must be
returned to their homes in time to harvest crops.
	   The harvest season begins in Kosovo in about three weeks. Unless
significant numbers can return home by then, the diplomat warned of
a humanitarian disaster once winter begins in a few months.

Hutu rebels kill eight Tutsis in displaced persons camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a camp for Tutsis
displaced by fighting in Burundi early Thursday and killed eight
people, a regional official said.
	   Gilbert Kayanda, governor of Bubanza province north of
Bujumbura, said fighting between the rebels and the army was
continuing.
	   He identified the rebels as belonging to the National Liberation
Front, the armed wing of the Burundian Hutu Palipehutu party. He
also said residents in the region 45 kilometers (28 miles)
northwest of the capital said many of the attackers were speaking
Kinyarwanda, the language of neighboring Rwanda.
	   ``There are many rebels in that area who were members of the
Interahamwe ... the area is very hilly and provides good hiding
places, and there is food,'' Kayanda said.
	   The Interahamwe was the militia organized by the extremist Hutu
government in Rwanda to kill Tutsis in 1994. At least half a
million people died in the 90-day slaughter.
	   Many of the militiamen sought refugee in eastern Congo and
northwestern Burundi, from where they now attack Rwanda.
	   Kayanda said residents said the attackers wore military
camouflage uniforms and sang ``don't fall back _ advance and kill
everything that moves.''
	   Since October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers in Burundi
assassinated the country's first Hutu president, at least 200,000
people have been killed, most of them civilians either targeted or
caught in the crossfire between army and rebels.
	   Tutsis, who make up only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, have run the country for all but four months since
independence in 1962. Hutus account for about 65 percent of the
population.
	   The population ratio is similar in neighboring Rwanda.
	   The National Liberation Front refused to recognize a cease-fire
agreed to at all-party peace talks on Burundi held last month in
neighboring Tanzania. The Burundian army said it was not bound by
such an agreement since it had to defend the population from
attacks.

French singer Nino Ferrer commits suicide

<TEXT>
	   CAHORS, France (AP) _ French singer Nino Ferrer committed
suicide Thursday near his home in the Lot region in southern
France, police said. He was to turn 64 on Saturday.
	   Police said Ferrer shot himself with a hunting rifle. His body
was found next to his car parked in a field near the town of
Saint-Cyprien.
	   A popular French singer for three decades, Ferrer was reported
missing by his wife after she found a letter saying he planned to
kill himself, police said.
	   Famous for his gravelly voice, nostaligic lyrics and puns,
Ferrer hit the top of the charts with ``Le Sud,'' ``Mirza'' ``Les
Cornichons,'' and ``Le Telefon.''
	   He gave up music several years ago to devote himself to
painting.
	   No details were immediately available concerning survivors or
funeral arrangements.

EU delegation surveys dismal refugee situation in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A delegation of the European Union, on a
tour of Balkan countries, expressed alarm at the worsening
situation of thousands of refugees massed in northern Albania along
the border with Yugoslavia, the Austrian Foreign Ministry said.
	   Austrian diplomat Gerhard Jandl, who led the EU mission,
described the humanitarian situation in the region as
``depressing,'' ministry officials, as quoted by the Austria Press
Agency, said.
	   Immediate measures to alleviate the refugees' plight are to be
discussed when the delegation returns on Friday.
	   At present there are between 15,000 and 20,000 Kosovo refugees
in Albania's border region, but the aid agencies and local
authorities are stretched to the limit in attempts to care for the
masses of displaced people, including many children, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   The delegation met Thursday in Skopje with representatives of
the Macedonian government and the opposition. More than a quarter
of Macedonia's population of two million are ethnic Albanians.

``Hail Motherland'' messages greet Indians on nation's 50th

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Telephones in 25 of India's largest
cities have been barking out ``Hail Motherland'' as the nation
wraps up celebrations of its 50th anniversary of independence.
	   The Hindu nationalist government led by the Bharatiya Janata
Party thinks the ``Vande Mataram'' greeting broadcast during the
last few days will generate a feeling of pride among Indians, ahead
of Saturday's independence day celebrations.
	   The greetings have been broadcast in cities, including New
Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. But technical problems and lack
of time could hamper the government's efforts to broadcast the
message on 180 million telephones in other big cities, The Indian
Express newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Many telephone exchanges in towns and villages are not
electronic and cannot broadcast these recordings. The
government-run telephone department must install new software in
its computers for the announcement to come on as soon as a person
lifts the telephone receiver, the newspaper said.
	   Companies such as AT and T, Motorola, Ericsson and Fujitsu,
which supply the equipment containing the software, are reluctant
to part with the secret computer codes, it said. They also have
said that it is impossible to install new equipment in the
telephone exchanges by Saturday.
	   But not all Indians are pleased with the greeting. Some see it
as yet another attempt by the right-wing government to promote its
brand of Hindu nationalism. BJP state governments have forced
school students to sing a patriotic song called Vande Mataram. The
BJP's political opponents have criticized the move.
	   Internet users in New Delhi blamed the switchover for computer
connections that snap within minutes. Fastidious language experts
have faulted the pronunciation of the greeting in some exchanges.

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Eleven illegal
immigrants from China were found wandering on the island of St.
Thomas after they were abandoned by the smugglers who brought them
there, police said Thursday.
	   The 10 men and one woman were discovered by residents near
eastern Sapphire Village.
	   The group was being interviewed by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents on St. Croix. Some of the immigrants
told police they paid as much as dlrs 10,000 to be smuggled into
the United States.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 132 Chinese illegal immigrants have
been caught in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Immigration officials said
220 were caught last year.
	   The Caribbean has become an increasingly busy transshipment area
for Chinese immigrants, who often agree to years of indentured
servitude in exchange for being smuggled to the United States.

Russian international signs for Paris Saint-Germain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian international midfielder Igor Yanovski has
signed a four-year contract with France's Paris Saint-Germain, the
French first division club said Thursday.
	   Yanovski, 24, has 16 caps for Russia. He moved from Russian club
Vladikavkaz.
	   The terms of the contract were not released.
	   Paris Saint-Germain has spent lavishly over the summer in a bid
to build a squad to challenge for the French title.
	   Its most standout signing was Nigeria's Jay-Jay Okocha who
joined for a French record deal of 100 million francs (dlrs 17
million).
	   Nevertheless, PSG failed to kick off the season successfully,
losing its opening game 3-1 to Bordeaux last week.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last three grafs with Iraq saying it has handed
videotapes of Aziz-Butler meeting to UN. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq renewed its allegations Thursday that
it is not being treated fairly by U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The comments came as Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for talks
aimed at defusing the latest crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced Aug. 5 that Iraq would no
longer cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged
with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and chemical
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arrival at Habbaniya Airport,
90 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, that he had brought a
message from Annan. He said he would meet Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, later Thursday ``to give him the message to
the Iraqi leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask Saddam to
reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said diplomat Aubin de la
Messuziere, head of the French interest section in Baghdad, handed
a letter to Aziz expressing French concern about Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine termed it ``a
grave decision that my country can't help but deplore.'' Vedrine
warned that Iraq was ``slowing down the accomplishment of the
mandates'' of the United Nations.
	   The head of the U.N. Special Commission, Richard Butler, on
Wednesday said in a letter to the Security Council that Iraqi
restrictions on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure
that Iraq was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   The letter followed a day after a similar letter from Mohammed
el-Baradei, head of the the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for overseeing destruction of Iraq's nuclear
weapons capability.
	   On Thursday, the state-run Al-Qadissiya repeated Iraq's
allegation that Butler was working on behalf of the United States
to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``Butler showed he is no longer up to his job, which requires a
minimum of impartiality and fairness,'' the newspaper said.
	   Al-Thawra, published by Saddam's ruling Baath party, said in a
front-page editorial that Butler's commission ``resorts to raising
doubts and accusations that are not based on any facts.''
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   In his letter, however, Butler said Iraq was impeding the
long-term monitoring by restricting the number of sites that could
be monitored and not allowing inspectors to act on violations that
inspectors' equipment detect.
	   The letter was clearly intended to prod the Security Council
into taking a tougher response to Iraq's decision by making clear
that monitoring of already known sites was insufficient to ensure
Baghdad isn't rebuilding its weapons programs.
	   Also Thursday, Iraq said it turned over to the United Nations
two videotapes of Butler's Aug. 3 meeting with Aziz, which was
broadcast earlier this week on Iraqi television.
	   Clips of the video show, among other things, Aziz refusing to
turn over a document to Butler, and Butler getting up to leave the
meeting.
	   Saeed Hasan, Iraq's deputy ambassador at the United Nations,
said in a letter to the Security Council that Baghdad was allowing
the United Nations and council members to view the tapes to inform
the international community of Butler's ``misrepresentations'' of
what occurred during the meetings.

Meeting Friday to begin talks on platform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western diplomats will meet Friday
with an ethnic Albanian team to begin forming a platform for talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future of Kosovo.
	   After Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova announced his team, special
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said the international community was
ready to help make the process a success.
	   ``The team is prepared to resume the process of negotiations
despite the fact that violence is continuing on the ground,'' Hill
said. ``It is precisely because of the violence that it is so
important to restart negotiations.
	   ``With the formation of this team Albanians are demonstrating
their readiness to engage in meaningful negotiations. The other
side must do the same. Without negotiations the people of Kosovo
will continue to suffer. With negotiations we can end the conflict
and allow people to resume their lives and build a new future.''
	   Hill also sent a message to the Kosovo Albanians:
	   ``This negotiating has been created to represent your interest.
It is responsible to you. The team will have a critical task of
negotiating agreements to end the violence, foster democracy and
establish the basis for a fair solution for the overall problem of
Kosovo. These are tasks that cannot wait even one more day, because
with every passing day people loose hope that Kosovo can be a safe
and secure place in which to live.''
	   He said the next step would be for a U.S. team to work with the
negotiators immediately to go over various ideas ``of how we can
proceed and then we would like to build a momentum very quickly to
get some early success'' to attract the Kosovo Liberation Army and
others in the Albanian community.

Amid concern over ruble, Russian Central Bank imposes new
</HEADLINE>
restrictions &QL;

 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government and Central Bank officials tried
Thursday to parry investors' growing panic over the Russian ruble's
stability with assurances that the currency would not be devalued.
	   As the ruble continued to slide and the stock market to plunge,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko dismissed the markets' free-fall as
a ``psychological reaction'' rather than one caused by economic
developments in the country.
	   ``The only normal way to respond to the market condition, the
investors' panic, is to strictly implement the program we have
approved,'' he said.
	   The stock market fell 6.5 percent, to close at 101.17 points.
The ruble ended sharply lower amid continued fear of bank defaults
and further instability of the ruble.
	   George Soros, the billionaire investor whose moves are closely
watched on international markets, shook markets with a suggestion
in Thursday's Financial Times of London that the ruble should be
devalued by 15 to 25 percent.
	   Central Bank officials went on the offensive, issuing a flurry
of denials that devaluation was on the government's agenda _ even
though the bank's ability to hold up the ruble is being eroded by
its rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves. The bank reported
Thursday that the reserves stood at dlrs 17 billion on Aug. 7, down
from dlrs 18.4 billion a week earlier.
	   ``In our view, devaluation will not solve a single problem and
would deal a painful blow to every Russian's purse,'' said Irina
Yasina, chief spokeswoman for the Central Bank. ``It would only
exacerbate the situation and that we don't need.''
	   Unlike the market ups and downs, devaluation would reach
ordinary Russians by sparking immediate, sharp price rises, which
could in turn stoke social unrest. It would also most likely cause
some banks to go bankrupt, sweeping away depositors' savings.
	   In the long run, devaluation could force Russian producers to be
more competitive with the foreign producers who provide 70 percent
of the food in Russian stores. But in the short run, it would be
excruciating for people already staggering under the weight of
unpaid salaries and the increasing cost of living.
	   Many Russians have been hedging their bets on the economy for a
long time by converting rubles to dollars and German marks as
quickly as they get them.
	   The Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency trading
by commercial banks, causing frightened bankers to temporarily halt
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was briefly halted on Russia's main stock exchange
for the second time this week, because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent during the first 40 minutes of trading.
	   Late in the day, Moody's, the international credit rating
service, downgraded its rating for Russia's foreign debt, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Fitch IBCA rating agency said it had placed one Russian
bank, SBS Agro, on what it called rating alert negative. The firm
said SBS Agro was having trouble ``meeting margin calls on its
repurchase transactions.''

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Rolling Stones arrived Thursday in
Warsaw, which hosted their first concert in the former Soviet bloc
more than three decades earlier.
	   The group will play one show in Poland at the nation's biggest
stadium in Chorzow, 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Warsaw,
on Friday night. Fans from neighboring Czech Republic and Slovakia
are expected to join Poles in the 60,000-capacity stadium.
	   In 1967, the group received permission to play in Warsaw because
a granddaughter of then-Communist Party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka
was a fan. A similar application to perform in Moscow that year was
rejected.
	   On Tuesday, the band played in Moscow for the first time.
	   The tour is promoting the band's latest album, ``Bridges to
Babylon.''

Norway will work for religious freedom in OSCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will stress religious freedom when
its takes over the rotating chairmanship of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe next year, deputy foreign
minister Janne Haaland Matlary said Thursday.
	   At a conference on religious freedom, Matlary pointed to the
Bosnian war and other conflicts in stressing that freedom of
religion must be an important goal for OSCE.
	   She said that although few conflicts are about religion in their
origins, it is easy to use religion to whip up hatred.
	   About 200 Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Christians and
representatives from other religions are taking part in the
conference.
	   Even with an official delegation from Iran in the audience, the
Lutheran bishop of Oslo, Gunnar Staalsett, blasted fundamentalism,
calling it a distortion of true religion and an insult against
humanity.
	   Staalsett stressed that both political and religious
fundamentalism is wrong, and that fundamentalism often violates
principles of equality.
	   He pointed out that there is fundamentalism within all the major
global religions, specifically mentioning both right-wing
Christians in the United States and countries that enact Muslim
religious laws.
	   Staalsett in particular lashed out against the Iranian death
threats against British author Salman Rushdie, whose Norwegian
publisher William Nygaard was severely wounded four years ago in a
shooting that Rushdie believes was connected to Iran.
	   The leader of the Iranian delegation, professor Hossein
Mohieddin, denied that the Rushdie case has anything to do with
fredom of expression. According to Norway's national news agency
NTB, he said that nobody has the right to insult another nation and
religion.

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A passenger presumed to be in a
truck that investigators think exploded at the U.S. Embassy is
still unaccounted for, acting U.S. Ambassador John Lange said
Thursday.
	   The truck driver was killed. But his assistant, Saidi Rogati,
has been missing since Aug. 7, when twin blasts hit the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The Nairobi blast killed
247; the one in Dar es Salaam killed 10.
	   All bodies from the Dar es Salaam blast have been identified,
and Rogati's is not among them, Lange said.
	   It was not immediately known whether Rogati, 49, was in the
water tanker at the time. If he was, the explosion may have blown
his body to bits.
	   Both Tanzanian police and U.S. officials have said the tanker _
now lying upside in the rubble _ may have been the bomb.
	   The truck delivered water to the embassy in Dar es Salaam, which
suffers from water shortages. Both the driver and his assistant
were embassy employees.
	   Embassy officials have said the water tanker was being checked
by a guard at the entrance when the blast occurred.
	   The FBI, meanwhile, said it has found crucial evidence.
	   ``We have found evidence of a bomb, I will assure you of that
and that is not surprising,'' said Kenneth Piernick, who is heading
the investigation.
	   FBI officials and Tanzanian police refused to comment Thursday
on the questioning of suspects.
	   Tanzanian police have said they have arrested 14 suspects, all
foreigners. Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohammed said around
30 people in all were being questioned.
	   Lange said the embassy was being abandoned.
	   ``I would never expect us to occupy this building in any way
shape or form. In fact, I would assume it will be torn down as soon
as the investigation is over,'' he said.
	   The U.S. government considered Tanzania a low-threat location
and embassy security was not up to current guidelines.

Relief and caution greet announcement of Holocaust settlement

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The two biggest Swiss banks' agreement to settle
Holocaust survivors' claims with a dlrs 1.25 billion payment was
given a relieved welcome in Switzerland Thursday, but also met with
some skepticism and criticism.
	   The banks said they expected ``other Swiss companies and
institutions will contribute to the financing of this sum.'' But
many said they would have to discuss the matter further.
	   The chief executive officer of the biggest bank, United Bank of
Switzerland, Marcel Ospel, said he was confident others would
contribute.
	   ``I have already received positive signals in connection with
this,'' he said, but didn't elaborate.
	   Late Thursday, the Swiss government said the agreement committed
it to nothing. Thomas Borer, the diplomat who heads the government
task force on World War II, read out in Bern a statement expressing
hope that it would help to calm the situation.
	   It restated its position that the settlement is a matter for
those involved.
	   ``Correspondingly, (the government) did not take part in the
negotiations, for which reason the Swiss Confederation is committed
to nothing by the settlement,'' the statement said.
	   Switzerland's main industry body, Vorort, said the banks'
settlement was in the Swiss economy's interest. But its president,
Andres F. Leuenberger, said any contributions from industry would
have to be discussed.
	   A spokesman for engineering group Sulzer said it was ready to
financially contribute to the settlement.
	   Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis said they were
ready for a dialogue with the banks, but left open the question of
a contribution.
	   Switzerland's central bank and government have refused to become
involved in settlement talks. Both said they didn't yet have full
details of the agreement.
	   The central bank welcomed as ``positive'' the out-of-court
settlement between the two major Swiss banks and their plaintiffs.
	   But Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said this was not
the time to discuss any contribution of its own.
	   In his view, the commercial banks had committed themselves to
paying the agreed sum, Abegg added.
	   The question of a financial contribution from third parties has
been postponed to a later phase, he said, giving time for the
accord to be studied in detail. He didn't specify a date.
	   Ulrich Pfister, spokesman for Credit Suisse, which joined UBS in
negotiating the accord, acknowledged it would meet some criticism
in Switzerland.
	   The parties that make up the coalition government gave a mixed
response. All four rejected any suggestion that either the
government or the SNB should contribute to it.
	   The Socialist Party gave the agreement a broad welcome, but said
many questions remained to be answered. Two center-right parties
expressed doubts that it would defuse tensions.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
he regretted that a combination of legal action and sanction
threats had achieved its objective.
	   Switzerland's main Jewish organization, the Swiss Confederation
of Hebrew Congregations, said it expected the accord would ease the
tension over the Holocaust issue.
	   ``We also hope it will establish a basis for a better
understanding between all those involved,'' said its general
secretary, Martin Rosenfeld.
	   The widespread hope that the accord will help calm the storm
over Holocaust-era assets was shared by Madeleine Kunin, the U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland.
	   It should ``go far toward helping put the important relationship
between Switzerland and the United States on solid ground once
again,'' Kunin said in a statement.
	   Sigi Feigel, honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of
Zurich, said in a statement that he was ``happy for the victims.''
	   But Feigel, who has been critical of Jewish organizations in the
talks, said he felt ``personally ashamed and humiliated'' by
``exaggerated demands'' and accusations that led to the accord.
	   The government stressed that existing efforts to address
Switzerland's wartime past, including an independent panel of
historians studying the period, will continue.

Italian police find 85 Romanians stuffed inside truck
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VICENZA, Italy (AP) _ Italian highway police Thursday found 85
Romanians, including dozens of children and a pregnant woman,
crammed into the false bottom of a truck smuggling them into Italy.
	   The Austrian driver of the truck was detained for questioning by
police, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   The Romanians, stuffed into a 12-square-meter (133-square-foot)
space, were suffering from dehydration after the journey in
temperatures in the 30s Celsius (90s F). The truck had set out from
Prague, the Czech Republic, and was headed to Milan and Turin,
normally about a 12-hour journey.
	   The trip apparently included few rest stops. Many of the people
were covered with excrement, news reports said.
	   Nine people were taken to a hospital for checkups, news reports
said.
	   Discovery of the Romanians, including 34 children, made for one
of the more heart-wrenching scenes in the last few weeks in Italy,
which has witnessed thousands of illegal immigrants tempt fate in
rickety boats to sail the Mediterranean from northern Africa to
Italian shores in hopes of a better life.
	   A traveler aboard a bus that was traveling the highway near
Vicenza, in northeastern Italy, noticed the people sticking out of
the space and called highway police, ANSA reported.
	   A tarpaulin covering the people in the false-bottom had
partially blown off.
	   ANSA quoted highway police official Oreste Tonini as identifying
the driver as Franz Smekal, 43, of Vienna.
	   Highway police officials were not available by telephone for
more details.
	   Arrangements were being made to take the Romanians back to the
Austrian border to be handed over to Austrian authorities,
officials said.
	   Under a new law aimed at discouraging illegal arrivals, Italy
sends illegal back to the country of departure. Italy's northern
neighbors have complained that Rome was too lax on the immigrants,
many of whom head to northern Europe in search of work or family.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government and Central Bank officials tried
Thursday to parry investors' growing panic over the Russian ruble's
stability with assurances that the currency would not be devalued.
	   As the ruble continued to slide and the stock market to plunge,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko dismissed the markets' free-fall as
a ``psychological reaction'' rather than one caused by economic
developments in the country.
	   ``The only normal way to respond to the market condition, the
investors' panic, is to strictly implement the program we have
approved,'' he said. He discussed the economic situation with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, pressing the
Communist-dominated parliament to quickly pass legislation
necessary for the austerity program, and with David Lipton, a
high-ranking U.S. Treasury official.
	   The stock market fell 6.5 percent, to close at 101.17 points.
The ruble ended sharply lower amid continued fear of bank defaults
and further instability of the ruble.
	   George Soros, the billionaire investor whose moves are closely
watched on international markets, shook markets with a suggestion
in Thursday's Financial Times of London that the ruble should be
devalued by 15 to 25 percent.
	   Central Bank officials went on the offensive, issuing a flurry
of denials that devaluation was on the government's agenda _ even
though the bank's ability to hold up the ruble is being eroded by
its rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves. The bank reported
Thursday that the reserves stood at dlrs 17 billion on Aug. 7, down
from dlrs 18.4 billion a week earlier.
	   ``In our view, devaluation will not solve a single problem and
would deal a painful blow to every Russian's purse,'' said Irina
Yasina, chief spokeswoman for the Central Bank. ``It would only
exacerbate the situation and that we don't need.''
	   Unlike the market ups and downs, devaluation would reach
ordinary Russians by sparking immediate, sharp price rises, which
could in turn stoke social unrest. It would also most likely cause
some banks to go bankrupt, sweeping away businesses' ruble savings.

Rebels say they have taken Matadi airport, approaching Kinshasa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels have taken the airport at
the western river port of Matadi, are advancing on the town and
have also seized the key Inga power plant on the Congo River, a
rebel leader said Thursday.
	   ``The airport has fallen into our hands. Government troops have
dispersed. We are marching into town tonight,'' said Jean-Pierre
Ondekane.
	   He spoke shortly after returning from Sake, 20 kilometers (12
miles) west of Goma, where he gave a pep talk to 1,000 rebel troops
who were preparing to fly later Thursday to Matadi.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
the rebel commander said.
	   He also said some rebel troops had advanced as far as Kasangalu,
30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Kinshasa.
	   The Inga dam is built at falls on the Congo River 40 kilometers
(25 miles) upriver from Matadi. It supplies hydroelectric power to
southern Congo, Kinshasa and northern Zambia.
	   Kinshasa is 280 kilometers (175 miles) northeast of Matadi.
	   There was no immediate way to obtain independent confirmation of
Ondekane's claims.
	   He said government troops were looting Matadi, Congo's principal
port that lies 120 kilometers (75 miles) upriver from the Atlantic
coast.
	   Ondekane also said rebel troops had captured Bunia, 360
kilometers (223 miles) north of Goma in the northeastern Masisi
region.
	   The government of President Laurent Desire Kabila operated a
radio station from Bunia that had been urging residents to take up
whatever arms they had to kill ethnic Tutsis in the region.
	   Kabila claims that neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are helping
rebels, many of them ethnic Tutsis, who are trying to oust him.
	   Both countries were important backers of Kabila in his
eight-month drive to oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
Kabila assumed power in May 1997. Relations with his former backers
have been gradually deteriorating.

Pakistan umpire short changed?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Edits to clarify bonus scale. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Cricket Council defended its pay
scale for umpires Thursday after a British newspaper claimed Javed
Akhtar received only 158 pounds (dlrs 260) for umpiring the fifth
test between England and South Africa.
	   An ICC spokesman, however, disputed the report, saying the
Pakistani umpire had received a 662-pound (dlrs 1,088) fee plus 600
pounds (dlrs 986) for expenses _ a business-class airfare and
accommodations.
	   Akhtar's match payment comprised what would have been his
regular fee for a match in Pakistan, 12,000 rupees (dlrs 260), plus
the ICC's maximum test bonus of 500 pounds (dlrs 822).
	   The Daily Mail reported Aktar received only his regular fee for
officiating in the five-day match while his English counterpart,
Peter Willey, received 2,755 (dlrs 4,529).
	   Willey's compensation included the standard salary for a
professional English umpire adjudicating in a test, paid by local
authorities, plus a bonus for his 11th test appearance.
	   The disparity was highlighted after Akhtar made seven
controversial decisions in England's 23-run victory at Headingley
which clinched the test series 2-1 for the host.
	   Based on the 158 pounds (dlrs 260) figure, Britain's domestic
news agency said Akthar would have earned more money per day
working an eight-hour shift at McDonald's.
	   England's Umpires Association chairman Barrie Leadbeater said
English umpires earn more because they are the only full-time
officials making a living from the game.
	   The ICC released a statement saying its umpire fees or bonuses
vary from country to country, as do players' fees, determined on
inversely proportional basis to the relative standard of living in
their home country and according to differences in scale of cricket
operations and variations in currency.
	   ``Recognizing the differences in (local) fee levels, the ICC fee
is set on a scale basis, ranging from 200 pounds (dlrs 330) per
test for the highest paid umpires to 500 pounds (dlrs 882) for the
lowest paid. Pakistan umpires are at this level,'' the statement
said.

Frank Sinclair leaves Chelsea for Leicester
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Frank Sinclair, one of Jamaica's World
Cup ``Reggae Boyz,'' moved from Chelsea to Leicester City on
Thursday in a 2-million pound (dlrs 3.3 million) transfer deal.
	   The fee was a record for Leicester, which finished mid-table in
the English Premier League last season.
	   The 26-year-old defender played in Jamaica's World Cup losses to
Croatia and Argentina and its sole win over Japan.
	   He is expected to make his debut in Leicester's opening league
game against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday.
	   Sinclair came through the ranks as a trainee at Chelsea and,
after a brief stint on loan to West Bromwich, became a first team
regular with the Blues in 1992-93.
	   He had mixed success in the following seasons until 1997-98,
when he played a key role in Chelsea's European Cup Winners' Cup
and League Cup title campaigns.
	   However, he missed Chelsea's last 11 games with a groin injury.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's main Albanian leader
announced his team Thursday to negotiate the future of the province
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic but without
representatives of rebels fighting for independence.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said the Kosovo Liberation Army refused his offer
to participate, as did two leading politicians with close links to
the guerrillas.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included,'' Rugova told a news conference. He called the
situation in Kosovo ``very dangerous and risky'' and said urgent
moves were necessary to ``halt the dramatic situation in Kosovo.''
	   There was no immediate response from Milosevic, who has offered
to discuss restoring self-rule which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But Milosevic's offer of autonomy, supported by the United
States and the Europeans, falls short of the KLA's goal of complete
independence from Serbia, the largest of two republics that form
Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill and other representatives of
the so-called Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy -- were on hand for the announcement to
show their support for Rugova. He also seeks independence but has
renounced violence.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, welcomed
the announcement and said the Albanian team ``is prepared to resume
the process of negotiations'' -- broken off in May -- ``despite the
violence on the ground.''
	   Rugova and Western powers had hoped for a broad-based delegation
to represent the Albanian community, which forms 90 percent of the
province's 2 million population.
	   But the KLA declined to join, raising doubts about prospects for
success. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Rugova decided to go ahead without the others to move the
negotiating process off dead center.
	   The diplomats said they hoped that if the talks showed signs of
progress, the others might join. Rugova's main card appears to be
solid backing from the Americans.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian journalists, the
KLA said they had designed their own seven-member team to represent
them in any talks. Adem Demaci, considered the most influential
Kosovo Albanian politician after Rugova, was designated as head of
the team on condition he would give up his position in the
Parliamentary Party of Kosovo.
	   Others included KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi and Bardhyl
Mahmuti, the head of KLA's support organization in Switzerland.
	   Rugova said he invited Bajram Kosumi, a Demaci ally and one of
the more hard-line Kosovo Albanian officials, and Mehmet Hajrizi of
the Albanian Democratic Movement to join the talks but they
refused.
	   All members of the team were longtime Rugova allies. Rugova's
position among Albanians has been seriously undermined since his
non-violence approach failed to halt both the five-month Serb
crackdown on Albanian extremists or achieve goals of self-rule.
	   A diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the process of forming a team was made
more difficult because ``evidence never came that anyone ... could
control the KLA.''
	   The rebels remained firm despite recent setbacks on the
battlefield.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Serb police Wednesday
fought their way into the former rebel stronghold of Glodjane
following two days of fierce fighting in which five Serb policemen
and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported that seven rebels were killed and 49 wounded in the
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the KLA. The
village has been under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   Each side blamed the other for launching the attacks.
	   Milosevic had promised European Union envoys that his forces
would not attack Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, speaking for the
EU, condemned the fighting around Junik and urged the Yugoslav
government to avoid actions that would worsen the ``already
unbearable humanitarian situation.''

Charges dropped against Brian Clough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Financial misconduct charges against Brian Clough
were dropped by the Football Association on Thursday because the
former Nottingham Forest manager is in poor health.
	   Clough, 63, had been accused of misconduct for allegedly
accepting unauthorized payments in transfer deals.
	   But the FA said in a statement that ``it would not be in the
best interests of the game to pursue the misconduct charge against
Mr. Clough because of his poor health.
	   ``Mr. Clough has provided medical evidence which indicates that
he is unfit to attend a personal hearing. The FA considers that in
all the circumstances, Mr. Clough would not be able to present his
defense to the best of his ability and it would be in no one's
interest to continue the prosecution.''
	   Similar misconduct charges against Ronnie Fenton, the former
Forest assistant manager, and Steve Burtenshaw, the former chief
scout at Arsenal, are still due to be heard on Sept. 16.
	   Charges against Nottingham Forest Football Club will be heard by
an FA disciplinary commission on a date to be confirmed.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's main Albanian leader
announced Thursday that he has gathered a team to negotiate the
future of the separatist province with the Yugoslav government. But

	   The rebels remained firm despite recent setbacks on the
battlefield, where Serbs have been making inroads into KLAa
territory.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 240,000
people have been displaced by the fighting. Tens of thousands are
hiding in forests and hills of Kosovo, fearful of reprisals if they
return home.
	   On Wednesday, a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity, warned that significant numbers of refugees must be
returned to their homes in time to harvest crops.
	   The harvest season begins in Kosovo in about three weeks. Unless
significant numbers can return home by then, the diplomat warned of
a humanitarian disaster once winter begins in a few months.

Womens' Ashes: Action washed out on day three
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARROGATE, England (AP) _ Australia batted to an overall lead of
103 before play was washed-out in the second womens' Ashes cricket
test against England on Thursday.
	   Australia is 123 for one in its second innings after England
declared its first innings closed at 326 for eight in the morning
session.
	   The Australian side took the early initiative after declaring at
306 for three on the first day but England took a first innings
lead in reply, due mainly to a century by Jan Brittin.
	   Brittin, who also scored a century in the drawn first test, hit
a well compiled 167 before she was eventually dismissed on
Thursday.
	   Australian bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick finished with 4-91.
	   Belinda Clark and Lisa Keightley started Australia's second
innings in aggressive fashion, putting on 50 in 54 minutes.
	   Clark scored 54 off 81 deliveries before mis-hitting a full toss
directly to England fielder Barbara Daniels.

Ronaldo dismisses reports Nike pressured him to play in World Cup
</HEADLINE>
final &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Scratch the conspiracy theory,
says Ronaldo.
	   Brazil's two-time FIFA Player of the Year said in a published
interview he felt fine at the World Cup final against France and
called reports that he was ailing and pressured to play
``nonsense.''
	   His account contradicted a version from teammate Edmundo, who
said the Inter Milan forward was pressured to play by Nike, which
has large sponsorship contracts with Ronaldo and the Brazilian
confederation.
	   Ronaldo was hospitalized shortly before the final on July 12 and
was scratched from the lineup _ then inexplicably put back in.
	   He played poorly and Brazil lost 3-0. Later, Ronaldo said he had
gone into convulsions at the hotel, and Brazilians questioned why
he had played at all.
	   ``I asked to play,'' Ronaldo said in an interview Thursday with
the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil. ``I returned from the clinic
feeling fine and the tests showed nothing wrong. I'd do everything
again.''
	   Although his lifetime contract with Nike implies certain
restrictions _ for example he can't promote cigarettes or alcohol _
the company doesn't run his life, he said.
	   ``They're always after me, but they don't pressure me into doing
anything,'' Ronaldo said. ``The stories divulged about Nike's
supposed demands for me to play are nonsense.''
	   He also dismissed criticism of his selection as the World Cup's
best player.
	   Many felt the honor should go to Zinedine Zidane, the French
midfielder who scored two goals in the final.
	   ``I'd vote for myself,'' Ronaldo said. ``Zidane had a good Cup,
but he was out two games because of an expulsion. I played seven
games and scored four goals.''
	   Ronals plans to marry his girlfriend Suzana Werner and to return
to Brazil _ but neither in the foreseeable future.
	   ``I wouldn't return to Brazil right now for any offer,'' he
said. ``But when I do, it will have to be to Flamengo.''

Energy workers protest army's unpaid bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Power station employees who picketed a district
military headquarters on Thursday to protest unpaid bills got a
sympathetic hearing from military officers who said they, too,
hadn't been paid, a news agency reported.
	   Union leader Nikolai Fyodorov said that the Far Eastern military
district authorities owe the Khabarovskenergo company 800 million
rubles (dlrs 111 million). As a result, the energy workers haven't
been paid in five months, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Military officers who met the picketers outside the headquarters
building said they too, ``hadn't been receiving due wages because
of poor financing,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Nevertheless, the protesters are threatening to cut power to the
military district installations if they don't get an accounting of
the district's payment plans within 10 days, ITAR-Tass said.

Power cut in Kinshasa as fears rise of rebel advances

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fear ran rampant in Congo's capital on
Thursday as a power blackout throughout Kinshasa fed speculations
that rebel forces were advancing on the city.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen said rebel fighters had
captured the town of Inga, about 200 kilometers (135 miles) from
the capital, where the primary power transformer for Kinshasa is
located.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Where state-run radio earlier in day had been broadcasting a
steady campaign of propaganda against the rebels and their alleged
Rwandan and Uganda allies, by afternoon, only static filled the
air.
	   State radio was cut due to the lack power for its transmitter.
	   Heavy fighting was reported in Matadi, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) south of Inga, where authorities had earlier warned people
to stay indoors.
	   A spokesman in the rebel stronghold of Goma, eastern Zaire, said
his forces had captured the Matadi airport and the Inga power
plant.
	   ``The airport has fallen into our hands. Government troops have
dispersed. We are marching into town tonight,'' said Jean-Pierre
Ondekane.
	   A column of at least 12 trucks and armored personnel carriers
filled with government troops were seen Thursday racing out of
Kinshasa in the direction of Matadi.
	   As evening descended on Kinshasa, candlelight flickered from
small shops and apartment buildings along the city's main June 30th
Boulevard.
	   ``I'm starting to get really concerned,'' computer store owner
Deo Maneno said while locking up his shop. ``If it's the rebels who
have cut the power, this is really serious.''
	   When the power was cut, rumors buzzed through the city as
thousands of people filled the streets and scurried to the safety
of their homes.
	   Battles in Matadi, on the Congo river about 250 kilometers (160
miles) southwest of Kinshasa, were reported by Congolese news
organizations shortly before the power outage.
	   The port had been targeted by the rebels for at least several
days due to its strategic location as a supply route to Kinshasa.
	   Congo accuses soldiers from neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of
fighting alongside Tutsi rebels who erupted in rebellion against
President Laurent Kabila's government earlier this month.
	   On Thursday, Congo and Rwanda traded claims of ethnic attacks
against Hutu and Tutsi civilians.
	   The Rwandan government called on international agencies to
intervene and save ethnic Tutsis it said were being persecuted by
Congolese authorities, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   In Kinshasa, the human rights minister said Rwandan troops were
attacking ethnic Hutus living in eastern Congo.
	   ``There is indescribable suffering and torture, deportations and
deprivation of liberty as a result of this oligarchic political and
military adventure by Rwanda,'' said the minister, Leonard She
O'Kitundu.
	   Both Rwanda and Congo have asked the International Red Cross and
the United Nations to monitor the human rights situation and help
ward off ethnically-motivated attacks by the warring sides.
	   Relations between Congo and its two neighbors, which helped
remove longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power and install
Kabila, had been deteriorating before the rebellion erupted. Uganda
and Rwanda complained Kabila had failed to stop cross-border
attacks on their territory.
	   The rebels say they are fed up with Kabila's rule, which they
allege has been tainted by mismanagement, corruption and nepotism.
	   Tutsis, with their distinctive angular features, have gone into
hiding in Kinshasa.
	   Calls on state radio to massacre the enemy have only fueled a
growing sense of rage against all Tutsis _ Rwandan, Congolese or
otherwise.
	   A government-controlled radio broadcast in eastern Congo's town
of Bunia called on people to kill all Tutsis.
	   ``People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades,
rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones and
the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis,''
the radio said.
	   ``Wherever you see a Rwandan Tutsi, regard him as your enemy. We
shall do everything possible to free ourselves from the grip of the
Tutsis,'' the radio said.
	   Kabila's government denies it is persecuting Tutsis, but
authorities in the capital acknowledge a number of civilians have
been arrested on suspicion of complicity with the rebels.
	   In Kampala, Uganda, three African foreign ministers met with
President Yoweri Museveni to discuss the rebellion, his spokeswoman
said Thursday.
	   The group, which is investigating Congolese claims of Rwandan
and Ugandan participation in the rebellion, is scheduled to leave
later Thursday for Rwanda, where they would meet up with Tanzanian
Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, she said.

	   LIMONE, Italy (AP) _ Two British tourists were found dead and a
third was missing Thursday after their motor boat capsized on Lake

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ After sorting through tons of wreckage
from the deadliest attack on a U.S. Embassy, investigators said
Thursday they have found fragments of a vehicle that carried the
bomb and interrogated five suspects.
	   FBI agents ``have been successful, we think, in identifying
certain parts of the delivery vehicle'' containing the bomb that
exploded in Nairobi on Aug. 7, said Sheila Horan, FBI special agent
in charge of the investigation.
	   ``We are progressing well,'' she said at the first FBI news
conference since the bombings.
	   Nearly simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 257 people and injured more
than 5,500. Among those killed were 12 Americans, all in Nairobi.
	   Tears streaming down his face, U.S. President Bill Clinton
watched the flag-draped caskets of 10 of the Americans arrive home
Thursday.
	   An Air Force plane flew the bodies home via Germany, landing at
Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington, as Clinton and his
wife Hillary met privately with families of those killed and
wounded in the bombings.
	   In Kenya, Deputy Police Commissioner Peter Mbuvi of the Criminal
Investigation Department said ``about five'' suspects were held in
connection with the Nairobi bombing ``because of suspicious
activities,'' including one spotted by an American at the embassy
after the bombing.
	   ``We are talking to them, we are questioning them, we are
interrogating them,'' he said, adding they have been taken into
custody ``gradually since Friday.''
	   ``We have not yet decided whether we should charge them or not
because the investigations are still at the initial stage,'' Mbuvi
said.
	   In Washington, a U.S. law enforcement source said two of those
detained in Kenya were considered suspects.
	   The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, which represents all the
nation's Muslim organizations, said police detained at least six
Muslims in connection with the blast and four remain in custody.
	   Amjad Javed was arrested five minutes after the blast when he
rushed to the embassy to see whether his friend, Farhat Sheikh, was
all right, said deputy secretary-general Ibrahim Lethome. Sheikh
was among the 34 Kenyan embassy employees who died, he said.
	   Mbuvi and Horan refused to comment on the identities of those
detained.
	   Police in Tanzania arrested 14 people in the bombing there. News
reports said two, a Turkish citizen and a Somali-born Australian,
were subsequently released. Police did not comment.
	   A passenger presumed to be in a truck that investigators think
carried the bomb to the U.S. Embassy is still unaccounted for,
acting U.S. Ambassador John Lange said Thursday.
	   The truck driver was killed. But his assistant, Saidi Rogati,
has been missing since the Aug. 7 blast.
	   All bodies from the Dar es Salaam blast have been identified,
and Rogati's is not among them, Lange said. If he was in the water
tanker at the time, the explosion may have blown his body to bits,
Lange said.
	   Horan said ``there is a temptation to immediately link the two
bombings'' in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam because the blasts
coincided, but she was not prepared to give further information.
Investigators in both countries are working closely, she said.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the bombings, including one from a previously unknown Islamic
group.
	   Horan was asked if intelligence agencies had recently received
any particularly credible threats against U.S. targets.
	   ``I would very much like to answer the question, but I am not
going to. I cannot at this time respond to that. I'm sorry,'' she
replied.
	   More than 20 U.S.-Kenyan investigating teams have embarked on
the painstaking process of analyzing fragments from the wreckage
and interviewing ``a massive'' number of people in connection with
the bombing, Horan said.
	   ``We are literally sifting through tremendous piles of debris in
an effort to come up with the piece of evidence which we can use to
complete this investigation,'' she said.
	   A day after the official mourning period ended where 247 were
killed, Kenyans still streamed to the devastated site, staring in
shocked silence broken only by the tinkling of glass from cleanup
work on bombed-out buildings and the hum of generators from FBI
tents set up to study evidence of the crime.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who was lightly injured in
the attack, toured the site with FBI agents, gesturing at the
embassy. Marines kept guard from behind memorial flowers placed on
the mission's front steps.
	   Kenyan soldiers held a solemn farewell ceremony after six days
of guard and rescue work, then posed for photos beside the small
pyramid of bouquet-laden rocks serving as a makeshift memorial to
the victims.
	   ``It's unbelievable,'' said 26-year-old Eva Athiambo, who wanted
to see the bomb site firsthand. ``In Kenya, those kinds of things
never happen.''

Myanmar rejects UN chief's proposal for an envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Myanmar has rejected the U.N. chief's
request that a special envoy be allowed to look into the human
rights situation in the country, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   In a letter to the government last week, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, the former president of
the General Assembly, be allowed to visit Myanmar at the end of the
week.
	   ``The response from the prime minister was polite but stated
that there was no reason for such a rushed visit and that the
dialogue that the secretary-general and the government of Myanmar
had maintained since 1994 could continue when the foreign minister
of Myanmar is in New York next month for the General Assembly's
general debate,'' said U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt.
	   ``The secretary-general is disappointed by the response,'' he
said.
	   The United States, among others, had sought Annan's intervention
in the crisis to try to rally world opinion against the military
regime and its treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition party
leader and winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Myanmar's military government blocked a fresh attempt by Suu Kyi
on Wednesday to travel outside the capital to meet with members of
her political party, claiming the journey was ``unsafe.''

Iraq turns over video of meeting; Butler's office complains about
</HEADLINE>
broadcast &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq turned over to the United Nations on
Thursday two videotapes of the failed meetings between the chief
U.N. weapons inspector and Iraq's deputy prime minister which led
to Iraq freezing cooperation with inspectors.
	   The videotapes, however, were immediately checked out of the
U.N. library by the secretary-general's office. U.N. spokesman Juan
Carlos Brandt denied the office was hoarding them and said they
would be returned once all the relevant officials had viewed them.
	   Iraq's deputy ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said in a letter to the
Security Council that Baghdad was allowing the United Nations and
council members to view the tapes to inform the international
community of ``misrepresentations'' by chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler of what occurred during the meetings.
	   Iraq ceased cooperation with inspectors after Butler said
following the Aug. 3 meetings that he could not certify that Iraq
had met the requirements to end eight years of debilitating
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clips of the Aug. 3 meetings show, among other things, Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz refusing to turn over a document
to Butler and Butler getting up to leave the meeting.
	   Butler has complained that the private meetings were broadcast
almost in their entirety on Iraqi television _ complaints which
were rejected Thursday by Iraq.
	   A statement from the Iraqi mission claimed that Butler had
``told reporters throughout the world, in a distorted way, the
contents of what are supposed to be `private official
consultations.'''
	   ``Iraq did not give its version of the discussions in the
meeting but simply showed the international public exactly what
happened at those meetings,'' the statement said.
	   Butler's spokesman, Ewen Buchanan, said Iraq's broadcast of the
meetings ``seems to breach basic diplomatic protocol.''
	   Butler had been told that the videotapes were intended to
maintain an accurate record of the discussions for both sides.

Report: French inquiry on Guinea-Bissau conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A report commissioned by French
President Jacques Chirac concluded that Guinea-Bissau's elected
government is linked to arms and drug trafficking and selling
passports to international criminals, news reports said Thursday.
	   The report's conclusions mirror accusations made by a rebel
military faction in the tiny West African country, the Portuguese
daily Diario de Noticias said.
	   The French presidential office denied the existence of the
report cited by the newspaper. Diario de Noticias did not reveal
its sources.
	   According to Diario de Noticias, the report was presented to the
French Foreign Ministry last week. The daily said the document was
intended to help the French government decide whether to expel
Guinea-Bissau from the Franc Zone.
	   The Franc Zone is an economic accord between France, Monaco and
15 African states that are mostly former French colonies.
	   Guinea-Bissau _ a former Portuguese colony _ was plunged into
conflict on June 7 following an attempted coup led by Brig.
Ansumane Mane.
	   Mane, who had been dismissed as military chief for allegedly
running arms to Senegal's Casamance separatists, accused President
Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and gun running.
	   In the fighting that followed, Vieira was backed by troops from
Senegal which is also in the Franc Zone. The rebels accused France
of supporting Senegal and Vieira.
	   But according to Diario de Noticias, the French report considers
that one acceptable solution to Guinea-Bissau's two-month-old
conflict would be for Vieira to step down.
	   Vieira first came to power via a military coup in 1980 before
gaining democratic legitimacy by winning elections in 1994.
	   No numbers were available on how many have been killed since the
fighting began in the tiny country of 1 million people, wedged
between Senegal and the Republic of Guinea on Africa's western tip.
	   A cease-fire in place since July 26 has calmed the situation,
although there have been reports of minor violations.
	   The two sides promised to abide by their truce at a second round
of talks last Saturday. A third round due next week was postponed
amid a debate over who should mediate the talks.

Burton, King lead as Pak struggles in the wind

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Brandie Burton and Betsy King
showed Se Ri Pak the way to play links golf at the Women's British
Open Thursday, carding 1-under 71s to share the lead while the
Korean phenomenon struggled to a 78.
	   Pak, winner of four tournaments including two majors in her
rookie season, bogeyed six holes and failed to make a single
birdie.
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic at Windsor, Ontario two
weeks ago, had four birdies in her round and King had three in
windy and wet conditions at the Royal Lytham course used regularly
for the men's Open.
	   Burton's 71 was spoiled by a double bogey 6 at the 398-yard
17th.
	   She drove into a fairway bunker, played her third shot into deep
rough under a tree and then hit a greenside bunker on the way to a
six. She then birdied the last for the first under-par round of the
day.
	   ``I'm very excited about getting in the red today,'' said the
American, who also birdied the fifth, eighth and 10th. ``Club
selection here was very trying and wore you down mentally.''
	   King, on her 43rd birthday, matched Burton's outward score of 34
with birdies at the second and seventh and collected another at 14.
She was headed for the lead until she bogeyed the 17th.
	   ``It was right into the wind,'' she said. ``And into the wind
the long holes are virtually unreachable. I was 50 yards short of
the green in two, got to within 25 feet and two-putted.''
	   Annika Sorenstam was on course to lead the field of 138 and was
two under with six to go. But her round fell apart with a double
bogey at 15 and the Swede also finished bogey-bogey.
	   Britain's Trish Johnson was the nearest challenger to the two
Americans on level par. With the weather conditions worsening, the
best score of the 30 players left on the course was 4 over.
	   Pak, strongly tipped to become one of the greats of women's
golf, almost made birdie at the tough 17th. Her second shot from
180 yards stayed on the right side of the green and her 35-foot
putt was barely an inch short.
	   The Korean's problems started at the first, when her 5-iron from
the tee overshot the green, she chipped short and missed a 6-foot
putt for bogey 4.
	   She three-putted from 15 feet at the sixth, missed another
6-footer at 12 and then bogeyed 14, 15 and 16.
	   After chipping out of a fairway bunker at 14, she three-putted
from 30 feet, drove her tee shot into the thick rough and was
forced to lay up at 15.
	   At the 16th, Pak dropped her second shot into a bunker just
short of the green, pitched out still short and had to play a
pitching wedge to make the green.
	   ``The wind is really, really strong,'' said Pak, who also saved
par at the last by rolling in a 20-foot putt. ``But it is the same
for all players and I have got to learn and keep working.''
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, who is aiming to win
for the third time in four years, carded a 76, mixing three birdies
with seven bogeys and Liselotte Neumann, titlist here four years
ago, had two double bogeys and three bogeys in a birdie-less 79.
	   Laura Davies, bidding for her first British Open triumph since
1986, went bogey-bogey-double bogey in the middle of her round and
wound up with a 7-over 79 while Emilee Klein, who won the
tournament two years ago, had a disastrous 82. She had double
bogeys at eight and nine, and two more at 13 and 17.

Germans seeking czarist Amber Room to start digging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ German treasurer-hunters on Friday
plan to begin digging at a site they believe could hold Czar Peter
the Great's Amber Room panels, stolen by the Nazis in World War II,
the Baltic News Service reported.
	   The expedition, funded by the German TV company NDR, this month
detected a large amount of metal buried in a shallow lagoon near
Preila, on Lithuania's coast. They were searching the area because
a wartime resident had said he saw German soldiers burying
mysterious boxes there.
	   Nazi troops took the 50 square meters (500 square feet) of
intricately carved amber during the siege of Leningrad, now St.
Petersburg. Germany has contended that the panels were destroyed
during the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the Russian
enclave of Kaliningrad.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.
	   The treasure-seekers will be aided by a Lithuanian mine-sweeping
squad, which will make sure the unknown objects are not explosives.

Medley of east and west German national anthems stirs criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Germany has been unified since 1990, but
put the national anthems from east and west together and a storm of
criticism results.
	   The state of Lower Saxony in western Germany commissioned a
Berlin composer, Bardo Hennig, to create the medley and plans to
have it performed at a state occasion on Oct. 3 _ German unity day.
	   The general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats, Peter Hintze, on Thursday called the idea scandalous.
	   ``Our anthem as a national symbol of unity in freedom should not
be messed around with,'' he said. ``More tact should be expected
from a state government.''
	   Kohl's spokesman, Otto Hauser, called it tasteless beyond
compare.
	   But Michael Knaps, a spokesman for the state Interior Ministry
said the criticism is ungrounded.
	   ``It really works,'' he said of the medley. ``We're sticking to
our plan.''
	   Germany's national anthem _ unaltered _ will be played at the
end of the ceremony, he added.

A first in Paraguay: changing presidents from one civilian to
</HEADLINE>
another &QL; 
 &UR; By PEDRO SERVIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A 54-year-old engineer, poised to
become the first civilian to succeed another as Paraguay's
president, vowed in published comments Thursday to attack
corruption as a hallmark of office.
	   Raul Cubas Grau is scheduled Saturday to succeed Juan Carlos
Wasmosy for a five-year term, marking a historic transition between
elected civilians since the end of Paraguay's 34-year military
dictatorship in 1989.
	   The changing of the guard by two members of Paraguay's
long-governing Colorado Party, comes amid a protracted economic
crisis in this South American nation of 5.6 million. Officially
unemployment has hovered around 15 percent, but is widely
considered much higher.
	   ``The priority of my government will be a frontal assault
against corruption,'' Cubas said in comments widely published
Thursday. He easily won a May 10 election.
	   Aides to Cubas said Paraguay has lost an estimated 2 billion
dollars in recent years because of bribery and other public sector
corruption.
	   ``I am going to audit all state enterprises,'' Cubas said before
laying out his initiatives in his first address to the nation next
Monday.
	   Gerardo Doll, Cubas' incoming ecomonics minister, said Cubas has
said he would put his Cabinet on a ``war footing'' against the
economic crisis, including cost-cutting in the public sector.
	   Cubas also must address infighting within his own party, where
acrimony is so strong that even the inaugural ceremony is scripted
so that Wasmosy will not place the presidential sash directly on
Cubas' shoulders. The head of Congress instead will carry it
between the two.
	   Originally the vice presidential nominee, Cubas assumed the
ruling party's presidential candidacy of former army Gen. Lino
Oviedo, the winner of a September 1997 Colorado primary.
	   But Oviedo was imprisoned in mid-campaign, handed a 10-year
sentence by a military court on charges he rebelled against
Wasmosy's order to resign as commander of the army in 1996. That
standoff lasted more than a day and raised concerns about
Paraguay's still fledgling democracy.
	   Shortly before the May election, Paraguay's Supreme Court upheld
the sentence. Oviedo remains under guard at an infantry base in
this capital.
	   Cubas went on to handily defeat one of Paraguay's top opposition
figures, Domingo Laino of the Democratic Alliance, a two-party
opposition coalition that united for the election.
	   Opponents claim Cubas is overwhelmingly loyal to Oviedo.
	   Luis Alberto Mauro, an opposition congressman, said many are
worried Oviedo will exert undue influence.
	   Asked whether he thought Cubas would be his own man, Mauro
replied, ``my guess is like what the weatherman says: uncertain
forecast.''
	   Critics say seven of Cubas' 10 Cabinet ministers are loyal to
Oviedo, including those named to defense, interior, justice.
	   Cubas also has not been bashful about invoking the name of the
hugely popular Oviedo and visited him frequently in prison. The
night of his election, Cubas thanked Oviedo for his short-lived
campaign. Oviedo's barnstorming of the countryside was widely
credited with helping to bring poor peasants out to vote for the
Colorado ticket.
	   Paraguay is a poor, landlocked nation where millions of Indians
toil in rural farming and cattle raising. It also is a country
tarnished by an image as a place of contraband trading in pirated
goods.
	   A Roman Catholic bishop, Claudio Gimenez, complained that
politicians have neglected the ``most urgent social needs of the
poor peasant and working classes'' amid their feuding over the
years.
	   ``The Church hopes the next leader will address the needs of the
people,'' he said.

Four Poles convicted in major cigarette-smuggling case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Four Poles were given sentences from
18 to 24 months of prison in connection to one of the biggest
cigarette-smuggling cases in Denmark, officials said Friday.
	   The four men were convicted of taking part in smuggling 13
million cigarettes from Poland to a storehouse in Danish city of
Kalundborg.
	   Cigarette-smuggling has become a major concern for Danish
authorities. Cigarettes cost about dlrs 5 a pack in Denmark, making
lower-priced smuggled smokes highly attractive.
	   In 1997, Danish police seized a total of 18 million cigarettes,
and in early 1998 police broke up a ring that had smuggled in some
50 million cigarettes.

Eight defense chiefs meet to discuss Congo, Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MILDRED MULENGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Defense chiefs from eight southern African
countries discussed renewed conflict Thursday in nearby Congo and
Angola as part of their routine regional security meeting.
	   ``Peace appears to be eluding the sub region,'' Zambia's army
commander Solomon Mumbi, who headed the security committee of the
Southern African Development Community, said at the two-day meeting
that opened Wednesday.
	   ``This region is faced, once more, with a serious security
situation which threatens peace and stability in the whole
subcontinent,'' Zambia's Defence Minister, Chitalu Sampa, told the
group.
	   The meeting included army commanders and senior defense
officials from South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia.
	   Recent fighting between government and rebel forces in Angola
has sent refugees into Namibia and Zambia and claimed hundreds of
lives. South African officials recently said they would offer
peacekeeping troops for Angola if sanctioned by the United Nations
and SADC.
	   In Congo, President Laurent Kabila is trying to stave off an
insurrection from the eastern part of the country that he claims is
supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The Congo situation in particular ``has the potential to engulf
the Great Lakes and SADC regions,'' Sampa said.
	   Other items on the group's agenda included discussion of the
establishment of an African Center for Security Studies, a program
initiated with United States backing to provide defense education
and conduct research on security issues; the installation of
hotline defense telecommunications network among member-states;
prevention of government coups; and establishment of
inter-departmental liaison mechanisms to combat cross border crime.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fear ran rampant in Congo's capital on
Thursday as a power blackout throughout Kinshasa fed speculations
that rebel forces were advancing on the city.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen said rebel fighters had
captured the town of Inga, about 200 kilometers (135 miles) from
the capital, where the primary power transformer for Kinshasa is
located.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Where state-run radio earlier in day had been broadcasting a
steady campaign of propaganda against the rebels and their alleged
Rwandan and Uganda allies, by afternoon, only static filled the
air.
	   State radio was cut due to the lack power for its transmitter.
	   Heavy fighting was reported in Matadi, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) south of Inga, where authorities had earlier warned people
to stay indoors.
	   A commander in the rebel stronghold of Goma, eastern Congo, said
his forces had captured the Matadi airport and the Inga power
plant.
	   ``The airport has fallen into our hands. Government troops have
dispersed. We are marching into town tonight,'' said Jean-Pierre
Ondekane.
	   A column of at least 12 trucks and armored personnel carriers
filled with government troops were seen Thursday racing out of
Kinshasa in the direction of Matadi.
	   As evening descended on Kinshasa, candlelight flickered from
small shops and apartment buildings along the city's main June 30th
Boulevard.
	   ``I'm starting to get really concerned,'' computer store owner
Deo Maneno said while locking up his shop. ``If it's the rebels who
have cut the power, this is really serious.''
	   When the power was cut, rumors buzzed through the city as
thousands of people filled the streets and scurried to the safety
of their homes.
	   Battles in Matadi, on the Congo river about 250 kilometers (160
miles) southwest of Kinshasa, were reported by Congolese news
organizations shortly before the power outage.
	   The port had been targeted by the rebels for at least several
days due to its strategic location as a supply route to Kinshasa.
	   Rebels said their next target is the capital.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
Ondekane said.

 &UR; UCI announces measures to crack down on doping &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with UCI statement, moves dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ World cycling's governing body said
Thursday it will impose a ``medical follow-up'' for riders and a
new drug-detection system as part of a raft of new measures to
crack down on doping.
	   Teams will have their own dedicated doctors to ensure rules are
obeyed, and the International Cycling Union's medical commission
will review its list of banned substances, a statement from the
Lausanne-based organization said.
	   Earlier Thursday, the head of UCI said his organization will
establish the ``medical follow-up,'' to take effect from January
next year, since testing during races can't always detect forbidden
drugs. The statement said the move was supported by all parties
including riders.
	   ``We're not even going to increase the number of checks'' during
races, ``because the problem is with non-detectable products,'' UCI
President Hein Verbruggen told Europe 1 radio earlier Thursday from
Lausanne, where the federation is based.
	   But, he said, ``let's at least guarantee the health of the
riders.''
	   UCI said in the statement it would establish a new system to
detect the performance-enhancing hormone EPO, which would be
operated in collaboration with laboratories in Cologne, Germany and
Lausanne.
	   A group of six doctors has been created to study and discuss
``practical problems'' which surfaced during the Tour de France.
	   UCI said in its statement that the number of racing days for
riders was a problem, rather than an over-busy calendar. To solve
that, the idea of limiting the number of days to between 90 and 120
has been kept in mind and a ``definitive number'' will be
determined this year, the statement said.
	   The statement said a ``certain unhappiness'' among riders in the
Tour de France over the methods used by police during their
investigations was to a certain extent ``comprehensible.''
	   But the statement said: ``On the other hand, one must be
conscious of the fact that the primary responsibility lies with
those who have broken the laws.''
	   The statement said UCI has called on the national federations
concerned to establish disciplinary procedures against all those
implicated in the Tour de France doping scandal.
	   The Swiss national federation said Wednesday it had opened
proceedings which may result in sanctions against three Swiss
members of the Festina team. The team was expelled from the Tour.

 &UR; Israel vows to press on against others who hold Holocaust victim
assets
 &UR; Eds: AMs RECAST. UPDATES and leads throughout with fresh comment
from officials, survivors; CHANGES Byline
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Holocaust survivors like 82-year-old Dov
Haber, whose uncle had a prewar account at a Swiss bank, greeted
with joy the news of a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement between the
banks and Jewish survivors or their heirs.
	   ``This is my uncle's money, not theirs, and they have to give it
back,'' he said.
	   Israeli leaders who began the fight against Swiss banks holding
dormant accounts of Nazi victims also hailed the deal _ and vowed
to keep going after other countries and companies that have held
back assets of Holocaust survivors.
	   ``This is the beginning,'' said Bobby Brown, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser on world Jewish affairs.
	   ``What has happened now with the Swiss puts on notice every
country and company that looted Jewish assets. The time has come to
look back and have the courage to admit wrong and to try to find
justice where none existed before,'' Brown said.
	   It was a small article appearing in the Israeli financial daily
Globes in 1995 that first caught the attention of the Israeli
government and Jewish leaders. The paper said an unknown amount of
funds deposited in Swiss banks by Jews killed in the Holocaust were
being hidden by the banks.
	   The late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered an
investigation into the report, opening the floodgates to a deluge
of information on seized property, looted gold and unpaid insurance
policies.
	   With Thursday's out-of-court settlement in New York complete
pending a judge's approval, officials can now turn their attention
to other areas.
	   Suits are currently pending in the United States against 16
European insurance companies and two German banks. In addition, the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group which acts as a liaison
between Israel and world Jewry, is looking into reports that
countries such as Portugal allegedly helped the Nazis move gold
taken from Jews to South America.
	   And then there is the property. Israel has been actively
seeking, with some success, the return of Jewish-owned property
across Eastern Europe. Last week, Romania's premier agreed to back
legislation in his country to return seized property and assets.
	   The battle against the Swiss banks was a lengthy one. Two years
of pressure and the threat of U.S. sanctions led the Swiss banks to
release the names of thousands of World War II-era accounts
holders, and offices were set up around the world to handle claims.
	   Last July, Dov Haber walked into the Tel Aviv claims office
clutching a brown leather satchel of documents proving he is the
nephew of Hermann Roth of Vienna, whose name appeared on the list.
Haber, whose entire family was wiped out by the Nazis, is now
hoping that someone from the claims office will contact him.
	   ``Every (Swiss) franc that we can get back in his name is very
good,'' he said, but added, ``It's been so many years, and I
understand that it will take more for them to give out the money.''
	   Thursday's agreement calls for the money to be paid out over
four years.
	   In return, the plaintiffs will release all claims against two
commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ plus the Swiss
National Bank, other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss
industry.
	   There are more than 300,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel, and
thousands have claimed their unpaid assets. Several Holocaust
survivors, while quick to express satisfaction that a deal had been
made, added that they hoped that the neediest survivors would most
swiftly benefit from the settlement.
	   ``The survivors are an aging population in terms of health and
welfare... these monies first and foremost must go to these people,
for psychological help, old age homes and home care,'' said
Jonathan Lemberger, head of AMCHA, a support organization for
Holocaust survivors.
	   Brown said reparations would be divided between claimants and
needy Holocaust survivors, and some of the money will go to
educational projects having to do with Holocaust studies.
	   In Geneva, the Swiss National Bank, responsible for maintaining
the strength of Switzerland's currency, welcomed the settlement
between the two major Swiss banks and its Jewish plaintiffs as
``positive,'' but did not say whether the SNB would contribute to
the payout.
	   Several private companies, including Sulzer, said they would
contribute, however, and Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and
Novartis said they welcomed a dialogue with the banks over the
settlement.

KLA issues statement on Kosovo political situation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army claimed
Thursday that it had made a ``tactical withdrawal'' in the face of
a Serbian offensive and that Belgrade's plan to destroy the rebel
movement had failed.
	   The declaration was made in a statement issued as Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a team to negotiate the
future of the province with the Serbian government.
	   The rebels refused to join despite serious recent setbacks on
the battlefield.
	   ``Our tactical withdrawal aimed at defending the civil
population has been succesful. We have taken back different
fighting positions,'' the statement said.
	   The rebels said that ``new conditions'' now require creation of
Kosovo institutions ``in which the large political spectre of
Kosovo will be represented with dignity.''
	   ``Aiming to halt the manipulations linked with the consitution
of these institutions, the KLA announces that Jakup Krasniqi,
Xhavit Haliti, Bardhyl Mahmuti, Hashim Thaqi, Faton Mehmetaj and
Sokol Bashota are the political representatives of the KLA.'' the
statement said.
	   In what appeared to be a warning to Rugova, the rebels said they
were making ``a final appeal: stop the actions to create disunity,
otherwise our strike will be ruthless.''
	   It also asked Kosovo Albanian politician Adem Demaci ``to take
the leading role'' in dealings with Serbia.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Aziz rejecting Butler's claims as ``inaccurate,''
Aziz-Prakash meeting underway. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Rejecting claims by chief U.N. weapons
inspector and the IAEA as inaccurate, Iraq's deputy prime minister
said Thursday that arms monitors had been given full access to 496
weapons sites.
	   Tariq Aziz said inspectors from the United Nations Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency were able to
visit these sites ``with no interference by the Iraqi side.''
	   His comments were made in a letter sent Thursday to Danilo Turk,
president of the U.N. Security Council. It was in response to a
letter sent to the Security Council by Richard Butler, the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, who had complained that Iraqi restrictions
on arms inspectors were making it impossible to ensure that Iraq
was not reviving its weapons programs.
	   Butler's letter followed a similar one from Mohammed el-Baradei,
head of the IAEA, which is responsible for overseeing the
destruction of Iraq's nuclear weapons capability.
	   Since the resumption of the inspections last November, both U.N.
and IAEA monitors ``are fully exercising monitoring activities
which cover 496 sites,'' Aziz said in the letter which was carried
by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``This indicates that what the IAEA and UNSCOM have described in
their letters of August 12, 1998, to the effect that their current
monitoring activities are limited is inaccurate, since the
activities which the IAEA and UNSCOM can perform, in the light of
Iraq's decision of August 5, 1995, cover more than 94 percent of
the routine IAEA and UNSCOM activities,'' Aziz said.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that Iraq
would no longer cooperate with the UNSCOM, which is charged with
ensuring that Iraq eliminates its biological and chemical weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   In his letter, Aziz broke down the sites into: 162 in the
nuclear area; 175 in the biological area, including 80 hospitals;
119 in the chemical area and 40 in the missiles area. In addition,
he said, import/export monitoring groups regularly visited 70
sites, including border and customs points.
	   The inspection of what he called ``under-monitoring sites'' was
``intensely strict and highly extensive, based on all the extremist
assumptions that these sites could be used for alleged proscribed
activities,'' Aziz said in the letter.
	   He said the inspectors made a total of 5,522 visits to the sites
since 1994, in addition to 1,416 air surveillance missions. Also,
301 visits were made to ``off-monitoring sites,'' during the same
period, Aziz said.
	   Between Aug. 6 and Aug. 12, monitoring groups made 49 visits _
in addition to gamma-ray surveys of 11 vast areas by the nuclear
team, Aziz said.
	   The Iraqi News Agency released the text of Aziz's letter to Turk
as the deputy prime minister began a meeting with Prakash Shah, the
envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq, who arrived in
Baghdad earlier Thursday for talks aimed at defusing the latest
crisis over weaponry.
	   Shah told reporters shortly after arriving in Iraq that he had
brought a message from Annan.
	   He said he would give Aziz ``the message to the Iraqi
leadership.''
	   He did not disclose the contents. But U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters earlier this week that Annan would ask
Saddam to reverse Iraq's decision not to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Annan in February brokered an agreement with Saddam that ended a
crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into
presidential compounds. Eight of Saddam's palaces were inspected
after the Feb. 23 deal.
	   Saddam announced Iraq was suspending cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors after Butler said during a visit to Baghdad last week
that he could not certify that Iraq had complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the destruction of its weapons.
	   Iraq banned new site inspections but said long-term monitoring
activities _ most conducted by surveillance cameras and air-testing
equipment _ could continue.
	   Meanwhile, Iraq said Thursday that it had turned over to the
United Nations two videotapes of Butler's Aug. 3 meeting with Aziz
which had been broadcast earlier this week on Iraqi television.
	   Clips of the video show, among other things, Aziz refusing to
turn over a document to Butler and Butler getting up to leave the
meeting.
	   Saeed Hasan, Iraq's deputy ambassador at the United Nations,
said in a letter to the Security Council that Baghdad was allowing
the United Nations and council members to view the tapes to inform
the international community of Butler's ``misrepresentations'' of
what occurred during the meetings.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   De Volkskrant, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Congo:
	   ``History is repeating itself in Congo. Just like his
predecessor Mobutu Sese Seko, President Laurent Kabila is
confronted with a Tutsi rebellion which started in the east and has
widened quickly. And just like Mobutu, Kabila has been accused of
nepotism and corruption by rebels.
	   The revolt against Kabila came not unexpectedly. The strongman
in whom the United States, South Africa and the regional leaders
have put their hope has turned out to be a dictator. The promised
democratic reforms have failed to take place. Dissidents and
critical journalists are arrested and human rights organizations
forbidden.
	    &UR; ___
	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on terrorism:
	   Terrorism has returned to show a more ugly face. The attacks on
the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania show the impunity and
randomness of this kind of violence.
	   Investigators are still not sure who is responsible for the
attack, but it appears Islamic fundamentalist groups might be. The
reason these groups are suspected is the United States is
considered an ally of Israel and an enemy of the Islamic cause in
general, particularly regimes like Iraq's.
	   In addition, no groups capable of putting together an operation
like this have been detected in African countries.
	   The fact that the terrorists had chosen American embassies in
countries outside of actual zones of international conflict is part
of a tendency to spread out the location of these attacks. This
obligates us to multiply the preventive work needed against this
kind of aggression.
	   Terrorism to achieve political ends is reprehensible under any
circumstance.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on the bombings in Africa:
	   Three days after the horrendous bombings of the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the most important sound is the
softest: the hope against hope that more survivors may yet be found
in the rubble. The loudest sound inevitably is the demand of
``Whodunnit?'' and ``How can they be punished?'' _ the game of spot
the terrorist and name the organization, and even the state, behind
him. But it is the small voice that should be heard _ the cry of
the survivor and the still voice of the victim. These outrages are
outrages precisely because of what they do to the innocent: the
passerby, the typist working in the embassy, the cleaner in the
building next door. ...

	   Tages-Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on bombings in Africa:
	   ... The bombs in Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salaam (which, in a bitter
irony, means `place of peace' in Arabic) show a disregard for human
life, but not for logic.
	   Terrorist acts, as their perpetrators intend, always have
propaganda intentions.
	   The message of these bombs is: Look, the Americans are
vulnerable! ...
	   In the same way the Israelis were shocked by Hamas suicide
bombings, it's not the first time the Americans have had to
recognize that their one-sided Middle East policy has made them
bitter enemies in the Arab world.
	   Enemies whose hate has become so great that they are prepared to
sacrifice themselves and an unlimited number of bystanders, if only
to attack one American or Israeli. ...
	   As long as conditions in the Arab nations and U.S. policy in the
region remain unchanged, there will be attacks. Even if all
embassies become fortresses.
	    &UR; ___
	   Expressen, Stockholm, on pop culture and politics:
	   The Rolling Stones play today at Singers' Field in Tallinn,
Estonia. It is the same grassy expanse, right by the Baltic Sea,
where Estonians carefully began to overturn the Soviet Union. Up to
100,000 people gathered in the evenings and sang in their own
language. The choir practice was an important element in what one
could call The Singing Revolution. ... That the Stones are playing
in Tallinn is a significant confirmation that the country now
belongs in the same popular culture circle as the rest of Europe.
...
	   Western individualism has its bad sides, but it is the best
guarantee against the massive madness of the collective project.
When the `I' is more important than the `we,' it will be difficult
for those who hold power to demand sacrifices for something sick.
That is why it is so important that individual freedom be
constantly revitalized.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on the bombings in
Africa:
	   There are two senses in which acts of terrorism such as the bomb
blasts that ripped through the United States' embassy complexes in
Kenya and Tanzania on Friday are senselessly indiscriminate. For
one thing, although the targets of Friday's attacks were obviously
American the vast majority of the victims were not. Instead, they
were local African office workers, shoppers, commuters and
passers-by ... innocence, however, has never been a defense against
terrorism. Why? Because the more blood and mayhem an act of
terrorism can generate, the louder the message of the terrorist can
be driven home. ...
	   Their real strategy is not so much to drive Americans ``out'' as
to immerse them more deeply in the murky waters of regional
politics. If it could be proved, for instance, that Arab terrorists
were behind the Kenyan and Tanzanian bombings, the U.S. might be
tempted to come down hard on certain Arab groups or governments.
The instruments with which to do so tend to be blunt. The hope of
those behind the original act of violence is that the effect would
be to heighten anti-American feeling in the Middle East and drive
more people to their cause. ...

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Jordan-Iran:
	   (Jordanian) Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani's current visit to Iran aims at initiating a new era of
bilateral dialogue and cooperation, while also paving the way for
broader coordination among all Muslim states.
	   The ongoing crisis in the Middle East peace process and the
threats posed to the Arab and Muslim worlds by the policies of the
current Israeli government require that all of us start a new
chapter in our relations.
	   After meeting with Anani, (Iranian) President (Mohammad) Khatami
blasted the Israeli government, describing it as ``the greatest
enemy of Islam and humanity.''
	   Palestinians, Jordanians, all Arabs and Muslims are well aware
of the catastrophe that the policies of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu promise to bring to this region.
	   Herein the voice of Iran, as a powerful regional player, can
strengthen this cause, because as a neighboring Islamic nation it
has demonstrated that it would support the Arab drive for justice
and genuine peace.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on the Afghanistan's Taliban
militia:
	   If good Muslims everywhere heed the diktats of Afghanistan's
Ministry for Fostering Virtue and Suppressing Vice, the sound of
music would be silenced throughout the Islamic world, all
television sets and video recorders would be smashed, photography
and the cinema would be banned together with Western sartorial
styles, women would be forbidden to step out of the house or to
study or work, men would be forced to have beards that are at least
a fist's length, and children would be allowed only names that are
sanctioned by the Syariah.
	   As the ultra-militant Taliban militia, a relic of the Cold War
which appears dedicated to forcing its subjects to live the way
people did a millennium ago, has demonstrated in the nearly two
years since it seized power, punishment for the slightest breach of
these iron rules is swift and severe. This medieval regression must
be anathema to millions of peace loving, tolerant and progressive
Muslims who have not time for harshly imposed obscurantism.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on the Asian economic crisis:
	   The Asian crisis has been here for almost a year, but until it
began to show symptoms of being ungoverned, it hadn't impeded on
the West's market. World markets suspected that Japan was putting
all its hopes on a maximum devaluation of the yen...
	   If on one hand, the yen is devaluated, this could begin to solve
the greater part of Japan's problems and rid them of export
competition. It would also move their recession toward the West,
provoking a rise in interest rates in the United States and Europe,
with a further consequence of depressing the stock markets and
slowing economic growth...
	   If on the other hand the Japanese government decides to govern
the crisis, the world markets could in fact regain their lost
position in a few days. ...
	   It seems impossible that the entire world would let itself be
put in a tight corner because one country has let confusion and
corruption take over internally. If this is a game, Japan vs. the
rest of the world, it seems natural that the rest of the world
would win.
	   Instead, it is not clear how it will end, or if the United
States and Europe know what to do to win it.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, Germany, on the BP-Amoco merger:
	   (German finance minister) Theo Waigel oversees a federal budget
of 460 billion marks (dlrs 258 billion) ... The latest merger of
two industry giants, the fusion of the oil companies BP and Amoco,
will result in a company with annual revenues of 200 billion marks
(dlrs 112 billion).
	   But it no longer seems noteworthy that private firms amass
revenues comparable to those of medium-sized nations ... such
large-scale fusions need no explanation ... Daimler-Chrysler, for
example, is comparable in size to BP-Amoco, and yet one hears no
compelling reasons why the global auto industry demands such a
concentration of corporate power.
	   BP-Amoco will presumably also fail to offer convincing reasons.
Three-digit revenue figures in the billions apparently are a matter
of prestige for these global players. The success of a global
corporation is manifested foremost in its capacity to purchase
other corporations anywhere, anytime. Royal Dutch Shell recently
announced mysteriously that it will engage in a spectacular
transaction before the end of the year ... depending on the
exchange rate, the Dutch firm is ahead of or behind Exxon, the
largest oil company in the world.
	   It is of small comfort that even after the BP-Amoco fusion a
number of oil companies remain, so that the cartel administrations
need not feel challenged. Elephant weddings always harm
competition.

Relief and caution greet announcement of Holocaust settlement

 &UR; With US-Swiss Banks-Nazis, Israel-Swiss Banks &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with government reaction, CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ While some Swiss officials welcomed an agreement
by the two biggest Swiss banks to settle Holocaust survivors'
claims with a dlrs 1.25 billion payment, others were skeptical and
critical Thursday.
	   The banks said they expected ``other Swiss companies and
institutions will contribute to the financing of this sum.'' But
many said they would have to discuss the matter further.
	   The chief executive officer of the biggest bank, United Bank of
Switzerland, Marcel Ospel, said he was confident others would
contribute to the out-of-court settlement between the two major
Swiss banks and their plaintiffs.
	   ``I have already received positive signals in connection with
this,'' he said, but didn't elaborate.
	   The Swiss government said the agreement committed it to nothing.
Thomas Borer, who who heads the government task force on World War
II, read out in Bern a statement expressing hope that it would help
to calm the situation.
	   It restated its position that the settlement is a matter for
those involved.
	   ``Correspondingly, (the government) did not take part in the
negotiations, for which reason the Swiss Confederation is committed
to nothing by the settlement,'' it said.
	   Switzerland's main industry body, Vorort, said the banks'
settlement was in the Swiss economy's interest. But its president,
Andres F. Leuenberger, said any contributions from industry would
have to be discussed.
	   A spokesman for engineering group Sulzer said it was ready to
financially contribute. Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and
Novartis said they were ready for a dialogue with the banks, but
left open the question of a contribution.
	   Switzerland's central bank and government have refused to become
involved in settlement talks. Both said they didn't yet have full
details of the agreement.
	   The central bank welcomed the agreement as ``positive.''
	   But Swiss National Bank spokesman Werner Abegg said this was not
the time to discuss any contribution of its own. In his view, the
commercial banks had committed themselves to paying the agreed sum,
Abegg said.
	   The question of a financial contribution from third parties has
been postponed to a later phase, he said, giving time for the
accord to be studied in detail. He didn't specify a date.
	   Ulrich Pfister, spokesman for Credit Suisse, which joined UBS in
negotiating the accord, acknowledged it would meet some criticism
in Switzerland.
	   The parties that make up the coalition government gave a mixed
response. All four rejected any suggestion that either the
government or the SNB should contribute to it.
	   The Socialist Party gave the agreement a broad welcome, but said
many questions remained to be answered. Two center-right parties
expressed doubts that it would defuse tensions.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
he regretted that a combination of legal action and sanction
threats had achieved its objective.
	   Switzerland's main Jewish organization, the Swiss Confederation
of Hebrew Congregations, said it expected the accord would ease the
tension over the Holocaust issue.
	   ``We also hope it will establish a basis for a better
understanding between all those involved,'' said its general
secretary, Martin Rosenfeld.
	   Madeleine Kunin, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, said in a
statement that the accord should ``go far toward helping put the
important relationship between Switzerland and the United States on
solid ground once again.''
	   Sigi Feigel, honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of
Zurich, said in a statement that he was ``happy for the victims.''
	   But Feigel, who has been critical of Jewish organizations in the
talks, said he felt ``personally ashamed and humiliated'' by
``exaggerated demands'' and accusations that led to the accord.
	   The government stressed that existing efforts to address
Switzerland's wartime past, including an independent panel of
historians studying the period, will continue.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's Muslims said Thursday their
community is being treated unfairly because of the U.S. Embassy
bombing and several Muslims have been unjustifiably detained.
	   Ibrahim Lethome, deputy secretary-general of the Supreme Council
of Kenya Muslims, said police detained six Muslims shortly after
the Aug. 7 bombing; four are still being held.
	   He said Amjad Javed was picked up five minutes after a powerful
blast ripped through the embassy in downtown Nairobi. He said
Javed's family and friends don't know where is being held.
	   ``He rushed over to see about a friend who worked at the
embassy,'' Lethome said. The friend was among the 34 Kenyan embassy
employees who died in the blast, he said.
	   Qari Abdu Razak and another man, whose name was not available,
have been released. The names of the other detainees were not
immediately available.
	   Kenyan police official Peter Mbuvi said Thursday that ``about
five suspects'' had been detained and were being questioned.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   ``It seems they've decided that the people who did it are
Muslims, now let's go for the evidence,'' said Mohamed Farouk Adam,
the vice-chairman of Jamia Mosque in downtown Nairobi.
	   ``We should first have a look at the evidence. Then, if it's a
Muslim, you can crucify him. We have no problem. But, please, don't
do this before you have enough evidence,'' he said. ``We don't want
to repeat the Oklahoma tragi-comedy again.''
	   When a bomb destroyed a U.S. government building in Oklahoma
City in April 1995, many officials and journalists jumped to the
conclusion that it was the work of Muslim fundamentalists.
	   But an American, a non-Mulsim, was charged, convicted and
sentenced to death for the crime.
	   The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims represents all mosques and
Muslim organizations in this East African nation.
	   There are no official statistics on how many of Kenya's 29
million citizens who are Muslims.
	   The council says it is about 25 percent. Academics and
researchers put it between 5 and 10 percent.
	   Religion has not been part of the national census since
independence from Britain in 1962. The academics base their
estimates on projections from the British colonial census.

U.S. embassy receives second bomb threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland tried
Thursday to trace a second hoax bomb threat it received in three
days, an embassy official said.
	   An anonymous caller telephoned the threat at about 2 p.m.,
setting off a search of the building and adjoining car parks with
sniffer dogs.
	   The seven-story Swazi Central Bank building, where the embassy
occupies the top floor, was immediately evacuated, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Police sealed off all access roads and diverted traffic.
	   The embassy received its first bomb threat Tuesday morning.
	   The threats caused extra concern after the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people.
	   Swaziland is a tiny mountain kingdom bordering South Africa and
Mozambique.

More than 30 reported arrested following police chief's death

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Following the recent killing
of a Bosnian Serb regional deputy police chief, Bosnian Serb police
have arrested some 30 people, officials and media said Thursday.
	   But U.N. officials said they were aware of at least 14 arrests
in what appears to be another showdown between Serb hard-liners and
moderates.
	   U.N. police monitors were currently seeking additional
information as well as access to the arrested people, officials
said.
	   The arrests were made in the wake of the death of Srdjan
Knezevic, who was killed last Friday in front of his apartment in
Pale by two masked men. He was gunned down with more than 20
bullets.
	   Knezevic apparently had changed from a hard-liner backing
wartime leader Radovan Karadzic to supporting the pro-western
government and President Biljana Plavsic.
	   Bosnian Serb hard-liners and moderates, who have been fighting
for domination in the Serb-held half of the country for the last
two years, have accused each other of being behind the slaying.
	   The new moderate Serb government, based in Banja Luka, obviously
used the opportunity to move stronger against hard-liners, while
the main hard-line party demanded replacement of the new interior
minister, Milovan Stankovic, accusing him of introducing a ``reign
of terror over innocent residents.''
	   Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik said Thursday the situation
in the Serb half of Bosnia had been ``somewhat destabilized'' in
the past weeks, especially following Knezevic's death.
	   He called on Krajisnik to explain his alleged involvement in the
Knezevic case, citing a recent Interior Ministry statement which
indirectly accused him of orchestrating the killing.
	   The arrests started over the past few days but increased
overnight and throughout Thursday, raising tensions in Pale, the
stronghold of the hard-liners, 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
	   The Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted the new Pale police
chief, Momir Vukovic, as confirming that 33 persons had been
arrested and 32 vehicles and apartments searched.
	   During the Bosnian war, Knezevic was a commander of the ``White
Wolves'' unit which fought along the front-lines around Sarajevo.
	   Sources said he was close to Karadzic, the no. 1 war crimes
suspect. But after the war, Knezevic apparently joined the Bosnian
Serb moderates and was appointed a deputy chief of the Bosnian Serb
police in the Sarajevo region.

Rights group seeks release of political prisoners in Uzbekistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ A human rights group appealed
Thursday for the release of all political prisoners in Uzbekistan
on the country's Independence Day, Sept. 1.
	   Human Rights in Uzbekistan said there are 159 political
prisoners in the former Soviet republic in Central Asia. The
group's general secretary, Talib Yakubov, said most were convicted
on drug charges.
	   The group has made similar appeals to Uzbek President Islam
Karimov every year since 1992. Karimov released 80 political
prisoners in 1994.
	   ``The existence of political prisoners in a state that is
building a democratic society may lower the rating of the head of
the state and the government,'' the group said in a statement.

Milosevic aide hails Rugova's announcement

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A close aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic hailed the formation of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team in Kosovo Thursday, urging an immediate resumption
of the talks.
	   Nikola Sainovic, a vice-president in the Yugoslav government,
called the decision by Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova a
``smart move,'' adding the only way out of the Kosovo crisis is
through ``constructive dialogue.''
	   Sainovic's statement carried by the official Serbian television
came only hours after Rugova announced his negotiating team. The
team does not include representatives of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, who refused to join the Albanian pacifist leader.
	   It was not immediately clear when the two delegations will
resume talks halted last May after Serbian forces launched an
offensive against the KLA.
	   In Kosovo, the KLA announced the forming of their own political
wing headed by Adem Demaci, a more radical politician who has been
critical of Rugova's policies.
	   Sainovic said the future of Kosovo lies in peace and tolerance
and equality of all its citizens. He said the state makes clear
difference between Albanian citizens and members of ``terrorist
gangs,'' in an apparent reference to KLA.

Holm wins third stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Brian Holm crossed the line with
countryman Frank Hoy to capture the third leg of the Tour of
Denmark on Thursday, giving the Danes two consecutive stage
victories in a race where a native hadn't won in two years.
	   Holm took 5 hours, 42 seconds to complete the 215 kilometers
from Odder to Svendborg, the race's second longest leg.
	   Holm escaped with countryman Danish champion Lars Hoy after 100
kilometers (60 miles), and they stayed together to finish. The two
friends tried to cross the finishing line simultaneously holding
hands up high, but Holm was credited as official winner in the
friendly finish.
	   They were more than four minutes ahead of the pack, but were
both far behind in the overall standings and didn't move into the
top 10. Belgian Marc Streel still led Dane Bo Hamburger by 41
seconds.

Court: Top club can fire manager for dating archrival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the cutthroat world of Dutch
soccer, getting too cuddly with the enemy has cost a top manager
her job.
	   A municipal court ruled Thursday that Rotterdam's Feyenoord club
can dismiss director Nicole Edelenbos, who is dating Maarten
Oldenhof _ the manager of archrival Ajax of Amsterdam.
	   Dubbed the ``pillow talk case'' by the Dutch media, the lawsuit
heaped extra attention on the Netherlands' two top clubs, whose
annual clash is the highlight of the Dutch season.
	   Fearful that Edelenbos might leak sensitive information to
Oldenhof, Feyenoord went to court to request the termination of her
contract.
	   The judge approved the request, but ordered the club to pay
Edelenbos 210,600 guilders (dlrs 105,300) in compensation, less
than the half-million guilders (dlrs 250,000) she had sought.
	   Edelenbos' lawyer told the Amsterdam daily Het Parool that she
had hoped to keep her job and considered Thursday's ruling
``contrary to her basic rights.''
	   Calls to Feyenoord went unanswered Thursday, and Ajax officials
declined to comment on the case.

 &UR; Israel vows to press on against others who hold Holocaust victim
assets
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with fresh comment from officials, survivors;
CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Holocaust survivors like 82-year-old Dov
Haber, whose uncle had a prewar account at a Swiss bank, greeted
with joy the news of a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement between the
banks and Jewish survivors or their heirs.
	   ``This is my uncle's money, not theirs, and they have to give it
back,'' he said.
	   Israeli leaders who began the fight against Swiss banks holding
dormant accounts of Nazi victims also hailed the deal and vowed to
keep going after other countries and companies that have held back
assets of Holocaust survivors.
	   ``This is the beginning,'' said Bobby Brown, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser on world Jewish affairs.
	   ``What has happened now with the Swiss puts on notice every
country and company that looted Jewish assets. The time has come to
look back and have the courage to admit wrong and to try to find
justice where none existed before,'' Brown said.
	   A small article in the Israeli financial daily Globes in 1995
first caught the attention of the Israeli government and Jewish
leaders. The newspaper said an unknown amount of funds deposited in
Swiss banks by Jews killed in the Holocaust were being hidden by
the banks.
	   The late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered an
investigation into the report, opening the floodgates to a deluge
of information on seized property, looted gold and unpaid insurance
policies.
	   With Thursday's out-of-court settlement in New York complete
pending a judge's approval, officials can now turn their attention
to other areas.
	   Suits are currently pending in the United States against 16
European insurance companies and two German banks. In addition, the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group which acts as a liaison
between Israel and world Jewry, is looking into reports that
countries such as Portugal allegedly helped the Nazis move gold
taken from Jews to South America.
	   Israel also has been actively seeking, with some success, the
return of Jewish-owned property across Eastern Europe. Last week,
Romania's premier agreed to back legislation in his country to
return seized property and assets.
	   The battle against the Swiss banks was a lengthy one. Two years
of pressure and the threat of U.S. sanctions led the Swiss banks to
release the names of thousands of World War II-era accounts
holders, and offices were set up around the world to handle claims.
	   Last July, Dov Haber walked into the Tel Aviv claims office
clutching a brown leather satchel of documents proving he is the
nephew of Hermann Roth of Vienna, whose name appeared on the list.
Haber, whose family was wiped out by the Nazis, hopes someone from
the claims office will contact him.
	   ``Every (Swiss) franc that we can get back in his name is very
good,'' he said, but added, ``It's been so many years, and I
understand that it will take more for them to give out the money.''
	   Thursday's agreement calls for the money to be paid out over
four years.
	   In return, the plaintiffs will release all claims against two
commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ plus the Swiss
National Bank, other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss
industry.
	   There are more than 300,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel, and
thousands have claimed their unpaid assets. Several Holocaust
survivors, while quick to express satisfaction that a deal had been
made, added that they hoped that the neediest survivors would most
swiftly benefit from the settlement.
	   ``The survivors are an aging population in terms of health and
welfare... these monies first and foremost must go to these people,
for psychological help, old age homes and home care,'' said
Jonathan Lemberger, head of AMCHA, a support organization for
Holocaust survivors.
	   Brown said reparations would be divided between claimants and
needy Holocaust survivors, and some of the money will go to
educational projects having to do with Holocaust studies.
	   In Geneva, the Swiss National Bank, responsible for maintaining
the strength of Switzerland's currency, welcomed the settlement
between the two major Swiss banks and its Jewish plaintiffs as
``positive,'' but did not say whether the SNB would contribute to
the payout.
	   Several private companies, including Sulzer, said they would
contribute. Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis said
they welcomed a dialogue with the banks over the settlement.

Burton, King lead as Pak struggles in the wind
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Brandie Burton and Betsy King
mastered the wind, the rain and a typically unhelpful links course
Thursday to card the only sub-par rounds and share the lead in the
Women's British Open.
	   The two Americans were 1-under after 71s made in conditions that
left big names like Se Ri Pak, Laura Davies, Liselotte Neumann, and
defending champion Karrie Webb languishing in the high 70s.
	   England's Trish Johnson made level par 72 but the rest of the
field of 138 were over par, many by double figures.
	   Webb, bidding to win the title for the third time in four years,
started with a 76, Pak, winner of four touraments including two
majors in her rookie season, labored to 78 and Davies and Neumann
struggled to 79s.
	   Emilee Klein, tournament winner two years ago, carded an 82 and
Donna Andrews, with one victory and four second places this season,
struggled to 81.
	   Even in mid-August the wind and rain blowing in from the Irish
Sea made it seem like January at the Royal Lytham course which is
often used for the men's Open.
	   The early trios had to get used to the wind gusting the ball
around while those who went out later found it either pushing them
down the fairways or blowing their tee shots almost vertically.
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic at Windsor, Ontario two
weeks ago was glad she was one of the early ones.
	   ``I'm very excited about getting in the red today,'' she said.
``Club selection here was very trying and wore you down mentally.
You were pretty much in control playing into the wind but you
didn't know what would happen downwind when the ball was in the
air.''
	   Burton's 71 was spoiled by a double bogey 6 at the 398-yard
17th.
	   She drove into a fairway bunker, played her third shot into deep
rough under a tree and then hit a greenside bunker on the way to a
six. She then birdied the last to with others at the fifth, eighth
and 10th.
	   King, on her 43rd birthday, went out three hours later by which
time the wind was even stronger and made playing into it almost a
lottery. She also could taken the outright lead but hit a wall at
the 17th.
	   ``It was right into the wind,'' she said. ``And into the wind
the long holes are virtually unreachable. I was 50 yards short of
the green in two, got to within 25 feet and two-putted.''
	   Birdies at the second, eighth and 14th outnumbered her two
bogeys but Pak, winner of the LPGA Championship, the U.S. Women's
Open and two more titles this summer, couldn't come up with one.
	   ``The wind is really, really strong,'' said the Korean, who also
saved par at the last by rolling in a 20-foot putt. ``But it is the
same for all players and I have got to learn and keep working.''
	   Her problems started at the first, when her 5-iron from the tee
overshot the green, she chipped short and missed a 6-foot putt for
bogey 4.
	   She three-putted from 15 feet at the sixth, missed another
6-footer at 12 and then bogeyed 14, 15 and 16.
	   After chipping out of a fairway bunker at 14, she three-putted
from 30 feet, drove her tee shot into the thick rough and was
forced to lay up at 15.
	   At the 16th, Pak dropped her second shot into a bunker just
short of the green, pitched out still short and had to play a
pitching wedge to make the green.

Egypt sends medical aid for victims of U.S. Embassy bombing

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian plane carrying a ton of medicine
and 15 top doctors left for Kenya Thursday to help the victims of
the U.S. Embassy bombing.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam, a heart surgeon, headed the
medical team.
	   The team is expected to stay in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, for
nine days and perform surgeries if asked by the Kenyan government,
Sallam told reporters before his departure.
	   The aid package is made up of emergency medical supplies,
medicine for the treatment of burns and anti-antibiotics, Sallam
said.
	   The aid was ordered by President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Earlier, a Kuwaiti newspaper said Kuwait was sending food and
medicine to Kenya and Tanzania, also site of a bomb attack on the
U.S. Embassy.
	   The Al-Watan newspaper said Kuwaiti air force planes will
deliver the goods, but it did not give details on the size of the
donation, which was ordered by Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah.
	   Volunteers from the Kuwait Red Crescent Society will accompany
the material to help with distribution in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, where the explosions killed at least 250 people and injured
some 5,000.
	   In nearby Bahrain, the U.S. Navy on Thursday sent 2,250
kilograms (5,000 pounds) of medical supplies and equipment to Kenya
to help victims of the bombing.
	   A C-130 Hercules transport aircraft left Bahrain with medical
supplies, including intravenous fluids, bandages and syringes, said
Lt. Brenda Malone, spokeswoman for the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.
	   The 5th Fleet earlier sent about 60 people, most of them
Marines, to assist in security and humanitarian activities in
Kenya.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian international midfielder Igor Yanovsky has
signed a four-year contract with France's Paris Saint-Germain, the
French first division club said Thursday.
	   Yanovsky, 24, has 16 caps for Russia. He moved from Russian club
Alania, in the city of Vladikavkaz.
	   The terms of the contract were not released.
	   Paris Saint-Germain has spent lavishly over the summer in a bid
to build a squad to challenge for the French title.
	   Its most standout signing was Nigeria's Jay-Jay Okocha who
joined for a French record deal of 100 million francs (dlrs 17
million).
	   Nevertheless, PSG failed to kick off the season successfully,
losing its opening game 3-1 to Bordeaux last week.

Polish teams to boycott weekend matches in dispute over leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The entire Polish first-division soccer
league _ all 18 teams _ announced Thursday it would continue its
refusal to play games to demand the resignation of federation
president Marian Dziurowicz.
	   The action, which canceled five games last weekend, is intended
to force Dziurowicz to quit over accusations of corruption and
mismanagement.
	   After a special meeting of the Polish federation Wednesday,
Dziurowicz said he would continue as president until elections for
new federation leaders on Nov. 12. He said he would not seek
re-election then.
	   The Polish state news agency, PAP, reported Thursday that two of
the first division teams wanted to play matches scheduled for this
weekend, but decided at a meeting Thursday to join the other sides
in extending the boycott a second week.
	   The boycott will end next week after a meeting between league
officials and federation officials, the teams announced. Only
first-division league matches are affected.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended the entire federation
leadership _ more than 20 people including Dziurowicz _ in May for
refusing to allow an investigation into the charges. The federation
leaders claimed they were outside government authority.
	   Debski reinstated them Friday to avoid a suspension of the
Polish federation by FIFA, but only after the federation agreed to
let state controllers examine its books and records.
	   Players from the first-division team then boycotted the five
matches last weekend to protest the reinstatement of Dziurowicz's
administration.
	   Poland has not qualified for the World Cup since 1982. Debski
blames federation officials for the general decline of the sport.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After a disappointing career at
several foreign clubs, Romanian striker Ilie Dumitrescu returned to
his homeland and signed a one-year contract with his former team
Steaua Bucharest on Thursday.
	   Dumitrescu, 29, left Mexican club America to sign a deal worth a
reported yearly salary of dlrs 150,000 at Steaua Bucharest.
	   Dumitrescu said he was disappointed by his performance at this
year's World Cup, where he played only 45 minutes in the game
against Tunisia. Romania drew 1-1 with Tunisia and was knocked out
by Croatia 1-0 in the second round.
	   Dumitrescu left Steaua in 1994 for a two-year contract with
Tottenham Hotspur in London.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A draft resolution before the Security
Council Thursday condemns the bombing of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania and calls on all states to cooperate with
authorities in finding those responsible.
	   The resolution, sponsored by Kenya and expected to be adopted
later Thursday, ``expresses its deep sorrow, sympathy and
condolences to the families of the innocent victims of the
terrorist bomb attacks at this difficult time.''
	   It ``strongly condemns the terrorist bomb attacks.'' And it
stresses that every nation ``has the duty to refrain from
organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist
acts in another state.''
	   The almost simultaneous attacks Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 257 people and
injured more than 5,500.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian
politician unveiled a new team Thursday to negotiate the future of
Kosovo with the Serb-led government but failed to win the backing
of rebels fighting for independence of the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been struggling
to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to stop
squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in Kosovo
made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or without the
rebels.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will meet Friday with the team to hammer out a negotiating platform
for what Hill said he hopes are imminent talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The five-member team is weighted with disciples of Ibrahim
Rugova, the scarf-wearing pacifist supported by one branch of the
Kosovo Liberation Army and despised by others.
	   The KLA never responded to an invitation extended two weeks ago
to join the team, Hill said, apparently because it did not want to
work with Rugova. Two leading politicians with close links to the
guerrillas also declined to participate in talks.
	   Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the rebels and other
ethnic Albanian politicians will join negotiations with Milosevic
if they see progress is being made toward autonomy for Kosovo. One
sign of progress, diplomats said, might be the formation of a
multi-ethnic police force in the province.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included'' in talks, Rugova told a press conference. He was
surrounded by Hill and representatives of the so-called Contact
Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision, with Vice
President Nikola Sainovic saying a Serb delegation has been ready
for months to resume talks, which broke off in May.
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring a version of the
self-rule he revoked from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear
what degree of autonony Milosevic is willing to grant the province,
which some Serbs consider the medieval cradle of their national
identity.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million.
	   Since 1991, ethnic Albanians have sought independence from what
they call the oppression of the Milosevic regime. The Albanians
have declared a self-styled ``Republic of Kosovo'' and elected
Rugova as president.
	   But Rugova's slow, peaceful approach to politics tried the
patience of politicians who broke with his party _ including Mehmet
Hajrizi and Bajram Kosumi, the two KLA-allied leaders who refused
to partipate in the negotiating team. Last year, the rebels started
attacking Serb police units. And on Feb. 28, Milosevic sent police
and military troops to crush the KLA.
	   Part of the problem for Hill and others trying to bring peace to
Kosovo has been the KLA itself, a secretive and apparently
disorganized band that has no single identified leader or main
headquarters.
	   KLA commanders in the field express wildly different positions
on politics and whether they would be willing to accept autonomy
instead of independence. Even speaking of the KLA as one, unified
group is tricky, and made it particularly difficult for diplomats
to corall the group for talks.
	   Part of the KLA professes support for Rugova, and could
conceivably join peace talks eventually. But the rest of the KLA
could easily continue fighting, with funding and arms trickling
over the border from supporters and self-declared leaders in
Albania, Germany and Switzerland.
	   ``Evidence never came in that anyone in Pristina'' _ Kosovo's
capital _ ``could control the KLA,'' a Western diplomat close to
negotiations said Thursday. ``And then, can the KLA really control
the KLA? That's a problem.'' The diplomat spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Just hours before Rugova announced his negotiating team, the KLA
announced its own six-member team of ``political representatives''
in a statement declaring its ``full trust'' in Adem Demaci to lead
the rebel army in ``creating the institutions of Kosovo.''
	   It urged Demaci, who spent 28 years as a political prisoner, to
leave his Parliamentary Party of Kosovo.
	   The statement suggested a threat to Rugova for attempting to
negotiate the future of Kosovo without the KLA, calling on
politicians to ``stop the actions to reach disunity, or our strike
will be ruthless.''

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Mark O'Meara, who won the British
Open in rain and wind, got off to a shaky start under ideal
conditions in the U.S. PGA Championship Thursday while trying to
become the first man to win three major championships in one year
since Ben Hogan in 1953.
	   O'Meara stumbled immediately, making bogey on the first hole at
tree-lined Sahalee Country Club and adding another at the third.
	   Tiger Woods, meanwhile, recovered from some early erratic play
to make the turn at 1-under and added another birdie at the 10th
hole. Woods, trying for his first major since winning the 1997 U.S.
Masters, was a stroke off the early lead set by Glenn Day, who
birdied the first three holes he played.
	   There were plenty of scores under par as temperatures headed
toward the mid-30s Celsius (90s Fahrenheit) even under the canopies
of huge trees lining the fairways. The early scores were an
indication that Sahalee wouldn't play as hard as the last two
majors, which were won with par scores.
	   Sahalee is a Chinook Indian phrase for ``High, Heavenly
Ground,'' and it lives up to its name. Huge trees line the fairway
and holes meander through the woods, offering players brief
glimpses of tiny green landing areas.
	   It's a course where the driver doesn't always come into play and
one where shot placement and selection is at a premium.

Israeli air raid after guerrilla attack in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla infiltration trails in southern Lebanon Thursday hours
after an Israeli army patrol came under fire, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   They said two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on
Mazraat Iqmata, an area in a no man's land about 500 meters (yards)
from the Israeli military outpost in Sojod.
	   The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties from the late night
raid, which came about five hours after Hezbollah guerrillas
attacked an Israeli armor patrol outside Sojod on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrillas said an armored vehicle
was hit.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the guerrilla
ambush and the air raid.
	   Two Israeli soldiers were wounded Tuesday night in a guerrilla
attack near Sojod, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the
port city of Sidon which is a frequent target of guerrilla forays
from their stronghold of Iqlim al-Tuffah across the front line.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 allied members of the locally recruited South
Lebanon Army militia from the occupied border zone.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Peace talks between Angola's government
and the former rebel movement UNITA are still under way despite
reported military offensives from both sides, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The negotiations to avert a return to civil war followed an
emergency visit from a special U.N. envoy to prevent what appeared
to be the imminent collapse of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace deal.
	   U.N. spokesman Ahmadou Toure said the two sides have met almost
daily over the last week in a ``genuine attempt'' to negotiate a
solution because the envoy made it clear the U.N.'s patience was
running thin.
	   ``The U.N. (peacekeeping force) is not going to stay here
forever,'' he said.
	   The government and UNITA have been accusing each other of
military offensives.
	   Earlier this week, the government's chief negotiator Higino
Carneiro said in a radio interview that UNITA offensives in the
northeast have plunged the country into ``total instability.''
	   State-controlled radio also accused UNITA of massacring 150
people in a recent attack.
	   The government claims UNITA maintains a 30,000-strong residual
army.
	   However, UNITA's chief negotiator Isaias Samakuva said the group
has already fully dismantled its military structures, so it cannot
be held responsible for the reported attacks.
	   Until the government ceases its ``hostile propaganda,'' Samakuva
has said UNITA cannot fulfill promises made in the 1994 peace deal,
such as moving its headquarters from the central highlands to the
capital Luanda.
	   Samakuva added that he had reports that an army battalion was
behind the reported fighting in the northeastern province of
Malanje because it was attacking diamond-digging settlements.
	   The situation has prompted President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to
cut short an unofficial visit to Brazil, Lisbon radio TSF reported.
He will return to Angola on Friday.

Amid concern over ruble, Russian Central Bank imposes new

restrictions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with G-7 phone conversation on Russian economy. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government and Central Bank officials tried
Thursday to parry investors' growing panic over the Russian ruble's
stability with assurances that the currency would not be devalued.
	   As the ruble continued to slide and the stock market to plunge,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko dismissed the markets' free-fall as
a ``psychological reaction'' rather than one caused by economic
developments in the country.
	   ``The only normal way to respond to the market condition, the
investors' panic, is to strictly implement the program we have
approved,'' he said. He discussed the economic situation with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, pressing the
Communist-dominated parliament to quickly pass legislation
necessary for the austerity program, and with David Lipton, a
high-ranking U.S. Treasury official.
	   The stock market fell 6.5 percent, to close at 101.17 points.
The ruble ended sharply lower amid continued fear of bank defaults
and further instability of the ruble.
	   George Soros, the billionaire investor whose moves are closely
watched on international markets, shook markets with a suggestion
in Thursday's Financial Times of London that the ruble should be
devalued by 15 to 25 percent.
	   Officials from world's seven wealthiest nations _ the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada _ held a
telephone conference call with Russian authorities to discuss the
financial turmoil in Russia.
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry also said in Washington that
U.S. officials were staying in close contact with the International
Monetary Fund over the developments.
	   Russian Central Bank officials went on the offensive, issuing a
flurry of denials that devaluation was on the government's agenda _
even though the bank's ability to hold up the ruble is being eroded
by its rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves. The bank
reported Thursday that the reserves stood at dlrs 17 billion on
Aug. 7, down from dlrs 18.4 billion a week earlier.
	   ``In our view, devaluation will not solve a single problem and
would deal a painful blow to every Russian's purse,'' said Irina
Yasina, chief spokeswoman for the Central Bank. ``It would only
exacerbate the situation and that we don't need.''
	   Unlike the market ups and downs, devaluation would reach
ordinary Russians by sparking immediate, sharp price rises, which
could in turn stoke social unrest. It would also most likely cause
some banks to go bankrupt, sweeping away businesses' ruble savings.
	   In the long run, devaluation could force Russian producers to be
more competitive with the foreign producers who provide 70 percent
of the food in Russian stores. But in the short run, it would be
excruciating for people already staggering under the weight of
unpaid salaries and the increasing cost of living.
	   Many Russians have been hedging their bets on the economy for a
long time by converting rubles to dollars and German marks as
quickly as they get them.
	   The Central Bank imposed new rules Thursday on currency trading
by commercial banks, causing frightened bankers to temporarily halt
their foreign exchange trading.
	   Trading also was briefly halted on Russia's main stock exchange
for the second time this week, because the main index had dropped
more than 10 percent during the first 40 minutes of trading.
	   Late in the day, Moody's, the international credit rating
service, downgraded its rating for Russia's foreign debt, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Fitch IBCA rating agency said it had placed one Russian
bank, SBS Agro, on what it called rating alert negative. The firm
said SBS Agro was having trouble ``meeting margin calls on its
repurchase transactions.''

Russia accuses Pakistan of helping Taliban victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin-Rakhmanov talks. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian diplomat accused Pakistan on
Thursday of sending troops and combat aircraft to help the Taliban
crush its opponents in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban's military success has been possible because of the
``active involvement of Pakistan's army units and air force,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said at a news conference.
	   Pakistan is sympathetic to the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic
movement that controls most of Afghanistan. Many countries have
said that Pakistan supplies weapons to the Taliban, though Pakistan
denies the charge.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Masoor Alam lashed out at Russia for
favoring anti-Taliban forces and failing to recognize the Taliban,
despite its recent victories.
	   ``Russia was completely in favor of the (anti-Taliban) Northern
Alliance, it continued to recognize Mr. (Burhanuddin) Rabbani as
the president of Afghanistan, even though he was ousted from Kabul,
and the Alliance's representative as the ambassador of the whole
Afghanistan,'' Alam was quoted as saying Thursday by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Moscow is opposed to the Taliban because it fears that a radical
Islamic state in Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and
weapons into the neighboring former Soviet republics of Central
Asia and threaten its own stability.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin discussed the developments in
Afghanistan by telephone on Thursday with President Emomali
Rakhmanov of Tajikistan, one of those republics.
	   The presidents expressed their ``deep concern'' about the
situation, Russian news agencies reported.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan _ a Central Asian
republic that does not border Afghanistan _ appealed to the warring
sides in Afghanistan ``not to leave the boundaries of their
country,'' and cross into former Soviet republics, Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Our troops are stationed there,'' Nazarbayev added.
	   Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, now governor of
the Krasnoyarsk region in central Siberia, lashed out at the
Russian government for failing to provide effective support to the
anti-Taliban alliance in the north.
	   ``The failure to take the necessary steps has led to the present
developments in Afghanistan. And the Taliban victory today would
mean Islamic extremism hitting Russia right below the belt,'' Lebed
said, according to Interfax. ``The situation is extremely
unpleasant.''
	   Russian officials have denied reports that Moscow is supplying
weapons to Afghan factions opposing the Taliban.
	   However, some Russian analysts said that Moscow was providing
covert assistance to the very groups that fought against the Soviet
army when it occupied Afghanistan from 1979-89.
	   They specifically mentioned Afghan rebel leader Ahmed Shah
Massoud, the most effective rebel leader in the 1980s when he led
resistance to the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

Moldova protests transport of nuclear fuel across its territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moldova will send experts to Bulgaria to monitor
the loading of spent nuclear fuel that is to be reprocessed in
Russia, a news agency said Thursday.
	   The fuel will be transported by rail across Moldova to the
Russian city of Arzamas. The nuclear station is located in
Kozlodui, Bulgaria, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) from Moldova.
	   Rightist parties in the Moldovan parliament opposed the
shipment, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Muslim cleric arrested in connection with settler shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Nablus, West Bank (AP) _ Israel arrested a Muslim cleric from
the West Bank suspected of involvement in the shooting deaths of
two Jewish settlers last week, neighbors and Israeli Radio said
Thursday.
	   Dirar Hamabni, a 37 year-old religious leader, was arrested late
Tuesday from his village of Assira, close to the Jewish settlement
of Itzhar where the two Jewish seminary students were killed while
patrolling their settlement, Israeli radios reported.
	   Hamabni's neighbor Mohammed Shder said he was active in the
Palestinian militant group Hamas, and was expelled from Israel in
1992 along with hundreds of Islamic radicals, who were allowed to
return a year later.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace making and has carried
out deadly attacks against Israelis in the past.
	   Two other Palestinian men were arrested Wednesday, also in
connection with the killings.
	   Also Thursday, an Israeli military court sentenced a Hebron
resident to two life sentences for the murder of three Israelis in
separate 1994 attacks, the Israeli army said.

Players withdraw unfair labor complaint
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Locked out National Basketball Association
players withdrew their complaint before the National Labor
Relations Board on Thursday, just hours before the board's regional
director was to issue his recommendation.
	   The move was a clear victory for the owners, who were accused of
an unfair labor practice by imposing a lockout before the sides had
bargained to an impasse.
	   ``I assume they came to the recognition that this was a loser,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``This is obviously a defeat
for the union strategy of litigation instead of negotiation.
	   ``The players must now recognize that the NBA lockout is
completely lawful, and the only way it will end is when the parties
sit down and reach a deal that is fair to both sides,''
	   The union filed its complaint last month, about three weeks
after the lockout commenced, charging the owners with unilaterally
imposing changes in conditions of employment.
	   NLRB regional director Daniel Silverman had the choice of
dismissing the union's charge, issuing a complaint against the
league or recommending an injunction be sought restoring the work
rules that expired along with the old collective bargaining
agreement.
	   ``This just demonstrates what we've been saying _ that this is a
perfectly legal lockout, that we have bargained in good faith and
you don't have to lock out only when games are in place,'' Granik
said.
	   The sides have not scheduled any resumption of formal
negotiations, which broke off last Thursday after the owners
received the players' latest proposal.
	   The union still has a grievance pending before arbitrator John
Feerick, who has been asked to determine whether players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   The union is due to file its legal briefs with Feerick on
Friday, and the league's response is due a week later. Feerick has
scheduled the hearings for Aug. 24-25.

 &UR; NATO welcomes new Kosovo Albanian negotiating team; Urges rapid
talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Xavier Solana on
Thursday ``warmly'' welcomed the news that ethnic Albanians have
formed a new team to negotiate the future of Kosovo with the
Serb-led government.
	   ``It is very important that negotiations are taken forward
quickly by both sides in a spirit of cooperation,'' Solana said in
a statement issued by the NATO headquarters.
	   He spoke of ``a window of opportunity'' in the Kosovo conflict
even though the new Kosovo Albanian negotiating team does not
include representatives from militants fighting Serb security
forces.
	   Solana said it was ``imperative'' that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic ``contributes positively to the process and
creates an appropriate environment by ensuring that his security
forces behave with restraint.''
	   The five-member team is led by Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist
supported by one branch of the Kosovo Liberation Army and despised
by others. Rugova hopes the rebels and other ethnic Albanian
politicians will join negotiations with Milosevic if they see
progress is being made toward autonomy for Kosovo.

Israeli strike guerrilla trails in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla infiltration trails in southern Lebanon Thursday after an
Israeli army patrol came under fire, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   They said two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on
Mazraat Iqmata, an area about 500 meters (yards) from the Israeli
military outpost in Sojod.
	   The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties from the late-night
raid, which came about five hours after Hezbollah guerrillas
attacked an Israeli armor patrol outside Sojod on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. Sojod is about 22
kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city of Sidone.
	   The Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrillas said an armored vehicle
was hit.
	   There was no Israeli comment on the guerrilla ambush and the air
raid.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 allied members of the locally recruited South
Lebanon Army militia from the occupied border zone.

	   In a statement distributed by the Itar-TASS news agency, the
Russian Foreign Ministry noted the agreement follows efforts by the
United States, Russia and other members of the Contact Group to
arrange a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
	   ``We call on the Yugoslav and Serbian leadership, as well as
Kosovar Albanian leaders, to began talks immediately and without
any preconditions, to demonstrate maximum restraint and to stop
hostile actions which could pose a threat to the dialogue,'' the
statement said.
	   The ministry urged the Contact Group, which also includes
Germany, Britain, Italy and France, to cordinate their efforts to
help Belgrade and Pristina move forward the negotiating process.

New Jersey regulators to rule on Tyson's return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ He's a convicted rapist who once bit
an opponent's ears. He couldn't even control himself when he came
to repent.
	   Then again, he's a heavyweight fighter who makes his living with
his fists and his unpredictability. He was licensed to fight even
after serving a three-year prison term, but then paid for biting
Evander Holyfield with a dlrs 3 million fine and a forced one-year
sabbatical.
	   Is Mike Tyson fit to return to boxing _ again?
	   That's the question facing New Jersey regulators, who will
decide Friday whether the former heavyweight champion has paid for
his attack on Holyfield's ears last year.
	   Tyson, 32, hasn't fought since the June 28, 1997 bout, which led
Nevada regulators to revoke his boxing license. Now he's asking New
Jersey to reinstate him.
	   The state Athletic Control Board, which heard nearly four hours
of testimony from Tyson and his supporters last month, will vote on
whether Tyson possesses the ``good character, honesty, integrity
and responsibility'' required by state boxing law.
	   It is unclear how much board members will consider his bitter
behavior at the end of that hearing, when he refused to read a
closing statement and used profanity while talking to his lawyer.
	   Tyson sent a letter of apology to the board that same day,
according to his lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr.
	   Fusco said Tyson will attend Friday's meeting.
	   ``He's nervous, he's anxious, but he's going to come there to
accept the decision,'' Fusco said Thursday.
	   Only two members of the three-man board will vote. Board member
Steven Katz, who did not attend the July 29 hearing, will vote only
if chairman Gerard Gormley and board member Gary Shaw deadlock on
whether to license Tyson.
	   The case is being watched closely _ by boxing insiders, the
casino industry, regulators in New York and Nevada, even the
National Organization for Women. Many of those parties have weighed
in with New Jersey officials.
	   In one corner are those who believe Tyson has been punished
enough for the bizarre biting, that he deserves a chance to return
to the ring.
	   ``The man paid dlrs 3 million, one of the biggest fines in the
history of sports,'' said boxing promoter Cedric Kushner, who is
not affiliated with Tyson. ``The man was off for 12 months. I think
absolutely, he should be entitled to resume his career. His clock
is ticking.''
	   In the other corner are those who say Tyson's checkered past _
the rape of a beauty pageant contestant, the attack on Holyfield,
the angry performance before the New Jersey board _ demonstrate
that he is too dangerous even for the most brutal of sports.
	   ``Everyone deserves a second chance, but this isn't a second
chance,'' said Bear Atwood, president of the National Organization
for Women's New Jersey chapter.
	   ``We've lost count of how many chances this is. The second
chance comes when you've demonstrated a willingness to change your
behavior. We haven't seen that from him.''
	   Some think Tyson should return to the scene of the bites and
apply for a license in Nevada.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An envoy of U.N. chief Kofi Annan urged the
Iraqi leadership Thursday to cooperate with arms monitors in their
inspection of banned weapons sites.
	   Prakash Shah met for more than an hour with Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Thursday night to try to defuse the latest
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Prakash said he delivered a message from Annan to the Iraqi
leadership, stressing that Iraq must cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
	   Aziz and the U.N. envoy agreed to continue holding talks,
Prakash told reporters after the meeting.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced on Aug. 5 that Iraq
would no longer cooperate with the United Nations Special
Commission, which is charged with ensuring that Iraq eliminates its
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``I mentioned to him (Aziz) that there is a unanimous view in
the council that Iraq should continue its coopeatation with the
U.N. and UNSCOM,'' Prakash said. ``The meeting, as always, was
cordial and friendly.'' He refused to give details.
	   He said Aziz ``wanted to convey the Iraqi point of view, the
Iraqi concerns,'' of continued U.N. sanctions.
	   Earlier, Aziz dismissed claims by chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler and the International Atomic Eenergy Agency as
inaccurate, saying arms monitors had been given full access to 496
weapons sites.
	   In a letter to Danilo Turk, president of the U.N. Security
Council in response to a letter sent to the council by Butler, Aziz
said UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors were able to visit these sites
``with no interference by the Iraqi side.''
	   Butler complained that Iraqi restrictions on arms inspectors
were making it impossible to ensure that Iraq was not reviving its
weapons programs.

Zanardi ready to resume march to CART title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELKHART LAKE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Alex Zanardi hasn't done much
wrong this season.
	   The Italian driver, far ahead of the pack as he attempts to
defend his CART FedEx Championship Series title, has been the
driver to beat at almost every race this year.
	   That's what makes what happened last Sunday at Mid-Ohio so
unlikely.
	   Zanardi was fined an unprecedented dlrs 50,000 by CART chief
steward Wally Dallenbach for unjustifiable risk in separate race
incidents with J.J. Lehto and Helio Castro-Neves. Dallenbach also
withheld the championship point Zanardi earned with his 12th-place
finish.
	   But, because none of the other contenders finished ahead of him
at Mid-Ohio, Zanardi still carries a 68-point lead over teammate
Jimmy Vasser going into Sunday's Texaco-Havoline 200 at Road
America.
	   That intimidating lead, after 13 of 19 races, means Zanardi
could go at least three more races without scoring a point and
still be out front, no matter what anyone else does.
	   Sunday's race was only the second time he has finished outside
the top 10 this season and the first time he has failed to reach
the podium (top three) since finishing eighth on the last day of
May at Milwaukee.
	   ``We must have a calmer week,'' Zanardi said. ``That (the
penalty) is behind us now. We must concentrate on winning this race
and getting our momentum back.''
	   Vasser, just four points ahead of Greg Moore in the battle for
second place, was knocked out of the Mid-Ohio race in a first-lap
crash. It is only the third time in his last 47 starts that the
1996 series champion has not been running at the finish.
	   ``Alex has definitely made it difficult on the rest of us,''
Vasser said. ``Before Mid-Ohio, I was picking up some decent points
and I wasn't gaining any ground on him.
	   ``The way he's running, the only way the rest of us will catch
up is if he decides to take a little vacation before the end of the
season.''
	   He says with Zanardi in control of his own destiny, there is
little he can do to catch him. But he won't give up.
	   ``I'd certainly like to win a few more races and make the
championship chase more exciting,'' Vasser said. ``But there are a
bunch of other drivers who want to do the same thing.''
	   Road America's 4.048-mile (6.477-kilometer) road course has been
a very good track for Zanardi in his two years on the CART circuit.
He has started first and second, and finished third and first.
	   ``Elkhart Lake is a place I really enjoy each year,'' he said.
``I feel most comfortable on these permanent road courses because
of my background, and we've had a very good car here the past two
years.''
	   If people are waiting for Zanardi to hit a slump, they might be
disappointed to study his CART history.
	   In 1996, he racked up the majority of his points on the way to
rookie of the year honors in the last eight races of the season.
Last season, he tallied 126 of his 195 points in the final seven
races, appearing on the podium six times.
	   Practice and qualifying at Road America begin Friday.

shooting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Nablus, West Bank (AP) _ Israel arrested a Muslim cleric from
the West Bank suspected of involvement in the shooting deaths of
two Jewish settlers last week, neighbors and Israeli Radio said
Thursday.
	   Dirar Hamabni, a 37-year-old religious leader, was arrested late
Tuesday in his village of Assira, close to where the two Jewish
seminary students were killed while patrolling their Jewish
settlement of Itzhar, Israeli radios reported.
	   Hamabni's neighbor Mohammed Shder said he was active in the
Palestinian militant group Hamas, and was expelled from Israel in
1992 along with hundreds of Islamic radicals. They were allowed to
return a year later.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace and has carried out
deadly attacks against Israelis in the past.
	   Two other Palestinian men were arrested Wednesday, also in
connection with the killings.

Power cut in Kinshasa as fears rise of rebel advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to ADD details of rebel claims; U.S. deploys ships to
Congo. Trims. No pickup.

 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fear ran rampant in Congo's capital on
Thursday as a power blackout throughout Kinshasa fed speculations
that rebel forces were advancing on the city.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen said rebel fighters had
captured the town of Inga, about 200 kilometers (135 miles) from
the capital, where the primary power transformer for Kinshasa is
located.
	   Heavy fighting was reported in Matadi, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) south of Inga, where authorities had earlier warned people
to stay indoors.
	   A commander in the rebel stronghold of Goma, eastern Congo, said
his forces had captured the Matadi airport and the Inga power
plant.
	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in the eastern city of
Goma.
	   ``The airport has fallen into our hands. Government troops have
dispersed. We are marching into town tonight,'' Ondekane said.
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that two Marine
amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic waters off
Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens living
there.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.
	   Congo government and rebel forces have both launched ambitious
radio campaigns claiming battlefield victories since Tutsi forces
launched the rebellion earlier this month.
	   But where earlier in the day state radio had been broadcasting a
steady campaign of propaganda against the rebels, by afternoon,
only static filled the air.
	   State radio was cut due to the lack power for its transmitter.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising, which has spread from Congo's eastern reaches to several
points southwest of the capital. Both countries vehemently deny
involvement in the rebellion.
	   As evening descended on Kinshasa, candlelight flickered from
small shops and apartment buildings along the city's main June 30th
Boulevard.
	   ``I'm starting to get really concerned,'' computer store owner
Deo Maneno said while locking up his shop. ``If it's the rebels who
have cut the power, this is really serious.''
	   When the power was cut, rumors buzzed through the city as
thousands of people filled the streets and scurried to the safety
of their homes.
	   Battles in Matadi, on the Congo river about 250 kilometers (160
miles) southwest of Kinshasa, were reported by Congolese news
organizations shortly before the power outage.
	   The port had been targeted by the rebels for at least several
days due to its strategic location as a supply route to Kinshasa.
	   A column of at least 12 trucks and armored personnel carriers
filled with government troops were seen Thursday racing out of
Kinshasa in the direction of Matadi.
	   Hostilities continued as Rwanda and Congo traded allegations of
ethnic attacks.
	   Congo's human rights minister said Rwandan troops were targeting
ethnic Hutus living in eastern Congo.
	   The Rwandan government called on international agencies to
intervene and save ethnic Tutsis it said were being persecuted by
Congolese authorities, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   Kabila's government denies victimizing Tutsis, but acknowledges
a number of civilians have been arrested on suspicion of spying for
the rebels.
	   Tutsis, with their distinctive angular features, have gone into
hiding in Kinshasa as calls on state radio to massacre the enemy
fuel a growing anger against all Tutsis _ Rwandan and otherwise.
``People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades,
rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones and
the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis,'' a
state radio station in the eastern Congolese town of Bunia said in
a Wednesday broadcast.
	   By Thursday, the rebels claimed to have captured the town,
although it could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Relations between Congo and its neighbors, which helped remove
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power and install Kabila,
had been deteriorating before the rebellion erupted. Uganda and
Rwanda complained Kabila had failed to stop cross-border attacks on
their territory.
	   The rebels say they are fed up with Kabila's rule, which they
say has been tainted by mismanagement, corruption and nepotism.

Brazil, Russia, Mexico to face Olympic champion Americans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ South American champion Brazil will join Russia,
Mexico and the host United States in next month's exhibition U.S.
Women's Cup, the last major women's soccer event in America before
the 1999 World Cup.
	   Although the Olympic champion United States plans two foreign
tours and 14 international exhibitions in 1999 before the June
19-July 10 world championship, this will be its last event in a
World Cup format prior to the quadrennial tourney.
	   By virtue of winning the South American championship in March,
Brazil already has qualified for the 16-nation World Cup field
while Mexico enters CONCACAF qualifying later this month.
	   Russia is in second place in its European group, and already has
assured itself of at least entering the continent's playoffs for a
World Cup berth.
	   The four European group winners qualify automatically for the
World Cup while the four runners-up enter two-leg playoffs to
determine two others.
	   The United States will take on Mexico on Sept. 12 in Foxboro,
Mass., prior to the Major League Soccer contest between New England
and Columbus, to open the tournament.
	   Brazil will play Russia three days later in Oneonta, New York
home of the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame.
	   The four teams will gather in Rochester, New York on Sept. 18
for a doubleheader with Mexico playing Brazil and the Americans
facing Russia. The final games will take place in Richmond,
Virginia, two days later with Mexico playing Russia and the United
States taking on Brazil.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Suspected Muslim extremists shot and killed
three Coptic Christian brothers on their farm in southern Egypt,
police officials said Thursday.
	   The attack by three gunmen took place Wednesday night near the
the village of Damshir in Minya province, 190 kilometers (120
miles) south of Cairo.
	   The body of another villager was found Thursday in a sugar-cane
field on the outskirts of Damshir and police suspect he was killed
by the same gunmen as they made their escape.
	   They identified the man as Ezzat Ali Hassan, a Muslim. It was
not clear what was the motive for his killing.
	   The Christian victims were identified as Farag Gabr Shehata and
his brothers Yaaqoub and Wahib. Police said that two other farmers
who had been with the Shehata brothers fled when the shooting
started and were safe.
	   The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal
security, issued a statement late Wednesday saying the attackers
were being sought.
	   Muslim extremists have waged a campaign since 1992 to try to
overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with Islamic
rule. Their targets have included Coptic Christians, foreign
tourists and police.
	   Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police
and extremists.

First time major winners abound in the PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Woods finishing &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Maybe Sahalee Country Club suits
Tiger Woods after all.
	   Woods, keeping his driver in the bag on the narrow, tree-lined
course, made seven birdies today en route to 4-under 66 and took
the early clubhouse lead in the PGA Championship.
	   Woods, who has not won a major championship since winning his
first at the 1997 Masters, bogeyed the first hole but did little
wrong after that on a course many predicted would take away his
long game edge.
	   Playing in ideal conditions, Woods made the turn at 1 under,
then birdied three of the first four holes on the back nine to move
into contention. He 3-putted the 14th hole for bogey, but made a
long birdie putt on 17.
	   Glen Day had the hottest start of any golfer, with birdies on
his first four holes, and also was at 4 under through 10 holes.
	   Mark O'Meara, meanwhile, stumbled early but regrouped to get to
par through 13 holes as he tried to become the first man to win
three major championships in one year since Ben Hogan in 1953.
	   Woods took advantage of an early tee time, hitting an iron off a
first tee decorated with the Wanamaker trophy that will go to the
winner of the championship. With massive trees framing every
fairway and the course not playing long at 6,906 yards (6284
meters), Woods did not plan to pull his driver out of the bag
during the tournament.
	   There were plenty of scores under par as temperatures headed
toward the 90s even under the canopies of trees lining the
fairways. The early scores were an indication that Sahalee wouldn't
play as hard as the last two majors, which were won with even par
scores.
	   If O'Meara hadn't won the Masters and British Open already this
year, he might have been a good pick to win his first major beneath
the towering firs and cedars of Sahalee.
	   The PGA has served as a breeding ground for new major champions
in the past decade, and O'Meara was a good candidate to carry on a
tradition of unlikely winners after going winless in his first 56
major championships.
	   Then a 20-foot (6-meter) putt on the 18th green at Augusta
lifted the burden of being one of the best players to have never
won a major. Almost as quickly, a playoff win at Royal Birkdale put
a burden of a historical nature back on.
	   ``Anything's possible,'' O'Meara said of his chances. ``But if
you had told me at the beginning of the year that I would have the
opportunity to win two of them I would have jumped and prayed for
the chance to have that happen.''
	   If recent history is any guide, O'Meara might have to be content
with a green jacket in his closet and a British Open trophy on the
mantle for this year.
	   Since Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in 1953
_ the only majors he played in that year _ six players have come to
the PGA Championship with a chance to equal him. Pat Bradley won
three majors on the LPGA Tour in 1986.
	   Tom Watson came the closest, finishing four shots off the pace
after winning the Masters and British Open in 1977.
	   ``I think the odds are a little stacked against me,'' O'Meara
said.
	   If the odds don't favor O'Meara, they do favor the likes of Jim
Furyk, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood and David Duval.
	   All are chasing their first major wins and all are at the PGA,
where first-time major winners have been the norm since Jeff Sluman
won at Oak Tree in 1988.
	   Nine of the last 10 PGA champions have been first-time major
championship winners. Nick Price was one of them in 1992 and he was
the only exception when he won it again in 1994.
	   ``There's not really a good explanation for it,'' said defending
champion Davis Love III, who achieved his breakthrough at Winged
Foot a year ago. ``It's like why are some guys hitting home runs
this year. I don't know. Everybody's on the bandwagon, I guess.''
	   Love's win last year was the latest in a series of first time
majors winners that includes names such as John Daly, Payne Stewart
and Paul Azinger. It also includes the likes of 1990 winner Wayne
Grady, who has never won on the PGA Tour since, and Mark Brooks,
who has finished in the top 10 only once since winning two years
ago.

 &UR; UCI announces measures to crack down on doping &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with UCI statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ World cycling's governing body said
Thursday it will impose a ``medical follow-up'' for riders and a
new drug-detection system as part of a raft of new measures to
crack down on doping.
	   Teams will have their own dedicated doctors to ensure rules are
obeyed, and the International Cycling Union's medical commission
will review its list of banned substances, a statement from the
Lausanne-based organization said.
	   Earlier Thursday, the head of UCI said his organization will
establish the ``medical follow-up,'' to take effect from January
next year, since testing during races can't always detect forbidden
drugs. The statement said the move was supported by all parties
including riders.
	   ``We're not even going to increase the number of checks'' during
races, ``because the problem is with non-detectable products,'' UCI
President Hein Verbruggen told Europe 1 radio earlier Thursday from
Lausanne, where the federation is based.
	   But, he said, ``let's at least guarantee the health of the
riders.''
	   UCI said in the statement it would establish a new system to
detect the performance-enhancing hormone EPO, which would be
operated in collaboration with laboratories in Cologne, Germany and
Lausanne.
	   A group of six doctors has been created to study and discuss
``practical problems'' which surfaced during the Tour de France.
	   UCI said in its statement that the number of racing days for
riders was a problem, rather than an over-busy calendar. To solve
that, the idea of limiting the number of days to between 90 and 120
has been kept in mind and a ``definitive number'' will be
determined this year, the statement said.
	   The statement said a ``certain unhappiness'' among riders in the
Tour de France over the methods used by police during their
investigations was to a certain extent ``comprehensible.''
	   But the statement said: ``On the other hand, one must be
conscious of the fact that the primary responsibility lies with
those who have broken the laws.''
	   The statement said UCI has called on the national federations
concerned to establish disciplinary procedures against all those
implicated in the Tour de France doping scandal.
	   The Swiss national federation said Wednesday it had opened
proceedings which may result in sanctions against three Swiss
members of the Festina team. The team was expelled from the Tour.

Ajax Amsterdam files complaint with FIFA over Barcelona

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam has complained to
the world soccer group, FIFA, over FC Barcelona's attempt to
acquire twin soccer stars Frank and Ronald de Boer, Dutch
television reported Thursday.
	   The twins have been trying to terminate their contracts with
Ajax which run through 2004, but a arbitration commission ruled
last month that they must remain with the Dutch club.
	   According to earlier media reports, the two players were being
courted by the Spanish powerhouse, which was willing to pay dlrs 22
million to acquire them both.
	   A spokesman for Ajax was not immediately available for comment.
	   Despite the ruling by the arbitration commission, an end to the
labor squabble is still not in sight since both players are
determined to leave the club.
	   They have suggested the idea of enlisting a negotiator to
resolve the dispute.

Paper attacks inspectors as U.N. official arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with 12 grafs from U.N. envoy's comments, details. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An envoy of U.N. chief Kofi Annan urged the
Iraqi leadership Thursday to cooperate with arms monitors in their
inspection of banned weapons sites.
	   Prakash Shah met for more than an hour with Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Thursday night to try to defuse the latest
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   Prakash said he delivered a message from Annan to the Iraqi
leadership, stressing that Iraq must cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
	   Aziz and the U.N. envoy agreed to continue holding talks,
Prakash said after the meeting.
	   On Aug. 5, President Saddam Hussein announced that Iraq would no
longer cooperate with the commission in charge of ensuring the
country eliminates its biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   The weapons must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
will lift trade sanctions that ban air travel to and from the
country and limit sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
set off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``I mentioned to him (Aziz) that there is a unanimous view in
the council that Iraq should continue its coopeatation with the
U.N. and UNSCOM,'' Prakash said. ``The meeting, as always, was
cordial and friendly.'' He refused to give other details.
	   He said Aziz ``wanted to convey the Iraqi point of view, the
Iraqi concerns,'' of continued U.N. sanctions.
	   Earlier, Aziz dismissed claims by chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler and the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iraq
was trying to place restrictions on the inspectors. Aziz said the
arms monitors were given full access to 496 weapons sites.
	   In a letter to Danilo Turk, president of the U.N. Security
Council, Aziz said UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors were able to visit
these sites ``with no interference by the Iraqi side.'' The letter
was in response to one sent by Butler.
	   Butler had complained that Iraqi restrictions on arms inspectors
were making it impossible to ensure that Iraq was not reviving its
weapons programs.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fear ran rampant in Congo's capital on
Thursday as a power blackout throughout Kinshasa fed speculations
that rebel forces were advancing on the city.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen said rebel fighters had
captured the town of Inga, about 200 kilometers (135 miles) from
the capital, where the primary power transformer for Kinshasa is
located.
	   Heavy fighting was reported in Matadi, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) south of Inga, where authorities had earlier warned people
to stay indoors.
	   A commander in the rebel stronghold of Goma, eastern Congo, said
his forces had captured the Matadi airport and the Inga power
plant.
	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in the eastern city of
Goma.
	   ``The airport has fallen into our hands. Government troops have
dispersed. We are marching into town tonight,'' Ondekane said.
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that two Marine
amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic waters off
Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens living
there.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.
	   Congo government and rebel forces have both launched ambitious
radio campaigns claiming battlefield victories since Tutsi forces
launched the rebellion earlier this month.
	   But where earlier in the day state radio had been broadcasting a
steady campaign of propaganda against the rebels, by afternoon,
only static filled the air.
	   State radio was cut due to the lack power for its transmitter.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising, which has spread from Congo's eastern reaches to several
points southwest of the capital. Both countries vehemently deny
involvement in the rebellion.
	   As evening descended on Kinshasa, candlelight flickered from
small shops and apartment buildings along the city's main June 30th
Boulevard.
	   ``I'm starting to get really concerned,'' computer store owner
Deo Maneno said while locking up his shop. ``If it's the rebels who
have cut the power, this is really serious.''
	   A loud blast was heard by residents in central Kinshasa after
nightfall, although it was not clear what had made the sound.
Earlier in the day, unexplained scattered gunshots were heard in
several neighborhoods.

Fighters one step from challenging for WBC title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDUARDO MONTES &QC;

<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Sure, Rafael Ruelas is feeling the
butterflies.
	   After working at it for years, Ruelas is one step away from a
shot at the WBC super lightweight title and he admits he's a bit
nervous. But that's normal, he said Thursday.
	   ``It does happen once in a while, but it's not much,'' said
Ruelas. ``I'm pretty much at peace. It's a good feeling.''
	   In fact, Ruelas said he prefers situations like his upcoming
fight Saturday with Konstantin Tszyu, where the stakes are so high.
	   ``There is much more to win here,'' he said. ``(With a victory)
I get to fight for the title. That's a goal that I've be pursuing
for a little over three years now. All I have to do is defeat this
one guy.''
	   Ruelas, the WBC's No. 3-ranked contender, and No. 2 contender
Tszyu are fighting for the chance to go against Miguel Angel
Gonzalez for the vacant super lightweight championship. Gonzalez
also had been scheduled to fight on the card at the El Paso County
Coliseum, but pulled out because of an injury.
	   Tszyu (20-1-1), a former IBF junior lightweight champion, is
favored over Ruelas (52-3), himself a former IBF lightweight
champion.
	   But such things don't matter, Tszyu said.
	   ``I don't like predictions. I come here like every fighter,
believing I'm going to win,'' he said. '' I'm planning for 12 hard
rounds, which I can do without any problems. What is going to
happen is going to happen.''
	   Ruelas said he sees himself defeating Tszyu in fewer than 12
rounds.
	   ``I don't expect it to go the distance and the reason for that
is our styles, the fact that both of us are powerful fighters,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of KOs in both our records. We both enjoy
fighting close. I think it's going to be an action-packed fight.''
	   The pay-per-view card also includes WBC featherweight champion
Luisito Espinosa of the Philippines defending his title against
Juan Carlos Ramirez of Mexico in a scheduled 12-round bout.

Myanmar rejects UN chief's proposal for an envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Tightens; ADDS US also not allowed to observe situation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Myanmar has rejected the U.N. chief's
request that a special envoy be allowed to look into the human
rights situation in the country, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   In a letter to the government last week, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, the former president of
the General Assembly, be allowed to visit Myanmar at the end of the
week.
	   ``The response ... stated that there was no reason for such a
rushed visit,'' said U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt.
	   ``The secretary-general is disappointed by the response,'' he
said.
	   The United States, among others, had sought Annan's intervention
in the crisis to try to rally world opinion against the military
regime and its treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition party
leader and winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Myanmar's military government blocked a fresh attempt by Suu Kyi
on Wednesday to travel outside the capital to meet with members of
her political party, claiming the journey was ``unsafe.''
	   In Washington on Thursday, State Department spokesman James
Foley said Myanmar authorities had yet to agree to a U.S. request
for permission to observe the situation and to speak to Suu Kyi.
	   ``... we are gravely concerned about the health and safety of
Aung San Suu Kyi and hold Burmese (Myanmar) authorities responsible
for ensuring her health and welfare,'' Foley said.

Sampras wins; Krajicek, Ivanisevic lose
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's early play; will be updated &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Pete Sampras was the model of efficiency
Thursday in beating Jan-Michael Gambill 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 to move into
the quarterfinals of the dlrs 2.45 million ATP Championship.
	   Sampras overwhelmed Gambill in the first-set tiebreaker, winning
the first six points, then broke Gambill once in the second set and
served out the rest of the way.
	   ``He served big, I served big _ we played a lot of quick points,
not a lot of ground stroke rallies,'' said Gambill, 21, the
youngest American in the top 100 rankings.
	   ``My serve resembles his a little. I hope he doesn't mind
that.''
	   Gambill served 15 aces to 13 for Sampras. But Sampras
concentrated more on holding his serve and made only one serious
attempt to break Gambill.
	   In the fourth game of the second set, Gambill rushed the net
after winning the first point. Sampras hit a winner, passing
Gambill on his forehand side, then Gambill double-faulted and
Sampras won the next two points for the only break in the match.
	   ``That came at a time when I was starting to get a hold of his
serve a little better,'' Sampras said. ``It was the time to
capitalize on winning the first set.''
	   Vince Spadea advanced with his second upset of the tournament,
beating eighth-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-3.
Spadea ousted Andre Agassi on Wednesday night.
	   Because of the large number of upsets _ only four of the 16
seeded players remain _ bonus points in the field have been reduced
and Sampras will have to successfully defend his title to regain
the No. 1 ranking from Marcelo Rios of Chile.
	   Among the remaining seeds, No. 3 Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic beat No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 and
No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia defeated Scott Draper of
Australia 6-3, 6-3.
	   No. 5 Patrick Rafter of Australia had a late match against Todd
Martin.
	   Korda was down 5-2 in the third set before rallying.
	   ``My father always told me, `Fight to the last point; play to
the last point,' and that's just what I did,'' Korda said.
	   ``I just kept playing, putting balls over the net, trying to win
the match.''
	   Ivanisevic had beaten Korda in seven of their 10 previous
matches. But he has not played with confidence since losing to
Sampras in five sets at Wimbledon, and Thursday's match was a
replay of last week at Toronto.
	   ``I'm playing good tennis at the moment, but I don't need to
lose those kind of matches, like I lost last week against Agassi,''
Ivanisevic said. ``I'm hitting the ball well. And then last week, I
had the match in my hand and I gave him the match.''
	   In other matches, Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Jerome Golmard
of France 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2); Magnus Larsson of Sweden defeated
Tommy Haas of Germany 6-4, 6-4, and Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic beat Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-4.

Gov't lifts ban on sales of contraceptives produced by Germany's
</HEADLINE>
Schering

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The government Thursday lifted its
two-month ban on sales of a popular contraceptive produced by the
Brazilian subsidiary of German pharmaceutical giant Schering AG.
	   The ban was imposed June 20 when health authorities discovered
that placebo birth control pills produced by Schering had reached
the market, causing several unwanted pregnancies.
	   Some 20 women have reported becoming pregnant after taking what
they believed were Microvlar contraceptives. The tablets, made of
lactose, were intended solely to test out new packaging equipment.
They were supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but
were stolen and sold illegally.
	   A Schering spokesman said the company, which also also
manufactures drugs for prostate cancer and leukemia, had complied
with a government order to change Microvlar's packaging and had
recalled almost all its contraceptives on the market _ real and
placebo.
	   ``With the new packaging, consumers can have absolute confidence
that they're buying a legitimate product,'' the spokesman said.
	   Last week, a state prosecutor filed charges against the
company's chief executive officer, Rainer Bitzer, and its
industrial director, Valter Schenk, for violations of the consumer
protection law.
	   ``They are responsible for the company's failure to identify the
placebos as such, for failing to promptly notify authorities that
the tablets had been stolen, and for the distribution of a product
unfit for human consumption,'' Prosecutor Pedro Manoel Ramos said
at the time.
	   If a judge accepts the charges, Bitzer and Schenk will be tried
and could face prison terms of more than seven years.
	   Luiz Francisco Carvalho Filho, one of the lawyers on the
Schering defense team, said the judge is not expected to rule on
the case before next week.
	   The company is appealing a 2.9 million real (dlrs 2.5 million)
government fine for taking more than a month to notify health
authorities that the test contraceptives had been stolen.
	   Some 650,000 packages, containing 21 placebos each, were
manufactured. It is unclear how many packages were stolen and
distributed, or how the plan was carried out. Several people have
been questioned in connection with the theft, but no one has been
arrested.

Security Council condemns Taliban offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council condemned the recent
Taliban offensive in Afghanistan on Thursday and said it was deeply
concerned about reports of the religious militia's capture of
Iranians in a key northern city.
	   The 15-member council ``strongly warns the perpetrators of this
flagrant violation of recognized norms and principals of
international law against causing any further harm to their
captives,'' and demands their immediate release, said council
president Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   Iran says 11 Iranian diplomats, a correspondent of the Islamic
Republic News Agency and 32 Iranian truck drivers were captured by
the Taliban Saturday when they overran the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The seizure of the city marked a major victory in an offensive
that has brought the Taliban close to their goal of uniting all of
Afghanistan under the militia's strict brand of Islam that bars
women from work, girls from school and bans television and radio.
	   ``The Security Council expressed its grave concern at the
continuing escalation of the armed conflict in Afghanistan caused
by the Taliban forces' offensive in the northern parts of the
country,'' Turk said.
	   Council members ``condemn the complete disregard displayed by
the Taliban towards the will of the international community, and in
particular the statement of president of the Security Council of
Aug. 6 demanding an urgent and unconditional cease-fire leading to
a final end of hostilities,'' he said.

Muted Iraqi response could pave the way for tougher action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council postponed any formal
show of support Thursday morning for U.N. weapons inspectors in
Iraq despite recent complaints from head inspectors that their work
was being undermined by Iraq's decision to freeze cooperation with
the United Nations.
	   Rather than issuing a formal resolution or statement, however,
the council was considering sending letters to Richard Butler of
the U.N. Special Commission, and Mohamed el-Baradei of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, conveying support for their
work and stating that Iraq's actions were unacceptable, diplomats
said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Such a muted move was seen as trying to gain more unity within
the council, where Russia, China and France have traditionally
taken the most sympathetic line toward Iraq.
	   Already, France has indicated its displeasure with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein over the abrupt cessation of cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``This decision will do a disservice to Iraq's cause by slowing
down the accomplishment of the mandates conferred to the Special
Commission and the IAEA,'' according to a statement Thursday from
the French Foreign Ministry.
	   The French position could lead to a tougher council stand when
sanctions are up for review in October.
	   Sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil, were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted
once weapons inspectors have certified that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   If weapons inspectors can't get to sites to certify Iraqi
compliance, sanctions won't be lifted. A more patient, middle
ground reaction from the council would force Iraq to make the next,
conciliatory move if it wants sanctions removed, diplomats said.
	   But letters expressing support for inspectors could also give
weapons experts the go-ahead to attempt the kind of inspections
suspended last week, diplomats said. If inspectors were blocked in
violation of U.N. agreements, the council could then take a more
aggressive stand.
	   So far, U.N. inspectors haven't tested the Iraqi announcement
and were awaiting word from the council on whether to proceed with
inspections and request Iraqi escorts for visits to new sites, U.N.
officials said. According to Security Council resolutions, the
inspectors will not go out on spot searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   A top Iraqi official at Iraq's U.N. mission said his country's
decision is clear.
	   ``We will not send people to accompany you,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If they want to escalate the
situation then yes, this would be the next step.''

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Donovan Bailey, the Olympic gold medalist and
world record-holder at 100 meters, could be competing again in less
than two weeks, after tearing a muscle in his left thigh.
	   Bailey was injured at the Weltklasse meet in Zurich,
Switzerland, Wednesday night.
	   ``The good thing is the next race is still about two weeks away,
so we have a window here,'' Chris Layne, one of Bailey's agents,
said Thursday. ``Donovan is day-to-day and I'd guess that we'll
probably make a decision (on whether to compete again) in about a
week.''
	   Bailey originally had planned to compete at Lausanne,
Switzerland, Aug. 25 and at Berlin Sept. 1. There's also a meet at
Brussels, Belgium, Aug. 28, but Bailey hadn't decided whether to
run there.
	   ``Donovan's injury is one of those tricky ones,'' Layne said.
``It could heal quickly or be a nagging type thing.''
	   Bailey pulled up about 60 meters into the 100 final at Zurich,
jumping into the air in pain. The 1995 world champion lay on the
track for several minutes before being taken to a hospital for an
MRI, which revealed a slight muscle tear.
	   Bailey breezed into the final with a time of 10.06 seconds in
his preliminary heat.
	   ``He was ready to run a very good time,'' Layne said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council condemned the bombing
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Thursday and called
on all states to cooperate with authorities in finding those
responsible.
	   A resolution, co-sponsored by Kenya, Tanzania and the United
States and unanimously adopted, ``expresses its deep sorrow,
sympathy and condolences to the families of the innocent victims of
the terrorist bomb attacks at this difficult time.''
	   It strongly condemns the ``terrorist bomb attacks.'' And it
stresses that every nation ``has the duty to refrain from
organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist
acts in another state.''
	   The almost simultaneous attacks Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 257 people and
injured more than 5,500.
	   ``The incidents of Aug. 7 underscore that terrorists know no
boundaries, and that the suppression of international terrorism,
the arrest, the conviction and the punishment of its perpetrators
are essential to the maintenance of international peace and
security,'' said the U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. Drug Enforcement Administrator
Thomas A. Constantine Thursday expressed confidence in Colombia's
fight against drug trafficking.
	   Constantine flew in to meet President Andres Pastrana after
rebels destroyed an anti-narcotics base at Miraflores, 275 miles
(440 kilometers) south of Bogota.
	   Three police officers were killed, eight others were wounded and
54 became rebel prisoners in the assault last week on the base used
for aerial fumigation by U.S.-contracted pilots of coca plants, the
raw material for cocaine.
	   Constantine offered sympathy for the deaths and said he would
visit wounded officers before returning Thursday to Washington.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Impeached President Fernando Collor de
Mello has lost his latest and perhaps final bid to run for office
again this century.
	   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal on Wednesday night scratched
Collor from the ballot in October's presidential elections and
upheld a 1992 congressional decision that stripped him of his
political rights until the year 2000.
	   Collor was impeached for corruption in 1992 and senators revoked
his political rights for eight years. But in 1994 the Supreme Court
absolved him of corruption charges and Collor argued that he should
be allowed to run for office again.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Leftist presidential candidate Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva said Thursday that if he was elected foreign
capital would continue playing an important role in Brazil's
economy.
	   Lula, the principal challenger to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's bid for re-election on Oct.4, made his remarks at a
meeting with foreign correspondents.
	   He was responding to fears that a leftist government would wreak
havoc on the economy.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaraguan police have arrested 11
people suspected of planning to kidnap government officials and rob
banks, officials said Thursday.
	   The arrests on Wednesday were part of a sweeping crackdown on
armed criminal bands operating in northern Nicaragua, said Evenor
Gutierrez, police chief in Matagalpa, 130 kilometers (80 miles)
north of Managua.
	   Gutierrez said the arrests were a major blow to the suspects'
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces, known by its Spanish
initials FAR.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Taxi drivers protesting competition from
``pirate'' cabs blocked major roads leading into Mexico City on
Thursday, jamming morning traffic for nearly four hours.
	   More than a million motorists were delayed by the protest, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The taxi drivers from Mexico state, which borders the Mexico
City federal district, closed down highways and major avenues
leading into the capital from 7 a.m. to nearly 11 a.m.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican navy is trying to identify the
owners of 38 boats that U.S. authorities suspect have smuggled
drugs through the Caribbean, Mexico City newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The boats are believed to have carried drugs through Mexican
waters within the last month, Navy Secretary Adm. Jose Ramon
Lorenzo Franco told the daily Reforma.
	   Though the boats appear to have Mexican registration,
investigators have yet to identify any of the owners, perhaps
because the boats have been stolen and renamed, he said.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorities have arrested 20 elite
soldiers accused of smuggling immigrants and drugs through Mexico
City's airport, a published report said Thursday.
	   Captains and majors were among those arrested from the
military's Armed Group of Special Forces, the daily El Universal
reported, citing anonymous government sources.
	   Authorities also removed 60 other military personnel from the
group based at the capital's international airport, Universal said.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan police have arrested an
evangelical minister accused of stabbing to death a mentally ill
man while trying to exorcise a ``devil'' from him, a public
prosecutor said Thursday.
	   The minister, Reyes Aguilar Gonzalez, was arrested Wednesday in
Tapalapa, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Guatemala
City, and taken to a nearby prison, local prosecutor Hugo Rolando
Lopez said.
	   Aguilar is accused of killing Gustavo Aguilar Munoz last
November in Casillas, a town near Tapalapa. Lopez said the minister
stabbed the man while trying to ``remove the devil the possessed
Aguilar Munoz.''
	   Lopez said the victim actually suffered from mental illness.
	   Arrest warrants have been issued for three other evangelical
ministers in the case, Lopez said.

Kosovo talks team formed _ but without rebel army

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian
politician unveiled a new team Thursday to negotiate the future of
Kosovo with the Serb-led government, but failed to win the backing
of rebels fighting for independence for the province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been struggling
to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to stop
squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in Kosovo
made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or without the
rebels.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will meet Friday with the team to hammer out a negotiating platform
for what Hill said he hopes are imminent talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The five-member team is weighted with disciples of Ibrahim
Rugova, a pacifist supported by one branch of the Kosovo Liberation
Army and despised by others.
	   The KLA never responded to an invitation extended two weeks ago
to join the team, Hill said, apparently because it did not want to
work with Rugova.
	   Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the rebels will join
the negotiations once they see progress is being made toward
autonomy for Kosovo. One sign of progress, diplomats said, might be
the formation of a multiethnic police force in the province.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included'' in talks, Rugova said. He was surrounded by Hill
and representatives of the so-called Contact Group _ the United
States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision, with Vice
President Nikola Sainovic saying a Serb delegation has been ready
for months to resume talks, which broke off in May.
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring a version of the
self-rule he revoked from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear
what degree of autonomy Milosevic is willing to grant the province,
which some Serbs consider the medieval cradle of their national
identity.
	   In Belgium, NATO Secretary General Xavier Solana said, ``It is
very important that negotiations are taken forward quickly by both
sides in a spirit of cooperation.''
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million.
	   Since 1991, ethnic Albanians have sought independence from what
they call the oppression of the Milosevic regime. The Albanians
have declared a self-styled ``Republic of Kosovo'' and elected
Rugova president.
	   But Rugova's pacifist approach tried the patience of politicians
who broke with his party. Last year, the rebels started attacking
Serb police units. And on Feb. 28, Milosevic sent police and
military troops to crush the KLA.
	   Part of the problem has been the KLA itself, a secretive and
apparently disorganized band that has no single leader or main
headquarters.
	   Part of the KLA professes support for Rugova, and could
conceivably join peace talks eventually. But the rest of the KLA
could easily continue fighting, with funding and arms trickling
over the border from supporters in Albania, Germany and
Switzerland.
	   Just hours before Rugova announced his negotiating team, the KLA
announced its own six-member team of ``political representatives''
in a statement declaring its ``full trust'' in Adem Demaci, a
former political prisoner, to lead the rebel army in ``creating the
institutions of Kosovo.''

Republicans accused of plotting in Haiti

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The international arm of the U.S.
Republican Party is embroiled in a political storm in Haiti, where
its crusade for political pluralism is being condemned as support
for militarist right-wing parties.
	   Weeks of criticism of the International Republican Institute
culminated this week in a charge by the pro-government Haitian News
Network that the group ``aims at overthrowing the Haitian political
order.''
	   The claim reflects Haiti's tremendous sensitivity to U.S.
influence, especially at a time of scant political order. The
country has been reduced to abject poverty and for more than a year
has lacked an effective government.
	   The IRI has taken a leading role in trying to re-establish a
political party system. And in doing so, it has run afoul of
supporters of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who still
dominates politics and appears poised to return to power in 2000
elections. Aristide's camp contends that the IRI is funding
right-wing politicians who supported the 1991 army coup that ousted
him.
	   ``It will weaken, not strengthen democracy,'' said Gabriel
Fortune, a legislator who supports Aristide's policies. ``Everyone
knows that if today some political parties are trying to
destabilize _ it's thanks to IRI funding.''
	   Institute chairman Lorne Craner, on a visit Wednesday to
dedicate a Political Party Training Center, said the project will
``create a fair playing field for pluralist competition.''
	   Craner denies providing money to any parties, saying IRI
assistance is restricted to technical help _ seminars for local
parties to discuss topics like free elections, campaigning and
registration drives. Never in its previous assignments around the
world, the IRI says, has the institute generated such controversy
and divisiveness.
	   Three days after the IRI criticized Haiti's disputed April 1997
elections, a Haitian police SWAT team raided the home of the aunt
of the IRI's Haitian representative, Stanley Lucas.
	   ``I can't say if it's political, but there are too many
troubling coincidences. I feel very threatened,'' Lucas said,
adding that he'd been warned to be careful before the elections.
	   Most parties have boycotted ballots since chaotic 1995
legislative elections that critics _ and Republican election
monitors _ said were rigged to favor Aristide's heirs. Last year,
Premier Rosny Smarth resigned over an April legislative ballot,
lodging the same charges. Haiti has been without a premier for more
than a year.
	   Haiti's two largest parties, Aristide's Lavalas Family party and
Smarth's breakaway Struggling People's Organization, have both
declined to cooperate with the IRI. By default, the institute ends
up working with Haiti's 26 opposition parties, many small and from
the extreme right.
	   Last month, Aristide supporters broke up an IRI-arranged town
hall meeting in the western port of St. Marc, yelling that only
Aristide's party has a right to a voice in Haiti.
	   Haitians long have been suspicious of the United States, which
occupied their country from 1915 to 1934. Many suspect the CIA was
involved in the coup that ousted Aristide in 1991. But most
welcomed the 1995 invasion that halted an exodus of Haitian boat
people to Florida and toppled the murderous military regime.
	   That intervention reinstalled Aristide until his term ran out,
but the populist priest always had a testy relationship with the
United States.
	   The Republicans' fracas has caused other organizations to be
targeted as alleged tools of U.S. domination _ including the U.S.
Democratic Party's National Democratic Institute and the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   But the IRI has drawn the bulk of ire _ being accused by
Aristide sympathizers of supporting alleged plotters of unspecified
subversive acts _ for which police arrested nine people last month
and are seeking 15 others.
	   ``The allegations are completely false. They can only serve to
incite people to violence,'' U.S. Ambassador Timothy Michael Carney
said. Opposition politicians also reject the charges.
	   Haitian human rights activist Chenet Jean-Baptiste said he was
accused Monday of being an IRI hireling by armed Aristide partisans
who threatened to kill him.
	   The same day, the Haitian News Network broadcast its claim,
alleging that ``certain pieces of information lead one to believe
that a certain sector of the U.S. establishment supports (a
destabilization) movement through IRI.''

	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ In yet another bizarre turn of
events, Mike Tyson withdrew his application Thursday for a New
Jersey boxing license, hours before regulators were to rule on it.
	   The reason was not immediately known. Tyson's lawyer, Anthony
Fusco Jr., who made the announcement, said he was told by a member
of the boxer's camp to withdraw the application. He wouldn't say
who told him.
	   ``The message was from Mr. Tyson that he has decided to withdraw
his application,'' Fusco said. ``He asked me to respect his wishes
and not make any comment or speculation. As his lawyer, I have to
do that.''
	   Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for State Attorney General Peter
Verniero, confirmed that Tyson's application had been withdrawn.

	   The state Athletic Control Board was scheduled to decide Friday
whether Tyson could return to the ring in New Jersey. He was banned
from boxing last year for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a
title fight in Las Vegas.
	   At a July 29 hearing before the board, Tyson apologized for
biting Holyfield and presented a parade of character witnesses who
urged regulators to give him another chance.
	   But at the end of the hearing, Tyson got angry and refused to
read a closing statement. Then he cursed in front of regulators.

	   The Athletic Control Board, which heard nearly four hours of
testimony from Tyson and his supporters last month, was to vote on
whether Tyson possesses the ``good character, honesty, integrity

	   Several boxing industry insiders have criticized Tyson for not
applying for a license in Nevada, the state that revoked it after

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The driver was only for show.
	   Tiger Woods couldn't attack tree-lined Sahalee Country Club from
the tee in the first round of the PGA Championship, so he left his
biggest weapon in the bag and found another one _ his putter.
	   Striding confidently to the hole as each putt dropped for
birdie, Woods once again got into contention at a major on Thursday
by shooting a course record 4-under 66 for the early lead.
	   ``I'm not going to put any more pressure on myself because I'm
near the lead,'' said Woods, who had the first-round lead at the
British Open and finished third. ``Three more days is an
eternity.''
	   On perfect rolling greens in still, sunny conditions, Glen Day
made an early charge with birdies on the first four holes. He was
at 5 under with four holes to play.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
season, got off to a rocky start with bogeys on two of the first
three holes.
	   But O'Meara is all about great finishes, and he once again found
a way to hang around the lead. He played bogey-free the rest of the
way and finished with a 69.
	   Russ Cochran, Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden and 1986 PGA
champion Bob Tway all finished at 69. Nick Price, playing his best
since 1994 when he won the British Open and his second PGA title,
wasted strong iron play by missing several birdie putts and
finished at 70.
	   Woods hasn't won a major since the 1997 Masters, where he was
fearless with the driver on an Augusta National course that
features generous, rough-free fairways.
	   Sahalee doesn't allow for that, not with its towering firs and
cedars that spread their limbs to the edge of fairways and swat
errant shots into ankle-deep rough.
	   Woods found that out right away when he blocked his 2-iron into
the right rough, hacked out into rough around the green and took a
bogey. But his round turned in his favor quickly when he got away
with a mistake.
	   Woods had 220 yards (200 meters) to the green on the par-5
second hole and aimed conservatively to the middle. But he hung his
3-iron out to the right _ straight at the flag, but directly over
the water.
	   ``I thought for sure the ball was wet,'' he said.
	   It cleared the water by about 6 feet (1.8 meters) and wound up
on the fringe, where Woods got up and down for a birdie.
	   ``From there, I felt at ease with myself,'' he said.
	   The rest of the round was simply a careful walk down the
treacherous, tight fairways of Sahalee. Woods never went on the
attack until he got to the greens.
	   Of his seven birdies, only two of them were inside 15 feet (4
1/2 meters) _ a wedge that landed right behind the hole at No. 10
and spun back 4 feet (1.2 meters) and a 30-yard (27-meter) pitch to
2 feet (0.6 meters) on the par-5 11th.
	   Throughout the day, Woods kept one thought in the back of his
head.
	   ``Hang in there, be patient, hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and give myself a chance,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit
the ball in the center of the green and attack from there.''
	   Putting is what plagued Woods more than anything at the U.S.
Open, where he had two four-putts, and at Royal Birkdale, where he
opened with a 65 and closed with a 66 to finish one-stroke out of a
playoff at the British Open.
	   ``It wasn't the greatest ball-striking round, but I made a lot
of putts,'' said Woods, who took just 27 putts in breaking Jack
Nicklaus' course-record 67, set at a 1984 exhibition.
	   ``It's perfect out there. The greens are perfect. You start the
ball on line, and you just starting walking. You know it's going to
go in the hole.''
	   Even with 2-irons and a 3-wood off the tee, Woods was far from
perfect. He made all three of his bogeys after missing the fairway
_ although one of them was a three-putt from fringe on No. 14.
	   But he proved that he is a quick study on knowing when to
attack, and when to wait for the course to come to him. Woods was
never suckered into going after pins tucked between contours around
the edges of the green. He had great control of his distance and
often left himself putts below the cup.
	   And while he gives up one advantage by leaving his driver in the
bag, he still has length with every other club.
	   ``My length is definitely a huge advantage on this course,'' he
said. ``I'm able to hit 2-irons, 3-woods and some guys have to hit
driver.''
	   Sahalee managed to frustrate others.
	   David Duval, the Masters runner-up who has finished no worse
than 11th in the majors this year, had a triple bogey and a double
bogey on the back nine, and then birdied the 18th for a 76.
	   Tom Watson, trying to win the only major keeping him from the
career grand slam, was tentative with the putter in his round of
72.

Muted Iraqi response could pave the way for tougher action

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council postponed any formal
show of support Thursday for U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq
despite recent complaints from head inspectors that their work was
being undermined by Iraq's decision to freeze cooperation with the
United Nations.
	   Rather than issuing a formal resolution or statement, however,
the council was considering sending letters to Richard Butler of
the U.N. Special Commission, and Mohamed el-Baradei of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, conveying support for their
work and stating that Iraq's actions were unacceptable, diplomats
said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Such letters could give weapons experts the go-ahead to attempt
the kind of inspections suspended last week, diplomats said. If
inspectors were blocked in violation of U.N. agreements, the
council could then take a more aggressive stand.
	   The council was expected to take up the issue again next week.
	   The relatively muted move of sending letters was also seen as an
attempt to gain more unity within the council, where Russia, China
and France have traditionally taken a sympathetic line toward Iraq.
	   Already, France has indicated its displeasure with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein over the abrupt cessation of cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``This decision will do a disservice to Iraq's cause by slowing
down the accomplishment of the mandates conferred to the Special
Commission and the IAEA,'' according to a statement Thursday from
the French Foreign Ministry.
	   The French position could lead to a tougher council stand when
sanctions are up for review in October.
	   Sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil, were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted
once weapons inspectors have certified that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   If weapons inspectors can't get to sites to certify Iraqi
compliance, sanctions won't be lifted. A less aggressive approach
by the council would force Iraq to make the next, conciliatory move
if it wants sanctions lifted, some diplomats said.

Woods stays out of the woods for early lead at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Day in at 68; quotes from Woods, O'Meara, Love;
other scoring; will be updated &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The driver was only for show.
	   Tiger Woods couldn't attack tree-lined Sahalee Country Club from
the tee in the first round of the PGA Championship, so he left his
biggest weapon in the bag and found another one _ his putter.
	   Striding confidently to the hole as each putt dropped for
birdie, Woods once again got into contention at a major on Thursday
by shooting a course record 4-under 66 for the early lead.
	   ``What did it look like? A lot of rough, a lot of trees,'' Woods
said. ``But overall, I saw a lot of putts go in the hole. And
that's definitely not a bad thing.''
	   It was the second great start in a major for Woods. He shared
the first-round lead in the British Open with a 65 and wound up
third, one stroke out of a playoff.
	   ``I'm not going to put any more pressure on myself because I'm
near the lead,'' he said. ``Three more days is an eternity.''
	   Sahalee, carved out of a forest 29 years ago, has never
entertained so many great players at once, and the course was
holding its own. With nearly half of the first round completed,
just 29 players were under par.
	   Glen Day was the only one to get as low as 5-under, but he gave
it back with a three-putt double bogey on No. 15 and a bogey on the
18th for a 68, tied with Bob Estes.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
season, got off to a rocky start with bogeys on two of the first
three holes.
	   But O'Meara is all about great finishes, and he once again found
a way to hang around the lead. He played bogey-free the rest of the
way and finished with a 69.
	   ``I was very relaxed out there because I've got nothing to lose.
I've already got two majors,'' O'Meara said. ``I hope I can use
that experience to carry me through. I played very well on the back
nine after kind of a shaky start. I was very proud of that.''
	   Also at 69 was 1986 PGA champion Bob Tway, Steve Stricker and
Kenny Perry, who lost the PGA in a playoff to Mark Brooks at
Valhalla two years ago.
	   Nick Price, playing his best since 1994 when he won the British
Open and his second PGA title, wasted strong iron play by missing
several birdie putts and finished at 70, along with Justin Leonard,
Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw and defending champion Davis Love
III.
	   ``It was a very bad ball-striking round on a day when the course
will play the easiest it will ever play,'' said Love, trying to
become the first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute in 1937.
	   Woods hasn't won a major since the 1997 Masters, in which he was
fearless with the driver on an Augusta National course that
features generous, rough-free fairways.
	   Sahalee doesn't allow for that, not with its towering firs and
cedars that spread their limbs to the edge of fairways and swat
errant shots into ankle-deep rough.
	   Woods found that out right away when he blocked his 2-iron into
the right rough on the first hole, hacked out into rough around the
green and took a bogey. But his round turned in his favor quickly
when he got away with a mistake.
	   Woods had 220 yards (200 meters) to the green on the par-5
second hole and aimed conservatively to the middle. But he hung his
3-iron out to the right _ straight at the flag, but directly over
the water.
	   ``I thought for sure the ball was wet,'' he said.
	   It cleared the water by about six feet and wound up on the
fringe, where Woods got up and down for a birdie.
	   ``From there, I felt at ease with myself,'' he said.
	   The rest of the round was simply a careful walk down the
treacherous, tight fairways of Sahalee.
	   Woods didn't go on the attack until he got to the greens. Of his
seven birdies, only two were inside 15 feet (4 1/2 meters) _ a
wedge that landed right behind the hole at No. 10 and spun back 4
feet (1.2 meters) and a 30-yard (27-meter) pitch to 2 feet (0.6
meters) on the par-5 11th.
	   Throughout the day, Woods kept one thought in the back of his
head.
	   ``Hang in there, be patient, hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and give myself a chance,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit
the ball in the center of the green and attack from there.''
	   Putting is what plagued Woods more than anything in the U.S.
Open, in which he had two four-putts, and at Royal Birkdale.
	   Even with 2-irons and a 3-wood off the tee, Woods was far from
perfect. He made all three of his bogeys after missing the fairway
_ although one of them was a three-putt from fringe on No. 14.
	   But he proved that he is a quick study on knowing when to
attack, and when to wait for the course to come to him. Woods was
never suckered into going after pins tucked between contours around
the edges of the green. He had great control of his distance and
often left himself putts below the cup.
	   Sahalee shot down so many others.
	   David Duval, the Masters runner-up who has finished no worse
than 11th in the majors this year, had a triple bogey and a double
bogey on the back nine, and then birdied the 18th for a 76.
	   The headliners from the U.S. Open also shot 76 _ champion Lee
Janzen didn't make a single birdie, while runner-up Payne Stewart
had two double bogeys on the back.
	   Straight-hitting Jim Furyk had a 2-over 72, along with Tom
Watson. Nick Faldo was at 73.

Tyson withdraws N.J. application for license; asks Nevada instead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike Tyson withdrew his application
for a New Jersey boxing license on Thursday, hours before
regulators were to rule on it, and instead asked Nevada for another
chance to fight.
	   The reason for the sudden change was not immediately known.
Tyson's lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., said he was told by a member of
the boxer's camp to withdraw the application.
	   ``The message was from Mr. Tyson that he has decided to withdraw
his application,'' Fusco said. ``He asked me to respect his wishes
and not make any comment or speculation. As his lawyer, I have to
do that.''
	   Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter
Verniero, confirmed that Tyson's application had been withdrawn.
	   Nevada boxing regulators banned Tyson last year for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during a title fight in Las Vegas.
	   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic
Commission, said he received a letter from Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel on Thursday asking the commission to meet to decide whether
to give the boxer a new license. The commission will meet within
two to three weeks to discuss the application, Ratner said.
	   Instead of reapplying in Nevada after a mandatory one-year wait,
Tyson had asked the New Jersey state Athletic Control Board to let
him return to the ring in that state, a move criticized by some as
an attempt to get around Nevada's ban. The New Jersey board was to
decide Friday.
	   At a hearing before the board last month, Tyson apologized for
biting Holyfield on June 28, 1997, and presented a parade of
character witnesses who urged regulators to give him another
chance. But at the end of the hearing, Tyson got angry, refused to
read a closing statement and cursed in front of regulators.
	   Critics welcomed Tyson's change of heart.
	   ``I think it would have had more meaning if they (the board) had
said no to the license,'' said Bear Atwood, president of the
National Organization for Women's state chapter.
	   A spokesman for New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco,
who had opposed Tyson's licensing in New Jersey, also applauded the
move.
	   ``It's very important that the states maintain the reciprocity
arrangement with regard to disciplinary actions,'' Joe Mahoney
said. ``We're going to continue to try to build greater solidarity
among them.''

Teachers share ideas at U.S. Virgin Islands conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ They built houses
out of modeling clay and noodles, surfed the Internet and dissected
diapers.
	   But they weren't kids at play _ they were school teachers, 100
of them from all parts of the Caribbean, and they were learning new
ways of teaching science and math concepts to youngsters.
	   During a 10-day seminar at the University of the Virgin Islands,
teachers from 13 Caribbean Community nations gathered to share
ideas for livening up elementary school classrooms. The seminar
ended Thursday.
	   ``Children are born with lots of curiosity ... and the real goal
of a school teacher in my mind is to nurture that and not to turn
it off,'' said program coordinator Frank Reinhart. ``The only way
you can do that is to do activities that are exciting and
interesting.''
	   The seminar is known as Project SMILE _ for Science and
Mathematics Integrated Learning Experience _ and is sponsored by
the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology.
	   During one day, teachers built buildings out of bread sticks,
pasta and modeling clay, then shook them to see if they could
survive an ``earthquake.'' Another day, they took apart disposable
diapers to see how they work.
	   Teachers also learned to use the World Wide Web to find lesson
plans and teaching resources.
	   The idea is get students more involved in learning and boost
their confidence, teachers said.
	   ``Their self-concept builds a lot more because they become part
of their learning experience, not the student that just sits and
becomes passive in the classroom,'' said Jacqueline Davis, a sixth
grade teacher from the U.S. Virgin Islands.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Sumitomo Trust takes an ampersand in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan must ensure that its top banks, especially
those with interests abroad, don't abruptly fail, Bank of Japan
Governor Masaru Hayami warned.
	   ``A sudden failure of top 19 banks must be avoided at all costs,
particularly ones that have overseas exposure,'' Hayami said.
	   Hayami, speaking at a press conference Thursday, said that
sudden failures of big banks could trigger unexpected ripple
effects, though he didn't elaborate what they might be.
	   Hayami also said that merger was one option for financially
weaker banks on the verge of collapsing.
	   He said that the central bank supports the plan announced by the
ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co. to merge.
	   ``I strongly hope that their merger talks will proceed quickly.
I sincerely wish them success with their merger,'' he said.
	   Struggling, debt-plagued LTCB has seen its share price fall
drastically over the past several months, trading well below 100
(69 U.S. cents) yen a share.
	   Share prices below that level are ordinarily seen as a warning
sign of a company's imminent demise. The merger talks with Sumitomo
Trust are widely assumed to have been coordinated as a virtual
bailout for LTCB.
	   In trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday, LTCB's share
price closed down 1 yen at 41 yen (28 cents).
	   Hayami also reiterated that it is important for banks to step up
disclosure of information regarding their financial standing.
	   ``They won't regain confidence (of the markets) unless they
disclose information and erase bad debts from their balance sheets
or build up reserves for writing off bad debts,'' Hayami said.
	   Japan's banks are burdened with an estimated 80 trillion yen
(dlrs 548 billion) in bad debts, most left over from the collapse
of a speculative land market boom in the 1980s.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators said Thursday they have
found fragments of a vehicle that carried the bomb used in the
deadly attack on the U.S. Embassy and interrogated five suspects.
FBI agents ``have been successful, we think, in identifying certain
parts of the delivery vehicle'' that exploded in Nairobi on Aug. 7,
said FBI special agent Sheila Horan. Nearly simultaneous bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500. Among those killed
were 12 Americans, all in Nairobi. In the United States, President
Bill Clinton watched the flag-draped caskets of 10 of the Americans
arrive home Thursday. An Air Force plane flew the bodies home via
Germany, landing at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington,
where Clinton and the first lady met privately with families of
those killed and wounded. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian
politician unveiled a new team Thursday to negotiate the future of
Kosovo with the Serb-led government, but failed to win the backing
of rebels fighting for independence for the province. U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been struggling to persuade
ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to stop squabbling and join
forces, said the ongoing violence in Kosovo made it imperative to
start talks immediately _ with or without members of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will meet Friday with the team to hammer out a
negotiating platform for imminent talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's
decision, with Vice President Nikola Sainovic saying a Serb
delegation has been ready for months to resume talks, which broke
off in May. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fear ran rampant in Congo's capital on
Thursday as a power blackout throughout Kinshasa fed speculations
that rebel forces were advancing on the city. Western diplomats and
rebel spokesmen said rebel fighters had captured the town of Inga,
about 200 kilometers (135 miles) from the capital, where the
primary power transformer for Kinshasa is located. Heavy fighting
was reported in Matadi, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of
Inga, where authorities had earlier warned people to stay indoors.
The claims could not be independently confirmed. Congo government
and rebel forces have both launched ambitious radio campaigns
claiming battlefield victories since Tutsi forces launched the
rebellion earlier this month. But state radio's broadcasts were cut
by the afternoon due to the lack power for its transmitter. (CONGO)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An envoy of U.N. chief Kofi Annan urged the
Iraqi leadership Thursday to cooperate with arms monitors in their
inspection of banned weapons sites. Prakash Shah met for more than
an hour with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Thursday night
to try to defuse the latest crisis over weapons inspections.
Prakash said he delivered a message from Annan to the Iraqi
leadership, stressing that Iraq must cooperate with weapons
inspectors. Aziz and the U.N. envoy agreed to continue holding
talks, Prakash said after the meeting. On Aug. 5, President Saddam
Hussein announced that Iraq would no longer cooperate with the
commission in charge of ensuring the country eliminates its
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles. (IRAQ)
	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ Three Russian cosmonauts, including
President Boris Yeltsin's former security adviser, blasted off
Thursday for the second-to-last mission to the Mir space station.
The Soyuz TM-28 ship was launched as scheduled at 1:43 p.m. (0943
GMT) from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan and entered its
designated orbit nine minutes later. The Soyuz is expected to dock
with Mir on Saturday. It carries a three-man crew consisting of
former presidential advisor Yuri Baturin, flight commander Sergei
Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka. Baturin, a 49-year old former
secretary of Yeltsin's security and defense councils, is a space
physicist by training. He concentrated on preparation for the space
flight after Yeltsin ousted him earlier this year and lost 12
kilograms (more than 26 pounds) to get into shape. (RUSSIA-MIR)

rebound, but the market held steady in the face of another day of
panicky selling overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
93.46 points _ or 1.1 percent _ to 8,459.50, halting a rally that
began Tuesday afternoon at the bottom of a 258-point plunge.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A slump in auto sales reflecting the General
Motors strike in July produced the worst decline in retail sales in
15 months. Outside of autos, sales were about average. Sales fell
0.4 percent from the month before, to a seasonally adjusted dlrs
224.7 billion, after rising just 0.1 percent in June, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But the drop wasn't as steep as
economists expected. Auto sales dropped 3 percent, to dlrs 59
billion, also the worst decrease since April 1997. Sales of all
other retail goods, however, rose 0.5 percent _ in line with the
average so far this year. They had edged 0.1 percent lower in June.
The nearly-two-month GM strikes ended late in July, not in time to
prevent a 9 percent sales slump for the company, compared with the
previous July. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government and Central Bank officials tried
Thursday to parry investors' growing panic over the Russian ruble's
stability with assurances that the currency would not be devalued.
As the ruble continued to slide and the stock market to plunge,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko dismissed the markets' free-fall as
a ``psychological reaction'' rather than one caused by economic
developments in the country. The stock market fell 6.5 percent, to
close at 101.17 points. The ruble ended sharply lower amid
continued fear of bank defaults and further instability of the
ruble. Officials from the world's seven wealthiest nations _ the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada _
held a telephone conference call with Russian authorities to
discuss the financial turmoil in Russia. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election-year plan
to push the country's long-term unemployed off welfare by
subsidizing low-paying jobs came under immediate fire Thursday from
unions, employers _ and even some in his own governing coalition.
The plan presented by Labor Minister Norbert Bluem subsidizes wages
for employers who take on the long-term jobless in order to boost
low pay to 73 percent of an employee's previous income.
Unemployment benefits, in contrast, pay out only 53 percent of
former income. Some 1.35 million long-term unemployed _ out of a
total of more than 4 million _ would be eligible. Unemployment _ at
nearly 11 percent in July _ has been the core issue ahead of
Germany's Sept. 27 parliamentary election, with each side arguing
over the best way to bring it down. (GERMANY-JOBLESS)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Aegon NV, one of the world's top
10 insurance companies, said Thursday its net profit in the first
half of the year rose 45 percent to 1.31 billion guilders (dlrs 655
million), partly because of strong gains by U.S.-based Providian.
The results were at the low end of expectations, but were
nonetheless up sharply from the 906 million guilder (dlrs 453
million) net profit posted for the same period a year ago. Aegon
said its net profit for all of 1998 should increase by 25 percent
and projected earnings per share for the year to rise by 20
percent. (NETHERLANDS-EARNS-AEGON)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Paris area is the biggest economic region in
the European Union, though it lags behind Hamburg and four other
regions in per capita production, according to a French government
study published Thursday. With 5 percent of the EU's gross domestic
product and 3 percent of its population, the so-called
``Ile-de-France'' region that includes Paris ranks No. 1 among 196
European regions, said the national statistics agency Insee. The
Paris region was followed by the Lombardy region that includes
Milan, with 3.2 percent of the EU's GDP, and Greater London, with
2.7 percent of EU GDP, according to the most recent comparative
figures, compiled from 1994, Insee said. (FRANCE-EU-ECONOMIC

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Look for the original John Steed in the movie
remake of ``The Avengers.''
	   Patrick Macnee, who played the dapper Steed on the TV series,
said he has a cameo role in the movie starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma
Thurman as Emma Peel and Sean Connery as the villain.
	   Macnee wouldn't reveal his role ahead of Friday's opening.
	   ``It's supposed to be a secret,'' he said in Thursday's Los
Angeles Times.
	   Macnee didn't offer Fiennes any pointers: ``You don't give the
man who has won a Tony for `Hamlet' advice on how to play John
Steed.''

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Rolling Stones arrived Thursday in
Warsaw, which hosted their first concert in the former Soviet bloc
more than three decades earlier.
	   The group will play one show in Poland at the nation's biggest
stadium in Chorzow, 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Warsaw,
on Friday night. Fans from neighboring Czech Republic and Slovakia
are expected to join Poles in the 60,000-capacity stadium.
	   In 1967, the group received permission to play in Warsaw because
a granddaughter of then-Communist Party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka
was a fan. A similar application to perform in Moscow that year was
rejected.
	   On Tuesday, the band played in Moscow for the first time.
	   The tour is promoting the band's latest album, ``Bridges to
Babylon.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French hotel is offering tourists a chance to
relive Princess Diana's last moments, from the Ritz Hotel where she
dined to the site of the car crash and finally, the hospital where
she was pronounced dead.
	   For an extra fee, the Hotel Odeon at Saint-Germain-des-Pres
offers private tours in a dark Mercedes _ the kind of car that
slammed into a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel nearly a year
ago, killing Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
	   French tourism officials called the plan ``unfortunate and
opportunistic.''
	   Emile Cacciari, manager at the Hotel Odeon, said his guests _
about 85 percent of them American _ are eager to visit the sites.
	   Van tours start next Monday and run through Aug. 31, the first
anniversary of Diana's death. They're free to Odeon guests and dlrs
25 for others. A ride in a Mercedes will cost dlrs 67.
	   Cacciari said the money would be donated to the Princess Diana
Memorial Fund. But a spokeswoman said Thursday that the fund would
refuse it.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her British television debut, the Duchess of
York will host her own talk show on Sky TV, the station said
Thursday.
	   Starting Oct. 5, the former Sarah Ferguson, or ``Fergie,'' will
present 10 one-hour programs on Sky One provisionally entitled
``Surviving Life,'' Sky said.
	   The 50,000 pounds (dlrs 80,000) she earns will go to her
favorite charities, it said.
	   Recording begins in September and the duchess will be dealing
with different topics in each show in front of a small studio
audience.
	   Fergie, who was divorced from Prince Andrew in 1996, has
frequently appeared in TV commercials in the United States and on
chat shows.
	   To help pay off a massive overdraft, she made commercials,
became a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers and has recently started
interviewing celebrities for Hello!, a European weekly that
features the lives of the stars.
	   In a statement, the duchess said her show ``will be about people
and the real problems that they face in society today.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The Taliban chief and the U.N. aid
worker met for four hours. When they emerged, it was as if they had
been in different rooms all that time.
	   Taliban Planning Minister Khalid Din Mohammed told reporters
after the closed-door session earlier this month that he and Bronek
Szynalski were close to resolving a dispute between international
aid groups and Afghanistan's zealously Islamic leaders. A somber
Szynalski said next to no progress had been made on how to get the
groups back to work.
	   The aid dispute persists, as does the gulf of understanding
between the Taliban _ whose name means ``students of Islam'' _ and
much of the rest of the world.
	   With a series of advances in recent days into the northern
Afghan territory of their enemies, the Taliban are near their goal
of bringing the entire country under an interpretation of Islam
that spurns outside influences.
	   ``The Taliban's stance is very rigid,'' said Ghairat Baheer,
Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan before the Taliban captured
Kabul, the capital, two years ago and sent their own envoy to
Islamabad.
	   ``They don't believe in give-and-take, they don't believe in
being part of the international community. They don't know they're
living in the 20th century.''
	   Foreign aid workers and hundreds of Afghan families, fearing a
decisive Taliban assault was imminent, fled Thursday from what
little territory remains in the hands of the anti-Taliban alliance.
	   Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president the Taliban ousted from Kabul
in 1996, said a guerrilla war against the Taliban would continue,
the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
	   In the 90 percent or so of Afghanistan the Taliban control,
women risk being whipped by religious police if they venture out
without a head-to-toe veil known as a burqa.
	   Girls' schools have been closed, including home schools that
international aid groups had tried to run quietly. Restrictions on
women's work and movements, which seem more rooted in rural
traditions than the Koran, have made it difficult for women to seek
medical treatment or even the bread distributed by aid agencies.
	   ``Such discrimination and the suffering it causes constitute an
affront to the dignity and worth of Afghan women, and humanity as a
whole,'' the independent Physicians for Human Rights says.
	   The Taliban accuse aid workers of flouting Afghan laws and
traditions. About 200 aid workers who had refused Taliban orders to
move to war-ravaged dormitories in Kabul were expelled last month.
	   Taliban officials say international organizations are welcome to
help Afghanistan develop, but only if they obey the country's laws
and respect its traditions.
	   They have said their edicts are aimed at preventing outside
influences such as music and television from corrupting people and
distracting them from prayer.
	   The Taliban also have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan _
which has been in conflict since a series of military and communist
coups in the 1960s _ by subduing enemies they describe as ``evil
and corrupt.''
	   ``If the Taliban take all of Afghanistan, we will have peace in
the country,'' John Aziz, a driver in Kabul, said Thursday. ``But
the Taliban should pay attention to education and the country's
economy. If they destroy the schools or universities, we will see a
very black future for the next generation.''
	   Baheer doubts that the Taliban, who have little diplomatic or
bureaucratic experience, will be able to run Afghanistan. But he
says the administration he represented, less a government than
enemies grudgingly banded together because they all wanted a piece
of power, bears some of the blame for the Taliban's success.
	   The Taliban emerged in 1994 in southern Afghanistan, many of
their leaders schooled in religious institutions in neighboring
Pakistan that emphasized the infallibility of the Koran, the Muslim
holy book.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, denies widespread
accusations Pakistan has armed the Taliban. Aziz cast his country _
one of the few to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate
rulers _ as a friendly adviser trying to persuade its neighbor to
improve human rights and soften its approach to the outside world.
	   ``Once the fighting phase is over, we will see the better side
of the Taliban,'' Aziz said.

Overview of Taliban background and edicts

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The Taliban's vision of Afghanistan would make it a land without
kite-flying or Western names, populated by women in head-to-toe
veils and men in beards.
	   Poised to control all of Afghanistan after four years of war,
the Taliban have expressed their strict version of Islam in a
series of edicts, such as one instructing parents who had given
their children names such as ``Rita'' or ``Victor'' to change them
to something more Islamic.
	   Others covered kite-flying _ seen as a waste of time better
spent at prayer _ the veils for women known as burqas and the
beards that denote a good Muslim man.
	   Infractions of the lesser rules can bring beatings. More serious
offenders _ murderers, alcoholics, thieves _ face punishments
ranging from hanging to whipping to having a limb cut off, often
meted out before crowds in sports stadiums.
	   More progressive Muslims say the Taliban version of Islam has
more to do with tribal traditions than the Koran.
	   Many Taliban studied in small, conservative religious schools in
neighboring Pakistan. The movement is strongest in rural southern
Afghanistan. Even after taking Kabul, the capital, the Taliban
military headquarters remains 280 miles (450 kms) south in the city
of Kandahar.
	   The Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who has
declared himself Amir-ul Momaneen _ King of the Faithful _ wields
absolute power.

Latin American soaps invade Romania with sudsy passion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BUC101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OCNA MURES, Romania (AP) _ The workers in a Transylvania
cornfield lay down their tools as if on cue and hurry back to their
houses. ``Let's go, it's starting!'' the cry goes up.
	   Minutes later, women and men alike sit transfixed in front of TV
screens watching beautiful people half a world away act out a drama
of heartache and passion. Hoeing the fields can wait _ the Mexican
soap opera ``Esmeralda'' cannot.
	   Similar scenes take place every day across Romania, a nation of
23 million where soaps recently have become a national obsession.
	   A passion for soap operas is hardly unique. But something about
the melodrama of Latin American soaps in particular seems to have
touched an especially deep chord in Romanians.
	   The shows are subtitled, but the common Latin roots of both
languages help many Romanians _ particularly the elderly with
impaired eyesight _ to understand the programs.
	   Television stations are deluged with thousands of letters each
month from viewers begging for more soap operas or asking how the
plots turn out. Bucharest ambulance crews, glued to their soaps,
were arriving so late to emergency calls that staff TVs were
removed.
	   The TV death of a prominent character was front-page news this
month in a Bucharest paper, which said it ``shatters millions of
Romanian women.''
	   ``They like to see, at least on screen, the love and tenderness
they want to have in their own lives,'' sociologist Diana Andrei
says of the soapaholics, most of them female.
	   Soap operas first appeared in Romania after the anti-communist
revolt of 1989. But they didn't proliferate until recent months,
after a change in broadcasting law decreed that there be less
violence and sex on TV _ making soaps more attractive for stations.
There are at least three a day now on all state and private
channels.
	   Unlike U.S. soaps, which have been criticized for including too
much sex, these soaps usually involve complicated and mostly
platonic plots about winning the love of the main female character.
	   Although American programs like ``The Young and the Restless''
are also popular, it's the South American and Central American
soaps that really have caught on.
	   Especially ``Esmeralda,'' the story of a beautiful blind woman
who recovers her vision and has two doctors passionately in love
with her.
	   Many women among the millions of faithful Romanian viewers,
Andrei says, adore the star character played by Leticia Calderon so
much that they emulate her hairdo and fashion style.
	   Beauticians and manicurists at one Bucharest salon ask clients
to wait for five minutes while they catch a glimpse of the show.
	   ``We schedule our lives around 'Esmeralda,''' says Alinda Dudu,
a 26-year-old architect in the capital, noting that a plumber
refused to come fix her broken pipe because the show was on.
	   The soap causes ripples at the bar in Parliament, where waiters
warn journalists and lawmakers to order their drinks quickly
because they want to close the bar in order to watch the program.
	   In Ocna Mures, a factory and farming town about 175 miles (280
kms) northwest of Bucharest, most shops close for an hour in the
late afternoon when ``Esmeralda'' comes on. Even local phone
operators sometimes suspend work.
	   Seven women who work in the fields gather daily at the house of
76-year-old Rozalia Corbu, who has one of the biggest TV sets on
her street. When they're not working or watching ``Esmeralda,''
they like to read magazines about the lives of their favorite soap
stars, or chat about the episodes.
	   As the program begins their faces become more animated. From
time to time, some sigh or bite their hands at Esmeralda's
heartaches.
	   ``The poor girl,'' says Leonora Rotar, 83. ``I would give her my
life just to see her happy.''

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A Honduran human rights leader has
denounced The Cincinnati Enquirer for retracting a series of
articles about alleged abuses by Chiquita Brands, saying the
newspaper ``made me look like a liar.''
	   Andres Pavon Murillo, comptroller for the independent Human
Rights Committee, on Thursday said his lawyers were preparing a
dlrs 10 million lawsuit against the newspaper that he will file
next week in Cincinnati.
	   Harry Whipple, president and publisher of the Enquirer, said the
newspaper had no comment.
	   The Cincinnati Enquirer on May 3 published an 18-page series of
stories that questioned the business practices of Chiquita Brands
International, the world's largest banana company.
	   The articles accused Chiquita of setting up seemingly
independent companies to bypass restrictions on land ownership,
bribing Colombian officials, exposing workers to health risks and
using force to suppress unions.
	   Pavon Murillo was cited in the series as showing Enquirer
reporters the site of an alleged training ground for Chiquita
security guards. The newspaper said thousands of spent and
discarded rifle shells littered the ground, including some that
``probably'' were from an AK-47, which are illegal in Honduras for
non-military use.
	   ``I risked my life for nothing because the Enquirer retracted
itself,'' Pavon Murillo told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from his home in the northern city of San Pedro Sula.
	   The Enquirer articles alleged that Chiquita security guards
intimidated, shot and even killed one banana worker.
	   Chiquita, in a statement published by the Enquirer, said it
``completely denies and rejects any assertion that it has ever
committed any illegal or violent actions against any person in any
country or that it has ever instructed others to do so.''
	   On June 28, the Enquirer renounced the series in the first of
three front-page apologies, saying it was paying Chiquita more than
dlrs 10 million to settle claims and had fired Michael Gallagher,
the lead reporter, in the belief that he improperly obtained
voice-mail tapes on which the series was based.
	   Chiquita sued Gallagher but not the newspaper, seeking
unspecified damages for defamation, trespassing, conspiracy, fraud
and violations of electronic-communications privacy laws.

Peru agrees to open military free zone on border with Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru agreed to open a temporary military
free zone on its border with Ecuador to ease tension between both
countries, Brazil's president Fernando Cardoso said Thursday.
	   Cardoso announced the agreement after nearly five hours of
emergency talks with his Peruvian counterpart, Alberto Fujimori, in
Brasilia.
	   The removal of troops was proposed by a peacekeeping group of
countries comprising Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United
States.
	   Cardoso stressed that the border area would not be completely
demilitarized, but rival troops would be separated and observed by
neutral peacekeepers.
	   Tensions between both countries flared up again over the past
few days after army units began concentrating on the disputed
border.

Burton, King excell in the wind while others flounder

	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Call them ladies in red.
	   Brandie Burton and Betsy King were the only players to card
sub-par rounds at the Women's British Open as their big rivals were
buffeted around by the wind and the rain.
	   Burton and King mastered the conditions to share the lead with
1-under 71s Thursday and their nearest challenger was England's
Trish Johnson, the only one to manage level par.
	   While the two Americans had red cards to mark their scores, the
scoreboard at Royal Lytham course was a mass of over-par green
numbers as names like Laura Davies, Liselotte Neumann, Se Ri Pak
and defending champion Karrie Webb carded rounds in the high 70s.
	   Webb, bidding to win the title for the third time in four years,
started with a 76, Davies and Neumann struggled to 79s and Pak,
winner of four touraments including two majors in her rookie
season, a 78.
	   Emilee Klein, tournament winner two years ago, carded an 82 and
Donna Andrews, with one victory and four second places on the U.S.
Tour this season, struggled to 81.
	   With the waves crashing in from the Irish Sea, it seemed like
January rather than mid-August at Royal Lytham. The rough seemed
thicker, the bunkers deeper and the wind blowing in from the sea
made a mockery of tee-shots fired by some of the best players in
the world.
	   ``I'm very excited about getting in the red today,'' said
Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago who had four
birdies in her round.
	   ``Club selection here was very trying and wore you down
mentally. You were pretty much in control playing into the wind but
you didn't know what would happen downwind when the ball was in the
air.''
	   If she hadn't double bogeyed the 17th, where she hit two
bunkers, she would have had an outright lead.
	   King, celebrating her 43rd birthday, had three birdies and was
pleased with her 71.
	   ``I hit some good tee shots and did not three-putt,'' she said.
	   But she bogeyed 17 after getting held up in the wind.
	   ``The first nine holes were not too bad but then the rain
started. Into the wind the long holes are virtually unreachable,''
she said. ``I was 50 yards short of the green in two, got to within
25 feet and two-putted.''

Fifty years since Bradman's last innings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Donald Bradman is living proof that champion
sportsmen shouldn't be judged as being only as good as their last
game.
	   Friday marks the 50th anniversary of Bradman's last innings in
test cricket. His international finale was in the fifth test
between Australia and England at The Oval in London, Aug. 14, 1948.
	   He was bowled for a duck, a tragic anticlimax to a brilliant
career.
	   The Australian captain was given a standing ovation as he strode
to the crease for his last test innings. He was 39, just weeks shy
of his 40th birthday, and his first class career had spanned 21
years.
	   The English cricket team even gave him three cheers.
	   He needed to score only four runs to finish with a test average
of 100. Nobody has been close to this mark, before or since.
	   It must have seemed elementary that a man who could frequently
belt 300-plus runs in an innings could notch a measly four runs
when he needed them.
	   But he was bowled by the second ball he faced. England bowler
Eric Hollies claimed the biggest scalp of his career and Bradman
departed the wicket with a test average of 99.94.
	   He had taken guard just before 6 p.m. local time and safely
played the first ball, a leg-break from Hollies.
	   The next was pitched on a perfect length, a googly which spun
past Bradman's forward defensive stroke and clean bowled him.
	   Australia went on to win the test by an innings and 149 runs and
tie up the series 4-0, but it was little consolation to Bradman _
the undisputed best batsman of all time.
	   If anyone deserved to achieve the incredible feat of a 100
average, it was Bradman. He was a national hero. And is still
celebrated as a ``living treasure''.
	   D.G. Bradman must have held every batting record in
international cricket in his heyday. He played 52 tests, scoring
6,996 runs in 80 innings at an average of 99.94. He scored 29
centuries and remained unbeaten 10 times.
	   Not only was Bradman prolific, but he scored his runs quickly.
	   He held records for hitting 2000 test runs in 22 innings, 3,000
in 33 innings, 4,000 in 48 innings, 5,000 in 56 innings and 6,000
in 68 innings.
	   If he'd scored four runs in his last innings, he would also have
scored the quickest 7,000 runs in test history. England's Wally
Hammond achieved that milestone, scoring 7,000 runs in 131 innings.
	   He was the first batsman to score 900 runs in a series, hitting
974 (averaging 139) in seven innings during a five-test series
against England in 1930. On that tour he had innings of 334 at
Headingley, 254 at Lord's and 232 at The Oval.
	   In first class cricket he scored 28,067 runs at an average of
95.14, including 117 centuries. He scored more than 200 in an
innings on 37 occasions.
	   Bradman was born in rural New South Wales on Aug. 27, 1908. He
was the son of carpenter and farmer.
	   He was just 5 feet 7 inches (1.67-meter) tall but had the
ability to tear any bowling attack apart.
	   Folklore says he practised as a boy by repeatedly hitting a golf
ball against a corrugated-iron water tank with a cricket stump just
to sharpen his reflexes.
	   Whatever he did, it worked. He made his first class debut for
New South Wales in the Australian domestic competition in 1927,
aged 19. He scored 118 on debut against South Australia in
Adelaide.
	   Bradman made his test debut for Australia against England in
1928-29. He scored 18 and one and was responsible for running-out a
senior batsman as England won the first test in Brisbane.
	   He was made 12th man for the second test before returning in the
next match to score 79 and 112. He was never dropped from the
starting XI again.
	   It was after he scored 806 runs against the West Indies _ at the
amazing average of 206 _ in 1931-32 that prompted England to employ
the infamous ``bodyline'' tactics to combat him in 1932-33.
	   England fast bowler Harold Larwood (who later migrated to
Australia) was ordered to bowl at the Australian batsmen to knock
the confidence out of them.
	   The bodyline series changed the face of cricket. The Australians
took a battering. One batsman suffered a cracked skull and others
were taken to hospital after sustaining sickening blows to the
body.
	   Mounted police were called in to quell crowd unrest at the
Adelaide Oval in the third test as the tempers reached boiling
point.
	   England eventually won the series 4-1 but Bradman won the hearts
of the nation by defying the bodyline tactics and scoring a
respectable average of 56.57.
	   He toured England in 1934 and helped Australia reclaim the Ashes
with a 2-1 victory. He captained Australia in all five series
between 1936-37 and 1948.
	   As captain he won every series. On the 1948 tour his side was
undefeated. If the Second World War had not interrupted his career,
he would undoubtedly have set scoring records that would never be
broken.
	   After his retirement, he faded out of public life and rarely
granted interviews to journalists. The Bradman museum was built in
Bowral, New South Wales, as a tribute.

Who helps the helpers?

 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Television viewers who saw the raw,
unedited footage of burned, mangled bodies at the scene of the U.S.
Embassy bombing might have an inkling of the horrors people here
are carrying in their heads.
	   But then add the rest: The screams, the sirens, the agonized
whimpers, the stench of singed flesh. The panic, pain and
confusion.
	   How do you cope?
	   A small army of Kenyans _ the country's first crisis counselors
_ is now learning how to help people deal with the emotional
aftermath of such a devastating trauma.
	   The Aug. 7 Nairobi bombing killed 247 people and injured more
than 5,500. Another 10 people died and more than 70 were wounded in
a nearly simultaneous blast at the embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.
	   ``You can stitch up the wounds. You can put a cast around a
broken limb. But the emotional wounds are going to take a long time
to heal,'' said Cpl. Walter K. Crews, of Macclenny, Florida, part
of a seven-person U.S. Army team sent in to train the crisis
counselors.
	   The team from the 254th Combat Stress Control Detachment based
in Wiesbaden, Germany, arrived in Nairobi on Monday.
	   By Thursday, they'd trained 125 doctors, nurses, ambulance
drivers, rescue workers, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists
and volunteers.
	   Meanwhile, Kenyatta National Hospital got a crisis hotline up
and running and seven centers were offering free crisis counseling,
said Rosemary Mbugwa, the program coordinator.
	   The Army team found that training crisis counselors can turn
into counseling itself.
	   The trainees, like the people they'll be helping, have been
through a shattering experience. Many have broken down in the
training sessions.
	   ``Some weren't able to help as fast or as much as they wanted to
and they feel guilty,'' said another member of the team, Spc.
Travis Allen, from Fort Scott, Kansas.
	   Others were angry, numb, depressed, fearful _ all normal
reactions, the experts say, to an abnormal situation.
	   Ben Nyakuni, a social worker at Kenyatta National Hospital,
works with the dying every day, mostly AIDS sufferers in the
maternity ward.
	   The mothers and babies are doomed to die; it's a heartbreaking
place. But he manages to keep his professional detachment.
	   This time around, it's hard. The tragedy is his, too.
	   Three of Nyakuni's neighbors died in the horrifying collapse of
the building next door to the embassy, and his aunt and another
neighbor were badly wounded.
	   ``At the beginning, I did not believe,'' Nyakuni said. ``This
sort of thing happens to other people. Not to me!''
	   On the day of the bombing, he was drafted to help out in the
emergency room, a ``mad scene,'' he said. There were horribly
mangled victims, people with dreadful burns, frantic relatives
milling around.
	   Like many people involved in the rescue effort, Nyakuni hadn't
had the time to think about his own feelings or confront the
horrors he's seen until he walked into the one-day course.
	   ``Who helps the helpers?'' Crews asked. ``That's what we're
trying to do.''

Former test batsman announces retirement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Former test batsman Mark
Greatbatch announced Friday his retirement from all first-class
cricket.
	   Lefthander Greatbatch played 41 tests and 84 one-day
internationals from 1988 until 1996. He hit three test hundreds,
one of them on his debut against England at Eden Park in Auckland.
	   Another century came in a memorable 146 over almost 11 hours to
save a test against Australia at Perth in 1989.
	   Greatbatch scored 2,021 runs in tests at an average of 30.62.
	   His big-hitting exploits were one of the enduring highlights of
the 1992 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. He scored 2,206
one-day runs, with two centuries, at 28.28.
	   In 169 first-class matches, Greatbatch made 9,856 runs at 38.05,
with a highest score of 202 not out.
	   Greatbatch is a fulltime employee of the Central Districts
cricket association, where he is director of coaching and
development. (djp)

Williams beats Testud in second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Serena Williams knows one way
to hit a tennis ball and that is hard with a lot of power. She
displayed that power Thursday during a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over
seventh-seed Sandrine Testud of France in the second round of the
Acura Classic women's tennis tournament.
	   Also on Thursday, Elena Tartarkova of Ukraine beat sixth-seed
Irina Spirlea of Romania 6-2, 6-2. Tartarkova got into the draw as
a replacement for Mary Pierce, who withdrew Monday because of a
groin injury. Tartarkova will face French Open champion Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, the third seed, in the quarterfinals.
	   Williams, 16, took the first set after the two traded service
breaks with repeated backhand winners. Testud, ranked 14th in the
world, used an arsenal of topspin shots to win the second set,
needing 13 set points before she was able to capitalize.
	   ``I totally lost my focus in the second set,'' Williams said.
``I got very upset. I was forced to come back. I think the crowd
may have energized me.''
	   Williams formerly resided in nearby Compton and now lives in
Florida.
	   ``We were both playing great,'' Testud said. ``I was happy to
close out that second set. After that, I couldn't control the game
anymore. She is one of the hardest hitters on the tour.''
	   Williams dominated the final set as Testud was able to hold
serve in the first game of that set. Williams advances to the
quarterfinals against top-seeded Martina Hingis, the No. 1 player
in the world.
	   Asked how she felt about playing Hingis, Williams said, ``I'm
very excited to be able to play her. It's all going to depend on
which Serena shows up.''
	   Eighth-seed Natasha Zvereva of Belarus took 58 minutes to
dispose of Magui Serna of Spain 6-2, 6-1. Zvereva won the last six
games while displaying blistering forehands and sharp volleys. She
advanced to Friday's quarterfinals against the winner of Thursday's
match between second-seeded Lindsay Daveport and Julie
Halard-Decugis of France.
	   Also on the schedule Thursday night was fourth-seeded Monica
Seles against fifth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France.

Connors, Leconte out of tournament with injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ Jimmy Connors withdrew from the
Citibank Champions senior tennis tournament Thursday because of an
injured foot.
	   Later in the day, Henri Leconte retired from his quarterfinal
match against Peter Fleming with a stomach virus.
	   Connors was scheduled to take on John Lloyd in a quarterfinal
Thursday evening. Instead, Lloyd advances to the semifinals.
	   ``Jimmy has plantar fascitis,'' trainer Bob Donatelli said of
Connors. ``Since the beginning of this event, he's been treated
with anti-inflammatories and painkillers. We were hopeful after the
(John) Fitzgerald match that the medications would reduce the
inflammation. However, the condition did not improve.''
	   The same soft-tissue injury to his left foot caused Connors to
default a match in last week's Sprint PCS Champions in Wellesley,
Massachusetts.
	   Leconte, who had reached the semifinals last week, went into the
locker room after losing the first set 7-6 (7-3). A few moments
later, he returned to the court and informed chair umpire John
Restaino that he was unable to continue.
	   ``I could see after a few long rallies that he was struggling,''
said Fleming, who moves on to a quarterfinal meeting with Tim
Wilkison. ``He was trying to keep the points as short as
possible.''
	   In another first-round match, Tim Wilkison made short work of
Johan Kriek 6-2, 6-1.
	   The withdrawal of Connors leaves John McEnroe as the highest
remaining seed. McEnroe plays Mikael Pernfors in the quarterfinals
Friday night.
	   The Citibank Champions is the sixth event on the 1998-99 Nuveen
Tour and the ninth event on the ATP Tour-sanctioned worldwide
senior tennis circuit.

Tune back in Australian side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby union winger Ben
Tune has been recalled to the Wallabies for next Saturday's Tri
Nations decider against South Africa at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
	   Tune reclaims his starting place ahead of Jason Little, who
filled in for the flying winger in Australia's Bledisloe
Cup-clinching win over New Zealand in Christchurch two weeks ago.
	   Apart from Tune's inclusion, the Wallabies are unchanged from
Christchurch with Queenslander Dan Crowley staying in the front row
instead of prop Richard Harry, who missed the Christchurch game
with a knee injury.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen said he was happy that Tune had
fully overcome the tendinitis in his left knee that kept him out of
the win over the All Blacks.
	   ``He's trained really well, hasn't pulled up sore on it at all
and done everything that's been required,'' Macqueen said.
	   Harry will still travel to South Africa as part of a 25-man
touring party with other backups Damian Smith and John Welborn.
	   The Wallabies leave Saturday for South Africa.
	   The Australian team: Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim
Horan, Joe Roff, Steve Larkham, George Gregan (vice-captain),
Toutai Kefu, David Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom
Bowman, Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley. Reserves: Chris
Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen
Finegan, Glenn Panoho, Jeremy Paul. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's Muslims said Thursday their
community is being treated unfairly because several Muslims have
been unjustifiably detained in the investigation of the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Nairobi.
	   Shortly after the Aug. 7 bombing, police detained six Muslims,
four of whom remain in custody, Muslim leaders say. Police, who
have not identified suspects, said they are still holding about
five people.
	   ``It seems they've decided that the people who did it are
Muslims, now let's go for the evidence,'' said Mohamed Farouk Adam,
the vice-chairman of Jamia Mosque in downtown Nairobi.
	   Both FBI and Kenyan investigators have said they had reasonable
suspicion to question the people they have detained.
	   ``We should first have a look at the evidence. Then, if it's a
Muslim, you can crucify him. We have no problem,'' Adam said.
``But, please, don't do this before you have enough evidence.''
	   One man picked up just minutes after the Kenyan bombing was
Amjad Javed, who rushed to the scene to check if a friend survived
the blast, said Ibrahim Lethome, an official with the Supreme
Council of Kenya Muslims, which represents all the Muslim
organizations in the East African nation. The friend, Farhat
Sheikh, was among the 34 Kenyan embassy employees who died, Lethome
said.
	   Javed's family and friends still don't know where he is being
held, said Lethome.
	   Driving the public's rush to indict Muslims for acts of
terrorism are several factors. Among them: Many of the nations that
have the most antipathy for the United States are Muslim, including
Iran, Syria, Libya, and Iraq. All four appear on the State
Department's list of terrorism-sponsoring nations.
	   Several Muslims have also been convicted in high-profile
terrorist acts in the United States, such as the bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York City and a shooting spree outside
the CIA offices in Virginia, both in 1993.
	   There are no official statistics on how many of Kenya's 29
million citizens are Muslims. The council says it is about 25
percent, but academics and researchers put it between 5 percent and
10 percent.
	   Religion has not been part of the national census since
independence from Britain in 1962. The academics base their
estimates on projections from the British colonial census.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death, the tears
have dried and the mountains of flowers have been cleared away. But
Diana's image remains indelible, and her memory a force for change
at the heart of the monarchy.
	   Bouquets with handwritten notes still appear faithfully at the
gates of Kensington Palace, where the world kept a televised vigil
in the days after her death in a Paris car crash.
	   They are tokens of remembrance. But there is little chance of
forgetting.
	   The familiar smile and the famous blue eyes still shine from the
covers of glossy magazines and newspapers on every newsstand in the
country. The tiara glitters on her short blonde hair on calendars,
coffee mugs and carousels of postcards.
	   ``If you had been asleep that week, you might be misled to think
she was still with us,'' says Hugo Vickers, a royal historian and
commentator. ``Her memory, her soul, hasn't been allowed to
settle.''
	   On videotape, Diana and lover Dodi Fayed walk again and again
through a corridor of the Paris Ritz Hotel on the way to their
deaths in a tunnel by the River Seine. Over and over, the princess
walks through the same Angolan minefield in documentaries and news
broadcasts.
	   And now Diana the schoolgirl flirts day after day with her
father's home-movie camera in a film shown at her ancestral home,
where admirers pay to see her report cards and to gaze across a
lake at her island grave.
	   But while Diana's memory seems trapped on automatic replay, the
monarchy slowly shifts and her sons move on. They grow up largely
outside the public eye, fiercely guarded by palace and family.
	   Their occasional public appearances with Prince Charles suggest
a warm and affectionate relationship _ a surprise, perhaps, to
those who heard Earl Spencer's funeral oration for his sister as an
attack on stuffy royal child-rearing, ``immersed by duty and
tradition.''
	   William and Harry have chosen to be with their father at
Balmoral Castle in Scotland on the Aug. 31 anniversary of their
mother's death, rather than with the Spencer family, which is
marking the day with a service at Diana's grave.
	   ``All three princes are evidently very proud of each other,''
the Daily Telegraph's royal correspondent, Robert Hardman, wrote
after the trio's vacation trip to Canada in March.
	   Hamming it up for the cameras in their new red-and-white
Olympics jackets, Prince William, now 16, Prince Harry, 13, and
their father seemed ``a formidable triple-act,'' Hardman wrote.
``That there is now a powerful bond and team spirit for the future
is beyond doubt.''
	   The future is looking a lot friendlier and more up to date at
Buckingham Palace, where the heavy draperies of protocol and
tradition are easing apart. Queen Elizabeth II has even hired a
public relations professional to help improve her communication
with the people.
	   Diana's death and her life ``had an impact on the way people see
the monarchy,'' the queen's press secretary, Geoffrey Crawford,
acknowledged as the anniversary of the crash approached. ``It has a
resonance not only in this country but abroad, and it's not lost on
the queen. And you see that in the way we're doing our business
now.''
	   ``The point is that there's no revolutionary change,'' Crawford
added, but ``the way people do their business and how they're
perceived _ I think that will change.''
	   A key to that public perception is the press.
	   The chastened tabloids, accused of pursuing Diana to her death,
have reined in their coverage of the royals a bit. But the
circulation battle waged over the minutiae of Diana's and Charles'
lives and loves continues.
	   William and Harry remain objects of fascination, and the press
commitment to leave them alone appears to be flagging.
	   Only last month, The Sunday Mirror revealed the boys' secret
50th birthday treat for their father _ an original skit _ spoiling
the surprise. And The Sun made front-page news of William's first
meeting with Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime companion.
	   Lord Deedes, former editor of The Daily Telegraph and an ally of
Diana in her campaign to ban land mines, remains skeptical about
tabloid restraint.
	   ``The fact is, nothing has altered at all really,'' he says.
``Intense competition will always elbow out good manners.''
	   At the same time, the palace has realized the value of allowing
photographers into events where the queen speaks informally with
people.
	   Now, instead of just standing grimly on podiums and clasping
bouquets, the queen is photographed laughing with a pink-haired
rock singer, chatting in a pub or running across a field to catch
sight of her husband in a coach-driving race.
	   One morning this summer, The Times covered the top of its front
page with a picture of the queen visiting a McDonald's, although it
carefully noted she eschewed a Big Mac and fries.
	   ``The people longed for a less remote monarch: yesterday they
met her,'' the headline said.

LONDON: headline said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   When the country awoke a year ago to hear Diana had been killed
with Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul, the royal family was in
Scotland.
	   Caught up in what was for them a personal crisis, the royals
failed to see the immediate need to communicate with the rest of
the country, which was taking the loss personally, too.
	   The violent death of a 36-year-old woman whose warmth and
vulnerability touched so many people brought an outpouring of
public emotion that looked briefly as if it might get out of hand.
Grief and anger rattled the palace gates. The crowd and the
tabloids demanded a display of mourning.
	   A shocked queen left her grandsons in Scotland and returned to
London to pay tribute to Diana in a rare live TV address. ``There
are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary
and moving reaction to her death,'' she said.
	   She seems to have studied the lessons closely.
	   The senior royals commissioned an opinion poll to get a clearer
picture of where they stood with the public. Though the results
remain private, leaks indicate the royals were found to be remote
and poor value for money _ although as individuals the queen and
her daughter, Princess Anne, particularly, retained their solid
standing.
	   The biggest image change has been for Charles, cast for so long
as the heartless villain in the Diana soap opera. Without the
mistreated heroine, there's not much need for a bad guy.
	   ``I think he's possibly a little surprised to find there is a
lot of sympathy for him, for his role as a single parent,'' says
Vickers, the historian.
	   ``For 17 years, he was eclipsed by the marriage and its failure,
held to account because of his marriage rather than the things he
achieved. She cast some pretty public javelins at him,'' Vickers
says. ``But I don't think he ever publicly said anything nasty
about his wife.''
	   Less than four months after the crash, a MORI opinion poll
suggested public approval of Charles had leaped nearly 20 points,
from 42 percent in August to 61 percent in December.
	   The Sun, which dispensed its share of vitriol at Charles'
expense in the bad old days, slapped him on the back this summer
and advised him to go public with Camilla Parker Bowles _ the most
vilified woman in the land when Diana was alive.
	   ``Show us you love her,'' The Sun's front page entreated.
``Clearly, a love that lasts more than two decades _ and survives
both marrying someone else along the way _ is very, very special,''
the newspaper gushed.
	   In life, Diana's magnetism and appeal very nearly swamped her
in-laws. When she was around to be photographed, it was easy to
overlook the hundreds of thousands of children Princess Anne's
charity helped in every destitute corner of the globe.
	   Charles talking with a disabled worker was never likely to be a
Page One photo. But if an editor had a snap of Diana going to the
gym in her workout clothes, there was no contest.
	   That is a tabloid fact of life, and Diana was skilled at getting
almost as much from the tabloids as they got from her. As her
marriage fell apart, she was accused of creating photo
opportunities to coincide with Charles' important speeches.
	   ``Every time he said something, he found out his wife was saying
something else or his wife was wearing a new outfit,'' Vickers
says. ``Now he knows that's not going to happen. He is not a new
man, but a man who has been able to come out of his shell, without
fear of being contradicted.''
	   The palace is also trying to show it is not just reacting, but
is actively involved in the evolution of a modern monarchy.
	   Senior royals and top advisers have been irked when they weren't
given credit for their initiatives _ like the queen's decision in
1994 to pay income tax, and moves this year to give royal daughters
equal rights with sons to inherit the throne.
	   The palace has been tightening its belt for years, but now seems
to be picking up speed and efficiency.
	   The royals underspent their travel budget, funded by the
taxpayers, by 10 percent last year. Prince Philip, the queen's
husband, and Princess Margaret, her sister, did their bit by using
their senior citizens' discounts to buy train tickets.
	   The size of the working royal family seems due to shrink, too.
Unconfirmed reports indicate the designation ``HRH'' _ His or Her
Royal Highness _ may be limited in future to children of the
monarch and the heir to the throne.
	   It was after her August 1996 divorce from Charles that Diana
lost her HRH, a point that rankled for the remaining year of her
life.
	   That resentment was one of the many contradictions of the woman
whom her brother, Earl Spencer, called ``the unique, the complex,
the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana.''
	   She often dispensed with formal protocol and identified with the
world's disenfranchised, but was angry at losing membership in the
very select royal club. She repeatedly aired her contempt for her
husband, but wanted to remain married to him. She was a devoted
mother and fiercely protective of her sons, but made the marriage
failure public in a way that could only bring them pain.
	   It was her brother who warned right away against the public
instinct to turn Diana into a saint.
	   ``There is a temptation to rush to canonize your memory,'' he
said in his Sept. 6 eulogy at Westminster Abbey. ``There is no need
to do so. ... Indeed to sanctify your memory would be to miss out
on the very core of your being.''
	   On Aug. 31, when people around the world stop to think about
Diana, many will remember her as they knew her _ a mischievous
sister, a hard-working charity patron, a demanding employer, a
loyal friend, a dedicated follower of fashion, a dazzling dinner
companion. And regiments of photographers on every continent will
remember Diana the chameleon, flirtatious and elusive, the ultimate
quarry.
	   But far more people will be remembering a woman they never met.
They are free to remember the Diana they wanted her to be.

	   PARIS (AP) _ It has been the most extensive investigation in
France ever devoted to a car crash. And a year after Princess
Diana's death, it is far from over.
	   In fact, though the focus may have shifted somewhat, the same
questions asked in the beginning have yet to be fully answered:
	   How much did the Ritz Hotel management know about the condition
of driver Henri Paul? Were Paul's drunkenness and the speed at
which he was driving the sole reasons for the crash? Did the
paparazzi trailing Diana's Mercedes that night bear any
responsibility?
	   One question seems to have faded from the spotlight _ perhaps
because there seems so little hope of an answer. Investigators
concede that the famous but elusive Fiat Uno, which may have
brushed the Mercedes before it crashed, will likely never be found.
	   But there is hope that some light will be shed once painstaking
tests on the Mercedes are completed. A lab near Paris is expected
to finish them in September or October _ more than a year after the
car smashed into a pillar in the Alma traffic tunnel, crumpling
into a tangle of smoking metal.
	   Only then is there a chance the investigation could soon close.
In the meantime, small details filter out.
	   In the latest tantalizing clue, a person closely familiar with
the Mercedes has told investigators that the car's brakes were
faulty and that it was especially precarious to brake suddenly.
	   Thus, a new question for Judge Herve Stephan, in charge of the
investigation: When the Ritz rented the car from Etoile Limousines,
was it warned about the alleged problems?
	   And what about bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of
the crash? Six months ago, his story was that Henri Paul appeared
fine that night _ that he wasn't visibly drunk.
	   But that was before he resigned from the employ of Mohamed Al
Fayed, owner of the Ritz and father of Dodi Fayed, who also died in
the crash.
	   Rees-Jones is expected to soon meet yet again with Stephan, and
his story could change. A hint of that came in June, when his
French lawyer, Christian Curtil, formally asked Stephan to question
top Ritz managers about possible security lapses and about how much
they knew of Paul's condition.
	   So far, Stephan has shown himself to be willing. Judicial
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say he has summoned
Ritz director Frank Klein to appear in September.
	   Finally, there are the paparazzi. The 10 men have been in legal
limbo since they were placed under formal investigation days after
the accident, on charges of both manslaughter and failure to assist
people in danger.
	   Still working at their jobs _ sometimes even at Diana-related
events _ the men haven't been formally charged.
	   Stephan called them all together June 5, where, facing Mohamed
Al Fayed and Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, they again
recounted their actions on that fateful night. There's been no sign
the meeting led to any breakthroughs.
	   Those close to the case believe all 10 will soon be cleared on
the manslaughter charge, but that at least some will go to trial on
the non-assistance charge. The penalties would likely be minor,
maybe a steep fine, but no jail time.
	   One thing is certain: The trial, which wouldn't take place until
1999, would draw huge attention _ just like every other step of
this seemingly endless inquiry.

Using Diana's image to sell anything _ even margarine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One might as well be blunt about it: Princess
Diana's death created a rare commercial opportunity that
businessmen weren't going to miss.
	   Marketers instantly figured they could sell just about any tacky
thing in the world if it had Diana's picture attached, and they've
been doing just that.
	   The boom in Diana goods supports a mini-industry estimated at
100 million pounds (dlrs 165 million) or more.
	   To the tourist on Oxford Street, Diana's image is for sale
everywhere. It's on coffee cups, plates and thimbles piled high in
gift shops. Bookstores have Diana window displays. She is on
posters and T-shirts.
	   Her signature even made an inglorious appearance on tubs of
margarine.
	   Diana's estate and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund
are trying to gain control of an image that seems to have spun out
of their control.
	   Their lawyers have gone to court in Los Angeles seeking to stop
the Franklin Mint from making Diana dolls, plates and other items
said to have racked up at least dlrs 9 million in sales.
	   They also are fighting for a British trademark of Diana's image,
and say they will go after every unauthorized Diana dealer they can
find if they win.
	   ``The idea is to trademark her image so we have a basis to stop
blatant commercial exploitation, like somebody slapping her picture
on a pair of underpants,'' said Vanessa Corringham, a fund
spokeswoman.
	   Enforcing a Diana trademark wouldn't be easy. Even though many
Britons view the commercialization as heresy of the highest order,
demand is strong.
	   Memorabilia dealer Billy Lynch said he adds a healthy 200
percent markup to Diana goods, but still can't keep them in stock.
	   ``It's not letting up. It's good business,'' he said at his
stall near London's Marble Arch. He quickly added that he gives
half his profits to the memorial fund.
	   Many shops also say some proceeds from Diana sales go the
memorial fund, but few say how much. Some have even stopped the
practice and now keep all the profits.
	   ``It's not something you can do forever. Life goes on,'' said
Matt Levy, a spokesman for Books Etc., a subsidiary of the U.S.
chain Borders, which previously gave 20 percent of profits on Diana
books to charity.
	   Reg Barnard, a boss at the Churchill Gifts chain, insisted Diana
items are no different from other royal souvenirs.
	   ``It's like the World Cup, isn't it?'' Barnard said. ``When
stuff's hot, it sells.''

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock prices lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Friday,
following an overnight decline in New York. Japanese stock prices
slipped in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 145.07 yen, down 1.49 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 145.16 yen.
	   Traders said the dollar carried over from its overnight weakness
in New York, where the currency moved lower on profit-taking after
recent gains.
	   Fears among investors that Japanese monetary authorities may
intervene to stem the yen's slide also supported the currency. On
Wednesday, Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance
minister for international affairs, suggested that authorities were
ready to step into the market to buy yen if necessary.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started lower as
investors grew wary of declines on European stock markets and on
Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 140.81 points,
or 0.92 percent, to 15,241.21 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the Nikkei index gained 3.05 points, or 0.02 percent.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,459.50
on Thursday, down 93.46.
	   Also affecting trading in Tokyo was renewed concern over the
Russian currency crisis and weakness in other Asian economies,
traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.98 points, or 0.51 percent, to
1,175.73.The TOPIX closed up 1.71 potions, or 0.15 percent, the day
before.
	   Trading remained light as many investors in Japan took off this
week for Japan's annual ``Obon'' holidays.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.195 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.185 yen, pushing its price down to 111.79 yen from 111.87 yen.

Terence Stamp, Tramp: Diana walking tour probes every tenuous link

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Look, here's the Albany apartments where actor
Terence Stamp lived. He gave Princess Diana elocution lessons, you
know. And isn't that the Tramp nightclub, where Dodi Fayed partied,
several decades before dating the most famous royal?
	   Oh yes, and here's the U.S. Embassy, Grosvenor Square. Around
the corner lived Alice Keppel, mistress of King Edward VII and
great-grandmother of (gasp) Prince Charles' longtime girlfriend,
Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   Welcome to Princess Diana's London, a walking tour where no
royal link is too tenuous, no gossip too vague.
	   Bring 4.50 pounds (about dlrs 7) _ a pound less for children _
and a pair of stout shoes and you get a brisk three-hour stride in
the steps of a fun-loving princess. There's plenty of hard
biographical detail _ spiced with hearsay, doubtful anecdotes and
sheer trivia.
	   Did you know that since Prince Andrew returned to live at
Buckingham Palace after his divorce, Queen Elizabeth II has
acquired satellite TV? Proof, surely, that his ex-wife, Sarah, was
right when she called him a couch potato, according to tour guide
Helena Jones.
	   ``We've done a lot of research, but people don't just want the
hard facts,'' says Ms. Jones, who has delved into Andrew Morton's
biography of Diana for lurid details of her battles with bulimia,
royal protocol and a fading marriage. ``I say `allegedly' a lot
because a lot of it you can't prove.''
	   Pamela Barton, a Lynchburg, Virginia, native who recently took
the tour, put on by the London Walks company, called it ``a mixture
of random facts, history, allegations and anecdotes. I'm not taking
it too seriously.''
	   The tour, which runs Thursdays afternoons, starts at the Ritz,
where Ms. Jones presents a potted history of the hotel before
adding, ``And, of course, from another Ritz hotel, Diana and Dodi
took their final car journey ...''
	   Next is Spencer House, Diana's former ancestral home in Green
Park with its voluptuous statues of Bacchus and Ceres.
	   Then there's a distant view across the Mall of Buckingham
Palace, with the balcony where Charles and Diana kissed on their
wedding day (but only after the queen gave her approval, according
to Ms. Jones) and it's on to Clarence House, where Diana lived
before her marriage, and St. James' Palace, where her body came on
its return from France.
	   There's no escaping Camilla: Ms. Jones reminds you that it was
at St. James' Palace that Charles' paramour recently met Diana's
16-year-old son, William, for the first time.
	   Other stops include Dodi's apartment building on Park Lane, the
royal jewelers Asprey's, the auctioneers Christie's, which sold
Diana's dresses, and the upmarket tailors Turnbull and Asser.
	   Hamutal Oren, of Raanana, Israel, loved it all.
	   ``It's a gossip tour. It's a way of seeing London through
different eyes,'' she said.
	   But Matt Hancock of Sydney, Australia, left early, saying he was
``looking for something more personal, not endless palaces.''
	   That's on offer Tuesday afternoons, when another tour by London
Walks takes in the route of Diana's funeral procession from her
Kensington Palace home, her favorite shops and restaurants and the
apartment where she was living when Charles came courting.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Tom Glavine and Chipper Jones reminded San
Diego just how good the Atlanta Braves are.
	   Glavine pitched a two-hitter for his second straight shutout and
Jones homered and scored three runs as the Braves beat the Padres
5-0 Thursday to avoid being swept in a three-game matchup of the
NL's top two teams. Andruw Jones went 3-for-4 with two RBIs.
	   Glavine (16-4), coming off a 5-0 win at San Francisco on Friday,
became the NL's second 16-game winner. San Diego's Andy Ashby was
the first, outpitching Greg Maddux in the Padres' 5-1 win Wednesday
night.
	   Glavine faced just four batters over the minimum and extended
his streak of scoreless innings to 23. It was his sixth career
two-hitter, and he struck out four and walked three.
	   The Braves regained a two-game lead over the Padres in the
overall NL standings. With the Braves leading the season series
4-3, the teams will meet again next Thursday and Friday at Atlanta.

Al Fayed's uphill battle for British citizenship _ and respect

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In his native Egypt, he is lionized for making
millions and producing a son whose whirlwind romance with a
princess fed dreams of a liaison between British royalty and Arab
wealth.
	   The French government honored him with the Legion of Honor. The
Italians gave him the Order of Merit.
	   In his adopted British homeland, where he has lived for 35
years, he has given generously to charity and spent lavishly on
aristocratic trappings _ a Scottish castle, a 500-acre
(200-hectare) country estate and the landmark Harrods department
store.
	   But Britain has never opened its arms to Mohamed Al Fayed.
	   The flamboyant merchant, whose son Dodi died in the car crash
that killed Princess Diana a year ago, is shunned by the royal
family and much of the ``establishment.'' The government has
accused him of lying. He is regularly vilified in the popular press
with such epithets as ``morally and personally repugnant'' and
``ill-mannered self-seeker.''
	   Still, Al Fayed remains on a quest for British citizenship,
already once denied.
	   And he is determined to clear his name _ to disprove a
government report that he misrepresented his origins, wealth and
business interests when he purchased a chain of stores that
included the crown jewel of Harrods in 1985.
	   Over the past 15 years, the millionaire and his younger brother,
Ali, have been buying British status symbols _ Harrods, shirtmakers
Turnbull and Asser, the 150-year-old humor magazine Punch, the
Fulham Football Club, a professional soccer team.
	   One thing he has not been able to buy is respect.
	   ``Al Fayed is too flamboyant for the English, and he makes them
nervous,'' says Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage, a
publishing company that specializes in the aristocracy.
	   ``The English are not snobbish. They will receive anyone in
society who acts as they think a human being should act. They don't
care whether they're Arabs, Romanians, Jews, insurance salesman,
grocers or actors. But they have to play by low-key rules that the
English devise _ and Al Fayed ignores those rules.''
	   A man of many parts, Al Fayed is said to be exceedingly
charming, devastatingly dismissive and decidedly autocratic.
	   He instituted a dress code at Harrods, which he rigorously
enforces during frequent walks around the store.
	   An overweight American tourist dressed in designer leggings and
a long shirt was famously kicked out of Harrods. Another American
waiting for his wife to try on an expensive dress says he was
hustled behind a large plant by a salesgirl who spotted Al Fayed
heading their way. His crime: He wasn't wearing acceptable
footwear.
	   Al Fayed has been accused of electronically eavesdropping on
employees, firing minority workers without cause and rifling
through the safety-deposit boxes rented to customers in Harrods'
basement.
	   He is a man with visions _ critics would say delusions _ of
grandeur.
	   Years ago, in an apparent effort to enhance his family's
standing, he added ``Al'' to his name, meaning ``THE Fayeds.'' And
in Harrods, this son of the land of pharaohs has created an
Egyptian Hall with 12 sphinxes _ each bearing his own face and the
name ``Al Fayed'' in hieroglyphs.
	   His personal luxuries are those of the ultra-rich: homes in
France and Switzerland, an apartment in New York, the sumptuous
English estate where he lives with his second wife, with whom he
has four children, a fleet of helicopters and luxury cars, a yacht
in the Mediterranean.
	   Only last summer, Al Fayed played host to Diana and her sons on
the yacht, a major coup. During that sun-drenched cruise, his
eldest son, Dodi, embarked on a highly publicized romance with the
princess.
	   But Al Fayed's dreams that they might marry _ a triumph over the
establishment that had snubbed him _ ended when their
chauffeur-driven Mercedes crashed in a Paris tunnel last Aug. 31,
killing Dodi, Diana and their driver.
	   Al Fayed has since aggressively squandered the outpouring of
public sympathy over the loss of his son.
	   Days after the crash, Al Fayed said he had been told Diana's
dying words _ purportedly a message to her family that he then
dramatically altered several times.
	   His insistence that Diana and Dodi were about to announce their
engagement _ and his ``99.9 percent'' conviction, shared by many in
the Arab world, that they were victims not of a drunk driver in his
employ but of a conspiracy over fears Diana might marry a Muslim _
have angered and upset her family and friends, royal circles and
legions of ordinary Britons.
	   After 16 years, Harrods lost its sponsorship of the Royal
Windsor Horse Show _ one of Queen Elizabeth II's favorite events _
and Al Fayed was chastised over the use of royal crests on Harrods
stationery.
	   ``At every turn, I am beset by petty, spiteful and malicious
attempts to put me in my place,'' Al Fayed, who declined to give an
interview to The Associated Press, wrote this summer in The Sunday
Times.
	   Al Fayed's most recent outburst was aimed at Diana's mother,
Frances Shand Kydd.

	   After she ignored him during an eight-hour hearing in a Paris
courtroom in June, he accused her of ``acting like the Queen of
Sheba,'' called her ``a bad mother'' and said Diana ``did not give
a damn about her.''
	   Stung by accusations he was rude and heartless, Al Fayed hit
back in The Sunday Times, saying he was ``proud to be a
working-class Egyptian'' and entitled to ``common respect.''
	   That spin created a problem: It was completely different from
the story he and his financial advisers put out at the height of
his epic battle to acquire House of Fraser, the company that owned
Harrods.
	   Much of Al Fayed's past remains murky _ even his birthdate.
	   A copy of his birth registration _ published by his business
arch-rival, the late Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland _ says Mohamed Abdel
Moneim Ali Fayed was born Jan. 27, 1929. But Al Fayed maintains he
was born in 1933.
	   In the family pedigree circulated during the Harrods takeover,
the Al Fayeds were described as a prominent Egyptian family with
vast business interests in Europe, the Middle East and the United
States.
	   Grandfather Ali Al Fayed was said to have founded the family
fortune a century ago, growing cotton and exporting it in his own
ships to English mills. The family supposedly lived in a mansion in
Alexandria and the children had an English nanny and attended
English-style schools.
	   In an 800-page report, however, Department of Trade and Industry
investigators concluded the Fayeds came from much more modest
roots: Their grandfather was not a cotton tycoon. Their father, Aly
Aly Fayed, was a teacher. And the family lived in the poor port
district of Alexandria.
	   Al Fayed was enraged at the report.
	   After he failed to get Britain's former Conservative Party
government to clear his name, he took his campaign to the European
Court of Human Rights. When the court refused to overturn the
report in 1994, he took revenge against the Conservatives.
	   He blew the whistle on two Tory legislators who had accepted
brown envelopes stuffed with cash _ Al Fayed's cash _ for asking
leading questions at his behest in Parliament during the battle for
Harrods. The payments were not illegal, but the ``sleaze'' scandal
that ensued helped defeat the Conservatives last year.
	   Several months before blowing the whistle, Al Fayed had applied
for British citizenship. Like many foreigners, he has permanent
residency. But as an avowed Anglophile and admirer of what he has
called Britain's ``great civilized way of life,'' he wanted a
passport.
	   No reason was given when Prime Minister John Major's government
turned him down in February 1995 _ but Conservative anger over the
``sleaze'' scandal is believed to have been key.
	   Although Prime Minister Tony Blair's newly elected Labor Party
government announced in December that the citizenship applications
from Al Fayed and his brother would be reviewed, several newspapers
reported this summer that the brothers would fail again.
	   One of those papers, The Sunday Times, in April placed Al Fayed
11th in its 1998 list of Britain's wealthiest people _ up three
places since 1997. But the Times said his business affairs remained
``as shrouded as ever,'' and that it was guessing when it put his
worth at nearly dlrs 2 billion.
	   Al Fayed now says that if he had known what Britain had in store
for him, he would have put all his wealth into France, where his
cash has restored the 100-year-old Ritz Hotel and the former home
of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to their former glory.
	   There were reports he planned to give the Windsors' villa to
Diana and Dodi, had they married.
	   Though his ties to the royals and Diana's immediate family have
dwindled since the crash, one of his staunchest and most vocal
allies is Diana's stepmother, Countess Raine Spencer, who is on the
Harrods board.
	   ``What people don't realize when they attack him so viciously is
that Diana liked him so very much herself,'' she told The Mirror in
July. ``She would never have wanted anyone to treat Mohamed the way
he has been treated.''

Experts disagree on health benefit of limiting salt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ To salt or not to salt _ that is the question
_ and scientists, doctors and researchers are far from a unified
answer.
	   A quarter century after it was first proposed that limiting salt
in the diet will lower high blood pressure and help prevent heart
disease, experts are staunchly divided on the issue. A survey by
Science magazine of 80 researchers and doctors finds strong
opinions on both sides.
	   The federal government, through the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, urges everybody to limit salt intake to 2,400
milligrams a day, or about a teaspoon.
	   The agency claims that if people followed this rule, strokes
could be reduced by 42 percent and heart disease by more than 20
percent. Right now, the average American consumes 3,300 to 4,000 mg
of salt a day.
	   Some scientists, however, believe that, as Science reports, the
agency ``has made a scientific commitment to salt education that
goes way beyond the scientific facts.''
	   Dozens of studies have been done about salt, or sodium chloride,
and its effects on heart disease and blood pressure. But their
interpretation creates great disagreement.
	   A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, for instance, analyzed 114 studies and concluded that
limiting salt has only a small benefit, significantly less
effective than drugs against high blood pressure.
	   On the other hand, a combined study that looked at 116 studies
concluded the link between salt and blood pressure is
``substantially larger'' than generally appreciated, and increases
with age.
	   Often, experts say, the wrangling among researchers and doctors
tends to drown out any systematic efforts to learn the truth.
	   ``The problem with this field is that people have chosen
sides,'' Charles Hennekens of the Harvard School Public Health said
in Science. ``What we ought to do is let the science drive the
system rather than the opinions.''
	   The controversy may arise from the different approaches taken by
doctors, public health officials and scientists, said Sanford A.
Miller, dean of graduate studies at the University of Texas Health
Sciences Center in San Antonio.
	   Miller was on a federal committee 20 years ago that set the U.S.
recommendations for limiting salt. Now he is uncertain that enough
data exists to proves salt is all that important to high blood
pressure. He still favors the government's recommendation, however.
	   ``There is public health science and there is experimental
science,'' said Miller. ``If public health waits for the surety
that scientific research demands, then people could be hurt during
the wait.
	   ``You try to start a public health action that might be
beneficial, as soon as you know that it will not hurt anybody.''
	   That, said Miller, is what happened with salt. But now there is
less compelling evidence about the universal health benefit of
reduced salt.
	   ``One size does not fit all,'' said Miller. ``Some people are
salt sensitive, but others can consume relatively large amounts and
have no problems at all.''
	   Public health groups are beginning to soften their stance on
salt intake and put a stronger emphasis on a well-rounded diet with
both less salt and less fat, Miller and others note.
	   The American Heart Association's nutrition committee recommended
this week for the first time that fruits and vegetables and low-fat
dairy products be included in a reduced-salt diet to help prevent
high blood pressure.
	   Different health professionals do have different perspectives,
agrees Edward J. Roccella, coordinator of a blood pressure
education program run by the government's heart and lung institute.
	   ``A clinician may say that a slight drop in blood pressure is
not relevant,'' he said.
	   But from a public health viewpoint a slight drop in blood
pressure among millions of people can make a huge difference
overall.
	   Deaths caused by stroke, for example, could be reduced by about
17 percent in the U.S. if reduced-salt diets brought high blood
pressure down by just two or three millimeters of mercury, he said.

U.S. officials mum on bomb suspects; Muslims object to speculation

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ American officials remain mum about
possible culprits in last week's deadly twin bombings at U.S.
embassies in East Africa, but Muslims claim investigators and the
media are unfairly targeting them.
	   With rescue operations wrapped up and the death toll apparently
fixed at 257, the focus Friday was on cleanup work and the all-out
push to learn who perpetrated the nearly simultaneous bombings in
Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7.
	   On Thursday, FBI officials said they were questioning five
suspects but refused to give details about them. Sheila Horan, FBI
special agent in charge of the investigation, would only say that
investigators had gathered ``very critical and important
information'' on the bombers' identities.
	   But claims that several Muslims have been detained prompted
complaints from Islamic leaders Thursday.
	   ``It seems they've decided that the people who did it are
Muslims, now let's go for the evidence,'' said Mohamed Farouk Adam,
vice chairman of Nairobi's Jamia Mosque and a prominent leader of
Kenya's Muslim community.
	   The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, which represents all the
nation's Muslim organizations, claimed police detained at least six
Muslims in connection with the blast and four remain in custody.
	   Police in Tanzania arrested 14 people in the bombing there. News
reports said two, a Turkish citizen and a Somali-born Australian,
were subsequently released. Police did not comment.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility,
including one from a previously unknown Islamic group. But there is
no known evidence indicating Islamic groups were involved.
	   ``We should first have a look at the evidence,'' said Adam.
``Then, if it's a Muslim, you can crucify him. We have no problem.
But, please, don't do this before you have enough evidence.''
	   Investigators say they have not proved the two Embassy bombings
are linked, but Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said joint
police work with Kenya ``has given us important leads in our
investigations.''
	   Kenyans are still streaming to the devastated site where 247
were killed, staring in shocked silence broken only by the cleanup
work on bombed-out buildings and the hum of generators from FBI
tents set up to study evidence of the crime.
	   ``It's unbelievable,'' 26-year-old Eva Athiambo said Thursday.
``In Kenya, those kinds of things never happen.''
	   Workers at a 22-story bank tower near the embassy, many with
bandages or stitches testifying to injuries suffered in the
explosion, lined up to clamber through an opening in the wrecked
building to retrieve personal belongings. Climbing out clutching
bags and boxes, several said bitterly that offices had been
ransacked.
	   Flag-draped caskets bearing the bodies of 10 of the 12 Americans
killed _ all in Nairobi _ arrived to an emotional greeting Thursday
at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
	   Tears streaming down his face, President Bill Clinton watched
the flag-draped caskets of 10 of the Americans arrive at Andrews
Air Force Base.
	   ``Each of them had an adventurous spirit, a generous soul,''
said Clinton. ``Each relished the chance to see the world and to
make it better.''

New Zealand prime minister sacks deputy in coalition infighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley fired her deputy Friday after unprecedented infighting in
the ruling coalition which has thrown the government into turmoil
and could yet lead to its downfall.
	   Winston Peters was fired from his cabinet post as deputy prime
minister and treasurer by Shipley, who said at a news conference
she no longer had confidence or trust in him.
	   The firing follows a tumultuous two days for the government,
triggered by the walkout of a Cabinet meeting Wednesday by Peters
and his three New Zealand First party ministers during a dispute
about the sale of the government's stake in Wellington airport.
	   ``It is with regret and some sadness that I have to announce ...
that I have asked the governor-general to dismiss Winston Peters as
deputy prime minister and as treasurer,'' Shipley told the news
conference.
	   Peters' departure from the Cabinet means Shipley's National
Party will continue in power as a minority government.
	   National has 44 votes in its own right in the 120-member
Parliament. NZ First has 16. The government coalition relies on up
to 10 votes from other parties for an outright majority in the
House.
	   If NZ First members withdraw from the coalition because of
Peters' firing, Shipley will be short of a majority even with the
support of the non-aligned votes. National will have to woo back at
least seven NZ first votes to continue to rule.
	   The numbers are unlikely to be tested immediately, as no votes
of confidence are scheduled in the Parliament before next February.
If the government lost such a motion, however, an early election
would be almost inevitable.
	   Special dispute resolution powers in the National-NZ First
coalition agreement have been invoked, which gives the government
one week to resolve the row before the coalition can be formally
dissolved.
	   On Wednesday, all 16 NZ First legislators were united behind
Peters when he led the Cabinet walkout.
	   But at least one, customs minister and associate treasurer
Tuariki John Delamere, had broken ranks by Friday, publicly calling
Peters a liar and commenting that his leader was ``probably
dog-tucker (food)'' politically.
	   National Party legislators had been calling for Peters' head
after he publicly criticized Shipley and the rest of the Cabinet,
accusing her of an ambush during the airport meeting.
	   The relationship between the pair deteriorated further in
Parliament on Thursday when Peters challenged Shipley's account of
the Cabinet discussion. Observers said the acrimony between the two
was palpable and appeared to make reconciliation impossible.
	   In Auckland, Peters said he was told he had been fired but
refused to comment until after completing a scheduled speech.

Puerto Rico legislature considers statehood referendum

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's legislature gave
final approval Thursday to holding a referendum on whether the
Caribbean island should become the 51st U.S. state _ despite
misgivings both locally and in Washington.
	   The bill for a Dec. 13 referendum was approved by a 19-8 vote in
the Senate a day after passing the House of Representatives. Its
sponsor, Gov. Pedro Rossello, is to sign it into law Friday.
	   Rossello's crusade to join Puerto Rico to the Union has sparked
a fevered soul-searching that pits local patriotism against the
convenience and prosperity offered by the United States, which has
controlled the island for a century.
	   It also confronts many Americans with the discomfiting prospect
of a U.S. state where Spanish dominates and people overwhelmingly
consider themselves a distinct nation.
	   According to the plan, Puerto Ricans would choose between
statehood; independence; independence with a vaguely defined ``free
association'' with the United States; or continuing their unusual
commonwealth arrangement.
	   Under commonwealth, worked out in 1952, Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents are U.S. citizens and eligible for federal aid,
but they cannot vote for president unless they live on the mainland
and their sole representative in Congress has no vote.
	   The United States is not bound to honor the referendum _ and
efforts to work together on the issue are flagging.
	   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed _ by a single
vote _ a bill allowing for a similar referendum and agreeing to
work with the island on possible statehood. But that bill is held
up in the U.S. Senate.
	   Undaunted, Rossello has forged ahead, announcing his desire to
hold a referendum anyway three weeks ago at a rally marking 100
years since the United States invaded and wrested the island from
the Spanish empire.
	   Rossello apparently hopes a strong majority for statehood could
dispel doubts and move Congress to act.
	   It seems a long shot: Polls show Puerto Ricans remain about
evenly divided between statehood and commonwealth _ as they were in
a 1993 referendum narrowly won by commonwealth _ with a small
minority favoring independence.
	   Critics who deride the commonwealth as colonial were boosted
this week when a U.N. special committee reaffirmed Puerto Rico's
right to self-determination and independence.
	   And there is a growing feeling that a clear decision on either
independence or statehood is inevitable.
	   ``We have reached the point of `to be or not to be' in our
relationship with the United States,'' columnist Guillermo Moscoso
wrote in The San Juan Star daily.

Muted Iraqi response could pave the way for tougher action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By giving only a muted response to the
latest Iraqi crisis, the Security Council is waiting for Baghdad's
next move _ and whether it violates U.N. agreements by trying to
block weapons inspectors, council diplomats say.
	   Such a violation could prompt a tougher council response and
would further jeopardize Iraq's attempts to have sanctions lifted
when the 15-member council reviews the measures this October.
	   To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation with the United Nations was ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   On Thursday, council members postponed any formal show of
support for U.N. inspectors, despite letters from top inspectors
who said their work was being undermined by Iraq's decision.
	   Rather than issuing a formal resolution or statement, the
council was considering sending letters of support to Richard
Butler of the U.N. Special Commission, and Mohamed el Baradei of
the International Atomic Energy Agency. The letters would state
that Iraq's actions were unacceptable, diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Such letters could give weapons experts the go-ahead to attempt
the kind of inspections suspended last week, diplomats said. If
inspectors ae blocked in violation of U.N. agreements, the council
could then take a more aggressive stand.
	   The council was expected to take up the issue again next week.
	   So far, U.N. inspectors haven't tested the Iraqi announcement
and were awaiting word from the council on whether to proceed with
inspections and request Iraqi escorts for visits to new sites, U.N.
officials said. According to Security Council resolutions, the
inspectors can't go out on spot searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   A top Iraqi official at Iraq's U.N. mission said his country's
decision is clear.
	   ``We will not send people to accompany you,'' the official said
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If they want to
escalate the situation then yes, this would be the next step.''
	   The relatively muted move of sending letters was also seen as
trying to gain more unity within the council. Russia, China and
France _ all permanent members of the powerful body _ have tended
to be the most sympathetic to Iraq.
	   Already, France has indicated its displeasure with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein over ending cooperation with the
inspectors.
	   ``This decision will do a disservice to Iraq's cause by slowing
down the accomplishment of the mandates conferred to the Special
Commission and the IAEA,'' the French Foreign Ministry said
Thursday.
	   The French position could lead to a tougher council stand when
sanctions are up for review in October.
	   Sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil, were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted
once weapons inspectors have certified that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   If weapons inspectors can't get to sites to certify Iraqi
compliance, sanctions won't be lifted. A more patient, middle
ground reaction from the council would force Iraq to make the next,
conciliatory move if it wants sanctions removed, one Western
diplomat said.

Researcher finds evidence of sudden warming 2,000 years ago in

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A heat wave suddenly moved across Africa some
2,000 years ago and lasted for centuries before relenting,
according to a study of ancient sediments dredged from the bottom
of a mountain lake in Kenya.
	   Researchers from the Weizman Institute in Rechovot, Israel, who
did the study said their findings show the global climate naturally
goes through cycles of warming and cooling. A current warming trend
has been blamed on greenhouse gasses dumped into the atmosphere by
industry and transportation.
	   ``Our findings show that the climate can warm up suddenly
without any connection to human activity,'' said Aldo Shemesh, head
of environmental sciences at the Weizman Institute in Rehovot,
Israel.
	   A report on the study will be published Friday in the journal
Science.
	   Shemesh said that documenting ancient, natural climate changes
will help modern science more accurately determine the manmade
effects on the future climate.
	   He and his colleagues gathered sediment cores from the bottom of
Hausberg Tarn, a small lake 14,000 up the side of Mount Kenya. They
used a carbon-14 dating technique to determine that some of the
bottom material was more than 3,000 years old.
	   From the corings, the scientists then extracted fossils of algae
that lived during those ancient times. By analyzing the ratio of
two isotopes of oxygen, they could determine the temperature of the
water when the algae lived.
	   For instance, oxygen-16 is the most common form of oxygen, but
the amount of oxygen-18 in the fossils increases when the water
cools and decreases when it warms.
	   The researchers found that the waters in Hausberg Tarn suddenly
warmed about seven degrees F between 350 BC and 450 AD. The warming
indicates a fundamental shift in the climate of equatorial East
Africa occurred during the period, the scientists said.
	   A number of studies in different parts of the world have found
evidence of sudden warming or cooling trends, but the Hausberg Tarn
findings are the first from a high altitude, equatorial location.

Negotiators in Kosovo face serious lack of support

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A team of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
chosen to try to negotiate peace with the Serbian government faces
a serious drawback: a lack of support from the rebel army fighting
for the province's independence.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leading ethnic Albanian politician,
announced Thursday the composition of his negotiating team, but he
failed to win the backing of the underground Kosovo Liberation Army
fighting for independence of the embattled province.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will meet Friday with the team to hammer out a platform for
negotiations with the Serbian government.
	   But the failure to obtain KLA support is a serious drawback
because sustained negotiations on the future of Kosovo are
inconceivable without a stable cease-fire. So is any peace
settlement without the rebel force's approval.
	   Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian ambassador to Belgrade, told
Austrian state TV that an end to the fighting is a precondition for
talks to begin.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been
struggling to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to
stop squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in
Kosovo made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or
without the rebels.
	   The ethnic Albanians' five-member team comprises mainly
disciples of Rugova, a pacifist supported by one branch of the KLA
and despised by others.
	   Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the rebels and other
ethnic Albanian politicians will join negotiations with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic if they see progress is being made
toward autonomy for Kosovo.
	   ``There are open seats for other representatives and politicians
to be included'' in talks, Rugova said. He was surrounded by Hill
and representatives of the so-called Contact Group _ the United
States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision. So did
foreign powers.
	   Vice President Nikola Sainovic said a Serb delegation had been
ready for months to resume talks, which broke off in May.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, speaking in his
capacity as the current European Union president, welcomed the move
as ``a first step in the right direction.''
	   He said a condition for the start of ``a substantial dialogue on
the future status'' of Kosovo had been fulfilled. He urged the
government in Belgrade to start negotiations immediately.
	   NATO Secretary General Xavier Solana also ``warmly'' welcomed
the news. He spoke of a ``window of opportunity'' in the Kosovo
conflict even though the new Kosovo Albanian negotiating team does
not include the KLA.
	   The Russian government also hailed the announcement of an ethnic
Albanian negotiating team, calling on both sides ``to begin talks
immediately and without any preconditions.''
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring a version of the
self-rule he revoked from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear
what degree of autonomy Milosevic is willing to grant the province,
which some Serbs consider the medieval cradle of their national
identity.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million.
	   Since 1991, ethnic Albanians have sought independence from what
they call the oppression of the Milosevic regime. The Albanians
have declared a self-styled ``Republic of Kosovo'' and elected
Rugova as president.

Woods stays out of the woods for early lead in PGA

 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) _ The driver was only for show.
	   Tiger Woods couldn't attack tree-lined Sahalee Country Club from
the tee in the first round of the PGA Championship, so he left his
biggest weapon in the bag and found another one _ his putter.
	   Striding confidently to the hole as each putt dropped for
birdie, Woods once again got into contention in a major on Thursday
by shooting a course-record, 4-under 66 for a two-stroke lead.
	   Three others still on the course at 2-under _ Craig Stadler,
Ignacio Garrido and Jesper Parnevik _ still had a chance to catch
him.
	   ``What did it look like? A lot of rough, a lot of trees,'' Woods
said. ``But overall, I saw a lot of putts go in the hole. And
that's definitely not a bad thing.''
	   Sahalee had plenty of bad things in store for others who tried
to navigate its narrow fairways in pursuit of the early score
posted by Woods.
	   Glen Day was leading at 5-under until he found the rough on the
15th hole, then three-putted from for double bogey. Frank Lickliter
had a chance to catch Woods until he put his tee shot on the par-3
17th into the water.
	   Both wound up with 68, along with Bill Glasson, Bob Estes and
1993 PGA champion Paul Azinger.
	   And then there's Olin Browne, who found out the hard way about
the unforgiving forest of Sahalee. His tee shot into a red cedar on
No. 8 didn't come down until a barefooted fan scaled the tree to
find it.
	   Browne took an unplayable lie, and eventually a double bogey.
	   Even Glasson took his lumps, his 68 marred by a double bogey on
the ``goal post'' hole, the par-5 11th, and a bogey on No. 18.
	   Sahalee came out a winner in its first test for the world's best
golfers. With two-thirds of the field finished, just 25 players
were under par, and 10 of them were still on the course.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
season, got off to a rocky start with bogeys on two of the first
three holes.
	   But O'Meara is all about great finishes, and he once again found
a way to hang around the lead. He played bogey-free the rest of the
way and finished with a 69.
	   Also at 69 were 1986 PGA champion Bob Tway, Steve Stricker and
Kenny Perry, who lost the PGA in a playoff to Mark Brooks at
Valhalla two years ago.
	   Nick Price wasted strong iron play by missing several birdie
putts and finished at 70, along with Justin Leonard, Ryder Cup
captain Ben Crenshaw and defending champion Davis Love III.
	   ``It was a very bad ball-striking round on a day when the course
will play the easiest it will ever play,'' said Love, trying to
become the first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute in 1937.
	   Woods hasn't won a major since the 1997 Masters, in which he was
fearless with the driver on an Augusta National course that
features generous, rough-free fairways.
	   Sahalee doesn't allow for that, not with its towering firs and
cedars that spread their limbs to the edge of fairways and swat
errant shots into ankle-deep rough.
	   Just ask David Duval, Payne Stewart and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen. All of them shot 76 and may have to be more aggressive _ a
daunting task at Sahalee _ if they want to stick around for the
weekend.
	   John Daly played aggressive from the start and got predictable
results _ he didn't birdie either par 5, took triple bogey on the
the 18th and shot 80.
	   Fred Couples, the hometown favorite, took double bogey on No. 18
and finished with a 74.
	   Woods learned about Sahalee's dangers early. He blocked his
2-iron into the right rough on the first hole, hacked out into
rough around the green and took a bogey.
	   But the round turned in his favor quickly when he got away with
a mistake. Woods had 220 yards (200 meters) to the green on the
par-5 second hole and aimed conservatively to the middle. But he
hung his 3-iron out to the right _ straight at the flag, but
directly over the water.
	   ``I thought for sure the ball was wet,'' he said.
	   It cleared the water by about six feet (1.8 meters) and wound up
on the fringe, where Woods got up and down for a birdie.
	   ``From there, I felt at ease with myself,'' he said.
	   The rest of the round was simply a careful walk down the
treacherous, tight fairways of Sahalee.
	   Throughout the day, Woods kept one thought in the back of his
head.
	   ``Hang in there, be patient, hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and give myself a chance,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit
the ball in the center of the green and attack from there.''
	   Putting is what plagued Woods more than anything in the U.S.
Open, in which he had two four-putts, and at Royal Birkdale.

Report: Japan selling more autos in Latin America, Middle East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing weak demand in key Asian and Western
markets, Japan's automakers are seeking to boost exports to Latin
America and the Middle East, a news report said Friday.
	   Automakers shipped 256,000 cars to Central and South America in
the first six months of 1998, up 30 percent from the same period
last year, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported.
	   That's the most cars Japan has ever exported to the region, the
report said.
	   Exports to the Middle East were also robust, reaching a
five-year high. Japanese automakers shipped 180,000 cars to the
region for an increase of 20.5 percent, the paper said.
	   Most of the gains came in sales of smaller models. Exports to
Latin America of Honda Motor Corp.'s small-sized Civic surged 70
percent in the first six months, the paper said.
	   The gains come as a severe economic crisis has slashed demand by
half in Asia, the region Japanese automakers had seen as their key
growth market, the report said.
	   Exports to the United States and Europe have also slipped as
Japanese automakers produce more cars locally to avoid trade
friction, the Nihon Keizai said. Domestic sales have been hurt by a
long economic slump.

Browne gets some help from a tree-climbing fan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Olin Browne got a lot of help from a
tree-climbing fan in the first round of the PGA Championship.
	   On the Sahalee Country Club's par-4 eighth hole, Browne's tee
shot stuck in a Douglas fir tree about 25 feet (7 1/2 meters) off
the ground.
	   No problem.
	   Ken Betzler, 31, of Seattle, got on the shoulders of another
fan, John Marnin, of Portland, Oregon, and climbed the tree,
fetching Browne's Titleist 8 and dropping it on the ground.
	   ``It's what I did as a kid,'' Betzler said. ``Isn't that what
all kids do? I thought it was a great opportunity to make a friend
of a golfer.''
	   And he did.
	   ``You'd better hang out with me the rest of the day,'' Browne
told Betzler, who works for a pharmaceutical company. ``I might
need you.''
	   Since it was an unplayable lie, Browne got a drop and a one-shot
penalty. If the ball would have been lost, Browne would have lost a
stroke and had to hit another tee shot.
	   A similarly lucky break helped Mark O'Meara in the third round
of the British Open that he won last month.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DALY DEJECTED: &LR;  John Daly challenged Sahalee with his big
driver. And lost.
	   Pro golf's version of Mark McGwire shot a 10-over-par 80 in the
first round of the PGA Championship. Then the sweat-drenched Daly
walked into the clubhouse and declined to talk to reporters.
	   Al Geiberger, the 1966 PGA champion, shot an 81 in Daly's
threesome. Geiberger, 60, didn't offer the PGA Tour's longest
hitter any advice. But if Geiberger would have been asked by Daly
for some, it would have been to play more conservatively on the
tight Sahalee layout.
	   ``But that's John's game,'' Geiberger said. ``His long game is
what gets the fans excited. Of course, they have no clue what he's
shooting.
	   ``Today, I think he got disgusted. Then his concentration went.
Our group wasn't too good.''
	   On a couple of holes, Daly outdrove Geiberger by more than 100
yards. And there were a lot of fans watching because they wanted to
see Daly.
	   ``It was a little embarrassing,'' Geiberger said. ``I'd rather
have embarrassed myself in private.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DISGUSTED JANZEN: &LR;  Two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen
walked off the Sahalee course in disgust.
	   And well he should have _ after a 6-over-par 76 that left him 10
shots behind Tiger Woods and reaching for the phone to make an
airline reservation.
	   ``If I don't shoot under par tomorrow, I'll have to check on the
overnight flights home,'' he said with a frown.
	   Except for the Open at San Francisco's Olympic Club in June,
it's been a disgusting year for Janzen, 33, also winner of the 1993
U.S. Open.
	   On Thursday, he carded 38-38 in a threesome with defending PGA
champion Davis Love III and Mark O'Meara, winner of the Masters and
British Open this year. O'Meara and Love didn't make Janzen feel
any better about himself, shooting 69 and 70, respectively.
	   That was enough to put Janzen in a bad mood.
	   ``It was just a matter that I couldn't hit a putt,'' he said.
``But, except for one tournament all year, I've struggled with my
putting. Today, I missed most of the short ones, the three-footers.
	   ``I felt like I hit the ball pretty well. But I let it get to
me.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LORD BYRON: &LR;  There the living legend sat in a folding chair
with his wife, greeting the players as they got up on the first
tee. The players responded warmly and with affection and respect
for the man who won 11 consecutive tournaments in 1945.
	   ``I love it,'' said Byron Nelson, 85. ``I love getting out here
with the fellas. It's great to see them.
	   ``I would have loved to have played here.''
	   In 1944, Nelson was in Spokane for the PGA Championship. It was
match play then and Nelson didn't win. But he came close, losing in
the final to Bob Hamilton 1-up.
	   Nelson walks with the help of a cane now, but he still plays
golf using a cart. He leaves Texas and goes to the majors as kind
of a goodwill ambassador for the players of the past.
	   ``It makes me feel good,'' he said.
	   Talking before any player had completed the first round, Nelson
refused to predict a winner for the PGA Championship over the
tight, tree-lined Sahalee course.
	   ``You're going to have to hit the ball straight and you must
have patience,'' he said. ``You have to adjust your thinking on
this course.''

Thailand unveils package to rescue financial system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank Friday said it
would take over two debt-ridden banks and five finance companies as
part of a comprehensive package to rescue the country's tottering
financial system.
	   An effective plan is considered essential for reviving the
recession-bound economy. Thailand's financial sector all but
collapsed last year after a slowdown in the economy exposed
insolvency in companies in many sectors of business.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said
non-performing loans will be written off existing shareholder
equity. The institutions' 10 baht (25 U.S. cents) shares will be
written down to .01 baht a share.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will then take over the seven institutions with
swaps of debt for new shares. In some cases cash will also have to
be injected, and at a later stage the institutions will be merged
with others or possibly offered for sale.
	   The remainder of the government's salvage program is to be
announced later Friday.
	   On the eve of the announcement, the central bank said it has
prepared a large amount of cash in case of a run by nervous
depositors.
	   Local television stations reported Thursday that small
depositors had rushed to withdraw their money from some of the four
commercial banks taken over by the central bank earlier this year.
But the reports said major clients of those banks did not join the
move.
	   Share prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand ended slightly
lower in moderate trading Thursday ahead of the expected banking
announcement.
	   A dealer at Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said some
investors would rather wait to buy shares of strong financial
institutions Friday when market sentiment is expected to be
depressed.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt.
	   Domestic political pressure is rising on the government, with
unemployment expected to hit almost 3 million this year, up from 1
million last year.
	   Opposition politicians have accused the government of committing
billions to prop up financial institutions owned by rich families,
while the poor suffer from factory closures and rising food prices.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to help rescue Thailand's economy.

Tyson withdraws New Jersey application for license; asks Nevada
</HEADLINE>
instead &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; CHANGES dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGIE WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's fate is once again in the hands of
Nevada boxing officials.
	   In the latest bizarre chapter of a saga that began when Tyson
bit Evander Holyfield's ears 13 months ago, Tyson's advisers on
Thursday abruptly withdrew his application for a New Jersey boxing
license.
	   They then turned to the state that banned him, appealing for
Tyson's return to the ring.
	   ``Maybe he came back to his senses and decided the best way to
go about this was to come back to the state that revoked his
license,'' said Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the Nevada Athletic
Commission. ``We have a very fair commission. And we make decisions
on the spot. We vote on it on the spot and we don't delay our
decisions.''
	   The move came on the eve of a meeting of the New Jersey Athletic
Control Board, which two weeks earlier listened as the former
heavyweight champ asked for his license back _ but also got angry
and cursed in front of the regulators.
	   ``We were surprised to get it today, but we will set up a
hearing and it will be a fair and impartial hearing,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   Ratner, who estimated a hearing could be held in two to three
weeks, said he had no idea why Tyson withdrew his application in
New Jersey.
	   Tyson adviser Shelley Finkel didn't give a reason, other than to
say there was concern over the perception that the boxer was trying
to get around the Nevada ban by applying in New Jersey. Finkel
denied he feared Tyson's application would be rejected.
	   ``I felt very positive,'' Finkel said, adding that he also is
confident about Tyson's chances in Nevada. ``We can always go back
to New Jersey if it's bad in Nevada.''
	   Ghanem said Tyson was making the right move in returning to the
state regulators who revoked his license.
	   ``It wasn't a smart move for him in the beginning,'' Ghanem
said, referring to the New Jersey application.
	   Nevada was taken by surprise when Tyson applied last month in
New Jersey. State boxing regulators had expected all along that he
would reapply for his license in Nevada after a mandatory one-year
wait.
	   Asking New Jersey for the license was seen as a calculated
gamble by Finkel. But many in boxing criticized the move and said
that if states did not respect each other's decisions that a
federal commission might be formed to regulate the sport.
	   Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3 million for
biting Holyfield's ears during the third round of their June 28,
1997, rematch for the heavyweight title.
	   Ghanem said Tyson is not assured of getting his license back,
despite the feeling by some in boxing that he has been punished
enough.
	   ``Mike Tyson will have to convince the commission that he is fit
to have a license,'' Ghanem said.
	   Two members of the New Jersey board were scheduled to decide
Friday whether Tyson could return to the ring in New Jersey.
	   At a July 29 hearing, Tyson's advisers presented a parade of
character witnesses who urged regulators to give him another chance
and the boxer apologized for biting Holyfield.
	   But at the end of the hearing, Tyson got angry, refused to read
a closing statement and cursed in front of regulators.

Top-seeded Coetzer advances in BostonCup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ With the rain finally abated,
top-seeded Amanda Coetzer advanced to the quarterfinals of the
BostonCup, while fourth-seeded Silvia Farina of Italy was upset.
	   Cara Black of Zimbabwe, the world's top-ranked junior girl a
year ago, knocked of Farina 1-6, 6-2, 7-5 Thursday. The match was
played after Farina completed a three-day, 1-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory
over Mary Joe Fernandez.
	   The Farina-Fernandez match began on Tuesday before being
suspended by rain after the first set. They played the second set
on Wednesday before rain once again forced suspension of play.
	   Farina came back later on Thursday to compete in doubles.
	   ``I was really tired. I'm not used to a match that lasts three
days and then having to come back and play two more matches,'' said
Farina. ``It was especially difficult staying focused.''
	   Coetzer, of South Africa, beat Nana Miyagi of Japan 6-3, 6-3.
Germany's Anke Huber won when Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus
withdrew because of cramps.
	   In other singles play, Lisa Raymond beat Ruxandra Dragomir of
Romania 6-3, 6-3; Russia's Elena Likhovtseva defeated Shi-Ting Wang
of Taiwan 6-4, 6-2, and Corina Morariu beat Meghann Shaughnessy
3-6, 6-1, 6-2.
	   Nathalie Dechy of France eliminated Japan's Yuka Yoshida 6-3,
6-4 before losing to South Africa's Mariaan DeSwardt 6-1, 7-6
(7-1).

Handicapped couple commit love suicide in lake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two physically handicapped lovers forbidden to
marry by their families have been found drowned in a lake in an
apparent case of double-suicide, police said Friday.
	   The bodies of Masaru Kawanaka and Megumi Nakama were found
Thursday floating in Lake Biwa, a scenic tourist spot in western
Japan, with their hands tied together, said police spokesman
Tetsuzo Koga.
	   Their wheelchairs were discovered at the bottom of the lake, and
police believe they pushed themselves off a high part of the
shoreline, Koga said.
	   Kawanaka, 46, was paralyzed from the waist down and Nakama, 39,
had had a leg amputated after a traffic accident. They fell in love
at a center for the physically disabled in Osaka, but their
families opposed their plans to marry, Koga said.
	   The handicapped are often burdened with an intense stigma in
Japan, and families have been known to hide their disabled
relatives from the outside world out of shame.
	   Lake Biwa is located about 300 kilometers (186 miles) west of
Tokyo.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rafter match &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Pete Sampras was the model of efficiency
Thursday in beating Jan-Michael Gambill 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 to move into
the quarterfinals of the dlrs 2.45 million ATP Championship.
	   Sampras overwhelmed Gambill in the first-set tiebreaker, winning
the first six points, then broke Gambill once in the second set and
served out the rest of the way.
	   ``He served big, I served big _ we played a lot of quick points,
not a lot of ground stroke rallies,'' said Gambill, 21, the
youngest American in the top 100 rankings.
	   ``My serve resembles his a little. I hope he doesn't mind
that.''
	   Gambill served 15 aces to 13 for Sampras. But Sampras
concentrated more on holding his serve and made only one serious
attempt to break Gambill.
	   In the fourth game of the second set, Gambill rushed the net
after winning the first point. Sampras hit a winner, passing
Gambill on his forehand side, then Gambill double-faulted and
Sampras won the next two points for the only break in the match.
	   ``That came at a time when I was starting to get a hold of his
serve a little better,'' Sampras said. ``It was the time to
capitalize on winning the first set.''
	   Vince Spadea advanced with his second upset of the tournament,
beating eighth-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-3.
Spadea ousted Andre Agassi on Wednesday night.
	   Because of the large number of upsets _ only four of the 16
seeded players remain _ bonus points in the field have been reduced
and Sampras will have to successfully defend his title to regain
the No. 1 ranking from Marcelo Rios of Chile.
	   Among the remaining seeds, No. 3 Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic beat No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5; No.
5 Patrick Rafter of Australia defeated Todd Martin 3-6, 6-3, 6-2;
and No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia beat Scott Draper of
Australia 6-3, 6-3.
	   Korda was down 5-2 in the third set before rallying.
	   ``My father always told me, `Fight to the last point; play to
the last point,' and that's just what I did,'' Korda said.
	   ``I just kept playing, putting balls over the net, trying to win
the match.''
	   Ivanisevic had beaten Korda in seven of their 10 previous
matches. But he has not played with confidence since losing to
Sampras in five sets at Wimbledon, and Thursday's match was a
replay of last week at Toronto.
	   ``I'm playing good tennis at the moment, but I don't need to
lose those kind of matches, like I lost last week against Agassi,''
Ivanisevic said. ``I'm hitting the ball well. And then last week, I
had the match in my hand and I gave him the match.''
	   In other matches, Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Jerome Golmard
of France 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2); Magnus Larsson of Sweden defeated
Tommy Haas of Germany 6-4, 6-4, and Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic beat Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-4.

Council decries Angola fighting, keeps UN presence for a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council, in renewing the
mandate for the U.N. force in Angola on Thursday, strongly deplored
the recent surge in fighting in the country and held the formal
rebel movement UNITA responsible.
	   The 15-member council decided to keep U.N. military observers in
Angola until Sept. 15 _ a short extension that indicated the
council's concern about the country's deteriorating security
situation.
	   ``The situation is particularly grim as over 1 million people
are now internally displaced due to the derailment of the peace
process,'' said Slovenia's ambassador, Danilo Turk. ``There is
little doubt that UNITA bears the brunt of the responsibility for
this lamentable state of affairs.''
	   The resolution calls on U.N. chief Kofi Annan to report to the
council by the end of August on the future role of the United
Nations in Angola. Annan recently sent his personal envoy, Lakhdar
Brahimi, to the country in the wake of a surge in fighting and
reports of massacres in two provinces.
	   Brahimi had said the climate of war had dissipated, but several
council members stressed that the two sides were edging toward a
full-scale resumption of hostilities.
	   ``The people of Angola deserve a lasting peace,'' said Sweden's
ambassador, Hans Dahlgren. ``No one, least of all the civilian
population which has suffered so much already, can afford a
continued deadlock in the peace process.''

Appleby plays in a fog without his late wife

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Stuart Appleby played golf Thursday
for the first time since his wife was killed in a London car
accident, but his head wasn't in the game.
	   ``I knew it would be a tough day,'' Appleby said after shooting
a 7-over-par 77 in the first round of the PGA Championship. ``I
tried and I tried but I couldn't seem to get it right.''
	   Appleby said not seeing his wife, Renay, in the gallery ``was
hard for my brain to comprehend. I still felt her presence. Not
seeing her physically there was something I wasn't ready for.''
	   Sympathetic crowds urged Appleby on at every hole. They had read
about the accident several weeks ago in which Stuart's wife was
killed while they were unloading luggage at a train station.
	   Appleby seemed distracted but the spectators tried to pump him
up.
	   ``Good luck!'' one spectator yelled.
	   ``Hang in there, Stuart.'' another said.
	   The bearded Stuart trudged on, head down.
	   There were a few good moments, like the 12th hole, where Appleby
made a putt for birdie from the fringe. It brought a half-smile.
	   But it was obvious he couldn't concentrate.
	   On the next hole, he skulled a chip shot over the green. Then he
chipped poorly again and settled for a double-bogey 5 on the par-3
hole.
	   ``It was nice to have the crowd behind me but I was rusty both
mentally and physically,'' he said. ``I had no tempo. I was not
sharp. It was a pity I couldn't keep up the (crowd's) enthusiasm. I
was obviously unprepared.''
	   At times Appleby would squat in the fairway while he awaited the
shots of playing partners Vijay Singh and Phil Blackmar, staring at
his glove or the ground. He was snapped back to reality by the
crack of club hitting ball.
	   ``I was just trying to feel myself around,'' Appleby said. ``I
didn't expect a lot.''
	   Caddie Joe Damiano added, ``Stuart just wasn't himself.''
	   Appleby tried to explain how lonesome he felt.
	   ``I remember all the things we did together and now I have to do
them by myself,'' Appleby said. ``It was hard knowing she was not
there.''
	   The most poignant moment came at the 18th hole when spectators
rose as one to give Stuart a standing ovation.
	   Touched by the reception, Stuart allowed himself a big smile.
	   Later he joked: ``I wish they were clapping for my golf.''

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Tom Glavine pitched a two-hitter for his second
straight shutout and Chipper Jones homered and scored three runs as
Atlanta beat San Diego 5-0 Thursday to avoid being swept in a
three-game matchup of the NL's top two teams.
	   Glavine (16-4), coming off a 5-0 win at San Francisco on Friday,
became the National League's second 16-game winner. San Diego's
Andy Ashby was the first, outpitching Greg Maddux in the Padres'
5-1 win Wednesday night.
	   Glavine faced just four batters over the minimum and extended
his streak of scoreless innings to 23. Andruw Jones went 3-for-4
with two RBIs for the Braves.
	   The Braves regained a two-game lead over the Padres in the
overall NL standings.
 &UR; Pirates 9, Reds 6 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Kevin Young homered and Lou Collier hit a
tiebreaking triple as the Pittsburgh Pirates overcame a five-run
deficit to complete a three-game sweep.
	   The Pirates got their first three-game sweep in Cincinnati since
May 22-24, 1987. They hadn't swept a three-game series on the road
since they beat San Diego from June 7-9, 1996.
	   The final win of the series was the most difficult of all.
Starter Todd Van Poppel lasted only one-third of an inning, giving
up five runs on four hits and a pair of walks as the Reds pulled
ahead 5-0.
	   Pete Harnisch (8-6) blew a 5-0 lead for the second time this
season, falling apart after he retired the first nine batters. The
right-hander lost to the Pirates for the first time since 1993 _ he
was 5-0 in his last six starts against them.
 &UR; Astros 6, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Ricky Gutierrez hit a three-run triple and Jose Lima
pitched eight strong innings as the Astros won their seventh
straight.
	   Gutierrez's bases-clearing hit in the fourth helped Houston
complete a four-game sweep of the Brewers and gain its 36th
come-from-behind victory this year.
	   Steve Woodard (9-7) walked Dave Clark, Sean Berry and Craig
Biggio before Gutierrez lined a shot to the gap in right-center for
his first triple of the season to put Houston ahead 4-2.
	   Pete Incaviglia, making his first appearance for the Astros
since getting called up from Triple-A New Orleans on Monday, added
a two-run double in the eighth.
	   Lima (11-6) allowed two runs and five hits, struck out six and
walked two for his third straight victory. Woodard went seven
innings, allowed four runs on six hits.

Dollar, Tokyo stock prices fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS midday stock, bond and currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday morning
amid speculation financial authorities may intervene to support the
ailing Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices followed Wall Street
lower.
	   The dollar bought 145.34 yen as of midday, down 1.22 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of 145.16
yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 250.95 points, or 1.63 percent, to 15,131.07 at
the close of the morning session. On Thursday, the Nikkei index
edged up 3.05 points, or 0.02 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar carried over from its weakness in New
York, where the currency moved lower overnight on profit-taking
after recent gains.
	   Fears among investors that monetary authorities may intervene to
stem the yen's slide also supported the currency. On Wednesday,
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, suggested that the government was ready to
step into the market to buy yen if necessary.
	   On the stock exchange, share prices tumbled as investors grew
wary of yet more declines on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost just over 1 percent on Thursday and is down about 10
percent for the last month.
	   A brewing financial crisis in Russia, coming on the heels of the
financial meltdown in the once booming markets of Asia, also
dampened investor confidence, analysts said.
	   ``There are very few reasons to buy at this point,'' said
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Ltd.
	   While Thursday's gain by the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average
snapped an eight-day losing streak, a faltering domestic economy
will continue to weigh on stocks, analysts said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.36 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,167.35.
The TOPIX closed up 1.71 points, or 0.15 percent, the day before.
	   Trading remained light as many investors in Japan took off this
week for Japan's annual ``Obon'' summer holidays.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond slipped to 1.180 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.185 yen, pushing its price up to 111.90 yen from 111.87 yen.

Yankees keep rolling with win over Rangers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez struck out 13 and
pitched two-hit ball for 8 1-3 innings as New York, which had
beaten up on Kansas City and Minnesota so far on this homestand,
extended its winning streak to eight games Thursday night with a
2-0 victory over the Texas Rangers.
	   Hernandez (8-3) was making his first start against the Rangers,
and he kept the AL West leaders off balance all night. He struck
out Juan Gonzalez and Mike Simms three times each, mixing his
fastball with a nasty slider.
	   Hernandez set a Yankees rookie record for strikeouts in a game,
bettering Stan Bahnsen's mark of 12 against Boston on Aug. 1, 1968.
	   The Cuban right-hander left to a standing ovation after walking
Gonzalez in the ninth. Mariano Rivera got two outs for his 31st
save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 4, Angels 3
	   In Toronto, Jose Cruz Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth
inning and the Blue Jays won their fifth straight game, 4-3 over
the Anaheim Angels.
	   The Angels had their four-game winning streak stopped and
dropped to 0-5 against Toronto this season.
	   Toronto trailed 3-2 in the eighth before rallying against four
Anaheim pitcher. Shawn Green, who homered earlier, hit a two-out
double off Pep Harris, and Shigetoshi Hasegawa (6-3) gave up an
infield single to Jose Canseco.
 &UR; Red Sox 8, Twins 7
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra was 3-for-4 with a homer and the
tiebreaking double to lead the Boston Red Sox to an 8-7 victory
over the Minnesota Twins.
	   Garciaparra drove in Boston's first run with a first-inning
sacrifice fly and its second with his 25th homer, in the fourth.
	   With the score 7-all in the seventh, Garciaparra followed Mo
Vaughn's leadoff double with another two-base hit to give the Red
Sox the lead for good.
	   The reigning AL rookie of the year has 95 RBIs for the season _
26 of them in 19 games since moving to the cleanup spot. He is
hitting .358 as the No. 4 hitter, with a .704 slugging percentage.

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ A look at the first round of the PGA
Championship on Thursday at the 6,906-yard (6284-meter), par-70
Sahalee Country Club:
	    &UR; Leader: &LR;  Tiger Woods at 4-under-par 66.
	    &UR; Jumble at the top: &LR;  Eight players where two strokes back at 68,
including Paul Azinger, Bill Glasson, Glen Day and Billy Andrade.
	    &UR; Taking advantage: &LR;  Andrade, the ninth alternate, got into the
tournament when Steve Jones withdrew after the death of a close
friend.
	    &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``We are in a different mindset than the tour
players. For them it is just another week. For us it is
Christmas.'' _ PGA club pro Scott Williams after shooting a 78.
	    &UR; In the trees: &LR;  Olin Browne on the par-4 eighth hole. Browne's
tee shot stuck in a Douglas fir tree about 25 feet off the ground,
with fan Ken Betzler of Seattle climbing up to get it down.
	    &UR; Shot of the day: &LR;  Woods' 3-iron on the par-5 second hole that
somehow cleared the water to help him make birdie.
	    &UR; It's a grind: &LR;  Mark O'Meara won two majors this year by
sticking it out until the end. He started early in the PGA, coming
back after making bogeys on two of the first three holes to shoot a
69.
	    &UR; Featured threesome: &LR;  Woods, and former PGA champions Nick Price
and Jeff Sluman, 1931 GMT Friday.

Woods stays out of the woods for early lead in PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stadler, Maruyama, Elkinton at 68 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Tiger Woods couldn't attack
tree-lined Sahalee Country Club from the tee in the first round of
the PGA Championship, so he left his biggest weapon in the bag and
found another one _ his putter.
	   Striding confidently to the hole as each putt dropped for
birdie, Woods once again got into contention in a major on Thursday
by shooting a course-record, 4-under 66 for a two-stroke lead.
	   Three others still on the course at 2-under _ Craig Stadler,
Ignacio Garrido and Jesper Parnevik _ still had a chance to catch
him.
	   ``What did it look like? A lot of rough, a lot of trees,'' Woods
said. ``But overall, I saw a lot of putts go in the hole. And
that's definitely not a bad thing.''
	   Sahalee had plenty of bad things in store for others who tried
to navigate its narrow fairways in pursuit of the early score
posted by Woods.
	   Glen Day was leading at 5-under until he found the rough on the
15th hole, then three-putted from for double bogey. Frank Lickliter
had a chance to catch Woods until he put his tee shot on the par-3
17th into the water.
	   Craig Stadler, playing for the first time in six weeks, birdied
the 16th and 17th holes and had a birdie putt for 66 until he
three-putted.
	   All of them finished at 68, along with Bill Glasson, Bob Estes,
Shigeki Maruyama and 1993 PGA champion Paul Azinger.
	   And then there's Olin Browne, who found out the hard way about
the unforgiving forest of Sahalee. His tee shot into a red cedar on
No. 8 didn't come down until a barefooted fan scaled the tree to
find it.
	   Browne took an unplayable lie, and eventually a double bogey.
	   Even Glasson took his lumps, his 68 marred by a double bogey on
the ``goal post'' hole, the par-5 11th, and a bogey on No. 18.
	   Sahalee came out a winner in its first test for the world's best
golfers. With two-thirds of the field finished, just 25 players
were under par, and 10 of them were still on the course.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
season, got off to a rocky start with bogeys on two of the first
three holes.
	   But O'Meara is all about great finishes, and he once again found
a way to hang around the lead. He played bogey-free the rest of the
way and finished with a 69.
	   Also at 69 were 1986 PGA champion Bob Tway, Steve Stricker and
Kenny Perry, who lost the PGA in a playoff to Mark Brooks at
Valhalla two years ago.
	   Nick Price wasted strong iron play by missing several birdie
putts and finished at 70, along with Justin Leonard, Ryder Cup
captain Ben Crenshaw and defending champion Davis Love III.
	   ``It was a very bad ball-striking round on a day when the course
will play the easiest it will ever play,'' said Love, trying to
become the first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute in 1937.
	   Woods hasn't won a major since the 1997 Masters, in which he was
fearless with the driver on an Augusta National course that
features generous, rough-free fairways.
	   Sahalee doesn't allow for that, not with its towering firs and
cedars that spread their limbs to the edge of fairways and swat
errant shots into ankle-deep rough.
	   Just ask David Duval, Payne Stewart and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen. All of them shot 76 and may have to be more aggressive _ a
daunting task at Sahalee _ if they want to stick around for the
weekend.
	   John Daly played aggressive from the start and got predictable
results _ he didn't birdie either par 5, took triple bogey on the
the 18th and shot 80.
	   Fred Couples, the hometown favorite, took double bogey on No. 18
and finished with a 74.
	   Woods learned about Sahalee's dangers early. He blocked his
2-iron into the right rough on the first hole, hacked out into
rough around the green and took a bogey.
	   But the round turned in his favor quickly when he got away with
a mistake. Woods had 220 yards (200 meters) to the green on the
par-5 second hole and aimed conservatively to the middle. But he
hung his 3-iron out to the right _ straight at the flag, but
directly over the water.
	   ``I thought for sure the ball was wet,'' he said.
	   It cleared the water by about six feet (1.8 meters) and wound up
on the fringe, where Woods got up and down for a birdie.
	   ``From there, I felt at ease with myself,'' he said.
	   The rest of the round was simply a careful walk down the
treacherous, tight fairways of Sahalee.
	   Throughout the day, Woods kept one thought in the back of his
head.
	   ``Hang in there, be patient, hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and give myself a chance,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit
the ball in the center of the green and attack from there.''
	   Putting is what plagued Woods more than anything in the U.S.
Open, in which he had two four-putts, and at Royal Birkdale.

 &UR; YANGON: 1988 uprising.

<TEXT>
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a military guest
house in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have
described them as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The military government issued a statement this week, however,
saying their release had been delayed because they were being
uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting the population to
revolt, while at the same time avoiding repercussions from the
governments of countries from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a British
national, James Mawdsley, to five years in prison for also handing
out pro-democracy leaflets in Yangon.
	   He was released after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning from the government not to return.

 &UR; Eighteen foreigners arrested in Myanmar will be tried Friday
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; minor editing

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreigners arrested last week
for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in Myanmar's capital Yangon
were to go on trial Friday morning, the government said.
	   The trial for the 18, from six Asian and Western nations, was to
begin at 10 a.m. (0300 GMT) at a court in Insein, a northern suburb
of Yangon that is home to a prison where political detainees are
usually kept.
	   Those arrested include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   They were detained on Sunday, the day after the 10th anniversary
of a nationwide democracy uprising that was brutally crushed by the
military, for handing out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling
them the outside world supported their struggle for democracy.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a military guest
house in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have
described them as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The military government issued a statement this week, however,
saying their release had been delayed because they were being
uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign

receive if convicted. Mawdsley was represented by a Myanmar lawyer
at his trial.
	   Insein prison, which sits just beyond the court, is where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept along with violent
criminals.

Woods stays out of the woods for early lead in PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to reflect Stadler at 69 sted 68
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Tiger Woods couldn't attack
tree-lined Sahalee Country Club from the tee in the first round of
the PGA Championship, so he left his biggest weapon in the bag and
found another one _ his putter.
	   Striding confidently to the hole as each putt dropped for
birdie, Woods once again got into contention in a major on Thursday
by shooting a course-record, 4-under 66 for a two-stroke lead.
	   Three others still on the course at 2-under _ Craig Stadler,
Ignacio Garrido and Jesper Parnevik _ still had a chance to catch
him.
	   ``What did it look like? A lot of rough, a lot of trees,'' Woods
said. ``But overall, I saw a lot of putts go in the hole. And
that's definitely not a bad thing.''
	   Sahalee had plenty of bad things in store for others who tried
to navigate its narrow fairways in pursuit of the early score
posted by Woods.
	   Glen Day was leading at 5-under until he found the rough on the
15th hole, then three-putted from for double bogey. Frank Lickliter
had a chance to catch Woods until he put his tee shot on the par-3
17th into the water.
	   All of them finished at 68, along with Bill Glasson, Bob Estes,
Shigeki Maruyama and 1993 PGA champion Paul Azinger.
	   And then there's Olin Browne, who found out the hard way about
the unforgiving forest of Sahalee. His tee shot into a red cedar on
No. 8 didn't come down until a barefooted fan scaled the tree to
find it.
	   Browne took an unplayable lie, and eventually a double bogey.
	   Even Glasson took his lumps, his 68 marred by a double bogey on
the ``goal post'' hole, the par-5 11th, and a bogey on No. 18.
	   Sahalee came out a winner in its first test for the world's best
golfers. With two-thirds of the field finished, just 25 players
were under par, and 10 of them were still on the course.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
season, got off to a rocky start with bogeys on two of the first
three holes.
	   But O'Meara is all about great finishes, and he once again found
a way to hang around the lead. He played bogey-free the rest of the
way and finished with a 69.
	   Also at 69 were 1986 PGA champion Bob Tway, Steve Stricker,
Craig Stadler and Kenny Perry, who lost the PGA in a playoff to
Mark Brooks at Valhalla two years ago.
	   Nick Price wasted strong iron play by missing several birdie
putts and finished at 70, along with Justin Leonard, Ryder Cup
captain Ben Crenshaw and defending champion Davis Love III.
	   ``It was a very bad ball-striking round on a day when the course
will play the easiest it will ever play,'' said Love, trying to
become the first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute in 1937.
	   Woods hasn't won a major since the 1997 Masters, in which he was
fearless with the driver on an Augusta National course that
features generous, rough-free fairways.
	   Sahalee doesn't allow for that, not with its towering firs and
cedars that spread their limbs to the edge of fairways and swat
errant shots into ankle-deep rough.
	   Just ask David Duval, Payne Stewart and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen. All of them shot 76 and may have to be more aggressive _ a
daunting task at Sahalee _ if they want to stick around for the
weekend.
	   John Daly played aggressive from the start and got predictable
results _ he didn't birdie either par 5, took triple bogey on the
the 18th and shot 80.
	   Fred Couples, the hometown favorite, took double bogey on No. 18
and finished with a 74.
	   Woods learned about Sahalee's dangers early. He blocked his
2-iron into the right rough on the first hole, hacked out into
rough around the green and took a bogey.
	   But the round turned in his favor quickly when he got away with
a mistake. Woods had 220 yards (200 meters) to the green on the
par-5 second hole and aimed conservatively to the middle. But he
hung his 3-iron out to the right _ straight at the flag, but
directly over the water.
	   ``I thought for sure the ball was wet,'' he said.
	   It cleared the water by about six feet (1.8 meters) and wound up
on the fringe, where Woods got up and down for a birdie.
	   ``From there, I felt at ease with myself,'' he said.
	   The rest of the round was simply a careful walk down the
treacherous, tight fairways of Sahalee.
	   Throughout the day, Woods kept one thought in the back of his
head.
	   ``Hang in there, be patient, hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and give myself a chance,'' he said. ``I was trying to hit
the ball in the center of the green and attack from there.''
	   Putting is what plagued Woods more than anything in the U.S.
Open, in which he had two four-putts, and at Royal Birkdale.

Japan again delays remote satellite link-up attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Technical difficulties forced Japan's space agency
to again delay a docking experiment between two orbiting research
satellites, a spokeswoman said Friday.
	   The trouble occurred when one of the satellites, the ``Hikoboshi
(Altair),'' approached the ``Orihime'' (Vega) at a distance of
about 140 meters (459 feet) Thursday evening, said Megumi Nakamura
of the National Space Development Agency.
	   On July 7, the agency successfully docked the two satellites,
the first time such an outer space maneuver had been conducted via
remote control from Earth.
	   In the latest attempt, Nakamura said the Hikoboshi's positioning
system went out of control at around 9:00 p.m. Thursday (1200 GMT).
A collision-prevention system was automatically activated, making
the two satellites move apart, she said.
	   Agency technicians were investigating the cause of the trouble,
Nakamura said. She said officials would decide on Monday whether to
attempt another docking.
	   It was the third such failure in less than a week.
	   A thrust-related problem prevented the satellites from coming
close enough to carry out a planned rendezvous last Saturday. A
separate problem prevented the maneuver from taking place as
originally scheduled last Friday.
	   Japan hopes its remote-controlled docking experiments can
eventually help to ferry regular supply shipments by unmanned
spacecraft to the space stations of the future.
	   Japan is spending dlrs 2.2 billion to build four modules for the
International Space Station, a joint project with the United
States, Russia and the European Space Agency that is scheduled for
completion in 2003.

Fielder clears waivers, signs with Indians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians signed Cecil Fielder on
Thursday after he cleared waivers, hoping he can help them ease the
loss of injured first baseman Jim Thome.
	   Fielder, 34, hit .241 with 17 homers and 68 RBIs in 103 games
for Anaheim before the Angels designated him for assignment on Aug.
5.
	   ``For one thing, he should help us in situations against
left-handers where we've been a little vulnerable this year,''
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said after a 7-4 loss in 12 innings
to Baltimore. ``He should give us a little thunder off the bench,
especially with Jimmy Thome being out.''
	   Fielder will join the Indians at Jacobs Field for Friday night's
game against the Orioles. Cleveland will make a roster move Friday
to clear room for Fielder.
	   ``I think Cecil Fielder would be an interesting guy for this
ballclub,'' general manager John Hart said before Cleveland played
Thursday night. ``He's a big guy. He's got power. He's familiar
with our league. If you look at left-handed pitching, I think there
could be some opportunities there for Cecil.''
	   The 6-foot-3 (1.88-meter), 261-pound (117-kilogram) first
baseman, known as ``Big Daddy,'' hit 51 homers for Detroit in 1990.
He was a key late-season addition to the New York Yankees in 1996,
helping them get to and win the World Series.

Thailand unveils package to rescue financial system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with names of institutions taken over, other details

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank Friday said it
would take over two debt-ridden banks and five finance companies as
part of a comprehensive package to rescue the country's tottering
financial system.
	   An effective plan is considered essential for reviving the
recession-bound economy. Thailand's financial sector all but
collapsed last year after a slowdown in the economy exposed
insolvency in companies in many sectors of business.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said
non-performing loans will be written off existing shareholder
equity. The institutions' 10 baht (25 U.S. cents) shares will be
written down to .01 baht a share.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will then take over the seven institutions with
swaps of debt for new shares. In some cases cash will also have to
be injected, and at a later stage the institutions will be merged
with others or possibly offered for sale.
	   The remainder of the government's salvage program is to be
announced later Friday.
	   On the eve of the announcement, the central bank said it has
prepared a large amount of cash in case of a run by nervous
depositors.
	   Local television stations reported Thursday that small
depositors had rushed to withdraw their money from some of the four
commercial banks taken over by the central bank earlier this year.
But the reports said major clients of those banks did not join the
move.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said the
financial institutions nationalized Friday, including the Laem
Thong Bank and the Union Bank of Bangkok, will continue to operate
as normal.
	   Laem Thong Bank is to be merged with Radhanasin Bank, which will
look for ``foreign strategic partners,'' he said. The Union Bank of
Bangkok will be merged with Krungthai Thanakit, a state-owned
finance company.
	   The finance companies taken over are Dhana Siam Finance &AMP;
Securities, First City Investments, IFCT Finance &AMP; Securities,
Vajiradhanathun Finance Co. Ltd., and Thai Summit Finance &AMP;
Securities Ltd.
	   Share prices on the Stock Exchange of Thailand ended slightly
lower in moderate trading Thursday ahead of the expected banking
announcement.
	   A dealer at Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said some
investors would rather wait to buy shares of strong financial
institutions Friday when market sentiment is expected to be
depressed.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt.
	   Domestic political pressure is rising on the government, with
unemployment expected to hit almost 3 million this year, up from 1
million last year.
	   Opposition politicians have accused the government of committing
billions to prop up financial institutions owned by rich families,
while the poor suffer from factory closures and rising food prices.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to help rescue Thailand's economy.

Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   The government has not said what charges they will face. But
most political detainees are charged under section 5j of the 1950
Emergency Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows authorities to
hand out maximum 20-year jail sentences for attempting to incite
unrest or disrupt the peace and stability of the state.
	   The foreigners were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide democracy uprising that was brutally
crushed by the military, for handing out small cards to Myanmar
citizens telling them the outside world supported their struggle
for democracy.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a military guest
house in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have
described them as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The military government issued a statement this week, however,
saying their release had been delayed because they were being
uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting the population to
revolt, while at the same time avoiding repercussions from the
governments of countries from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a British
national, James Mawdsley, to five years in prison for also handing
out pro-democracy leaflets in Yangon. He was released after three
months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning from the government not to return.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy activists and human rights groups have said.
Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused, they say. Most trials take less than an hour, as the
sentence has already been decided by officials higher up in the
government, the activists and groups say.
	   The foreigners are unlikely, however, to receive the same
treatment. Mawdsley was represented by a Myanmar lawyer at his
trial.
	   Insein prison, which sits just beyond the court, is where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept along with violent
criminals.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.
	   In 1995, the International Red Cross pulled out of Myanmar in
protest after it was not allowed access to political prisoners.

More than 7,000 people pardoned in South Korean amnesty
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung approved a
sweeping amnesty Friday that freed, among others, 103 political
prisoners who signed a controversial oath to obey South Korea's
laws, including one that makes it a crime to espouse communism.
	   The amnesty affecting 7,007 people in and out of prison will
take effect Saturday, the 53rd anniversary of Korea's independence
from Japanese colonial rule in 1945. South Korea has marked past
anniversaries with similar pardons.
	   Missing from the list of those granted amnesty were an estimated
400 political prisoners, including 17 who have served 30 years or
more behind bars, often in solitary confinement. They refused to
sign the oath.
	   The 103 political prisoners who did vow to obey the law were
among 2,174 inmates to be freed. Thirteen inmates will have their
prison terms reduced and 4,820 people will have their civil rights
restored.
	   ``The amnesty is aimed at achieving a grand national
conciliation in the midst of a national economic crisis,'' Justice
Minister Park Sang-chun told a nationally televised news
conference.
	   But human rights groups expressed disappointment, saying that
many political prisoners chose to remain in jail rather than swear
to obey draconian security laws as a prerequisite for release.
	   ``The oath requires prisoners to respect the national security
law _ a law which is used frequently to jail people for exercising
their freedom of expression,'' London-based Amnesty International
said in a statement.
	   ``Maintaining state security does not mean locking people up for
having left-wing views or keeping them locked up because they
refuse to accept a law which violates fundamental human rights,''
it said.
	   South Korea's largest human rights group Minkahyup also
denounced the oath, saying that many political prisoners regard it
as humiliating.
	   ``How can they swear an oath to obey the very law against which
they have fought? '' Nam Kyu-sun, a Minkahyup spokeswoman, said.
	   South Korea's national security law bans any activity that may
benefit its enemy, communist North Korea. The law has often been
used by past military governments to suppress political dissent.
	   The law is so broadly interpreted that even possession of
Marxist literature is a crime.
	   Among those to be freed are several labor activists convicted of
communist activities. They include Park No-hae, 41, a noted poet
who allegedly eulogized late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
	   Several former army generals will have their civil rights
restored. They were convicted of being involved in the bloody
military suppression of a 1980 pro-democracy uprising in the
southern city of Kwangju.
	   The 17 long-serving political prisoners were convicted of being
North Korean spies in the 1950s and 60s. They include Woo Yang-gak,
a former North Korean soldier who has been jailed for 40 years and
is considered the world's longest-serving political prisoner.
	   They have repeatedly rejected past government offers to free
them if they signed a statement swearing to abandon their
ideological beliefs.
	   Amnesty International and other civil rights groups contend the
new condition imposed by Kim's government is little different than
the old one.
	   Kim himself was once the target of repression by former military
governments. As a pro-democracy campaigner, he spent years in
prison and under house arrest, and human rights groups fault him
for not seeking repeal of the laws under which he was persecuted.

Visiting Arabs helping Egypt recover from tourism doldrums
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Last November's massacre of 58 foreigners at
an ancient temple left Egyptian tourism in tatters. Now the country
is getting a crush of visitors, most more drawn to shops and
nightclubs than Pharaonic monuments.
	   Arabs from the oil-rich Gulf _ men in their white dishdasha
robes and women swathed in black _ are crowding into Cairo hotels,
restaurants and shopping malls.
	   While Gulf Arabs usually come in the summer to escape
stultifying heat at home, tourism officials say this year's numbers
are far greater, in part because of Egypt's first Shopping and
Tourism Festival that started in mid-July.
	   ``Thank God, I am on my feet again. I thought it would take
years to see tourists back,'' said Mohammed Osman, owner of Amarco
Travel in Cairo.
	   Osman, deputy head of Egypt's Chamber of the Tourism Industry,
said that hotel occupancy is high in Cairo despite exceptional heat
here and that most hotels are booked through September.
	   The shopping festival _ an idea the Gulf emirate of Dubai
originated two years ago _ includes sales in stores and discounts
of up to 40 percent on EgyptAir flights and up to 50 percent in
hotels. It lasts until Aug. 20.
	   Egypt also used other ways to draw Arab tourists.
	   After the killing of 58 foreigners Nov. 17 by Muslim radicals at
Luxor in southern Egypt, the government quickly pleaded with fellow
Arab states to encourage visits. It also ran promotions in Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
	   Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui repeated a simple message
to his Arab neighbors: To help us, you must come as an example to
Westerners that Egypt is safe. But there are other reasons to visit
Egypt.
	   While the Middle East is having a heat wave, this week's highs
of 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) in Cairo are well below the
43 degree temperatures (109 Fahrenheit) in Dubai or 46 (115
Fahrenheit) in Mecca.
	   Life in Egypt also is more free-wheeling than in conservative
Gulf states which enforce strict Islamic rules.
	   In Egypt, men and women swim together at beaches and hotel
pools. Many restaurants serve alcohol, and nightclubs along Cairo's
Pyramid Road are famous for belly dancers and other enticements for
male customers.
	   In fact, some rich Arab visitors temporarily ``marry'' young
Egyptian women _ an old practice to skirt the Islamic prohibition
on premarital sex. While opposed by most Muslim clerics, it is
still sometimes employed.
	   Officials do not yet have figures on Arab visitors for the
shopping festival. But in the first four months of the year, Arab
tourism was up 14 percent over 1997, and major hotels in Cairo are
reporting occupancy rates this week of 90-100 percent.
	   Carmen Razy, sales manager of the Ramses Hilton Hotel, said the
1,200-plus rooms in the Ramses and the nearby Nile Hilton were all
full.
	   Still, it's uncertain whether the rush of Arabs will translate
into a general recovery for tourism, which was Egypt's second
leading foreign currency earner behind salaries sent home by
Egyptian workers abroad.
	   Arabs made up only about 20 percent of the 3.6 million tourists
to Egypt last year. And while Arab tourism was up 14 percent in
January-April over last year, overall tourism was down 33 percent
for the same period.
	   It's too early to say if Western tourists will return for the
winter season starting in November _ or if they will go back to
Luxor. But many in the tourism industry believe Egypt's ancient
monuments eventually will bring back Europeans, Americans and
Asians.
	   ``There is one place in the world where you can see the
Pyramids, the Sphinx and the Pharaonic temples in Luxor and
Aswan,'' said Razy, the Hilton sales manager.

Report: Japan selling more autos in Latin America, Middle East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to change sourcing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing weak demand in key Asian and Western
markets, Japan's automakers are boosting exports to Latin America
and the Middle East, an industry group said Friday.
	   Automakers shipped 256,000 cars to Central and South America in
the first six months of 1998, up 30 percent from the same period
last year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   That's the most cars Japan has ever exported to the region, the
association said.
	   Exports to the Middle East were also robust, reaching a
five-year high. Japanese automakers shipped 180,000 cars to the
region for an increase of 20.5 percent, it said.
	   Most of the gains came in sales of smaller models. Exports to
Latin America of Honda Motor Corp.'s small-sized Civic surged 70
percent in the first six months.
	   The gains come as a severe economic crisis has slashed demand by
more than half _ from 315,000 cars exported to 141,000 _ in Asia,
the region Japanese automakers had seen as their key growth market,
the association said.
	   Exports to the United States and Europe have also stalled as
Japanese automakers produce more cars locally to avoid trade
friction, it said. Domestic sales have been hurt by a long economic
slump.

Ruiz wins 1-meter gold, Wilkinson enters platform with most points
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to FIX slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Mark Ruiz, the bronze medalist in the Goodwill
Games last month in the men's 1-meter springboard, won gold in the
same event Thursday night in the U.S. National Diving
Championships.
	   The dive that made the difference at the Georgia Tech Aquatic
Center was his fourth attempt, a reverse 2 1/2 somersault that was
awarded three scores of 9.0.
	   ``My confidence level is pretty high right now,'' said Ruiz, a
19-year-old native of Puerto Rico and a resident of Orlando,
Florida. ``I felt pretty good going in, so I can't say I was
surprised to win.''
	   Ruiz, who also enters Sunday's platform competition in first
place, beat silver medalist Troy Dumais by 22.92 points. Dumais, an
18-year-old Los Angeles resident, said a left foot injury proved
too much to overcome.
	   The swelling in his foot, coupled by Ruiz's standout effort,
prevented Dumais from winning his first 1-meter event since taking
gold in the 1997 world junior championships.
	   ``Sure, I would have liked to win, but it just didn't work
out,'' Dumais said. ``Mark was really on tonight and given what I
was up against I feel pretty good about what I did.''
	   P.J. Bogart, 24, a former University of Minnesota standout, took
the bronze, 24.21 points behind Ruiz.
	   In the women's platform competition earlier Thursday night,
Danielle Guarneri, an Orlando, Florida, resident and a rising
junior at Texas A and M, took first place. But even though she goes
into Sunday's final the No. 1 seed, Guarneri enters the event with
only 155.43 points _ last among the eight divers in the last round.
	   Laura Wilkinson, the platform gold medalist in the Goodwill
Games last month, enters the final as the sixth seed but will carry
the most points _ 187.92 _ into Sunday's final event for women.
	   Divers who score high in the semifinals, a four-dive event
consisting only of voluntary attempts, can carry more points into
the final.
	   Wilkinson, the platform gold medalist in the Goodwill Games, was
14th at the end of the quarterfinals. The difference for Wilkinson
was her penultimate dive, a back 1 1/2-somersault with a half-twist
that gave her the only 10 of the night.
	   Kathy Pesek takes the second-most points into the final, 168.27,
and Powers was third with 167.85.
	   Guarneri moved into first place on her second effort of the
optional five-dive quarterfinals. The second attempt, a back dive
with 2 1/2 somersaults, was awarded 65.25 points. Her third, an
inward dive with 2 1/2 somersaults, was good for 56.7.
	   ``My confidence level is really high right now,'' said Guarneri,
adding that the performance was the highlight of her career. ``I
would have been happy just to make the top eight. To be in first
place is incredible.''
	   Kathy Pesek, a junior at Tennessee and a native of Houston,
balked on her final attempt, which would have been a forward dive
with 1 1/2 somersaults and one twist. She called the balk on
herself.
	   ``I started to go and I realized it was the wrong foot,'' Pesek
said. ``I took one little step and stopped and I balked.''
	   As a result, Pesek had two points deducted from her semifinal
total. But thanks to an event-high 67.2-point effort on her final
attempt of the quarterfinals, an inward dive with 2 1/2
somersaults, Pesek still finished second.
	   Powers, a Cincinnati native and a freshman at Stanford, moved
into third on her next-to-last attempt, an armstand forward
somersault.
	   Erica Sorgi, who finished sixth in the Goodwill Games and
another platform favorite, removed herself from the event because
of exhaustion.
	   ``I've been to a lot of meets this year,'' said the 16-year-old
resident of Mission Viejo, California. ``I did the Goodwill Games,
juniors and this all in a row. It's hard.''
	   Sorgi said she still plans to compete in the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard competition. She leads the 3-meter entering the finals
Saturday. The women's 1-meter finals are set for Friday night.

Tom Dolan bounces back, wins 400-meter individual medley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Tom Dolan bounced back from a
disappointing performance to win the 400-meter individual medley at
the U.S. Swimming Championships Thursday night.
	   Dolan, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 400 IM, suffered an
asthma attack in the 800 freestyle finals Tuesday night at the
Clovis Olympic Swim Complex. He was the top seed going into that
race and ended up taking 14th overall.
	   ``Going into that race, I felt I was going to break the American
record. I felt really good, but then after about 300 meters I just
couldn't breathe,'' Dolan said.
	   Dolan had no problems dominating the field in the 400 IM,
winning with a time of 4 minutes,16.33 seconds, more than two
seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Wilkins.
	   ``After this morning, I thought I was going to have a real good
swim in the finals,'' Dolan said. ``Usually when I have a good
morning swim it is a good sign, but right from the start of the
finals I could tell it was not going to be what I wanted. The time
is not that good for me. Fortunately it was good enough to win.''
	   Cristina Teuscher's bid for a double win came up just short as
she finished second in the finals of both the 200 freestyle and 400
IM.
	   Lindsay Benko won the 200 freestyle in 2:00.67. Maddy Crippen
won the 400 IM in 4:42.61.
	   Crippen was swimming in her third event of the championships
after taking fifth in both the 200 backstroke and 200 butterfly
Wednesday night.
	   Ugur Taner won the men's 200 freestyle in 1:48.91, nipping Josh
Davis at the finish.
	   ``I was pleased with the win, but I would have like to gone
faster,'' Taner said. ``I think I am capable of swimming a 1:47.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A factory worker walked into his
ex-manager's office and shot and killed him as revenge for being
fired, police said Thursday.
	   The man fired six shots at the boss after entering the factory
in Sao Carlos, 140 miles (220 kms) north of Sao Paulo, on
Wednesday, said military policeman Valdemir Dias.
	   Over 4,000 workers from the refrigerator parts manufacturer,
Tecunseh of Brazil, were evacuated as the 31 year old then held a
gun to his own head, said Dias.
	   After five hours of negotiation with police, the man
relinquished the weapon and was arrested, he added.
	   ``He alleges he was dismissed unfairly from his job two years
ago. He was frustrated because he could not find work since,'' said
Dias.
