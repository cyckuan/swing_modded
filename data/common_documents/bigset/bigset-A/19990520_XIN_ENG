<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called upon Ethiopia and Eritrea to end "inflammatory
rhetoric" and "to comply immediately and in full with" relevant
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-nation Council, Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon, said that
members of the Security Council "appeal to both sides for an end
to inflammatory rhetoric."
</P>
<P>
"They urged both parties to comply immediately and in full with
Security Council resolution 1227," which was adopted on February
10, 1999, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They expressed their dismay at the continuing fighting and
loss of life," the statement said, "They also expressed concern
about the humanitarian situation" in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "They reaffirmed that the OAU (the Organization of
African Unity) Framework Agreement represents a viable and sound
basis for the political settlement of this dispute," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members, voicing its welcome to the region
by the U.N. special envoy, "reaffirmed the Council's support for
the Secretary-General in coordination with OAU to promote a
peaceful solution to the conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was announced shortly after the closed-door
consultations on the conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which
featured the briefing on the latest development in the Horn of
Africa by the U.N. special envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council session kicked off after Ethiopia launched
a dawn bombing raid on an Eritrean city Sunday, its second strikes
in two days and a sign that a month of peace negotiations were
floundering.
</P>
<P>
Shanoun, who just returned from a visit to the region, was
seeking a ceasefire as a first step towards ending the war, U.N.
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been fighting over their
1,000-kilometer border, which was not clearly marked when Eritrea
gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Both the African countries have accepted a peace plan
hammered out by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but
they disagree over how to implement it. The plan calls for both
parties to withdraw from areas captured since the start of the
war in May last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
extended sanctions on Myanmar for another year because he said the
south-east Asian nation refuses to take the so-called U.S. model
of democracy and poses threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Congress on Tuesday, Clinton said his decision
continued a "prohibition on new investment" in Myanmar by
Americans. The sanctions had been due to expire on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar's present situation "continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has used so-called "threat" from small
nations as a pretext to impose sanctions against them and even
taken military actions as in the case of Iraq and Yugoslavia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- King Abdullah of Jordan on
Wednesday appealed to leading industrialized nations to give him a
3 billion U.S. dollars break by forgiving almost half of what his
country owes them.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, King Abdullah said Jordan owes 7
billion U.S. dollars to the industrialized nations and 3 billion
U.S. dollars in relief was essential "to give us a fighting chance
to get on our feet" and go on with a process of placing more of
the country's resources in private hands.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah, who succeeded his father, King Hussein, three
months ago, also pledged economic and bureaucratic reform at home
as well as a drive against corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan need to be strong economically to support
peacemaking between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty Hussein signed with Israel in 1994 raised
expectations of an economic miracle in Jordan. It did not
develop. At the same time, Jordan cut its trade with Iraq
dramatically and is looking westward for economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The dividends of peace we haven't been able to see," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said if Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon could reach peace agreements, "it would really transform
the whole area."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Welcomes Peace Accord in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday extended its welcome to the Tuesday signing of a
cease-fire agreement in the Togolese capital Lome, which commits
both warring parties in Sierra Leone to observe a cease-fire as of
May 24.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-member Council, Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon, said, "The
members of the Council expressed their appreciation to all those
who had helped to facilitate the agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council urged the parties to implement
fully all provisions of the May 18 agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "urged the parties to work constructively
and in good faith to establish a wider and more comprehensive
peace agreement during the negotiations scheduled to begin in
Lome, Togo, on May 25," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Ahlhaji Tejan Kabbah has agreed to a
cease-fire offer made by revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Lome.
Reports from West Africa say the president penned his signature on
a cease-fire agreement after four-hour comprehensive dialogue with
the RUF leader Corporal Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
The talks were hosted by President Gnassingbo Eyadema of Togo,
who is current chairman of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), which is making painstaking efforts to maintain
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Present at the signing ceremony in Lome were Francis Okelo,
U.N. special envoy for Sierra Leone, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the
United States Presidential Special Envoy for the Promotion of
Democracy in Africa, and the representative of the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The agreement commences on May 24 with peace talks starting
the day after. The peace accord allows for the release of
prisoners of war and civilians by the rebels, along with aid
agency access to desperate people on all sides.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the war and
hundreds of thousands have fled to take refuge in neighboring
countries. The rebels have committed widespread atrocities
against civilians in the West African country, and such an
action has been repeatedly condemned by the U.N. Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Says Trusts Newly Elected Israeli Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- King Abdullah of Jordan said
on Wednesday that he trusts Israel's newly elected prime minister
Ehud Barak and expected he will take Israel into a "new phase of
peace."
</P>
<P>
"I liked the man. He seemed to be very focused ... I think
there's trust and confidence between us," said the king, who met
Barak over lunch in Amman two weeks ago for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the type of man to take Israel into a new phase
of peace and stability in the region," he told a gathering at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 but retains
a keen interest in Israeli-Palestinian talks because of its
close historical relations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said his country would do what it could to help the
Israelis and Palestinians make progress in talks, which were
deadlocked during the last six months of rule by outgoing
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Barak's overwhelming victory shows the commitment of the
people of Israel to move forward and we must do our utmost to
support our friends in Israel and our Palestinian brothers to
achieve those ends as quickly as we can," the king said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned against great expectation from the just
concluded Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
"If we have this increase of aspirations and nothing happens
four or five months down the line, frustration could have an
even worse backlash than we had several months ago," the king said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Military contractors in the United
States are expected to get growing government procurement of
weaponry amid the U.S.-led NATO war against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, U.S. media reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the New York Times on Wednesday, the Pentagon has
earmarked 53 billion U.S. dollars for weapons buying in 2000 and
60 billion dollars for 2001, compared with 44 billion dollars in
1998, the lowest level in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The spending increases would be used to replenish stocks of
ships and aircraft, radar jammers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has drawn up a list including additional F-22's,
upgrades of the Abrams tanks and Apache helicopter, a new
destroyer, attack submarine and a new aircraft carrier, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. weapons makers have been lobbying for years for an
increase of military spending and an expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with 19 member countries.
</P>
<P>
They want to see a growing number of not only local but also
European buyers to come for precision bombs, smart weapons and
communications systems, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
Before the NATO started air raids on Yugoslavia, U.S. budget
proposal in February had requested 112 billion dollars in
additional military spending over the next five years to bring
Pentagon's budget up to 319 billion dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The increase would be the biggest since the late 1980s.

LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku announced Wednesday in London the lifting of
Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth, the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) reported.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said in a statement that the decision to lift the

Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which met in London on April 29
this year, to review Nigeria's transition to civil democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Commonwealth heads of government have unanimously endorsed
CMAG's recommendation that Nigeria's suspension should be lifted,"
he said, adding "I am delighted that an unfortunate episode in
Nigeria-Commonwealth relations will now come to an end."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Vietnam to Improve Public Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday that it has approved a credit of 80.5 million U.S.
dollars for Vietnam in order to improve public health and increase
economic development in three key urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Cities Sanitation Project aims to promote
sustainable public health improvements in the cities of Da Nang,
Haiphong, and Quang Ninh Province (Halong City and Cam Pha)," said
Andrew Steer, director of the World Bank in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"It will reduce the incidence of water-borne disease,
environmental degradation, and the effects of flooding and poor
sanitation that particularly affect the urban poor," he added.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the project are to upgrade the urban
environment and reduce pollution through programs in sewerage and
appropriate sewage treatment drainage, solid waste management, and
strengthening the capacity of the city agencies responsible for
providing sanitation services, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the project will not only benefit the public, but
also economic development as well. It will raise productivity and
competitiveness, making the cities more attractive to investors.
It also will reduce the disruptive effects of flooding to
businesses and production, ensure a healthier workforce, improve
beaches for the tourism industry, and increase property values.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, the lending arm of the World Bank for poor countries,
and will be payable in 40 years, including a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Australia, Denmark and Finland are currently
providing grants to assist with project preparation and they will
also provide further grant assistance primarily for consultancy
services during implementation of the project, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is approximately 120 million
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail on Wednesday condemned as "a barbaric act" the NATO's
air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade early this month.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with visiting Chadian Foreign
Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who arrived here on Tuesday on a
two-day official visit to Sudan, Ismail said "no regional
organization should enforce law by itself or bomb indiscriminately
civilian and military targets as is the case in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched on May 7 a
missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade which led to the
deaths of three Chinese journalists and seriously wounded more
than 20 embassy staff members.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister called on the United States-led
western military bloc to make an official apology to China and
compensate for the damages caused by the attack.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would visit Cairo on Saturday to meet Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the normalization of relations
between Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister expressed hope that the talks
between the two neighbors would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Ismail's visit to Cairo
aims to prepare for an anticipated summit between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart Omar
Al-Bashir with a view to improving the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese-Egyptian relations have been strained since an
assasination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995. The two
countries have also been at odds over the border Halaib triangle.
</P>
<P>
Ismail added he intended to start a two-week tour to
France, Germany, Spain, Finland and Algeria under the invitations
from his counterparts of these countries. His visit will mainly
tackle the situation in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Gaps Remain With Russia over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Major gaps still remain between
the United States and Russia over the Kosovo crisis despite
progress in their negotiations, U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that we continue to make headway, that we are
moving towards agreement, not away from agreement, that we're
broadening the areas of agreement with Russia. But clearly, there
are major gaps that remain," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott said there were no fundamental differences left between
the United States and Russia on solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Talbott made the remarks to Finnish television MTV3 after he
held talks with Russian Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"There is really no fundamental difference among any of the
parties that were discussing this issue here today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will fly to Belgrade while Talbott will go to Bonn
to attend a meeting by the western powers and Russia on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States
expected Chernomyrdin to present Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic with the proposed deployment of an international force
to keep the peace in Kosovo after the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
Russia accepted the principle of a peacekeeping force at a
meeting with NATO foreign ministers two weeks ago. However, the
allies want NATO troops at the core.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said th Clinton administration believes the air campaign over
Kosovo will achieve NATO's political goal.
</P>
<P>
No change was made in NATO policy of insisting that ground
troops would get involved in Kosovo only as peacekeepers and only
in the event of an agreement with Belgrade or a U.N. Security
Council authorization, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bill Clinton said that NATO "will not
take any option off the table," suggesting that ground troops may
be deployed in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Rules out War with Egypt over Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia on Wednesday ruled out a war
with Egypt over alleged disputes over Nile water between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Nile water "will never be the cause for a war"
between Ethiopia and Egypt, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin told reporters after a meeting between his Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Sinai
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The utilization of the Nile water is "rather an incentive for
cooperation in the region in the interests of the two peoples (of
Ethiopia and Egypt)," Mesfin stressed.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on reports that the Egyptian-Ethiopian ties
have been damaged due to Addis Ababa's dissatisfaction for Egypt's
quota of the Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has an annual quota of 55 billion cubic meters of Nile
water under an agreement signed with Sudan, another Nile country,
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin said that Zenawi's visit to Egypt at an invitation of
Mubarak was aimed at boosting bilateral relations and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zenawi, who arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for a two-day visit,
discussed with Mubarak the issue of Nile water sharing during
their talks in the day, Mesfin said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Unconditional Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Unconditional lifting of
sanctions against Iraq was the only logic way to mitigate the
suffering of Iraqi people, Iraq said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf, said
all five phases of the implementation of the "oil-for-food"
program had failed to achieve its goal and the humanitarian
situation in the country was worsening.
</P>
<P>
In current circumstances, Iraq would be unable to export oil
and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the
total sum set by the Security Council because of the limited
productive capacity of the Iraqi oil sector and the sharp fall
there had been in oil prices in world markets, Al-Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq was allowed to import 300 million U.S. dollars
worth of spare parts and equipment necessary to maintain and
expand production and exportation capacities for oil and
petroleum, the representatives of the United States and Britain in
the U.N. sanctions committee had blocked most of the contracts by
place them on hold at various times, Al-Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
The suspensions of the contracts in question had no legal or
technical basis but stemmed from political considerations that
were hostile to the people of Iraq and were at cross purposes with
relevant U.N. resolutions, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The procedures for the processing of the contracts submitted to
the U.N. sanctions committee took a long time, particularly those
procedures relating to the approval of contracts, Al-Sahaf noted.
</P>
<P>
There was deliberate delay on the part of some members of the
committee in the process of approving contracts for humanitarian
equipment to sectors relevant to infrastructure, such as contracts
for the electricity and water and sanitation sectors as well as
for the oil sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf requested the U.N. chief to assume his
responsibilities and clearly indicate that the oil-for-food
program would not make it possible to alleviate the great
suffering which the Iraqi people had been enduring for almost nine
years.
</P>
<P>
The only solution was to lift the embargo without any further
conditions and that this question involves a legal and moral
obligation on the part of the United Nations with regard to Iraq,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program was implemented late
1996, under which Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil every six months to buy necessities for its people.
To ease the continuing humanitarian crisis in the country, the
Council in February 1998 adopted a resolution under which Iraq
could sell 5.2 billions U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Hails Truce Accord in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday voiced his welcome to the Tuesday signing of a
cease-fire agreement in the Togolese capital Lome, which commits
both warring parties in Sierra Leone to observe a cease-fire as of
May 24.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here, said, "I welcome the signing
of the cease-fire agreement, which will help create an atmosphere
conducive to the success of the peace talks to begin on May 25."
</P>
<P>
The Government of Ahlhaji Tejan Kabbah has agreed to a
cease-fire offer made by revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Lome.
Reports from West Africa say the president penned his signature on
a cease-fire agreement after four-hour comprehensive dialogue with
the RUF leader Corporal Fodat Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the RUF, the Civil Defense Forces, the Government
and ECOMOG (West African peacekeeping force) to adhere strictly to
its terms," Annan said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"I now intend to initiative immediate measures to strengthen
UNOMSIL (the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone) to play its
role in implementing the agreement," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) Secretariat is sending a military assessment team
to Sierra Leone to draw up plans for an expanded presence which we
would then submit to the Security Council for approval in the
event of a lasting peace agreement between the Government and the
RUF," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The cease-fire agreement provides for guarantees of safe and
unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need and the
immediate release of all prisoners of war and non-combatants," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The parties have also agreed to request the United Nations,
subject to Security Council authorization, to deploy military
observers as soon as possible to observe compliance with the
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks was hosted by President Gnassingbo Eyadema of Togo,
who is current chairman of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), which is making painstaking efforts to maintain
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Present at the signing ceremony in Lome were Francis Okelo,
U.N. special envoy for Sierra Leone, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the
United States Presidential Special Envoy for the Promotion of
Democracy in Africa, and the representative of the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The agreement commences on May 24 with peace talks starting the
day after. The peace accord allows for the release of prisoners of
war and civilians by the rebels, along with aid agency access to
desperate people on all sides.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the war and
hundreds of thousands have fled to take refuge in neighboring
countries. The rebels have committed widespread atrocities
against civilians in the West African country, and such an action
has been repeatedly condemned by the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Gene Discovery Offers Hope for Osteoporosis Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chiroscience, a British-based
biotechnology company, has isolated a gene which it said could
lead to treatment to reverse osteoporosis within three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the company believed that by identifying the
gene coding for a protein that appears to regulate bone density,
they could develop a drug that increases bone density in
osteoporosis sufferers, The Independent newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this finding there is a real opportunity for a novel
treatment to be developed that will actually build strong bone,"
Dr John Latham, who led the research, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For those suffering from osteoporosis, this is the best news
in years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chiroscience team made the discovery of the so-called bone
mass gene by studying families in South Africa with a history of
sclerosteosis, a rare bone growth disorder.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found that people carrying a copy of the gene
for sclerosteosis usually have a bone density many times greater
than normal, making the bones almost impossible to break of
fracture.
</P>
<P>
Gene samples collected in South Africa have allowed scientists
to find the genetic marker for the chromosomes of individuals
carrying the gene.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said their next step is to design a compound
that mimics the action of this gene and create a drug that can
stimulate bone growth.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's GDP Growth Less Than 2% in 1999: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's leading commercial bank
Standard Chartered predicted Wednesday that 1999 will be another
flat year for the country's economy with gross domestic product
(GDP) growth forecast at less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
"Following excessive rains during December and January in many
parts of the country the volume of agricultural output is unlikely
to grow much, if at all, while mining output will remain depressed
due to the slump in commodity prices internationally," Standard
Chartered said in its latest April issue of Business Trends
Zimbabwe here.
</P>
<P>
The bank said prevailing high interest rates as well as
economic uncertainty would depress investment while the balance of
payments position remained fragile with continued delays by the
International Monetary Fund to release much-needed support.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of intermediate and capital goods would be
adversely affected by cutbacks in the construction and civil
engineering industries and the downsizing and delays in investment
projects, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Overall manufacturing output may well fall further in 1999,"
it added.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Turn to Starfish for Cancer Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A starfish found in the English
Channel could help in the fight against cancer, British scientists
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Britain's Cancer Research Campaign (CRC),
Oxford University, are joining forces to use an enzyme from the
starfish as a tool in developing new drugs to stop cancer cells
from growing.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the results of this pioneering project can be
transferred into new drugs as quickly as possible, the scientists
have also teamed up with pharmaceutical giant, AstraZeneca, the
CRC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believed that a crucial enzyme, known as the Cyclin
Dependent Kinases (CDK), regulates the growth of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
The enzyme has already been used to slow the uncontrolled cell
division that creates cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
While the enzyme is also present in human cells, the unusually
high quantities in the starfish's eggs make it extremely valuable
to carry out accurate and sophisticated lab tests to develop new
cancer treatments that can be directly applied to humans, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that the genes which control the
activity of the enzyme are very often damaged in tumors, which allows
cells to continue multiplying out of control.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France Expect Policy Change in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France on Wednesday
expected changes of Israel's policies toward the Middle East peace
process following the victory of the moderate opposition in
Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that President Hosni
Mubarak received a telephone call in the day from his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expected that Ehud Barak, leader of Israel's
Labor Party, would adopt flexible policies on the peace process,
compared with the incumbent Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, who has been blamed for the deadlock of the
Arab-Israeli peace talks due to his intransigence during the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory over Netanyahu in Israel's early
elections on Monday. He has pledged to advance the peace
negotiations with the Palestinians as well as the Syrians and
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Mubarak and Chirac exchanged
views on pushing the Mideast peace process forward and several
other issues of mutual interest, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
France, which has a desire to play a role in the Mideast
affairs, often coordinate stances on related issues with Egypt,
the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and a
key mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Create Common Monetary Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is introducing a monetary program among
its member states, which aims to create a regional currency union
in a bid to facilitate the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs of the COMESA Secretariat, revealed this at a press
briefing in Kenyan capital Nairobi here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya said that some major issues related to the monetary
union discussed at the 7th COMESA Inter-Governmental Committee
meeting in the past two days would be presented to the ministers
who will meet Thursday at their council meeting for further
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to work out a system for fast payment facility
to ensure that exports would be paid quickly in the security of
payment among the COMESA member states," said the COMESA official.
</P>
<P>
He said the Inter-Governmental Committee meeting had decided to
 introduce the limited currency convertibility which is to enable
the national currencies of the COMESA members to be convertible
among them directly, thus promoting business and trade among the
member states.
</P>
<P>
Especially, he noted, the small-scale traders will benefit from
this practice.
</P>
<P>
As to the currency convertibility, Chanthunya said, a smart
card is to be used to replace the travellers' check introduced in
1988 by the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern
Africa (PTA).
</P>
<P>
The use of the smart card will save foreign exchanges and
facilitate the cross-border travels in COMESA's 21 member states.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Committee meeting also decided to
introduce the monetary harmonization program with "the objective
to harmonize our economies because there is a lot of disparities"
among the member states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program will eventually make it possible to create a
favorable environment "for us to chose a single currency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Before a single currency, Chanthunya said, the committee
meeting decided to create a coordinating body of experts from
central banks and ministries of finance from the member states to
build their economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
He continued that a banking regulation and supervision system
will be worked out for the financial structures of the member
states for an increasingly financial integration.
</P>
<P>
They will undertake the study in this respect and decide that
the expert supervision unit will meet once every year to exchange
experiences and their best practices.
</P>
<P>
These major issues recommended by the committee meeting will be
 considered by the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the
ministers will bring their recommendations on the issues to the
COMESA Summit which will open on May 24, Chanthunya concluded.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is counting down toward a free trade area by October
31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Work for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The regional conference of "Toward
an African Consensus on Sustainable Solutions to the Debt Problem"
urged the African countries here Wednesday to work for the
cancellation of their debt.
</P>
<P>
Violet Sampa-Bredt, General Secretary of the Christian Council
of Zambia, said at the opening of the conference that the issue of
the Third World debt has recently received increasing attention
from various players in the arena on international economic order.
</P>
<P>
However, "we seem to be lagging behind in developing a common
African agenda on debt," he said. "This lag is also at the
governmental level."
</P>
<P>
It's the time to work toward the cancellation of Africa's debt,
while raising awareness among the populations about the impact of
debt, the church leader said.
</P>
<P>
And it is also the time to work toward pressuring the
governments to uphold the democratic principles of transparency
and accountability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign to have Zambia's external debt of 6.5
billion U. S. dollars cancelled has gained momentum with the
national campaign team remaining with about 20,000 signatures
before it presents the petition to the nation's creditors next
month.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee 2000 Zambia campaign, which is part of the world-wide
movement lobbying the donor countries and the international
financial institutions to cancel the debt of poor countries by the
year 2000, said that it wants to collect about 200,000 signatures
by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The campaign team said that the aim of collecting the
signatures is in line with the global plan to present about 22
million signatures at next month's meeting of the Group of
Seven/Eight in Cologne, Germany, and press the G7/8 leaders to
consider canceling the debt of the Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who is chairman of the
1999 G7/8 heads of government summit, recently announced that debt
cancellation and review of the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative put forward by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank were on the agenda for the Cologne Summit.

<HEADLINE> ILO to Help Tanzania Review Employment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has pledged to assist the Tanzanian government
to review, update and implement the national employment policy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Dar es Salaam Wednesday, Elias
Mabere, the ILO regional director for Africa, said the policy must
be reviewed to create greater job opportunities in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mabere said due to the seriousness of unemployment in Tanzania,
the private sector, civil societies, and the government must make
joint efforts to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment in Tanzania is very serious because it is higher
than 40 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ILO regional director further said unattractive environment
in Tanzania's rural areas made youths to shift to urban areas
hunting for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mabere also underlined the importance of reviewing the name of
the Ministry of Labor and Youth Development and its role. If
possible, he said, its name should be changed into the Ministry of
Employment, like many other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the function, Paul Kimiti, the Minister of
Labor and Youth Development, said the postponement of national
census of the number of the jobless has hindered the ministry's
effort to get correct data which is helpful to make proper
decisions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France Expect Policy Change in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France on Wednesday
expected changes of Israel's policies toward the Middle East peace
process following the victory of the moderate opposition in
Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that President Hosni
Mubarak received a telephone call in the day from his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expected that Ehud Barak, leader of Israel's
Labor Party, would adopt flexible policies on the peace process,
compared with the incumbent Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, who has been blamed for the deadlock of the
Arab-Israeli peace talks due to his intransigence during the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory over Netanyahu in Israel's early
elections on Monday. He has pledged to advance the peace
negotiations with the Palestinians as well as the Syrians and
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Mubarak and Chirac exchanged
views on pushing the Mideast peace process forward and several
other issues of mutual interest, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
France, which has a desire to play a role in the Mideast
affairs, often coordinate stances on related issues with Egypt,
the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and a
key mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Create Common Monetary Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is introducing a monetary program among
its member states, which aims to create a regional currency union
in a bid to facilitate the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs of the COMESA Secretariat, revealed this at a press
briefing in Kenyan capital Nairobi here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya said that some major issues related to the monetary
union discussed at the 7th COMESA Inter-Governmental Committee
meeting in the past two days would be presented to the ministers
who will meet Thursday at their council meeting for further
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to work out a system for fast payment facility
to ensure that exports would be paid quickly in the security of
payment among the COMESA member states," said the COMESA official.
</P>
<P>
He said the Inter-Governmental Committee meeting had decided to
 introduce the limited currency convertibility which is to enable
the national currencies of the COMESA members to be convertible
among them directly, thus promoting business and trade among the
member states.
</P>
<P>
Especially, he noted, the small-scale traders will benefit from
this practice.
</P>
<P>
As to the currency convertibility, Chanthunya said, a smart
card is to be used to replace the travellers' check introduced in
1988 by the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern
Africa (PTA).
</P>
<P>
The use of the smart card will save foreign exchanges and
facilitate the cross-border travels in COMESA's 21 member states.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Committee meeting also decided to
introduce the monetary harmonization program with "the objective
to harmonize our economies because there is a lot of disparities"
among the member states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program will eventually make it possible to create a
favorable environment "for us to chose a single currency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Before a single currency, Chanthunya said, the committee
meeting decided to create a coordinating body of experts from
central banks and ministries of finance from the member states to
build their economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
He continued that a banking regulation and supervision system
will be worked out for the financial structures of the member
states for an increasingly financial integration.
</P>
<P>
They will undertake the study in this respect and decide that
the expert supervision unit will meet once every year to exchange
experiences and their best practices.
</P>
<P>
These major issues recommended by the committee meeting will be
 considered by the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the
ministers will bring their recommendations on the issues to the
COMESA Summit which will open on May 24, Chanthunya concluded.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is counting down toward a free trade area by October
31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Work for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The regional conference of "Toward
an African Consensus on Sustainable Solutions to the Debt Problem"
urged the African countries here Wednesday to work for the
cancellation of their debt.
</P>
<P>
Violet Sampa-Bredt, General Secretary of the Christian Council
of Zambia, said at the opening of the conference that the issue of
the Third World debt has recently received increasing attention
from various players in the arena on international economic order.
</P>
<P>
However, "we seem to be lagging behind in developing a common
African agenda on debt," he said. "This lag is also at the
governmental level."
</P>
<P>
It's the time to work toward the cancellation of Africa's debt,
while raising awareness among the populations about the impact of
debt, the church leader said.
</P>
<P>
And it is also the time to work toward pressuring the
governments to uphold the democratic principles of transparency
and accountability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign to have Zambia's external debt of 6.5
billion U. S. dollars cancelled has gained momentum with the
national campaign team remaining with about 20,000 signatures
before it presents the petition to the nation's creditors next
month.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee 2000 Zambia campaign, which is part of the world-wide
movement lobbying the donor countries and the international
financial institutions to cancel the debt of poor countries by the
year 2000, said that it wants to collect about 200,000 signatures
by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The campaign team said that the aim of collecting the
signatures is in line with the global plan to present about 22
million signatures at next month's meeting of the Group of
Seven/Eight in Cologne, Germany, and press the G7/8 leaders to
consider canceling the debt of the Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who is chairman of the
1999 G7/8 heads of government summit, recently announced that debt
cancellation and review of the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative put forward by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank were on the agenda for the Cologne Summit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Responsible for Peace in E. Timor Autonomy Ballot: Wiranto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The responsibility for peace and
order and the smooth implementation of the East Timor autonomy
ballot set on August 8 will still be in the hands of the
Indonesian security apparatus, Defense Minister General Wiranto
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of U.N. civilian police advisory officers
deployed to East Timor is still in the discussion stage.
</P>
<P>
"They will only give suggestions to the Indonesian police,"
Wiranto, who is also commander of the Armed Forces, told reporters
after attending a coordinating meeting on political affairs here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism between the U.N. civilian police and the
Indonesian police is still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
The task of the U.N. police "is only maintaining the
implementation of the ballot," said Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
As host, he said, Indonesia has to do some work to make the
ballot run well, peacefully and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility of setting up an inter-department
body which will be appointed both in Jakarta and East Timor, so
the department's task can be done comprehensively and thoroughly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added there is no wish to bring U.N. forces to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and order
in East Timor. A key function will be the disarmament of rival
factions that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> UK Restricts Trial by Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
announced on Wednesday that magistrates rather than defendants
should decide whether a case should go to jury trial.
</P>
<P>
The move, unveiled by Straw at the Police Federation Conference
in Blackpool in northwest England, would restrict the historic
right to a trial by jury for around 18,500 a year defendants in
England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Straw said: "The primary aim of our justice system is to be
fair and just - and the rights of the defendant must be paramount.
</P>
<P>
"But we also have a responsibility to ensure that those rights
are not abused," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government believes its plans would "curtail abuse of the
system" and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
Jury trials cost on average 13,500 pounds (22,275 U.S.
dollars), compared with only 2,500 pounds (4,125 U.S. dollars) for
a case tried by magistrates
</P>
<P>
The move will affect defendants in so-called "either way"
trials, which can be dealt with in either a crown court or a
magistrates' court.
</P>
<P>
While serious crimes such as murder, rape and arson can only be
tried by a jury, many offences can be heard in either court.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is up to defendants to opt for trial by
magistrates - two or three justices of the peace - or judge and
jury.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Stepashin Confirmation Victory to Yeltsin, For Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma's
confirmation Wednesday of Sergei Stepashin as the country's new
prime minister represented a fresh victory for President Boris
Yeltsin over the opposition-dominated lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the approval of Stepashin, following last Saturday's
failure in the State Duma to start formal impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin, was only a development that postponed the coming
of a "final showdown" between the left opposition and the
president, observers say.
</P>
<P>
With fundamental differences on major issues, coupled with the
approaching of the parliamentary elections due later this year,
new confrontations between the two sides could erupt at any moment
in a volatile Russia that saw three premiers sacked in about 14
months.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Stepashin's confirmation did avert a much-feared
vicious fight between the president and the Duma and greatly eased
the tension that has beset the Russian political scene in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's balloting, most members of the Liberal
Democratic Party, Our Home Is Russia and the deputy group of
Russian Regions voted in favor. But what made Stepashin to clear
the State Duma with an overwhelming majority was the change of
mind of the left opposition, which commands 211 seats in the 442-
deputy lower house.
</P>
<P>
According to final figures, 310 deputies voted for Stepashin,
far exceeding the simple majority of 226 votes as required.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, a 47-year-old first deputy prime minister and
interior minister, was nominated by Yeltsin last Wednesday
following the dismissal of former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Primakov's ouster, the left opposition indicated
that it would "resolutely vote down" any candidate produced by
Yeltsin. That stance, however, changed dramatically in a matter of
days.
</P>
<P>
The facts that Stepashin is the only acceptable personage in
the Yeltsin camp, that a rejection of Stepashin could endanger the
current Duma's own survival, and that Stepashin won support from
the Federation Council, or upper house of parliament, were the
reasons behind the left opposition's about face.
</P>
<P>
Although Stepashin is apparently a Yeltsin protege and
believed to be connected with many of Yeltsin's policies objected
by the opposition, he is, at the same time, a person widely known
as pragmatic and has no major conflicts with various political
parties and movements.
</P>
<P>
During his recent public appearances and meetings with leaders
of the left opposition, Stepashin has repeatedly stressed that if
confirmed, his government would continue the basic policies
formulated by the previous cabinet and retain the core members of
that cabinet.
</P>
<P>
His promise not to take such anti-constitutional moves as
banning the Russian Communist Party further softened the hostility
of the left opposition, which obviously realized that it was not a
bad idea, after all, to have a "Primakov government without
Primakov."
</P>
<P>
A constitution that tilts toward the president is another
reason that forced the State Duma to accept Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
Since its failure last Saturday in the State Duma to set in
motion impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin, the left
opposition has been looking for opportunities to "level with" the
president in their political standoff.
</P>
<P>
If they so wish, the opposition might well vote down any of
Yeltsin's prime ministerial nominees, but that would mean a
dissolution of the Duma and appointment by presidential decree of
such persons as Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister much
more unacceptable to the left opposition.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if Yeltsin resorts to "extraordinary measures"
such as banning the Communist Party and amending the constitution
following the dissolution of the Duma, the left opposition's
chances of winning the next parliamentary elections would very
likely be reduced markedly.
</P>
<P>
The communist-dominated opposition now enjoys wide support
among a population unsatisfied with the current economic
predicament and political instability.
</P>
<P>
The third reason that prompted the left opposition to let go
of Stepashin as premier was the upper house's favorable attitude
toward the nominee. Stepashin's presentation in the Federation
Council on Monday was warmly received by most members of the upper
house.
</P>
<P>
Federation Council speaker Yegor Stroyev and the powerful
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov both stepped out to voice their support
for Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
All these circumstances, plus Stepashin's acceptability,
apparently made the left opposition choose to avoid confrontation
with the regional leaders and thereby face the allegation that it

Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"While India is facing a period of political uncertainty, we,
on our part, remain committed to carrying the process forward in
the spirit of the Lahore Declaration," he said in an address at
the National Defense College.

the Kashmir dispute.

Referring to the Lahore declaration, he said, the historic
document stressed the need to intensify efforts to resolve all
outstanding issues including the Kashmir dispute. "This is a

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Maintain Nuclear Deterrence: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that Pakistan will maintain nuclear
deterrence despite all odds.
</P>
<P>
"We will preserve this deterrence under all circumstances. We
shall not compromise on our security and survival," Sharif said in
a speech at the National Defense College.
</P>
<P>
"This is the question of life and existence," Sharif said,
adding that the establishment of nuclear deterrence has now made
Pakistan's defense impregnable.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining the nuclear deterrence, Pakistan remains
acutely conscious of the risk and responsibilities arising from
the possession of nuclear weapons, the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
"We are adopting appropriate measures to put in place an
effective command and control system," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, is sensitive to international
non-proliferation concerns. The government is opposed to a nuclear
arms race in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear restraint, stabilization and minimum credible
deterrence constitute the basic elements of Pakistan's nuclear
policy," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government has declared a unilateral
moratorium on further testing and has offered a strategic
restraint regime to India.
</P>
<P>
"We have solemnly committed ourselves not to transfer nuclear
technology or material to any other country or entity. This has
been our consistent policy," the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Accuses Ethiopia of meddling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May19 (Xinhua) -- "The Voice of the People", a radio
 supporting faction leader Hussein Aidid returned to the air
Wednesday again by broadcasting the usual programs and
anti-Ethiopian propaganda after more than three months' silence.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Aidid as strongly condemning the Ethiopian
policy toward Somalia in a press statement issued Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that Ethiopia has unlawfully attacked and
violated the territorial integrity of Somalia by "crossing some of
its troops into Somalia."
</P>
<P>
The radio has also accused Ethiopia of sponsoring a meeting for
some Somali factions inside Ethiopia for the sole purpose of what
it called instigating more Ethiopian attacks against Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The strongly-worded statement also accused the Ethiopian forces
of planting land mines in several regions in central and southern
Somalia including Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Hiran and Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained that these land mines are continuously
causing fatalities and injuries to lives of both human beings and
animals.
</P>
<P>
The last known land mine victims in Bay region include three
men, among whom a senior official from Aidid's faction, who died
near the grave yard of Baidoa town 10 days ago after his vehicle,
a four-wheel-drive Nissan, hit a land mine.
</P>
<P>
However, many of the estimated one million land mines buried in
Somalia have been laid down during the height of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Aidid also said in his statement that Ethiopia is attacking
parts of Somalia by "using the pretext of Oromo nationals and
weapons being brought to southern Somalia."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Oromo nationals in Somalia are refugees who
fled Ethiopia in 1964 during the war between Somalia and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, between 500 and 700 Oromo nationals, and weapons
have allegedly arrived for Aidid two weeks ago on a vessel
chartered by Eritrea which docked at the natural port of Merca
town, 100 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Some of the local newspapers have reported that many of the
Oromo soldiers have already crossed into Ethiopia a few days ago
for possible hit-and-run attacks against the regime of Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the statement called on the international
community to put pressure on Ethiopia to refrain from what it
called the intervention in Somalia's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the Inter-Governmental Authority
for Development, the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity to intervene into the problems between Somalia and
Ethiopia.

PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Wednesday that the chances for finding a political solution to
the Yugoslav crisis are nearing each day.
</P>
<P>
When visiting an air force commanding base in Taverny, north of
Paris, Chirac said that the chances for a final solution to the
Yugoslav crisis are increasing in both diplomatic and military

``We see each day which is passing the nearing of the chances

He said that the coordination between Russia and the allies is
helpful in arriving at a resolution to be adopted by the United
Nations Security Council, which he said the Serbs are most likely
to accept.
</P>
<P>
``I hope that an agreement should come between Russians and the
allies to make a mission by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
useful and positive during the next week,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poor Economy Affects Zimbabwe's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The economic conditions prevailing
in Zimbabwe are militating against the education delivery system
with few resources being allocated to the sector, Minister of
Education, Sport and Culture, Gabriel Machinga said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The escalating cost of education in this country is a reality
that government grants for educational needs are not adequate," he
said at the launch of the Harare chapter of the Better Schools
Program (BSP) here.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed at improving the quality and relevance of
the education system, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Machinga's ministry swallowed up 29 percent of the total 1999
budget distribution by vote, with an allocation of more than 12.3
billion Zimbabwean dollars (323 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increasing cost of education, he said, was being compounded
by the high rate of inflation and the poor performance of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the delivery of education was not an event but a
process which needed the proper environment to achieve the desired
results.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would do everything possible to ensure
that the quality of education was not compromised.
</P>
<P>
"We can launch BSP program but what is important is to deliver
the goods, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Better Schools Program had already been launched in other
parts of the country and the program is part of the educational
reform process underway countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, resource centers would be established in
each district to provide students, teachers and the community with
research and modern technology facilities like computers and the
internet service.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is initiated with the assistance of the
Royal Netherlands Embassy in Zimbabwe, is targeted at 85,000
teachers, 6,000 headmasters and 500 education officers.

<HEADLINE> UNITA's Breakaway Group Urges Isolation of Savimbi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway group of the rebel
UNITA movement, UNITA Renovation Commission, Wednesday called upon
its members and sympathizers to "actively help" the government to
"comprehensively isolate" the military clique led by Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Valentim, secretary for international relations of the
commission, said on the state-run radio that the struggle against
Savimbi, President of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), "is a national campaign."
</P>
<P>
In order to win a lasting peace in Angola, "the UNITA
Renovation Commission should actively participate in the fight
against the rebels," the secretary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Valentim, who is also the government minister of hotels and
tourism, stressed that it will help to bring an early end to the
civil war if "the logistical support from Zambia" is cut off.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia denies having rendered logistical supports to
the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Valentim also said that the struggle against Savimbi should be
extended across the continent and the European countries
influential in Africa through the concerted efforts of information
and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Early last September, some UNITA members led by Valentim who
were holding positions in the Angolan government declared the
establishment of the UNITA Renovation Commission, which has been
cooperating with the government for the peace process in the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the efforts made by the Angolan government to
internationally isolate Savimbi, General Secretary of the
renovation commission, Eugenio Manuvakula, held talks with the
Ivorian ambassador to Luanda this February, prompting the
government of Cote d'Ivoire to withdraw the passports it had
granted to the UNITA members including Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Said to Burn Over 200 Houses in Bamiyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia are alleged
to have burnt more than 200 houses in Bamiyan city after
recapturing the central Afghan town early this month.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan journalist, who recently returned from Bamiyan, the
stronghold of Shiite Muslims, said 200 to 250 residential houses
in the western part of Bamiyan city were burnt down after the
entry of Taliban troops into the town on May 9.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the smoke coming out of the debris," said the
journalist, who added that the Shiite population there also blamed
the Taliban for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban first took the town in September last year but lost
it to the Hizb-e-Wahdat faction of the anti-Taliban northern
alliance on April 21 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan journalist said most of the residents of Bamiyan
city have fled and only young people remain there, adding that
tanks and other military vehicles are patrolling the streets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three famous Buddhist statues in Bamiyan have
received further damage in the recent fighting in this
Shiite-populated town.
</P>
<P>
A 53-meter-high statue, the journalist said, is the worst
damaged, with half of its head missing.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban commander in Bamiyan told the journalist that more
than 3,000 of their soldiers took part in the offensive to
recapture the town.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Taliban soldiers and about 130 from the alliance
were killed in the fighting, the commander estimated.
</P>
<P>
The journalist went on to say that the entire Bamiyan city and
Yawklang town, headquarters of Hizb-e-Wahdat 50 kilometers west of
Bamiyan, are currently in the control of the student militia.
</P>
<P>
He added the militia are using all the three airports --
Bamiyan airport, Shibar II airport and Yawklang airport, with most
of the operation, including transportation of arms and ammunition
as well as food stuff, between Kabul and Bamiyan at the Bamiyan
airport.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud is
expected to make an official visit to Jordan at the end of this
month, his first trip abroad since he took the oath of office last
November.
</P>
<P>
The independent Central News Agency quoted diplomatic sources
as saying Lahoud's visit was scheduled at Jordanian King
Abdallah's invitation, delivered by Jordanian Prince Ali bin
Hussein last month when he made the first official visit to
Lebanon by a member of the Hashemite royal family in three
decades.
</P>
<P>
During Lahoud's visit, he will discuss with Jordanian leaders
issues concerning the bilateral ties and regional affairs,
especially the stalled peace process, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan, Lebanon and Syria cooled after late
Jordanian King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994
when Lebanon and Syria were technically still at war with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon follows the foreign policy lead of Syria which
stations some 35,000 troops in Lebanon to allegedly prevent
the rekindling of the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lahoud will also extend his condolences to
late King Hussein and place a wreath on his tomb.
</P>
<P>
Due to his absence at the king's high-profile funeral in
February, Lahoud came under heavy criticism from his country's
public opinion.

<HEADLINE> Use of Malawian Currency to Be Allowed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Bank of Mozambique
Adriano Maleiane said Wednesday that the governments of Mozambique
and Malawi have signed a preliminary agreement to allow use of
their currencies in the other country, effective as from September
this year.
</P>
<P>
Maleiane disclosed this at a press conference here to mark the
24th anniversary of the founding of the central bank, the
Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The informal agreement will facilitate the legal direct
convertibility of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
So far, Mozambicans or Malawians have had to use the U.S.
dollar as intermediate when they enter the other country for
cross-border trade, investment or travel, finding much difficulty.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the entrepreneurs, business people
or travelers from both nations can convert their own currency in
the banks of the other country. The central banks of the two
countries will take the responsibility of returning the money to
the other country.
</P>
<P>
Maleiane said that the agreement will be implemented in
Mozambique and Malawi and when proven successful, it will be
extended to other Southern African Development Community members
like Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that a formal pact can be inked with Malawi
in September this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks Luanda to Rescue Its Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has formally
asked the Angolan government to rescue the three Russian pilots
whose Antonov-26 plane was downed by the rebel UNITA troops last
week.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Russian embassy in Luanda disclosed Wednesday
that the Russian Foreign Ministry made the request in an interview
Tuesday with the Angolan Ambassador to Moscow Luis Paulo de
Castro.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued in Portuguese capital Lisbon by
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the
UNITA forces downed a government plane in northeastern Lunda-Norte
Province on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the Russian "mercenary" crew members
were captured and they are detained in the central highlands
headquarters of the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
However, the Angolan government declared that the Antonov-26
belonged to a private company, which was transporting mining
equipment and the Russians had been employed to operate the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government strongly condemned the violent UNITA act
of shooting down the civilian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official news agency ANGOP Wednesday charged
that from last Wednesday to Sunday, the UNITA troops had killed
five civilians and destroyed 14 trucks in ambushes on the civilian
fleet on the road linking coastal town of Benguela and Huambo.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Visits Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohmmad
Khatami arrived in Doha, Qatar Wednesday for a two-day visit
aimed at boosting ties mainly in economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, the first Iranian president to visit the Gulf
emirate since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, will hold talks
with Qatari Emir Sheikh Bin Khalifa Al-Thani on the situation
in the Gulf region and other issues of mutual concern, Iranian
sources to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, both countries will sign up to eight
agreements concerning investments and other economic fields, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides are also expected to discuss the
construction of trade centers in either state in a bid to
promote bilateral trade, they said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is the last leg of Khatami's three-nation tour, which
has already taken him to Syria, Iran's long-time Arab ally, and
the Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president spent five days in Saudi Red Sea port of
Jeddah for two rounds of talks with senior Saudi officials on ways
of boosting political and economic ties, as well as stabilizing
the world oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Khatami came to Iran's two Gulf neighbors at a time when Tehran
and the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have been in a
rapprochement process during the past two years. His visit is
expected to offer a boost to the overall cross-Gulf ties, which
will in the end positively affect the stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and the GCC states were strained for nearly
two decades because of Tehran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which
toppled the late Shah's regime, and Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88,
during which the Gulf states backed the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Their tension was eased after President Khatami took office in
August 1997. Khatami, a political moderate, voiced Tehran's desire
to end hostility and establish mutual trust with the GCC states
and apparently received positive response from the GCC leaders.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the GCC, a regional
political and economic alliance established in 1981, also groups
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the Netherlands
on Wednesday presented a draft resolution to the United Nations
Security Council, proposing allowing foreign companies to invest
in Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The revised British-Dutch draft resolution said the foreign
investments could only be considered 120 days after Iraq had
cooperated with U.N. weapons inspectors and after the
establishment of a new U.N. weapons monitoring system in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution proposed to lift the ceiling on how
much oil Iraq could sell. It also called for integrating Iraq's
illegal sales of oil, especially to Turkey, into the current
U.N. structure.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands called for the replacement of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction by a new expanded
commission with power similar to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended its cooperation with the United Nations after
the United States and Britain launched military strikes against
it last December. The United Nations Security Council has been
sharply divided on its policy towards Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Abubakar, "Mother of New Nigeria" (By Wang Jinyu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- In less than two weeks time, Nigeria
would be ushered into a new world of democracy where state power
resides not with a clique of military rulers but with
democratically-elected civil servants.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the handing-over of state powers, the out-going
military ruler, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, has been commended as "the mother of a new Nigeria" in
the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
About 11 months ago when General Abubakar assumed office
following the sudden death of his predecessor General Sani
Abacha, it was unimaginable that he could have completed his
transition program in May this year.
</P>
<P>
When the head of state announced on July 20 last year the
transition program beginning from September 1998 to may 29 this
year, there were much scepticisms over the genuineness and
sincerity of General Abubakar to hand over power.
</P>
<P>
With the experiences of the two unfulfilled transitions in 13
years by former military rulers of Generals lbrahim Babangida and
late Sani Abacha, Nigerians are justified to have doubts over the
transition program made by the military government.
</P>
<P>
However, General Abubakar this time has turned the program
into reality with three elections at local, state and federal
levels successfully conducted.
</P>
<P>
New constitution promulgated and preparations to hand over
power have reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The faithful implementation of transition program is seen as
the peak of the Abubakar government and the regime could thus be
awarded a pass mark in its democratization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Abubakar government had exhibited
commendable ability to match its pronouncements with deeds.
</P>
<P>
By the time Abubakar came into power last year, the political
temperature had already reached a boiling point, the world, which
had isolated Nigeria and Nigerians, were witnessing perhaps the
worst period since independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
When he was appointed the head of state to succeeded the late
General Abacha, Abubakar inherited the worst human rights
situation in the history o the west African country.
</P>
<P>
During the past 11 months, General Abubakar has managed to
improve the human rights situation at home and to forge new
relations with external creditors and western countries like the
United States, Britain, France, Japan and some other countries in
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
By now, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights has given
Nigeria a clean bill concerning the human rights situation and
the Commonwealth of Nations has also expressed its readiness to
accept Nigeria back to its fold.
</P>
<P>
So, Nigerians describe the current transition program, to be
completed on May 29, as one which "lead us out of the abyss of our
national despair."
</P>
<P>
In the political front, analysts said, Abubakar has performed
above average, but the performance in the economic front has been
less than satisfactory as one analyst put it that " things are
now worse than before Abubakar took over."
</P>
<P>
Inflation has maintained an upward movement after two years of
steady decline while foreign exchange reserves dropped from seven
billion U.S. dollars in December last year to 3.1 billion dollars
in March.
</P>
<P>
The persistent power failure and fuel crisis all over the
country have slowed down business activity, and government
over-spendings resulted in a 38 billion Naira (about 400 million
dollars) deficit in the first Quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, certain that the in-coming Nigerian
government would inherit a very sick economy from the out-going
military rulers.
</P>
<P>
This Day newspaper graded the performances of the Abubakar's
11 month- regime with "excellent" for its efforts in restoring
democracy and external relations, "good" for human rights and
personal approval rating; "average" for institutional reforms, but
"poor" for economic development.
</P>
<P>
 Analysts here conclude that if the transition keeps the date
with May 29, it shall, like a religious ordinance, be referred to
as the "spiritual life spring and the mother of a new Nigeria."

<HEADLINE> Annan Says U.N. to Play Leading Role in Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that the United Nations will have a leading role to play in
seeking a political solution to the Kosovo crisis through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Annan, during his first visit to Macedonia, said that the concerned
parties share the belief that the United Nations should play a leading
role in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will soon formulate a resolution on the
stationing of an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the
U.N. chief said. He called on the international community to unite
together under the U.N. banner to seek a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Annan met with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and Prime Minister Ljubko Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
He discussed regional issues and the refugee problem with
Gligorov and promised that the international community will help
Macedonia to tide over the difficulties arising out of the influx of
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov asked for more humanitarian and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski told Annan that Macedonia will not close its border and
it can receive another 20,000 to 30,000 Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations office will be opened in Skopje, capital of
Macedonia, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also met representatives of various U.N. organs
working in Macedonia to help the 230,000 refugees and visited a
refugee camp near Skopje.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Grants Highest Award on Saudi Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela Wednesday conferred the Order of Good Hope on visiting
Saudi Arabian crown prince, Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and
highlighted South Africa's hopes for a resumption in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince arrived in South Africa Wednesday on a six-day
official visit during which several bilateral agreements are
expected to be signed.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the South African Foreign Ministry said earlier
Wednesday that the Saudi prince would start to visit South Africa
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his Pretoria residence, where an official dinner
was hosted in honor of Prince Abdullah, Mandela said this week's
change in Israel's government had reawakened hopes of a resolution
to the Palestinian-Israeli impasse.
</P>
<P>
He also said the relationship between Saudi Arabia and South
Africa has been embarking on "an important strategic partnership".
</P>
<P>
"As an influential leader in the Gulf region, your actions have
also promoted relations between the Gulf and southern Africa, and
contributed to the rebirth of our continent," Mandela told Prince
Abdullah as he bestowed the South Africa's highest award for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said it had been an inspiration to work with Saudi
Arabia in brokering a resolution to the impasse in the Libyan
Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
The deal, brokered by Mandela's top aide Jakes Gerwel and Saudi
Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, had "achieved what neither could have
done alone, and helped bring about what few thought possible,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"Their achievement, we believe, will be an inspiration to all
those whose hopes for a resumption of the Middle East peace
process have been reawakened by the change of government in
Israel," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Joins in Nigerian Railway Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China handed over the last batch of
China-made locomotives to the Nigerian railway rehabilitation
project to Nigeria Wednesday in a jubilant ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ten locomotives, 32 coaches, 80 wagons are among the equipments
handed over to the Nigerian Railway Corporation at the occasion in
the railway compound on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of Transport Rear Admiral F B I Porbeni,
Sole Administrator of Nigerian Railway Corporation Greg G. Ilukwe
and Chinese ambassador Liang Yinzhu, attended the hand-over
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also marked the launching of Lagos-Ilorin
intercity express train service and the founding of a Railway
Museum in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Chen Xiaoxing, Managing Director of
China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation said that by far
89 percent of the track rehabilitation work has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts are stepping up their efforts in providing
technical and management training to the Nigerian staff, he added.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed in December 1995 in Beijing between
Chinese and Nigerian railway authorities, is aimed to rehabilitate
3,505 out of Nigeria' s 4,288 kilometer railways.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Chinese company will supply 50
locomotives, 150 coaches, 400 wagons and 20 railbuses and provide
technical and managing support to the Nigerian side.
</P>
<P>
In the test journey Wednesday, Nigerian newsmen said that the
China-made passenger cars are both comfortable and technologically
advanced.
</P>
<P>
One of the locomotives is named after Gen. Abulsalami Abubakar,
Nigeria' s Head of State.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said the project will surely contribute
not only to the economic benefits of the both countries but the
friendship of the two peoples as well.

UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China, Russia and France on
Wednesday presented a draft resolution to the United Nations
Security Council, proposing that most of the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Russian-French draft resolution wanted to suspend
sanctions on civilian goods as well as air and sea embargoes and
financial transactions for an initial period of 100 days upon
receipt of the report of the U.N. Secretary-General that the
reinforced Ongoing Monitoring and Verification system in Iraq
has become effectively and efficiently operational.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution requested the Secretary-General submit
every thirty days to the Security Council for its review a report
as to whether the reinforced Ongoing Monitoring and Verification
system in Iraq is effectively and efficiently operational.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft resolution, Iraq's assets abroad would
remain frozen until it has accounted for missing prisoners and
looted property in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended its cooperation with the United Nations after
the United States and Britain launched military strikes against it
last December. The United Nations Security Council has been
sharply divided on its policy towards Iraq since then.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Britain At 19-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of people out of work in
Britain fell by 17,400 in March on the claimant count measure to
1.29 percent, according to official figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
That is equivalent to 4.5 percent of the workforce, the lowest
rate since April 1990, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here had forecast a rise of 6,500 in the claimant
count, but the ONS cautioned that the figures were distorted by
the timing of Easter.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the government's preferred measure for unemployment,
the so-called ILO (the International Labor Organization) figure,
the number of people out of work increased by 24,000 to 1,822,000
between January and March.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the data are compiled following guidelines
set out by the ILO, based on surveys which ask people whether they
are seeking work.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the data show that the labor market in Britain
continues to be in good health. Across the UK, 27.35 million
people now have a job. This is the highest level ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Andrew Smith said: "The continued strong
growth in employment is especially good news - it is up again by
63,000 over the last quarter."
</P>
<P>
However, the OECD has predicted recently that unemployment in
the UK will rise from 6.4 percent for 1999 to 7.3 percent by the
year 2000.

economic battlefield which now engages our attention."
</P>
<P>
He told the summit which were attended by 11 heads of state, a
monarch, some prime ministers and vice presidents that there are
still unacceptable levels of poverty, ignorance and disease in
Africa despite its resources, according to a Pan-African News
Agency report.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings noted that "much of the huge potential of Africa is
still locked up through lack of capital and business expertise,"
adding "the African renaissance that is our vision for the 21st
century depends on sustainable economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that a disturbing aspect of the
democratization process in Africa is the liberalization of their
economies.
</P>
<P>
"There are structural aspects of the world economy that hinder
further growth," he stressed at the week-long summit, "the growing
external debt burden as well as the disadvantageous terms of trade
are some of the most serious of the structural constraints."
</P>
<P>
He said Africa need to do more to build the confidence of the
outside world "in our economies as safe havens for investment and
trade.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Calls for Halt of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said here Thursday that NATO allies should stop bombing of
Yugoslavia as soon as the Group of Seven and Russia agree on a
draft resolution to be submitted to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and
other NATO military chiefs at the NATO headquarters, D'Alema said
he was convinced that the military campaign should be closely
linked to the political action and effort.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that if we had an agreed draft to be
submitted to the U.N. Security Council, the moment you have such a
draft resolution agreed, at that time there should be a pause in
the bombings to allow a convening of such a meeting and to enable
the Security Council to take this deliberation," D'Alema stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This is the meaning of the position taken yesterday by the
Italian parliament and I have come here to illustrate this
position to our allies," the prime minister told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also pointed out that if the Yugoslav government
refuses to accept requests from the international community which
are accepted by the U.N., NATO should relaunch its military action.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Urges U.N. to Find Final Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
urged on Wednesday the United Nations to find a final solution to
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian news agency MIA, which was monitored here
Thursday, said that Gligorov made the appeal during his talks with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was on a one-day visit to
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"Appreciating all the U.N. efforts, I think that they should
engage again in finding the final solution," the MIA quoted
Gligorov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian president said that his country was firm in its
position for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis through
political dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia would like to see "a sooner end of the air strikes"
by NATO, which have been going on for 58 days Thursday, and a
political agreement to be reached soon so that refugees would be
able to return to their homes in Kosovo, Gligorov said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, Annan
said: "We are moving one step forward in the coordination, in
order to achieve a political solution."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that the United Nations will continue with
its humanitarian role but the efforts by the international
community will not just focus on humanitarian alone.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russian envoy Viktor Chernomirdin's trip to
Belgrade Wednesday, Annan said that the coming two weeks will be
critical.
</P>
<P>
A political solution to the matter will "allow the refugees to
return to their homes, where human rights will be guaranteed," the
U.N. secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Although the United Nations has been trying hard to end the war,
Annan said, he cannot be sure that Kosovo refugees will be able to
return home before winter.
</P>
<P>
"We work very hard in a coordination with other governments to
end the war and to find a political solution. We are doing
everything to find a prompt solution so that the refugees would
not have to stay here over the winter, but I cannot say anything
for certain," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment I keep contact with Marti Ahtisaari,
Strobe Talbott, Viktor Chernomirdin and with all the governments
that are involved in the peace talks," the U.N. chief said. "I
hope that they will be able to achieve some results."
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations will have a central role to
play in resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a U.N. resolution that will regulate the
presence of the peace forces in Kosovo. The Security Council will
be able to play this critical role and we will start to see the
solution for the problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Unionists Reject Accusation of Snubbing Peace Talks in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party rejected accusations on Thursday that it has
turned its back on the latest round of talks in the Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble did not attend Thursday's
talks in Downing Street, after declaring the latest deal on
decommissioning "virtually dead" on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Trimble could not attend Thursday morning's
meeting merely for practical reasons and did not intend to snub
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the latest meeting with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the unionists
were "playing for time."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is stagnant and bogged down and increasingly I
think, even today, in some degree of disrepute," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
But Unionist party senior negotiator Sir Reg Empey said they
did not know a meeting on Thursday until very late on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The "fundamental issue" of decommissioning must be dealt with
or it would "hang like a sword of Damocles" over the peace process,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The deal currently on the table outlines mechanisms for
government powers to be devolved from London to the Northern
Ireland Assembly by June 30.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists have so far rejected it because it does
not state that paramilitary decommissioning must start before the
assembly's executive is set up.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. WTO Accord Benefit Both Parties: U.S. Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- American business community will
collectively impose further influence on political circles in
Washington and around the United States for an agreement with
China on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
This was the view expressed here Thursday by leaders of the
American business community in Hong Kong at a panel discussion
during the Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) Investors' Forum.
</P>
<P>
Jason Felton, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong (AmCham), said that his chamber will continue to put
pressure on the Clinton administration and on the Congress of the
United States to recognize the long-term benefits of China's WTO
entry to the United States and the world trade.
</P>
<P>
It will be a tragic misopportunity if the agreement is not
concluded and that will be against the interest of both parties,
said Felton, who led an AmCham delegation to Washington last month
to lobby congressmen and government officials for the WTO
agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
Felton said that there are two groups of people that are often
seen. In one group are grown-ups who deal with situation and
issues in a mature and serious way and in another are those who
don't do things that way, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect leaders of our government to be among those grown-
ups," Felton said. He spoke highly of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji,
saying that Zhu had done things in a grown-up way during his visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, when the deal is ready to be struck, there were
no grown-ups available on the U.S. side of Washington D.C.," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Felton criticized some U.S. congressmen for blocking the WTO
agreement between the United States and China with non-trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
There are more recognizations among the U.S. people, even in
the House of Representatives and the Senate, of the benefits of a
WTO agreement to the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same panel discussion, Terrence Cuddyre,
general manager of Bank of America, Asia, briefed the audience on
the specific positive impact of China's entry into the WTO on the
banking industry as well as insurance and securities businesses of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Richard Kahler, president of Caterpillar China, spoke about the
WTO issue from the U.S. manufacturers' perspective.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's WTO entry would help him achieve his three
business goals in China -- to be a leader in the import of Chinese
goods, to invest in product opportunities and to set up his
distribution system in China.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Muir, director for external affairs of Seagram Asia
Pacific, said that the agreement for the accession of China to the
WTO is overwhelmingly in the interest of international business.
</P>
<P>
Muir, who served as AmCham chairman in 1998, when the
negotiations between China and the United States intensified, said
that the negotiations have lasted 13 years and he still remains
optimistic to see China enter the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The benefit for the United States is the access to the big
Chinese market and the cost is that the United States has to
abandon its discriminative policies against China, the first of
which is the annual renewal of the normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
The WTO accession will provide China with opportunities of
access to the international markets and overseas capitals, Muir
said. Of course, Chinese enterprises have to raise their
competitiveness to meet the increasingly intensive competition, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on
Thursday called for intensified efforts to find a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Rinas Airport after meeting with
representatives of U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), the U.N. chief said that the refugee
situation "pressurizes all of us to intensify our efforts to find
a political solution" to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
A political solution ought to be found "sooner other than later
" so that the refugees can go home in security, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had a very useful discussion with the
representatives of U.N. agencies and the NGOs which have been
working here to help the Kosovo refugees totaling over 430,000 in
Albania alone.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the U.N. agencies and NGOs need to cooperate
more closely to deliver their humanitarian job.
</P>
<P>
"I think we all accept it is a challenge for all of us. The U.N.
cannot do it alone and the NGOs can not do it alone. We have a
major challenge here. And I am pleased to see how they work
together," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
When Annan was meeting with the NGO representatives, his
spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told reporters that the U.N. secretary-
general placed a very strong emphasis on U.N. working more as a
team or as a system.
</P>
<P>
"He feels we can get a lot more accomplished with the money we
have. But everyone should pull together and work in a cooperative
way, " the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that there is "a lot waste of energy in the crisis.
They all rush in and they all try to do their own thing. There is
a need for coordination."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hopes that the refugees would be able to
reach home before winter. But "at the same time, we have to
prepare now in the event that some of them cannot get home before
winter," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"That means getting materials in place by June, winterization
of camps or other accommodations, " Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting the press, Annan left by a U.N. High Commissioner
of Refugees (UNHCR) helicopter for Kukes, north Albania, to visit
refugee camps and talk to refugees.
</P>
<P>
He was schedule to fly back to Tirana to hold talks with
Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko and President Rexhep Meidani
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the U.N. chief's first visit to Albania. He was
received at the Rinas Airport by Meidani upon his arrival.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Optimistic for Arab-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
on Thursday voiced optimism for a new stage of Arab-Israeli talks
that could open fresh vistas towards a just and comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian and German members of the
Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Moussa reiterated
Egypt's readiness to cooperate with Israel's prime minister-elect
Ehud Barak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would help Barak, who won a landslide
victory in Monday's Israeli elections, revive the Middle East
peace process stalled over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Moussa accused the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of not only failing to push forward the peace process
but also seeking to torpedo the progress in the peace process
launched in 1991 in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's diplomacy "was clear in declaring Netanyahu was wrong"
and that the policies adopted by Israel under him "were
misguided," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is a positive Israeli policy to help both
the Arabs and Israel in realizing peace and security," Moussa
said, underlining that security should be realized within an
acceptable formula that takes into consideration all parties and
not just one.
</P>
<P>
"Insistence on security for a single party could not possibly
be acceptable," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi FM Calls for Speedy Resolution of Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Thursday called for speed resolution of the boundary
demarcation and disputes arising out of those by the
sub-continental countries in the spirit of SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) for the benefit of the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
"There should be an urgent need for the sub-continental
countries concerned to address these problems which we inherited
prior to the partition," he said while addressing a dialogue on
"SAARC: Present and Future" here, the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The boundary demarcation made at the time of partition did not
solve problems, rather it created new ones, he pointed out, adding
"We have to march forward and should not look back in the past
which was not pleasant on many counts."
</P>
<P>
After exploding nuclear devices last year, India and Pakistan
had "very earnestly" begun the task of confidence building among
them, Azad said, renewing his appreciation of the bus trip made by
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Delhi to Lahore
aimed at generating confidence and good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
"We are also waiting for (his) similar trip here," he said. "We
expect the Dhaka-Calcutta bus service to begin very shortly."
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy pursued by the government, Azad said,
"Our initiatives are to have better relations with all our
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present position of the SAARC, Azad said:
"SAARC is at a crossroads." "We now have to take stock of what we
have achieved, and decide where we would like to see ourselves in
the next century."
</P>
<P>
The SAARC had made "considerable progress" in furthering
institutionalized arrangements for cooperation, he said. There are
many areas where "we can learn from experience and improve the
organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the process of globalization, "we have no choice but to go
for regional cooperation for common good", he stated, emphasizing
the need for further strengthening of efforts already made to make
the regional grouping fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation is at the core of the SAARC, Azad
stressed, saying "Our people will be disappointed if this body
fails to deliver results."
</P>
<P>
Founded in December 1985, the SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Slams NATO's Claim of "Fighting for Values" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO's recent strategic slogan "
fighting for values" is nothing but a new version of hegemonic
philosophy, said a signed commentary by Xinhua correspondents.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "'Fighting for values' is a fig leaf
for NATO's hegemonism," said at the turn of the century, when
people of the world are yearning for a permanent peace, "the U.S.-
led NATO has brazenly cooked up various absurd arguments as pleas
for its aggressive and hegemonic policies."
</P>
<P>
The core of NATO's new strategic concept issued on April 25 in
Washington, the commentary noted, is to extend the organization's
defense zones to outside its members' territories, and to turn
NATO from a traditional group of collective defense into "an
offensive and aggressive military bloc which can poke its nose to
anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
NATO's new strategy underlines the importance of the so-called
"safeguarding democratic values," for which NATO has "the freedom
of action if necessary." Meanwhile, leaders of key members of the
NATO have been trying hard to justify the aggression against
Yugoslavia as not a war for territory but "a fight for
safeguarding values."
</P>
<P>
"This NATO's nonsense of 'fight for values' sounded a bit fresh
at the first hearing, but is in fact a new version of the
aggressor and gangster logic held by the Western Great Powers,"
Tang Tianri and Zhou Xisheng said in their co-signed commentary.
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what NATO has done in Yugoslavia -- since it keeps
saying that it is using force there to stop the 'humanitarian
disaster' in Kosovo and to 'fight for values' for the West," said
the commentary, listing the atrocities brought to that country.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment against Yugoslavia, starting on March 24, "is
not only the largest ever war action waged by NATO in its 50
years' history, but also the most barbarous and the largest
military aggression taking place in Europe since World War II."
NATO has used 1,000 various sophisticated warplanes which carried
out 12,000 sorties of bombing mission. More than 10,000 tons of
bombs, including graphite bombs and cluster bombs were dropped,
and 3,000 missiles fired.
</P>
<P>
As a result, at least 1,200 civilians were killed in Yugoslavia,
with an immediate loss of more than 120 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even further, "the wild NATO even wantonly trampled on
international laws and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations and the basic norms governing the international
relations by laying murderous hands on foreign targets in
Yugoslavia," said the commentary, in reference to the NATO's
blowing up of a humanitarian vehicle on May 5 and the attack on
the Chinese Embassy on May 7 which killed three Chinese
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peace calls and efforts from all over the world, "
the U.S.-led NATO still goes on its own way and stubbornly clings
to its barbarous policy of war, with a strong will to override
Yugoslavia, thus further deteriorating the Kosovo crisis."
</P>
<P>
Being responsible for the grave war crimes committed against
Yugoslavia, what right does the U.S.-led NATO have in talking
about "humanitarianism" and "human rights?" The commentary asked.
</P>
<P>
The aggression war against Yugoslavia is a mirror that
thoroughly exposes NATO's real objective of playing power politics
and pursuing hegemonism, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The big family of the world is composed of individual sovereign
nations, which differ in social system, cultural heritage, life
style, religion and values. All nations are equal even though they
share different views in the above-mentioned fields. Any attempt
to alter other nation's values by using force accounts to serious
violations against the fundamental norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the view of state sovereignty was
developed in history and is still functioning. It is the most
basic common sense and principle in international relations.
</P>
<P>
The "values" NATO wants to safeguard are nothing but the so-
called "democracy," "freedom" and "humanitarianism" that the
western powers have all along advocated. However, the hypocrisy of
such values has been fully revealed in NATO's bombing against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The commentary concluded that three objectives are behind
NATO's claim of fighting for "values":
</P>
<P>
First, the bloc wants to introduce those "values" of its own to
other regions in the world by force;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, in attempting to force other nations to fall into
dependents of NATO, it plays deceiving gimmicks and creates new
excuses for its aggressive expansion;
</P>
<P>
And, by claiming that it is fighting for "values," the military
organization is defending its aggression wars which are either
underway or to be staged in an attempt to evade the condemnation
from the just international opinion and the punishment of the
history.
</P>
<P>
In one word, "fighting for values" is merely an excuse of the U.
S.-led NATO to promote hegemonism, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Condemns NATO Bombing of Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Anna
Linda denounced on Thursday the NATO killing of innocent people in
its barbaric bombing of the populous Belgrade, describing it as "
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
She made the statement in an interview with Swedish journalists
after the NATO bombing of Belgrade's Dragisa Misovic hospital
which killed three patients and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
Linda said that the Swedish government had informed NATO of its
position on the ongoing military strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Embassy in Yugoslavia, which is near the hospital,
was also slightly damaged when the NATO warplanes fired three
missiles at the hospital and a nearby petrol station, she said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, however, made it clear that the Swedish
Embassy was not the target of NATO although it suffered a minor
damage in the air raids.
</P>
<P>
She said that Sweden hopes that a breakthrough could be made in
the international efforts to stop the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
so that the U.N. Security Council would reach an agreement on the
settlement of the Kosovo issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Antezana Rojas Francisco, 39, possessing a Bolivian passport,
arrived at the airport by a Swiss air plane. He was caught at the
checkpoint for carrying 3,275 grams of cocaine hidden in six
shampoo and liquid soap bottles in his luggage.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent investigations showed that the Bolivian man had been
recruited by two Peruvian citizens before his plane took off in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the police captured Trujilo Roca Abrahan, 37, one of
the two Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor's Office under the Supreme Court of Justice
ordered the two men into custody on charge of drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The police said the detainees were members of an international
trafficking ring.
</P>
<P>
This is the second drug capture in this month. Two weeks ago,
as many as 25 kilograms of heroin were seized on the road linking
the western towns of Arad and Timisoara in Romania's biggest drug-
seizing operation this year.
</P>
<P>
Drug smuggling and addiction in Romania became rampant since
early 90's. The police confiscated over 21 tons of drugs in the
past eight years, and made over 530 criminal records of persons
involved in drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Warns of High Inflation Without IMF-Agreed Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting Minister of Economy
Andrei Shapovalyants warned Thursday that the country's inflation
could rise to 60 percent next year if the State Duma fails to pass
the laws required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a government session chaired by newly confirmed
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, Shapovalyants said foreign
investment in Russia would drop dramatically if the IMF and the
World Bank refuse to provide loans.
</P>
<P>
However, Stepashin, who was confirmed by the State Duma only
on Wednesday, said some difficulties could be encountered in
pushing the IMF-agreed bills through the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bills were agreed on with the IMF as a condition for
freeing 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in frozen credits.
</P>
<P>
Shapovalyants said his ministry is working on ways to prevent
capital flight in the event Russia is denied new loans.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, meanwhile, noted that no substantial foreign
investment is likely before presidential elections in 2000, and

<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC) smashed two Afghan groups and killed 30 members in
recent armed clashes, the evening newspaper Kayhan reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two Afghan groups exchanged fire with
the IRGC ground forces in the Torbat-e Jam region, the
northeastern province of Khorasan, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian forces also seized a large amount of ammunition
and narcotics from the hideouts of the two groups, the report
said. However, it did not mention when the clashes happened.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Iranian troops launched military
attacks on Afghanistan's western provinces last weekend and the
Afghan ruling Taliban militia lodged a protest to Iran over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday denied the
reports and claimed that Iranian armed forces would encounter
notorious smuggling gangs in case they try to cross into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC deployed its forces along Iran's northeastern
borders with Afghanistan since last September following the
killing of a group of Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Party' Basic Line Vital to China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The adherence to the basic line
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is the fundamental guarantee
for the Chinese People to overcome all difficulties on their way
forward.
</P>
<P>
This has again been evidenced by the fact that the CPC Central
Committee has, in accordance with the Party's basic line,
resolutely, correctly and properly handled the incident of the U.S.
-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7,
said a People's Daily editorial, which will be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin said, "The Chinese People will
unswervingly stick to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic
line to carry the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century in line with the strategic
objectives set during the 15th National Congress of the CPC."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's speech incorporates the scientific summary of
historical experience and is also a sound answer to power politics
and hegemonism, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The U.S-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
indicated that power politics and hegemonism cannot tolerate a
growing socialist China that upholds justice, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The incident reminds us again that the world is far from
peaceful, and the only way that we can meet the challenge posed by
power politics and hegemonism and stand firmly on our own feet in
the world is to hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
adhere to the Party's basic line and constantly enhance our
comprehensive national strength," the editorial points out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have scored tremendous achievements in
socialist construction in the past 20 years. "But this is what the
hostile forces both at home and abroad are unwilling to see and is
also what they most fear," says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, they attempt in every way to change our political
line and to disrupt and sabotage our cause in a bid to contain our
development."
</P>
<P>
However, all their attempts are bound to fail, as the Chinese
people are armed with Deng Xiaoping Theory, firmly pursuing the
Party's basic line, and united in striving for the realization of
China's trans-century grand objective, the editorial declares.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes to Reach Partnership Agreement With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
on Thursday expressed hope that a partnership agreement would be
reached between his country and the European Union (EU) in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told Egyptian and German members of the Arab-German
Chamber of Commerce and Industry that Cairo hopes the
Euro-Egyptian partnership agreement will be concluded "within the
coming weeks or months," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official described the negotiations between the
two sides for the agreement "are proceeding satisfactorily."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU have been engaging for years in the talks on
the partnership agreement on deepening cooperation in industry,
agriculture and trade. The two sides are now stuck over, among
other things, the agricultural items.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed the importance of the Euro-Egyptian partnership
agreement in boosting cooperation between Egypt and the EU, and
promoting Egypt's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The accord would help eliminate customs restrictions hampering
export of Egyptian products to Europe, and allow the transfer of
advanced technology to the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also provide an effective mechanism for
settling trade disputes, protecting intellectual property rights
and reinforcing political dialog between Egypt and the 15-nation
European organization, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The main challenges facing Egypt in maximizing benefit from the
agreement are improving infrastructure and industrial services,
and modernizing the national industry in a bid to boost Egyptian
products' competitiveness and the Egyptian-EU trade.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Charter Not to Change Before 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- All political changes to
Philippines' 1987 Constitution would take effect only after
President Joseph Estrada's term ends in 2004, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora reiterated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said in a radio interview that the president has already
made it clear that economic--not political--reforms should top the
list of constitutional provisions to be considered for revision.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, the president wants political changes
to take effect only after his term ends," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress are reportedly planning to convene a
constituent assembly to amend certain provisions in the 1987
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
They cited a recent Social Weather Stations survey showing that
the public favor some changes to the Charter.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Presidential Palace would let Congress decide
whether to amend the Charter through a constituent assembly or a
constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying that we will abide by Congress' decision. It is
not for us to decide how to amend the Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Estrada administration has been clear about its
position of favoring amendments to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said that the president had set up a Preparatory Commission
on Constitutional Reforms to recommend amendments to the Charter
and the commission "will have real work to do."
</P>
<P>
He added the president does not want a repeat of the past
administration's experience in 1997, when it tried to amend the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1997 attempt failed because of perceptions that
some elected officials tried to amend the Charter mainly to remove
the limits on their terms of office.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to repeat that experience," he said.

he said, adding that "This would bode ill for the efforts to
improve the atmosphere since February this year."

Pakistan, he said, remains committed to the dialogue process.

<P>
YANGON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar delegation left here
Thursday for Laos to attend a six-nation ministerial meeting on
drug control due to begin in Vientiane Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Colonel Thein Nyunt, minister of
progress of border areas and national races and development
affairs. He is also vice-chairman of the Myanmar Central Committee
for Drug Abuse Control.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third ministerial-level meeting since the six
nations (China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam),
involving the U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP), signed a
memorandum of understanding on drug control in Beijing in 1995 and
agreed on a sub-regional action plan.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on regional collaboration on drug control is
expected to be signed when ministers of the six nations meet in
Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review projects being implemented under
the sub-regional action plan worked out at the second ministerial
meeting held in Bangkok in July 1997 on law enforcement, supply
and demand reductions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to discuss progress in
implementing the decisions of the U.N. General Assembly Special
Session on Drugs in June 1998, which aimed at significantly
reducing demand and supply of illicit drugs by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two projects dealing with precursor control and the
reduction of illicit drug use in the highlands of East Asia are
being carried out from 1997 to 1999 in Myanmar's Shan and Kachin
states under the component agreement of the sub-regional action
plan signed by senior officials of the six nations in Yangon in
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Friday's ministerial-level talks in Vientiane have been
reportedly preceded by senior officials' meetings since Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Collective Responsibility Cited for Closure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The closure of the Cooperative Bank
is a complicated matter and many agencies should be held
responsible for this, Ugandan central bank governor Charles
Kikonyogo told a news conference Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"As the supervisor of all commercial banks in the country, we
do not do the day-to-day work of these banks. It is very
difficult to stop the culture of fraud in the financial sector,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The managers, the stakeholders and even the general public
should also be blamed for the closure of commercial banks. Of
course, government departments should shoulder some
responsibility," the central bank governor added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is better for Uganda to have fewer but
well-managed banks than to have many but insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, central bank spokesman Malugembe Musoke
told reporters that lack of qualified accountants also leads to
mismanagement of the banks. The whole country has no more than 60
qualified accountants at present, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank is intensifying its efforts to train
all cadres in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank announced the closure of the Cooperative Bank
in a press release issued Wednesday evening. This is the second
big commercial bank closed in the capital city so far this year.
The Greenland Bank Limited was closed in early April because of
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the amount of deposits in the Cooperative
Bank, Kikonyogo said he could not give the exact figure, but the
deposits of the bank was about 51 billion shillings (42 million
U.S. dollars), accounting for eight percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
He said that some businesses would be affected by the bank
closure, adding that the depositors' money would be paid back.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Former First Lady Pleads for Forgiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former First Lady, Maryam
Abacha, pleaded Wednesday in a statement released to Nigerian
press for forgiveness for her husband and family.
</P>
<P>
In the message entitled "My message to fellow Nigerians"
circulated to media houses, she said: "My husband was not an
angel. Neither am I," adding she does not intend to make excuses
for the "alleged shortcomings" of her husband, former Head of
State Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
She also sent a congratulatory message to Olusegun Obasanjo,
who she referred to as a "good and old friend", on his victory in
the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
The former fist lady's statement is apparently geared to the
coming government hand-over on May 29, suggested This Day, a major
Nigerian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Head of State Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar had
reiterated that his government will not prosecute the Abacha
family over the allegation of looting of the treasury.
</P>
<P>
There was no basis for prosecuting members of the Abacha family
"since the man whose signature authorized the spending is now
dead," he told a media briefing Tuesday in Abuja, the country's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Sani Abacha, who became head of state in 1993 and died last
June, and his family are under constant attacks by many Nigerians
accusing them of human rights abuses, looting of the treasury,
subversion of democracy and scheming to perpetuate itself in
office.

<HEADLINE> Closed Ugandan Commercial Bank to Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The just closed Cooperative Bank in
Uganda would be sold to competent banks in the near future, a
senior official with the central bank told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Katimbo Mugwanya, executive director of the central bank in
charge of banking supervision, said: "We made it very clear in the
press statement that the seizure and closure of the bank means
that the bank will not exist any more."
</P>
<P>
"In about one month and a half the bank will be sold to
competent banks in the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked what if there were no bidders for the bank by that
time, he said the central bank would, in that case, pay the
depositors and liquidate the loans.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank was notified of its insolvency late last year.
 But the bank's internal control systems were very weak and it has
been riddled by extensive and persistent employee frauds.
</P>
<P>
The bank's level of bad and doubtful loans to total credit
advanced had risen from 29 percent to 51 percent over the last
three years and were standing at 20 billion shillings (16 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative Bank, with a history of more than 20 years, has
 altogether 24 branches across the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Elect New Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting a
nine-month war to topple the regime of President Laurent Kabila
have elected Emile Ilunga as their new leader to replace Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba as chairman of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD).
</P>
<P>
Commander Jean Pierre Ondekane became the first RCD deputy
chairman, while Moise Nyarugabo, who was formerly RCD first
-deputy chairman, became its second deputy-deputy chairman, the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The election was made Wednesday following a special congress
held in the rebels' capital of Goma, on the shores of Lake Kivu,
on the border with Rwanda. It brought together 50 founding
members of the Congolese Rally for Democracy, and 22 top military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the congress was to solve the internal power
struggle which heightened two months ago by Wamba's flight to
rebel-held city of Kisangani, the third largest city in the
country. He installed his headquarters there in what his
opponents called a ''violation'' of the texts of the movement.
</P>
<P>
Emile Ilunga had kept a low profile and was in charge of the
department of health. He, like Kabila, is from Katanga Province
and served in the famous Katangese ''Gendarmes'' which
unsuccessfully fought the regime of late Zairian dictator, Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Among the urgent tasks assigned to the new rebel leader is to
try to unify the movement in solving squabbles rocking its
previous leadership.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Offers No Cars or Free Tickets to IOC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Games organisers warned to
International Olympic Committee (IOC) members that no chauffeur
driven cars or free tickets for relatives are available in the
2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Michael Knight, president of Sydney Olympic Organising
Committee, said that the 5.5 million dollars (3.5 million U.S.
dollars) budgets of cars and tickets will be squeezed off as he
announced cuts of 71 million dollars (45 million U.S. dollars) at
a board meeting on Thursday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
This action means the IOC members will receive no privileges
which they had got used to in past Games.
</P>
<P>
Organisers said only IOC members, International Sports
Federations and National Olympic Committee officials without a
specific job to do at the Games would be victims of the move.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Exports of Leather Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China is making an effort to
increase leather goods exports and is trying to get 7 percent
annual growth in exports.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest leather shoe producer, with an
annual production capacity of at least 2.4 billion pairs. The
industry earned 9.72 billion U.S. dollars through exports last
year, 2.3 billion dollars less than in 1997, but leather ranked
high among all light industry exports.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance between shoe supply and demand on the domestic
market is becoming more obvious even though shoe exports accounted
for almost 40 percent of major leather goods exports.
</P>
<P>
It was affected by the Asian financial crisis and exports of
leather are becoming more difficult, according to Xu Yong,
chairman of the board of the Leather Industry Association, who
says that most domestic shoe producers don't place enough emphasis
on name-brand products and think about price competition instead.
</P>
<P>
However, he says, some shoe manufacturers like Senda have
withstood the export pressure and have even improved their
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
To boost exports, China will exploit new markets in the Middle
East, North America, and Africa and, by 2010, output of major
leather products is expected to grow 5 percent, and sales and
exports to grow 7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
If China joins the WTO this year, it will bring more commercial
opportunities for the sector, says Zhang Shuhua, the president of
the Leather Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
By then, the import tax on raw leather materials will go down
from 20 percent to 15 percent, which will strongly boost exports
and lower production costs.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Optimistic About China's Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China has been pulling through the
Asian financial crisis very successfully and the long-term
prospects for its economy are quite optimistic, according to
Flemming Larsen, vice-director of the research department under
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today on the World Economic
Outlook published recently by the IMF, Larsen said that the Asian
financial crisis has had some adverse impact on China, which is
quite normal for a country which is increasingly becoming
integrated into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Although China's exports have decreased somewhat, it does not
mean that China's competence has weakened," he said. "The global
and regional economic climate was to blame."
</P>
<P>
He said that since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis,
China has introduced measures to stimulate and promote domestic
demand, and at the same time has paid attention to actually
lessening the role of these measures, which is the right way to
develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The major economic measures adopted by the Chinese government,
including the foreign exchange rate policy, have proved very
successful," he said, adding that these measures not only helped
stabilize and develop the domestic economy, but have also
contributed significantly to the recovery of the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth rate of China's gross domestic product
may continue to slow down for another year, but with the bottoming
out of the Asian economy and the recovery of the global economy,
China's national economy will also recover.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the current slow down of China's economy is
mainly affected by the global economic environment, it will not
last long, and there should be no worries about this.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese FM Says Macao Transition Will Be Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama, a veteran diplomat who has visited China 6 times, told
Xinhua in an interview today that there will be an appropriate and
peaceful transition of Macao and that Portugal and China will
provide the world with an example of common understanding.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Gama said that, during the decade after the signing of
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Statement in 1987, both countries have
had positive and satisfactory cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He praised the enormous efforts both sides have made and said
that there has been progress in many areas, including the move of
Portuguese civil servants to Portugal, the social security problem
in Macao, and basic issues related to the transition ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there are still some problems to be resolved,
but said that they can be handled with a cooperative approach and
that judiciary problems and the status of the official language
can be resolved in the next meeting in Lisbon because both sides
of the liaison group consider it a common goal.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Portugal would lend a hand in improving
relations between the EU and China when Portugal becomes president
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that each trip to China seems to foretell a major event.
In 1978, when he first visited China, the two countries were
busily trying to open diplomatic ties, something that happened the
next year, and 9 years later, when he visited China as foreign
minister, he was one of the people who helped prepare the joint
statement and the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group.

<HEADLINE> Priceless Buddha Going On Display In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A carving of Buddha that is more
than a thousand years old, which is referred to as "the Eastern
Venus", will be shown to the public at the Museum of Chinese
History here on July 9.
</P>
<P>
The carving was made between 386-550. Its two arms are missing
but it has an enigmatic smile, and archaeologists say that the 1.
87-meter carving is typical of oriental culture.
</P>
<P>
Other sculptures discovered in October 1996 at the same site
where this piece was found, the Longxing Temple site in Shandong
Province, are being proposed for the exhibit, a museum staff
member told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The sculptures are made of white marble, granite, and pottery.
Some of them bear chronological records which show the oldest
dating back to 529 and the most recent to 1026. They were found by
a group of workers who stumbled on an underground cave during
construction work in October 1996 in Shandong's Qingzhou County.
</P>
<P>
When archaeologists examined the cave they found many colorful
carvings of Buddha and decided that the ruins could be part of
Longxing Temple, one of the most famous Buddhist temples in
ancient Qingzhou, which was a prosperous cultural center more than
a millennium ago.
</P>
<P>
Su Bai, a prominent archaeologist, says the sculptures are the
most delicate he's ever seen and that they have unique artistic
and academic use. This is echoed by Ma Shichang, a professor of
archaeology at Beijing University, who says that no other
sculpture rivals those found at Longxing Temple.
</P>
<P>
Academics and archaeologists in Hong Kong and Taiwan have paid
close attention to the finds and some Japanese and South Koreans
want to organize overseas exhibits of them, according to insiders.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Chinese History by the Tian'anmen Square is to
launch the exhibition as a special event to greet the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China, which falls on
October 1 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Development Bank (CDB)
announced today that it has successfully issued 10 billion yuan in
discounted six-month financial bonds through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time this year that the CDB has issued
financial bonds after two issues of long-term bonds in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CDB said that, after competitive bidding,
the price for the bonds was defined at 98.3 yuan, with an annual
earning rate of 3.43 percent, which is 0.35 percentage points
lower than the current one-year fixed deposit interest rate,
effectively cutting down fund-raising costs for the CDB.
</P>
<P>
He said that the successful issuance of the bonds indicates
that the CDB's market financing capability has become mature.
</P>
<P>
Successful bidders of the bonds include the China Industrial
and Commercial Bank, China Construction Bank, Guangdong
Development Bank and Hangzhou Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the CDB will issue more short-term
financial bonds in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Privacy, Right Protection for AIDS Patients Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to protect the privacy and
legal rights of hundreds of thousands of HIV/AIDS victims in China
are being enhanced with the Ministry of Health (MOH) publishing an
administrative order introducing powerful regulations for
management of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the State Council, China's highest
governing body, the MOH order for the management of HIV carriers
and AIDS patients has been issued to relevant organs of local
governments at different levels, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
China had officially reported more than 12,000 confirmed cases
of HIV infection by the end of last year. However, the real figure
is estimated as some 400,000 by experts and is rising.
</P>
<P>
The new order, the first of its kind in China, not only asks
that personal information about HIV/AIDS sufferers be kept secret,
but also declares that the legal rights and interests of those
people and their relatives should not be infringed.
</P>
<P>
Before this, there was not even one government rule covering
this, or further a law, in China to clearly stipulate the
protection of HIV/AIDS patients while discouraging discrimination
against them, which is believed to be common nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will draft a regulation on the prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS this year. It will be more powerful than this
order in terms of the protection of rights and interests of the
patients," said Shen Jie, a ministry official in charge of the
management of the HIV/AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
The MOH order asks all units and individuals who are in charge
of diagnosis, treatment, and management work not to publish any
personal information about HIV/AIDS sufferers, such as the name
and the family address.
</P>
<P>
"Principally, a person, as well as his or her spouse and other
family members, should be informed after he or she is confirmed
HIV positive. And the person should be provided with psychological
counseling and technical instructions to prevent further infection,
" the order says.
</P>
<P>
Medical institutes and their employees designated by local
health authorities should not refuse to provide medicare to HIV/
AIDS patients, it says.
</P>
<P>
According to the order, AIDS patients and their children should
not be deprived of schooling, employment and other social
activities. HIV carriers can get married after taking medical
advice.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, HIV carriers and AIDS patients are
prohibited from donating blood, sperm, organs, human tissues and
cells. Those who intentionally cause HIV transmission would have
to take responsibility for this.
</P>
<P>
The ministry encourages communities to play a leading role in
creating a friendly, tolerant and healthy environment for the
patients, helping them to avoid high-risk behaviors while taking
positive attitudes towards life, Shen Jie said.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Confident Indonesians Will Choose Good Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BATAM, Indonesia, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday he is confident that the
Indonesians will elect a good government that will continue to
bring good to Indonesia and its people in next month's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie here, Mahathir said the Indonesian leader apprised
him of the true situation in that country and he felt that the
situation was not as bad as reported in the media.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that the general election will proceed smoothly
and in the end, the Indonesians who are known for their
nationalistic spirit will surely choose a government that will do
a lot of good for Indonesia," he said after the four-eye meeting
which lasted 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held as soon as Mahathir arrived here for a
short visit specially to hold bilateral talks with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that Indonesians who love Indonesia will not
forget their responsibility and we in Malaysia feel easy because
we know that Indonesia will continue to be progressive and
peaceful," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"And a developed and peaceful Indonesia is important to this
region, especially for good relations between Malaysia and
Indonesia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described his visit to the island as very useful and
very good for Malaysia and also for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the meeting, he and President Habibie managed
to resolve several small bilateral issues relating to trade and
logging in their joint-border areas.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting really helps us to clear up bilateral problems,
keeps us updated on each other's problems and to find ways and
means of solving the problems in a way that is not to the
detriment of each other," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was followed by an hour-long meeting between the
delegations from both countries.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders appeared relaxed at the news conference and
President Habibie described Mahathir as a senior and invited him
to start the conference.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who is the presidential candidate for Parti Golkar in
the coming election, said he was thankful to see Mahathir healthy,
adding "That is most important to me."
</P>
<P>
Habibie said Indonesia realized that the new millennium, which
was only months away, would bring many changes, stiff
international and industrial competition and would depend greatly
on productivity.
</P>
<P>
"These are determined based on compatibility and harmony
between culture and technological knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as Malaysia and Indonesia had similarities in
various fields it was appropriate for the two countries to hold
discussions at the ministerial level and also between Mahathir and
himself to give priority to efforts to raise their productivity.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Indonesia and Malaysia would be able to
further step up cooperation in the fields of economy and culture
to enhance their productivity and human resources.

of a 4,300-km-long oil pipeline connecting the western parts of
the country with Khazakstan.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Yaowen, vice-president of the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the pipeline project which is expected to
cost a total of 2.3 billion US dollars, will help China to carry
out its energy strategy in developing oil in western parts, and in
the meantime exploring and utilizing oil resources in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the international section of the
pipeline will extend 3,000 kilometers from Karamay in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and end in Khazakstan.
</P>
<P>
"When completed in eight years, the pipeline is expected to
transport 25 million tons of oil from Khazakstan to China annually,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline's domestic section starts from Korla, north of the
Tarim Desert. After arriving at Lanzhou, a major petrochemical
industrial center in northwest China's Gansu province, the
pipeline will go east to central China's Henan province in one
direction and to southwest China's Sichuan province in another.
</P>
<P>
China's northwest provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and
autonomous regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang together have one third
of the country's total oil reserves. The region is expected to
produce one fifth of China's total oil output in three years.
</P>
<P>
Khazakstan, which borders Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is
very rich in oil and gas resources, and is expected to be one of
the world's six largest petroleum producers within ten years.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the pipeline will not only help China
import oil from Khazakstan, but also ease oil transportation in
the western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
At present, a 482-km section of the pipeline from Korla to
Shanshan within Xinjiang has been completed, and the construction
of the pipeline from Xinjiang's Shanshan to Luoyang in Henan and
Pengzhou in Sichuan is in full swing.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Protests India's Border Guideline Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Thursday lodged protest
with India over its violation of the India-Bangladesh border
guideline.
</P>
<P>
Pinak R. Chakraborty, deputy high commissioner of India to
Bangladesh, was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
handed over the protest note, the official news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The protest was registered following construction of defense
structures by the Indians near Tetulia in Panchagarh district,
northern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka asked New Delhi to stop the construction and to resolve
the dispute by holding flag meeting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
None can go for construction of defense structures within 150
yards of the zero line between the two countries, as per the
India-Bangladesh border guideline, the BSS said. And in the
present case, that guideline was violated, Foreign Ministry
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tension was building up Wednesday when members of the Border
Security Forces of India were seen erecting trench near the
Majhipara border of Tetulia, the BSS said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Appointment of Macao SAR's First Chief Executive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's most
influential newspaper, is to publish an editorial tomorrow hailing
the appointment of the first Chief Executive of the Macao Special
Administrative Region today.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's top governing body, made the
appointment today in accordance with the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR and a relevant decision of the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, and as a result of the votes of the
Selection committee of the First Government of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily editorial says that it is the first time in
hundreds of years that local residents in Macao have themselves
selected the leader of the Macao government, which is a major
event in the process of Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The outcome, representing the coming of a new era for Macao,
has caught the attention of both the Chinese people and the
international community, the editorial says, extending warm
congratulations to Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first Macao SAR Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that it is the "one country, two systems" policy put
forward by Deng Xiaoping that laid a solid ground for handling the
Macao issue, the editorial notes that the central authorities with
Jiang Zemin at the core have made strenuous efforts in carrying
out the policy and local residents in Macao have taken an active
part in preparing for the establishment of the Macao SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
The process of electing the first Chief Executive has always
been characterized by fairness, justice, transparency, democracy
and honesty and in strict accordance with law, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The outcome, highly spoken of both at home and abroad,
indicates that the Chinese government is determined to carry out
the policy of administering Macao by Macao people and fully
implementing the Macao SAR Basic Law, the editorial says.

</P>
<P>
The first Chief Executive will be responsible for preparing the
establishment of the first government of Macao SAR in accordance
with law and will also have a lot of work to do for the
implementation of the "one country, two system" policy, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial expects the first Chief Executive of the Macao
SAR, with support from the people of the motherland, trust by the

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges More Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin asked on Thursday for more military spending in the wake
of NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a government session for the first time since he was
confirmed as premier by the State Duma (lower house of parliament)
on Wednesday, Stepashin said the defense spending must be planned
at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the 2000 budget
plan, up from the current 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The events in Yugoslavia show that the level of our defense is
such that no one would speak to us," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would insist on the implementation of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's decree that increases defense spending
to 3.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin asked acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov "to
take into consideration this position in drafting the 2000 budget.
"
</P>
<P>
Zadornov, however, said Yeltsin had signed the decree "in a
somewhat different situation. It should be realized that 3.5
percent of GDP constitutes 35 percent of the budget expenditure."
</P>
<P>
He warned that rising military expenditure would mean reduction
in spending in other items, including the social sphere.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Zadornov said the Finance Ministry would consider
this request when drafting the 2000 budget and do its best to
increase defense spending.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir, Habibie Hold Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BATAM, Indonesia, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie Thursday
held bilateral talks proposed by Jakarta on this Indonesian island
in the Riau archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was welcomed on his arrival by Habibie who also flew
in Thursday morning. They were then driven in the same car to the
seaside Nongsa Point Marina Resort for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were accompanied by their wives on the trip.
</P>
<P>
This was the two leaders' second meeting since Habibie took
over from the deposed Soeharto in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi, who has also assumed duties
as state secretary, said last week Habibie would discuss bilateral
and regional issues with Mahathir but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The talks began with a four-eye session between the two leaders
before their delegations met. Officials said the discussions,
expected to last two hours, would cover politics, economy,
security, culture and social issues.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is accompanied by Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar
and International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Habibie leads a high-profile delegation that includes Muladi,
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Trade Ginandjar
Kartasasmita, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Defense Minister
General Wiranto and Industry Minister Rahadi Ramelan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had met at last November's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir departed after lunch to begin a two-day visit to
Malaysia's southern state of Johor which is linked to Batam island
by ferry.

<HEADLINE> Britain Recalls Aircraft Carrier From Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Thursday that it was
recalling its aircraft carrier Invincible from the Adriatic Sea,
where it had been involved in the NATO air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I've decided that she should now return to the United Kingdom
with her task group," Defense Secretary George Robertson told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be a direct replacement nor is one needed as
the number of aircraft available has been steadily increasing
since she first deployed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also said the Invincible's Sea Harrier jump jets had
been regularly flying air defense patrols as part of NATO's air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
When the Invincible was first deployed early in NATO's eight-
week-old campaign, the alliance needed its fighters so that other
fast aircraft could be "re-rolled" from air defense to bombing
missions, Air Marshal Sir John Day, deputy chief of the Defense
Staff, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Invincible Sea Harriers were able quickly to fulfill this
requirement so that NATO could continue to maintain air
superiority," Day said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the traditional fighter and bomber aircraft have been
deployed to the area we can afford to release Invincible and her
Sea Harrier FA2s," said Day.

<HEADLINE> More French People Want NATO to Stop Bombing Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- More French people want NATO to stop
bombing and engage in talks with Yugoslavia, said a poll published
on Thursday by the daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine percent of French people believe that NATO should
cease bombing and engage immediately in the talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, while 49 percent others think that
NATO should continue the military intervention as long as the
Serbs don't accept the NATO conditions, said the poll.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, 56 percent of the interviewees supported the
NATO bombing while 42 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The poll was jointly conducted on May 15 among 952 people
representing all walks of life in France and above the age of 18
by the Ifop polling institute and the daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
Liberation said that the growing number of "errors" committed
by NATO in its bombing missions was the main reason for the drop
of the support rate to the war.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that people sympathetic with the left-wing
parties are more inclined to a stop of NATO bombing, while those
who support the right-wing parties show more support to NATO.

Speaking at the Asia-Mexico business meeting which was opened
here Thursday morning, Armando Jarque said that Mexico is
strengthening its relationship with Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland, adding: "We are doing this on a daily basis and this is
the main purpose of this business meeting."
</P>
<P>
Armando Jarque said the Mexican government works with the aim
of attaining economic growth, high levels of employment and an
increased standard of living and is achieving these goals.
</P>
<P>
Mexico also has free access to the markets of North America and
many other countries in Latin America, and "we are working
dynamically in opening new free markets, like the European Union",
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that Mexican trade is very successful in the
markets of the American continent and that there are many
possibilities for success in the Asian-Mexican market, for you and
for us." "Our strategy is to participate even more in Asia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned many Mexican delegations' visit to Hong Kong and
the upcoming visit by Hong Kong Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan to Mexico city as well as the number of investments happening

<HEADLINE> 7th COMESA Council of Ministers Meeting Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The 7th meeting of the Council of
Ministers of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) opened here Thursday with the theme of "Countdown Toward
COMESA Free Trade Area" by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, COMESA Secretary-General
Erastus Mwencha noted that regionalism is a vital component of the
global economic architecture and globalization has brought about
major benefits through market integration.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the decline in trade performance in Africa
for 1998 was attributed to reduced international commodity prices
which fell sharply in the year, pushing the share of primary
products in world exports below 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1998 world exports valued at 5,583 billion U.S. dollars,
the COMESA contributed only 23 billion dollars, or 0.45 percent
of world trade,

he complained.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha told the ministers that the signing of a free trade
area between the European Union (EU) and South Africa means that
even more challenging competition is right at COMESA doorstep.
</P>
<P>
For achieving a free trade area by the set date, he said, the
council simplified the tariff reduction schedule on a common list
to a single tariff reduction rate based on current national tariff
rates covering all goods that meet the Rules of Origin criteria.
</P>
<P>
On protection of infant industries, Mwencha said the major
threat to our industries is not from within the COMESA but from
outside the region, adding that "we can no longer delay reducing
costs of production and level of protection. "
</P>
<P>
"If we turn a blind eye to the clear global signals, it will be
at our own long-term peril," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha urged the member states to make every effort to
implement all of the COMESA programs, saying that "we need to
finish the last lap and enter the new millennium with our free
trade area in place, bringing Africa into the global arena on
equal terms."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, who officially opened
the meeting, said, "our vision should be that of one region that
is integrated, internationally competitive, in which factors of
production move free in an enlarged and prosperous COMESA market."
</P>
<P>
He said all stake-holders should give attention to the COMESA
agenda to remove all barriers to intra-COMESA trade, to implement
the transport facilitation measures adopted by the COMESA
authority, to promote COMESA as a common investment area and to
attain monetary harmonization in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
Godana noted that the establishment of the free trade area and
adoption of a common external tariff will only be the beginning of
the regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
He urged the COMESA members to expand intra-COMESA trade in
order to encourage both foreign and regional foreign direct
investment, which will in turn lead to economic growth, create
additional jobs and raise the people's living standards.

<HEADLINE> Canada Bank Forecasts Stronger Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada has shaken off the effects of
the Asian financial crisis and is on course for a much stronger
economic growth than previously expected, the Bank of Canada said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economy could grow by as much as 3.75 percent this
year, up half percentage point from the bank's November monetary
policy report, Gordon Thiessen, governor of the bank, said as the
bank released its semi-annual report on monetary conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said the effects of last year's Asian financial crisis are
fading.
</P>
<P>
"Canada was moving toward full (economic) capacity and got hit
by the shock, and we've now tended to recover a good deal of that,
though the shock has not disappeared completely," said Thiessen.
</P>
<P>
Powerful growth in the U.S., low interest rates, and rebounding
consumer, business, and investor confidence began improving
Canada's economy last year and early 1999, said Thiessen, adding
that the fourth-quarter growth in 1998 was 4.6 percent, while the
first three months of 1999 showed 4 percent of growth.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, after raising interest rates by one
percentage point last August, has now returned rates to the level
they were before.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to rise moderately but remain in the
lower half of the bank's one to three percent target range.
</P>
<P>
Within a year to 18 months, the economy will hit its full
capacity but may be able to grow beyond that point without
incurring a new burst of inflationary pressures, said Thiessen.

<P>
He made this remark after statistics showed the country's
imports finally rebounded after 13 months of consecutive decline
and grew by 1.5 percent in March on an annual basis mainly due to
the rebound in imports of raw materials and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said in a news release that the growth in imports
indicates a recovery of industrial activity and return of
consumer confidence. "Imports, especially of raw materials and
consumer durables, are a leading indicator of growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods increased by
10.81 percent over the March 1998 level while imports of consumer
good increased by 15.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
By sub-commodity, imports of unprocessed raw materials
increased by 73.98 percent while imports of semi-processed
materials increased by 15.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports of consumer durables, which were the first to suffer
from the economic slowdown, grew by 7.24 percent, boosted by
imports of passenger cars and home appliances.
</P>
<P>
Medalla, who is also director-general of the National Economic
and Development Authority (NEDA), noted that the continued drop in
capital imports by 10.97 percent is not really an alarming signal.
</P>
<P>
"Given the huge under-utilization of capacity where about 40
percent of our firms are operating at less than 70 percent, I do
not really expect capital goods imports to show an immediate
recovery even if the economy is already recovering," he said.
</P>
<P>
This "good news" was also bolstered by reports from the Bureau
of Agricultural Statistics that total value of agricultural output
grew by 2.7 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Macao Seeks New Opportunities for Tourism Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao is making a landmark investment
to build a 338 meter high sightseeing tower on the south of the
peninsular in an effort to boost development of the tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
Costing 112 million U.S. dollars, the Macao Tower will be used
for tourism and telecommunications purposes and will provide a
fabulous view of the city of Macao and Taipa Island.
</P>
<P>
After completion, the tower will rank 8th among the world's
tallest telecommunications and sightseeing structures of this kind.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the four pillar industries of Macao,
constitutes 40 percent of its GDP, with about one-third of local
employees engaged in the tourism and related businesses.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the tourist industry, the Macao government
has built and rebuilt a number of tourism attractions and related
facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Scenic spots like the Ruins of St. Paul, the Goddess A-Ma
Statue and the Museum of Macao have enhanced the attractions of
this historic city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1990, Macao has poured some nine
million U.S. dollars into rebuilding projects and in maintaining
existing sites of historic importance, and that more than half of
the ancient architectural treasures in the city are now under
proper protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
Because of its unique architecture, colorful entertainment
programs and convenient transportation facilities, Macao draws
several million visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 tourist arrivals in Macao exceeded 6.9 million, which
is 17 times the Macao population.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Macao government hosts annual arts festivals,
international firework displays and a music festival, which have
all attracted a large number of visitors and helped to increase
the popularity of Macao around the world.
</P>
<P>
As the return of Macao to the motherland is approaching, the
travel program highlighting the history and culture of Macao
provides a golden opportunity for its tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Macao has in recent years received 240,000 to 270,000 tourists
from inland areas under this program. In the busiest year there
were registered 300,000 tourists.
</P>
<P>
Besides appreciating Macao's unique culture and architecture,
tourists also bought souvenirs, and enjoyed the Portuguese style
food.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the Macao International Airport and the tax
free policy for consumers will help Macao to become another
international shopping center in the future.
</P>
<P>
To help the Macao residents know their home better, in April
the China Travel Service Macao Ltd. launched a new travel program
highlighting the places of historic interest which was well
received by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Every day it sends one or two groups at least to the Macao
Peninsular and the two islands of Taipa and Coloane and at
weekends the tour groups can number as many as 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Use of Force in Yugoslavia Sets Wrong Precedence: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said that the
use of force in Yugoslavia has set a "wrong precedence" and
weakened global order.
</P>
<P>
"In the Kosovo situation the use of force in circumvention of
the (U.N.) Security Council howsoever genuinely motivated sets a
wrong precedence and weakens prospects of a global order based on
Charter principles," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told
reporters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said during a press briefing that Pakistan has repeatedly
emphasized this critical aspect of the global system irrespective
of their size or affiliations.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had written to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on the subject on May 5, saying
that the inability of the U.N. Security Council to take effective
action and to carry out its Charter responsibilities had been "a
matter of deep concern to us."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade, the spokesman said that the incident once again
underscored the importance of the central role that the U.N.
Security Council ought to play in any situation which potentially
threats peace and security in any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked at the U.S. missile attack at the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. Immediately on hearing the news we expressed
our deep regrets in a public statement," said Altaf.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sense of outrage of the Chinese government and
the people is fully understood and their pain is shared by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, as is well known, has always taken
positions of principle in international forums and supported the
strengthening of global peace and stability, Altaf noted.
</P>
<P>
The developing world in particular has always looked towards
China as a pillar of support and strength in their just causes,
said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Qatar, Iran Sign Cooperation Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and Iran Thursday signed
in Doha a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in different
fields in an effort to further improve their relations.
</P>
<P>
The memo was signed after Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani held official talks with visiting Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami on issues mainly concerning the development of
bilateral ties, the Kuwait News Agency reported quoting Qatari
sources.
</P>
<P>
Besides a memorandum of understanding on labor and social
cooperation, mutual investments, and cooperation in the fields of
tourism, media and crackdown on drug-trafficking, seven other
agreements were also initiated after the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders in their talks also reviewed a number of
political issues at the regional, Islamic and international level,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is in Doha on the last leg of his three-nation tour,
which has already taken him to Syria and Saudi Arabia. He is the
first Iranian president to visit the Gulf emirate since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and Qatar, along with other Gulf Arab
states, had been strained for two decades because of Tehran's
Islamic Revolution in 1979, which posed threats to the Gulf
governments, and the Iran-Iraq war during which the Gulf nations
sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Their tension was eased after President Khatami took office in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a political moderate, voiced Tehran's desire to end
hostility and establish mutual trust with the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states and apparently received positive response
from the GCC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Try to Harmonize Stock Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- All the stock exchanges in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) members have agreed
to harmonize their listings requirements with those of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange in South Africa as an important step
toward integration of the capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a two-day workshop on harmonization of the
listings requirements of the SADC stock exchanges here Thursday,
Permanent Secretary of the Zambian Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development James Mtonga said the SADC groups together 14
countries, creating a market with a combined population of almost
200 million and therefore offers enormous scope and potential for
integration of the regional capital markets.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to exploit its full potential, there is no
doubt that the SADC must explore and pursue programs that cement
regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Harmonization of listings requirements will attract foreign
capital into the SADC region, the permanent secretary said, adding
that there will also be a greater mobility of capital between SADC
member states.
</P>
<P>
Mtonga said there are three levels of expected benefits of the
harmonization of listings requirements: investor confidence will
be enhanced; the standards of disclosure and conduct of listed
companies will be improved and dual listings and cross-border
investment will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is a globally recognized stock
exchange which ranks in the top twenty markets in the world in
terms of size.
</P>
<P>
As such, the South African exchange operates to international
standards of disclosure, reporting and conduct and its expertise
and international platform is now being made available to other
stock exchanges in the region via the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Mtonga said that investors in Zambia and elsewhere will benefit
from the improved standards of corporate disclosure and conduct by
the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
This seminar is important because it enables all the key
players in the Zambian capital market, including policy markets in
the government and related institutions to understand and
appreciate the working and application of the listing requirements
of the Lusaka Stock Exchange and the SADC region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Stock Exchange has drawn up a set of harmonized
listing rules. These rules will allow local companies to raise
capital on other SADC stock markets while encouraging foreign
companies to list on the Lusaka Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Investor protection regulations will be strengthened to
increase overall confidence in the Zambian capital market, he
added.

<HEADLINE> New Rice Techniques Promise to Save 25 Percent Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- New water-saving techniques are
being developed that could save up to 25 percent of the water now
used to grow rice, a report of the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Such techniques are especially important for Asia, where demand
for water is expected to increase about 50 percent over the next
25 years and where about half of irrigated land is planted in
rice, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"With the projected growth of Asian cities and industries and
their increased need for fresh water, rice farming must become
more water efficient." says Ismail Serageldin, chairman of CGIAR
and World Bank Vice President for Special Programs, in the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the new rice techniques include wet
seeding, intermittent rice irrigation, land leveling, improved
weed management, and management of cracked soils.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the scientific developments came on the eve
of the CGIAR's mid-term meeting in Beijing, China, from May 24 to
28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the impact of the CGIAR's future
research agenda on pressing food security, poverty reduction, and
environmental protection problems.
</P>
<P>
CGIAR is the largest scientific partnership in the agricultural
research field. Established in the early 1970s, it works to
promote food security, poverty eradication and sound management of
natural resources in the developing world.

<HEADLINE> Educated Chinese Are More Concerned About Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent telephone survey by
Beijing Business Consultation Corporation of 250 Beijing residents
has shown that the higher the education level, the more likely a
person is to be concerned about environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
It showed that respondents with a college education or higher
knew the meaning of terms like ozone layer, acid rain,
desertification, greenhouse effect, and biodiversity more often
than those without a college education.
</P>
<P>
And, the degree of concern among Beijing residents about air
quality increases with the level of education. Over 98 percent of
the respondents with a college education or higher are interested
in the daily air quality report but less than 60 percent of the
respondents without a college education care.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more well-educated people knew about "Earth Day"
and "International Environment Day" than people without a higher
education. "Ozone layer" is the best known environmental phrase.
Nearly 90 percent of the respondents had heard of it.
</P>
<P>
But, only about half had heard of or knew the meaning of "
biodiversity protection". Analysts say that this indicates that
people care more about the problems that directly concern them.

(PNG) Thursday agreed that Australia's aid to PNG will be limited
to no more than 300 million Australian dollars (198 million U.S.
dollars) a year from next year when a new treaty comes into
effect.
</P>
<P>
That's roughly the same as the amount for PNG in this year's
budget, but well down on the previous years.
</P>
<P>
The amount was agreed at talks in Adelaide, capital of
Australia's South Australia state between Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer and his PNG counterpart Roy Yaki on the
Treaty on Development Cooperation, which is due to come into
effect from July next year.
</P>
<P>
Under that treaty Australia will no longer directly fund the
Papua New Guinea budget, but will instead spend its aid on
mutually agreed projects.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty will make Australia's aid program to Papua New
Guinea more accountable as well as responsive to the needs of
Papua New Guineans throughout the country," the ministers said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty also encourages PNG agencies, companies and
individuals to take a greater part in delivering aid activities."
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific island country which used
to be ruled by Australia, is by far Australia's single biggest aid
recipient, accounting for around one-fifth of Australia's aid
budget totaling 1.5 billion Australian dollars (one billion U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Gold Price Slide Spells Gloom for S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The slide in gold price may
take its toll on the South African economy as job cuts, negative
investor sentiment and possible interest rate hikes are feared.
</P>
<P>
The gold price dropped to its 20-year low Wednesday in London,
fixing at 272.50 dollars per ounce. In response, the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange's gold index slumped 52 points, or 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the fall in gold price, which is hitting South
Africa's foreign exchange earnings badly, has spiked any chances
of an interest rate cut before the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in the country relies heavily on the
continued reduction in interest rates as punitive interest rates
after last year's currency crisis drove the economy into
recession.
</P>
<P>
The prime lending rate, which was once as high as 25.5 percent
last year, now stands at 19 percent. Economists had earlier
forecast that the rate could drop to 16 percent at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
If the gold price remains depressed for some time, South
Africa's gold mining industry may have to cut its production and
retrench its work force, analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
Some mines have already frozen their expansion projects at the
news, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The fall in gold price was triggered by the Bank of England's
announcement two weeks ago that it would sell half of its gold
reserves, and the decision by the International Monetary Fund to
sell between five and ten percent of its gold to reduce the debt
burden of poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Two Books On World Issues Now On Chinese Bookstore Shelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two books on global issues written
by Tommy T.B. Koh, ambassador-at-large of Singapore, came off
press here today.
</P>
<P>
Koh's "The Quest for World Order -- Perspectives of a
Pragmatic Idealist" and "The United States and East Asia --
Conflict and Cooperation" reflect his attitude on a number of
issues like international order, environmental protection, and
reforming the United Nations (UN) and are based on his more than
30 years of work in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The president of China's Institute of International Studies,
Yang Chengxu, commented that the two books could help people more
accurately analyze world issues and get a clearer idea about
prospects for the international community.
</P>
<P>
Koh said that peace and development of the world in the long
run will serve the national interests of every nation and that all
conflicts in the world should be, indeed can only be, resolved by
negotiations, and that the use of force will go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The UN, he says, as an international organization dealing with
various world conflicts, should be further developed, rather than
dispersed.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Edge Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices edged up on the
Singapore Stock Market Thursday inspired by the better-than
expected performance in Singapore's economy and buoyed by the
overnight gains on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index gained 15.39 points to end at
1926.89 points, off its intraday high of 1943.05 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume decreased to 689.30 million shares valued at
946.82 million Singapore dollars (about 549..6 million U.S.
dollars). Gainers edged out losers by 189 to 132 with 123 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Samudera topped the most active stocks chart with a turnover of
44.70 million units. Frt Links was the second most heavily traded
stock with 29.67 million shares done. GES was the next with 27.96
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
RothmansI headed ascent of the day surging 220 cents to 13.90
Singapore dollars. BATS moved up 102 cents to finish at 5.80
Singapore dollars. SPH 100 picked up 90 cents to end at 25.20
Singapore dollars.
</P>

OCBC F continued to be the biggest loser incurring a loss of 80
cents and closing at 14.20 Singapore dollars. OCBC and PacCent
sank 30 cents each and ended at 11.70 and 5.55 Singapore dollars.
BBR lost 28 cents to end at 0.335 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed Thursday's gain to the positive results of
Singapore's first quarter economic performance and April's
improvement in its external trade as well as overnight strength on
Wall streets.
</P>
<P>
They said the first quarter's 1.2 percent growth in Singapore's
economy and its April's moderation in its external trade decline
injected fresh impetus into the market.
</P>
<P>
They noted the bulk of the benchmark index's gains came from
Rothmans Industries Ltd, which surged 2.20 Singapore dollars to
13.90 Singapore dollars. Its sister company, BAT Singapore Ltd,
jumped 1.2 Singapore dollars to 5.80 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
The said the two firms' parent, BAT Ind PLC, had announced
plans to delist both units after acquiring all of their shares.

<HEADLINE> African Potato Can Be Toxic Rather Than AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The African potato,
recommended as a miracle medicine by South African traditional
doctors to cure AIDS, can be poisonous, Thursday's Star newspaper
quoted a South African medical expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Bouic, professor of immunology at Stellenbosch
University of South Africa, warned that African potato can cause
vomiting and diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
African potato, a kind of hypoxis plant, resembles a hairy beet
root.
</P>
<P>
Some hawkers in Johannesburg sell the potatoes with photocopied
 pamphlets on their benefits. According to the pamphlets, the
vegetable is a miracle remedy for tuberculosis, flu and psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
South African traditional doctors claimed recently that the
African potato can also cure deadly infective disease, AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Traditional doctor Mondli Mdungwa said AIDS patients can have
their blood cleaned and their immune system boosted by drinking
the water made of African potato.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to make full use of the traditional
herb medicine rather than using the expensive AZT in curing AIDS
disease.
</P>
<P>
AZT was discovered as a drug that can minimize the transmission
of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tax Talks to Resume Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government's crucial talks on the future of the ambitious tax
reform with an opposition party will continue Friday after more
than two hours of negotiations failed to reach a comprise.
</P>
<P>
The support of the Australian Democrats Party, the fourth
largest party with several seats in the Australian Senate, became
vital for the government's proposed goods and services Tax (GST)
package after independent Senator Brian Harradine, who holds the
balance of power in the Senate, rejected the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats insist on exclusion of food from the 10 percent
GST proposal made by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Democrats leader Meg Lees said the talks with Prime Minister
John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello would resume in Melbourne
Friday and discussions so far had been helpful but inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
She gave no indication of whether the government was prepared
to offer any concessions.
</P>
<P>
"There was no decision of any shape or size or form," Lees told
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Howard described the talks as constructive but was reluctant to
go into any detail.
</P>
<P>
The GST bill, considered business-friendly and simpler than the
country's current complicated taxation system, has been welcomed
by the country's business community, but rejected by some MPs on
the ground it would be unfavorable to low-income earners since
food is tax-free under the current taxation system.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party, the biggest and oldest party in the
country and only 6 seats short of a majority to win last October's
federal election, have been opposing the tax bill submitted by the
ruling coalition comprising of the Australian Liberal Party and
National Party of Australia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket slumped
late Thursday, dragged lower by weakness in the resources sector.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the gold sector also impacted on the all ordinaries
index which slipped 28.6 points, or 0.96 percent, to close at
2952.6.
</P>
<P>
Gold in Sydney closed trading Friday at 273.85 U.S. dollars an
ounce, having spent most of the day below 273.40 U.S. dollars, a
level not seen since May, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Fears the United States might raise interest rates caused most
of the 29.5 point slump in the all resources index to 1171.2. Any
rise in U.S. rates could lead to a slowing in the economy there
and that could flow through to softer demand for commodities.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index weakened across the day finishing
34.8 points lower at 5186.4.
</P>
<P>
Final national turnover was 564.2 million stocks valued at
865.52 million U.S. dollars, with falling stocks outpacing rising
stocks 796 to 565, with 436 stocks trading steady.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector performed a large turnaround on the day,
finishing 35.8 points softer at 6616.4 after beginning on a strong
note.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Banking Group suffered, losing 31.4 cents to 11.239
Australian dollars, National Australia Bank also slid 16.8 cents
to 25.04 Australian dollars, and the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia fell 10 cents to 24.50 Australian dollars. However,
Westpac Banking Group remained firm, up 18 cents to 10.64
Australian dollars.

Resource sector leader BHP dropped 35 cents to 16.80 Australian

CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended weaker
Thursday as gold prices fell through 20 year lows and commodity
prices lost ground on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency closed at 66.02 U.S. cents from 66.35
U.S. cents Wednesday, after trading between 65.86 and 66.15 U.S.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Explores Trade Opportunities in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered delegation of
South African government officials and business executives will
head for Libya Sunday, hoping to secure contracts worth billions
of U.S. dollars since the lift of UN sanctions against the
country.
</P>
<P>
They are hoping to cash in on the political goodwill that
exists toward South Africa in Libya, following President Nelson
Mandela's intervention in a long-standing dispute arising from
Libya's refusal to hand over two men suspected of the 1988 Pan Am
airliner bombing over Lockerbie in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be led by Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin, Mineral and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna and Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also on board will be Mandela's top aide Jakes Gerwel, who
helped engineer the diplomatic coup which saw the handover of the
two bombing suspects to face trial in the Netherlands, and
sanctions being dropped.
</P>
<P>
Sectors to be represented on the delegation include mining
exploration, agricultural equipment, construction, banking,
aviation equipment and services and telecommunications, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
An advance team of trade and foreign affairs officials are
already in Libya busy setting up meetings for the delegation.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that our business community is exposed to the
enormous potential that exists in Libya and the north Africa
region," Pahad said in a separate statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that transport and infrastructure projects
worth up to 14 billion U.S. dollars could open up as a result of
sanctions being dropped.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni pointed out that millions
of dollars of Libyan assets which were frozen with the imposition
of sanctions in 1993 would now be freed up, and as a result the
Libyans had cash to spend.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects planned by the Libyan government are a
2,178- kilometer railway costing about four billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Maduna has previously stated that the government would
facilitate local companies sourcing oil from Libya and other
countries, to lessen South Africa's dependency on Iran for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports account for 95 percent of Libya's foreign earnings.
And Tripoli is anxious to boost its sales and production, which
has been slowed by the UN embargo.
</P>
<P>
In addition to securing contracts in Libya, South African
companies will also be looking for new markets for their products.
Favorable relations with Libya may give them better access to its
Arab Maghreb Union partners -- Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and
Mauritania -- which represent a potential and relatively untapped
market of 74 million people.
</P>
<P>
Pahad will use the opportunity to discuss with Libya ways of
ending the ongoing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
Foreign Ministry statement said. Libya, which has provided
financial backing for the government of President Laurent Kabila,
recently hosted talks aimed at ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
There will also be further discussions on the establishment of
a South African embassy in Tripoli. Diplomatic affairs with Libya
are currently dealt with by the South African mission in Tunisia.

through joint efforts, there will be a smooth transition and
handover.
</P>
<P>
He asked Jaime Gama to convey his regards to President Jorge
Sampaio and said that he is looking forward to visiting Portugal
this year.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Gama conveyed the Portuguese president's regards and
offered a formal apology on behalf of the Portuguese Government
for the NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy and emphasized
that NATO should make a thorough investigation of the matter and
give reasons to China.
</P>
<P>
Europe wants to develop relations with China through mutual
cooperation rather than military means so that Europe and China
can grow strong together, he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal will make a concerted effort with China to ensure the
smooth return of Macao to China, he said, expressing his hope that
Jiang's upcoming visit to Portugal will help promote bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Portugal will, during its presidency of the
European Union in the first half of next year, make an active
effort to develop EU-China cooperation.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi has calls for concerted efforts in building the Mozambique
Aluminium Plant, the country's largest project since independence
in 1975, to benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi made the call Wednesday while visiting the construction
site of the factory, in Boane County in the suburbs of the capital
Maputo, according to the Noticias newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Boane region, where the plant is located, has become an
important place or economic growth point in Mozambique or even in
southern Africa. The prime minister urged local entrepreneurs to
take the challenge and make use of the opportunity for
development.
</P>
<P>
The aluminium factory project has absorbed a total investment
of 1.34 billion U.S. dollars, 43 percent of which from South
Africa, 23 percent from Britain, 14 percent from Europe, ten
percent from Japan, and nine percent from an international
financing corporation under the World Bank. Only one percent of
the investment is from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The factory is expected to start operation in 2001, with raw
materials from Australia and Britain, while its products are
projected for Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Officials Cast Doubts Over Barak`s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s politicians and former
officials cast doubts over Israeli prime minister-elect Ehud
Barak`s Middle East policies though Amman has officially
welcomed his victory in Monday`s election.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Izzedin, former Jordanian information minister, said he
believed Barak`s Labor Party policies appear in essence similar
to that of outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud
Party, though in a different tone.
</P>
<P>
Izzedin`s remarks were published Thursday on Jordan`s English
daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"Barak has floated so many No's, and all those No's were the
policies of the Likud Party," Izzedin said.
</P>
<P>
Barak said on Monday that he would try to revive the Middle
East peace process which remained deadlocked under Netanyahu,
but there will be no withdrawal from Arab east Jerusalem which
Israel captured during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
There would either be no Palestinian army and no evacuation of
major Jewish settlements on the West Bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
Izzedin, now a Senate member, said all these conditions were
bound to jeopardize the Palestinian entity and abort plans for
an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Israeli wars against Arabs, except the 1982
invasion of south Lebanon, were launched by Israel`s Labor
governments, and Arabs, should not be over optimistic over the
election of Labor Party leader Barak as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
His cautious attitudes were echoed by former Jordanian Lower
House Speaker Sa`d Hayel Srour.
</P>
<P>
Srour said Arab countries should adopt a wait-and-see policy
toward the Barak government.
</P>
<P>
Barak could give the United States and European countries,
major brokers of the Middle East peace process, an impression
that he is delivering on the path of peace, while he might hide
bad intentions, the former speaker said.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed former official said that Israeli Labor and Likud
did not differ much in nature when it came to the national
interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"He could be worse than Netanyahu though we hoped for the
best," he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs Belgrade Hospital, Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes, in a fierce attack
on Belgrade since May 7, bombed a hospital in the capital city and
killed three people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The air raids were launched around one o'clock and loud
explosions could be heard from around the city.
</P>
<P>
Three patients of Belgrade's Dragisa Misovic hospital were
killed and the hospital was extensively damaged, Serbian Vice-
Premier Milovan Bojic confirmed before dawn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The damage to the hospital buildings is extensive, especially
to the maternity ward," said the government official. "Two women
were cut and bruised by flying glasses as they were giving births
in the ward at the time."
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes fired three missiles at the hospital and a
nearby petrol station.
</P>
<P>
During the Wednesday and Thursday attacks, NATO aircraft also
bombed a weather station near the northernmost Yugoslav city of
Subotica.
</P>
<P>
NATO jets bombed a bridge on the northern river Begej, the
airport near Belgrade's Batajnica, a factory compound near Baric
and Makis, a radio aerial in Vrbas as well as the towns of Sabac,
Raska and Sombor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 missiles were fired at the western Serbian town
of Sabac between midnight and two o'clock, while another 21
missiles struck Raska in southwest Yugoslavia, where the villages
of Dubinje and Jadovic were the main targets in the Sjenica
municipality.
</P>
<P>
The attack was launched soon after Russian special envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin left Belgrade following his talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Final Election Results Show Collapse of Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Votes from Israeli soldiers and
abstentees, which were counted Wednesday night, have cemented the
landslide victory of the left wing and the crushing collapse of
the right wing in the just ended Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the official final results announced after the
votes from army, diplomats, prisoners and hospital patients were
counted, the leftist party Meretz gained its 10th seat in the
next parliament at the expense of One Israel, which was reduced
from 27 seats in the preliminary results to 26.
</P>
<P>
The far-right-wing National Union had its fourth seat and
Yisrael b'Aliyah was down from seven seats in the preliminary
results to six.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results, the right-wing Likud, National
Religious Party and National Union merely got a total of 28 seats
in the next Knesset. This represents a sharp drop compared with
the 1996 election in which Likud alone gained 32 seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the left, center and Arab parties enjoyed a
majority of 66 seats. Among them, the newly formed Center Party
and Shinui, or Secular Movement, will occupy six seats each in the
next parliament.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that the next parliament will be
further fragmented, with the number of parties increasing to 15
from 11 in the outgoing one.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the two traditional big parties, Labor and
Likud, have suffered continuous decline in regard to their
influence.
</P>
<P>
While the Labor-led One Israel had lost eight seats from the
last parliament to stand at 26, Likud lost almost half of its
mandates, down from 32 to 19, making it difficult to form a
counterbalance to the left bloc.
</P>
<P>
A big winner of the Knesset election is the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, whose seats increased from 10 to 17. This virtually
catapulted it to a major party.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister-elect Ehud Barak, who won 56.08 percent of the
votes according to the final results, will begin coalition talks
Sunday. While he can rely solely on a left-center front, Barak
said he would seek a broad-based coalition.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Opposed to NATO Ground Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic on Wednesday
reiterated its opposition to NATO's possible ground attacks
against Yugoslavia, said a government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The Czech Republic has made it very clear from the very day
when NATO began its bombing on Yugoslavia that it will not
participate in ground military actions against Yugoslavia," the
spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Czech soldiers will join peace keeping
missions in Kosovo just as they did in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after U.S. President Bill
Clinton said on Tuesday that NATO could not rule out the
possibility of using ground troops. Meanwhile, Britain is also
urging the military alliance to launch ground attacks on
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Forming Coalition No Easy Task for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's prime minister-elect
Ehud Barak will start his efforts in forming the new cabinet on
Sunday, however, grouping a coalition is not an easy task for the
Labor Party leader.
</P>
<P>
Barak has to deal with all the election partners such as Gesher
and Meimad which joined forces with the Labor in forming the One
Israel alliance in the elections. And there is the Center party
leader and former defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai who helped
him defeat Benjamin Netanyahu by pulling out from the race before
the voting began.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after initial election results were announced, all
political parties, including the right-wing National Religious
party and Shas, expressed their willingness to join the future
coalition government headed by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef said Wednesday night
he hopes to see his party serving in the coalition for peace, and
promised to help Barak achieve a "breakthrough" in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, the Meretz party, which is regarded as a sister party
of Barak's Labor, said it won't join a coalition with Shas in it.
</P>
<P>
Another suspension is whether Barak would include Israel's Arab
parties into his coalition. The Democratic List, the Hadash and
the Balad had mobilized their Arab supporters to vote for Barak,
which was a crucial factor that brought Barak to power.
</P>
<P>
Barak said in the past that he wants to form a broad-based
coalition in order to heal the difference between the left and
right and to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
To this end, reports said that Barak is sending out messages
that he wants the Likud in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
This has become a viable option after Netanyahu announced to
step down as party leader and incumbent Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon was picked as its caretaker party leader.
</P>
<P>
Sharon a year ago met with Labor's key member and former prime
minister Shimon Peres in an attempt to form a unity government
with Likud and Labor as a core.
</P>
<P>
How to distribute the key minister posts among the parties that
will be included in the coalition is a further tough job for Barak
as there are too much factional greed and personal egos.

PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The determination of the French citizens to continue
supporting NATO's war against Yugoslavia is wavering, according to
a latest poll. Forty-nine percent of the polled in France think
that NATO should stop bombing and talk with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, while another 49 percent think that NATO
should continue the war. One month ago, 56 percent supported the
war and 42 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
-- Western countries remained on Wednesday circumspect vis-a-
vis the offers by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for a
political settlement to the conflict, but kept the door half open.
An intensive diplomatic activity was going on across Europe to
explore the possibility of a negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac expressed on Wednesday his
optimism about a possible breakthrough in seeking a political
settlement to the Yugoslav conflict in the coming week. He said
that the coordination between Russia and the Western allies could
lead to a solution.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a latest poll, the French rightwing parties
could win 41.5 percent of the votes in the forthcoming European
Parliament elections in June, against 38.5 percent by the leftwing
parties. The list of candidates led by former Gaullist interior
minister Charles Pasqua could win 13.5 percent, ahead of the
centrist Union for French Democracy.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Education Center Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drug education center
opened to the public in Beijing today with exhibits from the
nation's first anti-drug exhibition that was held in Beijing last
June.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau
Qiang Wei said at an opening ceremony that drug-related crimes are
a serious problem in Beijing and that the number of drug addicts
is on the increase and more young people are becoming enslaved to
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 85.1 percent of the drug addicts are
between the age of 17 and 35.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the center is to warn the public about the harm
of drug and to increase public awareness and improve the anti-drug
work by the municipal government, Qiang Wei says.
</P>
<P>
The center has 860 photos, 20 statues, and two film projectors.
Its theme is "Treasure Your Life and Reject Drugs" and it takes
visitors through a tour of the harmful effects of narcotics, the
history of China's drug problems, China's principles, policies,
laws, and regulations on drugs, and the success of the Chinese
government in its war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
A special part of the center is devoted to youngsters to teach
them how to resist drugs and the temptation of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
China dealt with more than 182,400 drug-related crimes last
year and arrested more than 230,000 people and seized over 13,600
kilograms of drugs.

<HEADLINE> Old Altar Discovered in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A more than 1,000-year-old altar was
recently unearthed on the campus of Shaanxi Teachers University,
the oldest of its kind found in China so far.
</P>
<P>
The altar dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The four-
story structure was discovered 950 meters to the east of the
southern gate of the old city of Chang'an. The first layer has a
diameter of 54 meters, the second is 40 meters in diameter, the
third is 29 meters, and the top floor is 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Each layer has a flight of 12 steps. The steps on the southern
side are wider than those on the other three sides because they
were for the emperor.
</P>
<P>
It may seem strange to modern people to find that the altar was
built entirely of earth, with a single layer of brick and stone,
and covered with a thin layer of lime, says An Jiayao, a research
fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Archaeology
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
A local historian says that 17 emperors used the altar to
worship Heaven during the 300 year rule of the Tang Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> More Workers In Liaoning Being Told About Factory Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Workers at 100 major enterprises
in northeast China's Liaoning Province will be better informed
about the state of affairs in the operation and administration of
their factories this year.
</P>
<P>
The practice of making company affairs more open will soon
spread to other state-owned and collectively-owned companies and
to companies where state-owned assets dominate.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the province's drive to introduce more
democratic management. Liaoning is an old industrial center that
built up in the early years of the New China and that now has a
tenth of the country's state-owned large and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, major enterprise decisions like the
annual financial report, major reforms, and major problems related
to production and management will be publically discussed mainly
at workers congresses or through billboards, open letters,
announcements, wall bulletins, opinion boxes, and reporting
centers, according to a Provincial Economic and Trade Commission
official.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Mixed Reactions in Gulf to Barak's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The victory of Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak in Israel's elections this week has brought
mixed reactions from Gulf countries, with some expressing hope
that Middle East peace process will be resumed soon, while others
doubting real progress can be made.
</P>
<P>
Oman is one of the Gulf countries that has hailed Labor's
victory over Likud in Monday's elections. In a statement issued
on Thursday, Omani Minsiter of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef
Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah said he was confident that the new
government in Tel Aviv under the leadership of Barak would revive
the Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Oman became the first Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
state to have trade relations with Israel when the Labor Party was
in power. However, the relations were cut off in 1996 after
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party came to power.
</P>
<P>
With Labor leader Barak taking the post of prime minister, the
changed political situation in Israel would give a boost to the
peace process and negotiations with the Palestinians, said
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
"What is required at present is to restart the talks, and we
hope the new government in Israel will do this," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is another GCC country that echoed Oman's voice. Qatari
cabinet said Wednesday that it "expressed its hope that the new
Israeli government would take practical and serious steps to put
the peace process back on the right track by complying and
implementing agreements signed with the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Qatar, which is the only Gulf country that has kept limited
ties with Israel, also called on Barak to speed up final status
talks with the Palestinians, restart negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, other GCC members, including Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have so far
reacted coolly to the new political development in Israel, which
signals their pessimism.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's influential English daily Khaleej Times Thursday
described Barak as "a hawk in moderate's clothing," noting that no
real progress could be made in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some symbolic movement may be made in implementing the pitiful
Wye River Memorandum, but "the important point is not the Wye
crumbs being offered to the Palestinians, but the larger and real
question of the kind of Palestinian state that will be on offer,"
the paper said in an editorial entitled "Exploding the Barak Myth."
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that Barak is taking hawkish
positions on issues such as East Jerusalem and the major and
expanded settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and the Palestinian
refugees' right to return to their home land.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its dissatisfaction with the United States' support
for Israel, the editorial said the "tragedy of the Palestinians
and Arabs is that the sole mediator in the field and the
unchallenged superpower is an acknowledged Israeli partisan."
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between Barak and Netanyhu on a
Greater Israel," said the paper. "What distinguishes the two are
the size of a Greater Israel and the manner of achieving this
objective."
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis, Labor and Likud alike, are acting on the
premise that beggars cannot be choosers, that Palestinians will
have to accept what is on offer because the mightiest nation on
earth is on Israel's side," the paper concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
The COMESA, with its headquarters in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
was established in 1994 to replace the Preferential Trade Area for
Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) which had been in existence
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishing the COMESA was signed on November
5,1993 in Ugandan capital Kampala and was ratified a year later in
Lilongwe, Malawi on December 8, 1994 when the first COMESA summit
was convened.
</P>
<P>
The second COMESA summit was held on April 20, Lusaka, Zambia,
focusing on promoting regional trade, economic integration,
security and peace.
</P>
<P>
The third summit was held in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of
Congo on June 29, 1998 under the theme "Information - A Tool for
Increased Trade and Investment in COMESA."
</P>
<P>
The third summit set the target to establish a COMESA free
trade area by the year 2000, the establishment of Comtel, a
private company limited to provide a framework for regional
telecommunications interconnectivity, and the expanded membership
of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda set by the COMESA Treaty, the
sub-regional organization will pass stage by stage on its way to
achieving its mission for an increased cooperation and integration
in all fields of development, particularly in trade, customs,
monetary affairs, transport and others.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, zero tariffs should be achieved among COMESA
members (free trade status).
</P>
<P>
And by 2004, a common external tariff, or customs union, will
be established with less restricted movement of people (common
market status).
</P>
<P>
By 2025, a monetary union, free movement of people including
right of establishment (economic community status) will be
established.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the COMESA has 21 members: Angola, Burundi, the
Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia,
Rwanda, Seychelles, the Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the COMESA is to facilitate the removal
of all structural and institutional weaknesses of member states,
and the promotion of peace, security and stability so as to enable
them to attain sustained development individually and
collectively.

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 500,000 people will be moved
out of the Three Gorges area over the next five years to make sure
that China's largest water conservation project will go well.
</P>
<P>
The effort is tied to power production and the opening of the
ship lock when the second-phase of the project is completed in
2003, participants at a two-day conference on the emigration here
that ended today were told.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase of the emigration work started last year and
by the end of April, 5.1 billion yuan had been spent resettling 76,
000 people.
</P>
<P>
The state has allocated 12.7 billion yuan for the move, which
began in 1993, a year before the Three Gorges Project began. By
now, 150,600 people have been moved, 8.97 million square meters of
living space have been built, and 355 factories and mines have
been moved or shut down.
</P>
<P>
China has high expectations for the dam project and set up a
Three Gorges Construction Committee and a subordinate emigration
department and nearby provinces, cities, and departments have a
comprehensive plan for the move which, involves 22 counties,
cities and districts, with about a million people, in the
reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The central government has asked these areas to support the
emigration work and by last year, some 6 billion yuan from the
rest of the country had gone to the area to help.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, attention was paid to continuing the
emigration, improving capital management and project quality, and
protecting the environment.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Prioritize Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki has committed his government to drawing up a rural
development plan for the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally Wednesday in Umtata, Eastern Cape Province,
Mbeki criticized his own party, the ruling African National
Congress (ANC), for not taking the issue seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, elected as ANC chairman in 1997, is generally believed
to succeed President Nelson Mandela as new head of state after the
coming general elections set for June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki admitted that the ANC-led government, during its five
years in power since 1994, had developed plans for many sectors
such as industry, health and telecommunications, but had never had
a rural development plan.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki repeated earlier statements that three provinces, East
Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Northern Province, deserved special
attention in this regard.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Angolan Request for Military Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has rejected
Angola's request for military aid to crush the UNITA rebel
movement, The Star newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda has been in South Africa
since Tuesday to garner support.
</P>
<P>
South African policy supports the Angolan government but is
firmly against military involvement in a civil war that both sides
have the capacity to drag out for years but which neither side can
win, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference with Miranda, South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo expressed full political support for the
Angolan government and pledged to back regional and UN efforts to
cut UNITA's supply lines.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Selebi, director-general of South African Foreign
Ministry, was quoted as saying: "Angolan people must reach the
conclusion that peace is essential to that country's future. And
that conclusion must be reached by them. Unless they do so, it
will be difficult to intervene from outside."
</P>
<P>
Angolan-South African relations are cool because Angola
believes the African National Congress (ANC) government should
have offered military support against UNITA as a payback for the
support Angola gave the ANC during its struggle against apartheid.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian field hockey teams
are set to go to the SEA (Southeast Asian) Games in Brunei next
August with the target of taking bronzes in both male and female
events.
</P>
<P>
However, chairman of the country's field hockey government body
Primadi Tabrani said that the team would possibly relish the
challenge for silvers.
</P>
<P>
Given the hockey record among Southeast Asian Nations, Malaysia
looks certain to win the gold in the male category. Indonesia has
a chance -- though slim -- for the silver, but Singapore will be
the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
"The female team strength among the participants are level. Our
chance will be a bit better in this category", Primadi was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The federation plans to call in 18 players for a training camp
in Lampung, southern Sumatera. The workout, starting next June,
will last for a month before it moves on to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Most of the squad members are those who guided the Indonesian
teams to take bronzes at the last SEA Games in Jakarta two years

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Unemployment Rate Down to 7.2 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's unemployment rate fell
to 7.2 percent in April from the previous month's 8.1, bringing
the number of the jobless back to the 1.5 million range, the
National Statistical Office (NSO) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 7.2 percent jobless rate came after four straight months
when the rate stayed around eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In its report on employment, the NSO said that April saw the
jobless rate at 7.2 percent, down 0.9 percentage points from March
to 1.55 million.
</P>
<P>
The NSO figures showed that the two-percent range of the
unemployed made a steep climb following the onset of a financial
crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions in late 1997 and peaked at 8.7 percent last February.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the reduced unemployment to the beginning
of farming season and mounting employment in construction industry.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football (CFA) has asked Zambia to withdraw from police hands the
case against two Tunisian football officials facing charge of
attempted bribery in Ndola, northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The African soccer governing body was quoted by Times of Zambia

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Global Change Study Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists have
appealed for a greater research effort in the study of global
changes because of the deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiyu, the vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said recently that Chinese scientists should work to
improve the environment in China and the rest of the world and to
provide a scientific basis for environmental protection policies.
</P>
<P>
Global change research refers to studies of the atmosphere,
hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere and other environmental
systems and their changes, scientists say,
</P>
<P>
They have warned that increased human activities, economic
development, and the growing population have caused global warming,
ozone layer depletion, soil degeneration, the extinction of animal
species, and resource shortages.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is the chairman of the national committee for an
international geosphere and biosphere program, warns that global
changes may hinder the natural development of forests in northern
China.
</P>
<P>
He says that they may decrease or even disappear, leading to a
shortage of fresh water. The warming of the environment may cause
a rise in the sea water level, threatening life in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists say that the study of global changes should
focus on the evolvement of geosystems as the combined result of
human activities, land utilization, the greenhouse effect, and
other influences.
</P>
<P>
Chen has asked other scientists to do more research on global
changes in the coming decades and to collect more data to share
with their counterparts in other countries.

<HEADLINE> UN to Probe Zambia's Alleged Gun-running for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security Council
is yet to probe the report submitted by Angola on Zambia's
involvement in the supply of arms and logistics to the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Canada's permanent representative to the United Nations, Robert
Fowler, who is also chairman for the U.N. Security Council
Committee on Sanctions on UNITA, said there has been a lot of wild
speculations about Zambia's alleged gun-running for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted Fowler as saying
the allegations that Zambia was trafficking in arms on behalf of
Jonas Savimbi' s rebel movement have mostly been in form of rumors
than any tangible reports.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of rumors and stories about the whole issue.
There has been pretty wild speculations and a variety of
allegation," he said when he arrived in Lusaka Wednesday on a
seven-nation tour of southern Africa to investigate why sanctions
against UNITA were not working.
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the report which was submitted by the Angolan
government nearly two months ago showing the "proof" of Zambia's
role was still being translated into English and hoped he would be
able to study it when he returns to New York.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations did not have the capacity to gather accurate
 information about the Zambia/Angola stand-off, he said, adding
the world body would appreciate facts from any source.
</P>
<P>
"There is no information about that and I would appeal to
journalists, non-governmental organizations and any other bodies
to provide us with the relevant information. You need to have
dates, exact times, routes and if possible photos, if such an
issue was to be handled easily," Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
Fowler has already been to Angola, Namibia and Botswana. He
will proceed to Zimbabwe, South Africa and Democratic Republic of
Congo and is expected to attend the Organization for African Unity
summit later in Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: COMESA Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are some of the major figures about this African
sub-regional economic organization:
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Covers an area of 12.88 million square kilometers
with a population of 380 million.
</P>
<P>
The regional body had a total of gross domestic product (GDP)
of 155 billion dollars in 1997 and the 1998 GDP was estimated at
165 billion dollars, representing the nominal growth of 4.5
percent in 1997 and 3.14 percent in 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's total exports in 1998 was estimated at 23.97 billion
dollars, while imports 38.83 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intra-COMESA trade in 1998 is estimated about 4.2 billion U.S.
dollars representing a growth rate of 20 percent every year since
the founding of the regional body. Trade with third countries is
growing at about 7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, total external debt of COMESA was estimated at 130
billion dollars, which constitutes a heavy burden hindering the
development of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
With 90 percent arable land, 95 percent of water resources
unexploited and together with its rich cultural heritage, minerals
deposits, oil and gas reserves and other resources remain almost
untapped, the region has a vast potential for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In the region, 60 percent of the land area is covered by rivers
and lakes and 95 percent of the water is economically unexploited.
</P>
<P>
Only four percent of the energy potential from the numerous
rivers and lakes including the Congo, the Nile, the Zambezi, the
Victoria, the Owen Falls and Aswan has been developed.
</P>
<P>
With a total hydroelectric potential of 700 billion kw, of
which 96 percent remains to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Except for electricity generation, the water and lake resources
have enormous potential for exploitation for water transport,
irrigation and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is proud of its huge mineral wealth, including 300
billion tons of phosphate, 105 billion tons of iron ore, 200
billion tons of petroleum and large proven deposits of gas,
uranium, nickel, copper and cobalt.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Songosongo gas reservoir in Tanzania, if fully
 exploited, can provide enough gas to meet needs of the region.
</P>
<P>
The region has enough mineral potential to support large-scale
industries such as steel mills, fertilizer plants and other
factories to meet the regional needs.
</P>
<P>
The region also has many of the natural and man-made wonders of
the world for tourist destinations. They include great pyramids in
Egypt, great rift valley in Kenya, Masai Mara and Serengenti game
reserve bordering Kenya and Tanzania, great Victoria falls in
Zambia and the cradle of mankind such as Lake Turkana in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Just as Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott once said, the
resources and heritage in the region offer a diverse package for
tourist industry, with a guided tour of the ancient Egyptian
pyramids, a cruise down the Nile, a safari in the Masai Mara and
Serengenti game reserve, a view of the Gorillas in the lush
Ruwenzori in Uganda and a visit to the magnificent Victoria falls.
</P>
<P>
With rich natural resources to be exploited, the COMESA region
has been an attractive destination for both local and overseas
investment.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reviews Policy on Limiting Foreigners' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
decided to review its policy of limiting the business scope of
foreigners, a newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has disowned a statement issued
by the Ministry of Industries and Commerce, which spelt out
investment areas reserved for Tanzanian nationals, The African
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, the ministry, through the Tanzania Information
Services, issued a statement stipulating that effective from May 1
this year, foreigners would be barred from doing business in 24
fields, such as running small hotels (up to 20 rooms) and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ministry stipulated that 13 business
enterprises which foreigners cannot run without offering 50
percent or more of the shares to Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
The minister, Iddi Simba, told a press conference later that
the policy is aimed at alleviating poverty and solving
unemployment problem of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The policy, however, has not been implemented so far although
the deadline has passed.
</P>
<P>
The independent English-language paper said the government is
forced to review the policy to please donors.

JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African prison
authorities have categorically denied the saying that 6,000
inmates would be released on parole to stem the overflow at
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Barry Eksteen, spokesman for the Department of Correctional
Services, said Wednesday that "such a decision would have to be
approved by the cabinet, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to put this number of prisoners on parole, or
even a smaller number...We are not going to parole people
convicted for certain crimes, especially aggressive crimes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's local daily Sowetan quoted unidentified sources as
saying that the over-crowding may result in the prison
authorities' releasing up to 6, 000 prisoners in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show South Africa's prisoner population is steadily
climbing. Official figures reveal that prisons in the country can
accommodate less than 100,000 prisoners, but there are nearly
155,000 prisoners behind bars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today that Chinese sovereignty over the Nansha
Islands and adjacent waters is indisputable because of history and
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told a press conference in response to a question about the
recent remarks of a Philippines leader in Hong Kong that China has
ambitions for the South China Sea and Philippine territory that
China has taken note of that and deeply regrets it. The fact is,
he said, that the Philippines have taken some islands and reefs in
China's Nansha Islands, violating China's territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said that Meiji Reef is a part of the Nansha Islands and
that the fishing facilities built on the reef by Chinese fishery
departments are within the scope of Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that the dispute over the
Nansha Islands should be solved through peaceful negotiations in
accordance with international law and maritime laws, including the
principles and laws of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the parties involved will work for peace and
stability in the South China Sea area, he said, and remarks or
acts that contradict this will not help solve the issue and are
not desirable.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Says Anti-China Moves Doomed to Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The attempt to stir up feelings
about a "China threat" and anti-China sentiment is doomed to fail,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about people in the U.S. criticizing
China of stealing American nuclear technology and making political
donations, Zhu said that this was merely a fallacy dreamed up by a
few people with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt to stir
up anti-China feelings.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are sticking to the Cold War thinking and are
making a great effort to dream up stories about Chinese spying on
U.S. nuclear technology and making political donations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S.-led NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade triggered off aroused condemnation by the
Chinese and the international community, the spokesman said, and
right now the rumor-mongers in the U.S. have been intensifying
their efforts to fabricate spy and donations tales.

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Taikang Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
has become the first insurance company in China to get a AA rating
from an appraiser.
</P>
<P>
The joint-stock company is backed by 16 state-owned enterprises
and has about 70,000 clients. Its premiums amounted to 1.46
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The AA rating was based on its assets, management,
profitability, repayment record, and risk-prevention ability,
according to Mao Zhenhua, chairman of the board of China Chengxin
Securities Rating Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Rating insurance companies are important for preventing risks,
standardizing the insurance business, and adapting China's
insurance business to international norms, Mao says.
</P>
<P>
There are three ranks of rating: AAA, AA, A, and BBB in the
first rank; BB, B, CCC, and CC in the second; and C and D in the
third class. A triple A rating means maximum repayment ability and
minimum risks.

<HEADLINE> One More Commercial Bank Closed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of the Uganda, Uganda's
central bank, has taken over the management of the Cooperative
Bank because the latter has proved to be insolvent and failed to
raised minimum capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Wednesday evening, the central bank
director Charles Kikonyogo said the action was taken because the
bank was insolvent to the tune of 4.8 billion shillings (four
million U.S. dollars) last December.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank required a capital injection of 6.6 billion
shillings (5.3 million dollars) by that time.
</P>
<P>
The central bank director disclosed that the Cooperative Bank
would be given to competent financial institutions to run and
depositors were assured of being paid soon.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank has 24 branches and six agencies and has
been running aggressive media marketing campaigns for weeks. The
bank's former Managing Director Peter Robinson resigned on March
17, citing personal reasons. He was replaced by Polly Ndyarugahi.
</P>
<P>
This is the second commercial bank closed this year on the
heels of the Greenland Bank Limited on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The deepening financial crisis triggered widespread concerns
and worries about the safety of depositors' money, prompting the
Ugandan currency, shilling, to slide further against the dollar
over the past few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Decline in Singapore's External Trade Continues to Moderate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The long-unabated decline in
Singapore's total external trade continued to ease with total
trade falling by 4.9 percent year-on-year in April 1999, about
half of the contraction rate in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Development Board of Singapore said in a press
release Thursday that non-oil domestic exports (NODX) increased

</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of electronic products shrank by three percent
in April, less severe than the 4.7 percent decline in the
preceding month, while domestic exports of non-electronic products
grew by 7.9 percent contributed mainly by strong growth in

Of the top five electronic products, domestic exports of PCs
gained 9.6 percent, that of printed circuit boards and integrated
circuits recorded more moderate decline and that of disk drives

the 7.9 percent decline in March.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-exports (NORX) declined by 10.3 percent in April
1999, less severe than the contractions in the preceding five
months. NORX to the crisis-hit economies, viz Malaysia, Japan,
Thailand and South Korea, went up ranging from 4.2 percent for
Japan and 35.4 percent for South Korea, while NORX to the
developed markets, namely the U.S., and EU remained weak.
</P>
<P>
Of the top markets for NODX, the U.S. market declined by 6.9
percent in April, 1999, following a 6.8 percent decline in March
1999. The EU market remained buoyant with a growth of 8.1 percent.
The Malaysia market sank by 2.2 percent, less severe than the 7.1
percent decline in the preceding month. The Japan market grew by
14.5 percent after contracting for 12 consecutive months. The Hong
Kong market plunged by 16.4 percent, more moderate than the 21.4
percent decline in March 1999.

-- Angola's foreign minister has been in South Africa since
Tuesday to garner support for the intensifying war against the
rebel movement of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA). His request for military aid, which was rejected
by South Africa, represents a difficult diplomatic challenge.

<P>
KUNMING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China is building a cigarette
memorial hall in the southwestern province of Yunnan, the "kingdom
of tobacco".
</P>
<P>
The 900-sq.m. hall is in the city of Yuxi, the home of Asia's
largest cigarette factory, owned by Yuxi Cigarette Factory. It is
expected to show documents and materials on the history of tobacco
raising but also on the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
The time has come for such a monument because of the trend
against smoking, says Zhu Qiqi, curator of the Yuxi Museum.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's largest number of smokers, but until now
it has no museum that deals with the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan province is now holding the '99 International
Horticulture Exposition, which includes a tobacco garden, and is
the biggest tobacco producer in China. But it cut its tobacco
output by almost half last year.

<P>
LANZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of red deer, a rare
animal that is under state protection in China, has increased to
more than 4,000 in Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The red deer has a horse-like body but the head of a deer. The
big animal has a mild disposition and gets along with humans well.
Unfortunately it is also a source of medicinal items and extensive
hunting of the animal almost put it on the verge of extinction
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
The red deer mainly lives in the western part of China in Gansu
and Qinghai provinces and the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous
regions, according to Ma Chongyu, the director of Gansu Provincial
Wildlife Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the development of nature reserves and
artificial breeding techniques have contributed to increases in
the number of the deer, Ma says.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Treasurer Presents Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch
stood
up in Parliament and read his fourth but last Budget here
Thursday,
predicting his country's economy would grow by an annual average
of more
than three percent in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old treasurer will exchange portfolios with young
Finance
Minister Bill English shortly.
</P>
<P>
In an hour-long speech, Birch said the New Zealand economy has
already
turned round to the direction of growth in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a surplus of about 2.2 billion NZ dollars (1.21
billion
U.S. dollars) of the Government accounts for the year ending on
June 30,
boosted by the latest sale of the state-owned Contact Energy.
</P>
<P>
"It is the sixth consecutive fiscal surplus, and they are the
only
surpluses achieved since 1978," Birch said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the New Zealand Government will have a
deficit of
36 million NZ dollars (19.8 million U.S. dollars) in the next
fiscal
year, and surpluses then rise to just over 1.5 billion NZ dollars
(825
million U.S. dollars) by the 2001-2002 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Budget, the debt of the New Zealand
Government, as a
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), has trimmed to 22.8
percent
and should be 20.2 percent within three years. It peaked at 52
percent of
the GDP in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The Government is confident that with good fiscal management,
a
continuation of the current domestic and international economic
prospects, and a steady reduction in debt, we will be able to
commit to
further income tax reductions within the next term of Parliament,"
the
Treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
However, amid the measures about lower taxes in the Budget, the

Government imposes more expense on car owners. The accident
compensation
levy on vehicle registration will rise 47.5 NZ dollars to 148.75
NZ
dollars (82 U.S. dollars) and the cost of registering a car will
be
207.1 NZ dollars (114 U.S. dollars) a year from July this year.
</P>
<P>
In the Budget, the New Zealand Government also promises to
allocate
more funding to education, health, Maori's welfare affairs, and
science
and technology research.

<HEADLINE> Senegalese President Calls for Ending Wars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- President Abdou Diouf of Senegal
has called on the international community to support mechanisms
for conflict resolution in Africa to end the wars on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"All that Africa needs to develop is peace. We want to do away
with the conflicts on the continent through strengthening the
mechanism for conflict resolution in the various sub-regions of
the continent," Diouf told a presidential plenary session of the
Fifth African-African American Summit in Accra, Ghana, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long summit, which started Monday, reached its climax
Wednesday when 11 African heads of states, a monarch and half a
dozen top government officials from the United States and some
African states met to discuss the future of the continent, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a broad theme of "Business, Trade and Investment: Africa
Can Compete", the biennial summit has also recorded the highest
number of over 4,000 participants from around the world with
majority being African Americans.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said the summit's objective of launching Africa into the
21st century could only be realized on the basis of a strengthened
partnership between Africa and African Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with your influence Africa will receive the
needed attention it deserves in fostering a strong relationship
with the rest of the world," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
To him, the way forward for the continent, which is saddled
with huge debt overhang, high illiteracy rate and naked poverty,
is integration and investment.
</P>
<P>
Africa spends about a third of its annual income in servicing
debt owed to rich developed nations and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
Less than a quarter of what Africa pays to service debt is more
than what the continent invests in education and health sectors.

met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammad on Thursday in
Indonesia's Batam island, to discuss outstanding bilateral issues,
official Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say what the two leaders talked about during

Before leaving Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir said that one topic to be

<HEADLINE> Employment Creation Center Set up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- An organization which is expected to
 stabilize Zambia's economy through the creation of employment has
been formed in Lusaka, the Zambian capital.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Employment Creation is expected to
contribute about two billion U.S. dollars to Zambia's economy
through non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted the center's chief executive
Kapembwa Mumbalanga, an economist, as saying that Zambia only
needed about one billion dollars to have a stable economy.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed center is a national joint venture involving
the University of Zambia, Copperbelt University, various
institutions of higher learning, the Zambian government, private
business sector, the church and the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
Mumbalanga said the main objective of the organization was to
undertake spirited research in job creating activities in order to
establish mass and self-sustaining employment projects that were
practical in the Zambian context.
</P>
<P>
He said the center will focus on non-traditional exports in
order to free the copper mining industry from the stress it is
currently under.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve activities such as bee-keeping, fish
farming, game ranching, talc mining, production of fruit
concentrates and garment production.
</P>
<P>
All the ventures that have been cited are almost entirely
dependent on Zambia's natural resources, he said, noting that
countries like China raised about two billion dollars from garment
production annually.
</P>
<P>
The center is targeting to export two billion dollars worth of
non- traditional exports in 20 years' time.

<HEADLINE> Australian Lamb Farmers Protest Outside U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 angry farmers rallied
outside the United State embassy here Thursday in a campaign to
turn up the heat on a U.S. proposal to limit Australian lamb
exports.
</P>
<P>
The protest, followed by a barbecue featuring prime Australian
lamb, coincided with Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer's talks
in the United States with American trade representative Charlene
Barshevsky on proposed curbs to Australia's 72 million annual lamb
trade with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will decide early next month
whether to impose tariffs or other measures, including quotas and
200 percent tariffs, to restrict Australia's lamb exports to help
the ailing U.S. lamb industry.
</P>
<P>
The farmers gathered at a large lawn outside the U.S. embassy
after several hours' drive by bus from New South Wales and
Victorian states, the richest part of Australia.
</P>
<P>
With placards in hand, the farmers chanted "All we ask from the
U.S. is a fair go!", "Free trade U.S.A,".
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the farmers made speeches in turn accusing
the United States of trying to put up trade barriers and warning
the U.S. of possible damages to their lamb farmers.
</P>
<P>
Peter Barnard of Australia's Meat and Livestock Association
said Australian lamb farmers invested 30 million U.S. dollars in
the past decade in promoting lamb consumption and building the
"vast, untapped U.S. market."
</P>
<P>
The two hour protest ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he
would be prepared to lobby President Clinton directly.

MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tragedy struck the small
municipality of Sariaya, Quezon Province of Central Philippines
early Wednesday morning as four people of a family were murdered
in their home and another seriously wounded, Philippines News
Agency (PNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the multiple murders include Jennifer Abiera Amato,
42, and her three children aged from 14 to 4. One of the children,
Lovely Amato, 13, was raped before being murdered. Another 7
year-old son survived the incident and is under guarded condition
at hospital.
</P>
<P>
PNA quoted a police report as saying that the suspects gained
entry into the house sometime between midnight and 3 a.m. after
breaking a portion of the house wall. Once inside, the
perpetrators started the ruthless killing.
</P>
<P>
The murder weapons, found at the scene of the crime, were
stones and a bladed weapon.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are still at large and a joint investigation is
currently being conducted by the local police and the National
Bureau of Investigation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Army Worms Portend Disaster in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Agriculture Ministry has
warned that the country's crops and pasture are threatened unless
army worm invasion is contained.
</P>
<P>
Army worms have destroyed over 100,000 hectares of land,
including 30, 000 hectares of maize fields and 70,000 hectares of
pasture, according to a statement by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Kenya Times Thursday quoted Agriculture
Minister Musalia Mudavadi as saying that the government has
dispatched 22,500 liters of pesticides to farmers in combating
the ravaging of the worms.
</P>
<P>
Army worm outbreaks were reported in the country in February
this year, Mudavadi said, adding that his ministry had taken
necessary measures to eliminate the worms in the past three
months, but the erratic weather conditions were conducive to the
recurrence of the deadly pests.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister reaffirmed that the pests, which hit
Kenya severely in 1984, will not lead to a food shortage, nor do
they pose a threat to coffee and tea plantation. In the event of
rainfall, the army worms would be eliminated naturally, he added.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Abubakar, "Mother of New Nigeria"  (by Wang Jinyu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- In less than two weeks time, Nigeria
would be ushered into a new world of democracy where state power
resides not with a clique of military rulers but with
democratically-elected civil servants.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the handing-over of state powers, the out-going
military ruler, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, has been commended as "the mother of a new Nigeria" in
the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
About 11 months ago when General Abubakar assumed office
following the sudden death of his predecessor General Sani
Abacha, it was unimaginable that he could have completed his
transition program in May this year.
</P>
<P>
When the head of state announced on July 20 last year the
transition program beginning from September 1998 to may 29 this
year, there were much scepticisms over the genuineness and
sincerity of General Abubakar to hand over power.
</P>
<P>
With the experiences of the two unfulfilled transitions in 13
years by former military rulers of Generals lbrahim Babangida and
late Sani Abacha, Nigerians are justified to have doubts over the
transition program made by the military government.
</P>
<P>
However, General Abubakar this time has turned the program
into reality with three elections at local, state and federal
levels successfully conducted.
</P>
<P>
New constitution promulgated and preparations to hand over
power have reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The faithful implementation of transition program is seen as
the peak of the Abubakar government and the regime could thus be
awarded a pass mark in its democratization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Abubakar government had exhibited
commendable ability to match its pronouncements with deeds.
</P>
<P>
By the time Abubakar came into power last year, the political
temperature had already reached a boiling point, the world, which
had isolated Nigeria and Nigerians, were witnessing perhaps the
worst period since independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
When he was appointed the head of state to succeeded the late
General Abacha, Abubakar inherited the worst human rights
situation in the history o the west African country.
</P>
<P>
During the past 11 months, General Abubakar has managed to
improve the human rights situation at home and to forge new
relations with external creditors and western countries like the
United States, Britain, France, Japan and some other countries in
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
By now, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights has given
Nigeria a clean bill concerning the human rights situation and
the Commonwealth of Nations has also expressed its readiness to
accept Nigeria back to its fold.
</P>
<P>
So, Nigerians describe the current transition program, to be
completed on May 29, as one which "lead us out of the abyss of our
national despair."
</P>
<P>
In the political front, analysts said, Abubakar has performed
above average, but the performance in the economic front has been
less than satisfactory as one analyst put it that " things are
now worse than before Abubakar took over."
</P>
<P>
Inflation has maintained an upward movement after two years of
steady decline while foreign exchange reserves dropped from seven
billion U.S. dollars in December last year to 3.1 billion dollars
in March.
</P>
<P>
The persistent power failure and fuel crisis all over the
country have slowed down business activity, and government
over-spendings resulted in a 38 billion Naira (about 400 million
dollars) deficit in the first Quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, certain that the in-coming Nigerian
government would inherit a very sick economy from the out-going
military rulers.
</P>
<P>
A status report compiled by local newspaper, This Day,
described the performance of the Abubakar regime during the past
11 months as follows: "restoring democracy and external relations,
excellent; human rights and economy, poor."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here conclude that if the transition keeps the date
with May 29, it shall, like a religious ordinance, be referred to
as the "spiritual life spring and the mother of a new Nigeria."

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Accuses Ethiopia of meddling in Somali Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- "The Voice of the People", a
radio supporting faction leader Hussein Aidid returned to the air
Wednesday again by broadcasting the usual programs and
anti-Ethiopian propaganda after more than three months' silence.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Aidid as strongly condemning the Ethiopian
policy toward Somalia in a press statement issued Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that Ethiopia has unlawfully attacked and
violated the territorial integrity of Somalia by "crossing some of
its troops into Somalia."
</P>
<P>
The radio has also accused Ethiopia of sponsoring a meeting for
some Somali factions inside Ethiopia for the sole purpose of what
it called instigating more Ethiopian attacks against Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The strongly-worded statement also accused the Ethiopian forces
of planting land mines in several regions in central and southern
Somalia including Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Hiran and Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained that these land mines are continuously
causing fatalities and injuries to lives of both human beings and
animals.
</P>
<P>
The last known land mine victims in Bay region include three
men, among whom a senior official from Aidid's faction, who died
near the grave yard of Baidoa town 10 days ago after his vehicle,
a four-wheel-drive Nissan, hit a land mine.
</P>
<P>
However, many of the estimated one million land mines buried in
Somalia have been laid down during the height of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Aidid also said in his statement that Ethiopia is attacking
parts of Somalia by "using the pretext of Oromo nationals and
weapons being brought to southern Somalia."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Oromo nationals in Somalia are refugees who
fled Ethiopia in 1964 during the war between Somalia and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, between 500 and 700 Oromo nationals, and weapons
have allegedly arrived for Aidid two weeks ago on a vessel
chartered by Eritrea which docked at the natural port of Merca
town, 100 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Some of the local newspapers have reported that many of the
Oromo soldiers have already crossed into Ethiopia a few days ago
for possible hit-and-run attacks against the regime of Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the statement called on the international
community to put pressure on Ethiopia to refrain from what it
called the intervention in Somalia's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the Inter-Governmental Authority
for Development, the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity to intervene into the problems between Somalia and
Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Create Common Monetary Market  (by Li Jinqi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is introducing a monetary program among
its member states, which aims to create a regional currency union
in a bid to facilitate the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs of the COMESA Secretariat, revealed this at a press
briefing in Kenyan capital Nairobi here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya said that some major issues related to the monetary
union discussed at the 7th COMESA Inter-Governmental Committee
meeting in the past two days would be presented to the ministers
who will meet Thursday at their council meeting for further
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to work out a system for fast payment facility
to ensure that exports would be paid quickly in the security of
payment among the COMESA member states," said the COMESA official.
</P>
<P>
He said the Inter-Governmental Committee meeting had decided to
introduce the limited currency convertibility which is to enable
the national currencies of the COMESA members to be convertible
among them directly, thus promoting business and trade among the
member states.
</P>
<P>
Especially, he noted, the small-scale traders will benefit from
this practice.
</P>
<P>
As to the currency convertibility, Chanthunya said, a smart
card is to be used to replace the travellers' check introduced in
1988 by the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern
Africa (PTA).
</P>
<P>
The use of the smart card will save foreign exchanges and
facilitate the cross-border travels in COMESA's 21 member states.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Committee meeting also decided to
introduce the monetary harmonization program with "the objective
to harmonize our economies because there is a lot of disparities"
among the member states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program will eventually make it possible to create a
favorable environment "for us to chose a single currency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Before a single currency, Chanthunya said, the committee
meeting decided to create a coordinating body of experts from
central banks and ministries of finance from the member states to
build their economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
He continued that a banking regulation and supervision system
will be worked out for the financial structures of the member
states for an increasingly financial integration.
</P>
<P>
They will undertake the study in this respect and decide that
the expert supervision unit will meet once every year to exchange
experiences and their best practices.
</P>
<P>
These major issues recommended by the committee meeting will be
considered by the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the
ministers will bring their recommendations on the issues to the
COMESA Summit which will open on May 24, Chanthunya concluded.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is counting down toward a free trade area by October
31, 2000.

local government can keep in closer touch with the people.
</P>
<P>
These centers are also helping the awareness of local
government officials in their service to the public as well.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the people of Shenyang now may dial
2211 to report problems to the Shenyang Residents' Complaint
Center, which was founded more than a year ago following the
example of another city's hotline, and the complaints are
responded to expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
With more than 20 employees, the Shenyang Residents' Complaint
Center has opened ten phone lines to facilitate the acceptance of
complaints.
</P>
<P>
To date, hotline has received more than 170,000 complaint phone
calls, and many of the problems reported have been dealt with
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Similar centers have also been established at grassroots units
in the city, and they all eventually will be linked by computer
network for greater efficiency in reporting and solving problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 cities across the country have sent
representatives to Shenyang to see how it is done.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian champions
Deportivo Cali were poised to enter the Libertadores Cup final
after whitewashing Cerro Porteno 4-0 at home in their semi-final
first leg on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final first leg, two-times former champions
River Plate of Argentina defeaed Brazil's Palmeiras 1-0 in Buenos
Aires.
</P>
<P>
Cali, who last appeared in the final 21 years ago, beat their
Paraguayan opponents despite the absence of suspended striker

</P>
<P>
Carlos Castillo opened the scoring in the 35th minute. Two
minutes before halftime Cerro goalkeeper Danilo Aceval saved a
penalty from Victor Bonillo.

<P>
But Mayor Candelo increased Cali's lead at the start of the
second half and added two other goals in the last ten minutes by
Giovanni Cordoba and John Wilmer Perez.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras were heavily indebted to goalkeeper Marcos for three
stunning first-half saves against River Plate, champions in 1986
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Berti of River Plate scored the winning goal in the 48th
minute after an amazing scramble in which two successive shots hit
the Palmeiras post.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras defender Junior Baiano, who played for Brazil in the
last World Cup, made a series of blunders which culminatined in
him being sent off.

minute for a second bookable offence as his team failed to add to
their score.

<HEADLINE> Two Ministers Dropped From Malaysian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two senior ministers were
dropped from the cabinet and a new minister was appointed in a
reshuffle announced by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Rahmat was replaced by Khalil Yaakob as information
minister while Deputy Home Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir was
promoted to take over from Sabbaruddin Chik as the culture, arts
and tourism minister.
</P>
<P>
Khalil has also been appointed secretary-general of the main
ruling party the United Malaya National Organization (UMNO),
succeeding Sabbaruddin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amin Mulia, president of Sabah Barisan Nasional
Component Party Akar, was named minister in the Prime Minister's
Department.
</P>
<P>
Both he and Khalil will be sworn in as senators on May 25 to
enable them to take up the appointments.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said at a news conference here that Yang di-Pertuan
Agong had consented to the appointment of the three ministers and
that of Khalil and Amin as senators.
</P>
<P>
The appointments will take effect on May 25 after they are
sworn in before Yang di-Pertuan Agong.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the two ministers resigned from their posts and
described the cabinet changes "as a move to strengthen the
government machinery."
</P>
<P>
"The ministers who resigned from their posts have also carried
out their duties well. But in view of their resignations, we have
to make replacements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that Mohamed and Sabbaruddin tendered their
letters of resignation two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter about Sabbaruddin's remarks Wednesday that
he was asked to resign, the prime minister replied, "Sabbaruddin
saw me and said he would like to resign. And no, it is not because
of health reasons." The prime minister said Mohamed and
Sabbaruddin did not give any reasons for wanting to resign.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was also asked about the factors that he
would take into account before calling for the general election,
due before June next year.
</P>
<P>
"Well, what is convenient to the government party because as
you know, it is the government which decides the date of the
election. It is not a fixed date as in some countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Cuts Tariffs on Selected Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
drastically reduced tariffs by an average of about 70 percent on a
number of imported products used as raw materials to stimulate
growth of the hard-pressed manufacturing sector, the weekly
Business reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Tariff Commission Dzikamai Danha confirmed the
tariff cuts Wednesday, saying the new rates would be announced
"any time from now" in the Government Gazzette.
</P>
<P>
Sectors to benefit from the reductions include those operating
in the film industry, fiber-glass manufactures, agricultural
concerns, construction and engineering companies, footwear
manufacturers and leather tanners.
</P>
<P>
"The tariff reductions would reduce the operating costs for the
 companies concerned and help improve their competitiveness both
locally and in the export market," Danha said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission was planning on a week-long retreat in
the resort town of Kariba from May 29 to look at other submissions
made by the industrial and commercial sectors and review the
present tariff structure.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector's contribution to the gross domestic
product had been shrinking and the tariff reductions would help
stimulate production, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Cultural Relics In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Cultural Heritage
Administration recently overhauled its protection control methods
in various areas and says it will deal more severely with relics-
related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The administration has ordered local offices to pay greater
attention to cultural relics protection and to improve safety
devices and prevent possible fires, an official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to the administration, China had reported 53 cases of
relics theft in 1998 and 236 important relics disappeared. In
addition, 53.7 percent of the items were taken from museums or
antique stores and lost.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 ancient stone or terracotta scriptures disappeared,
accounting for 73.6 percent of the thefts.
</P>
<P>
Also, even after a marked drop in the number of fires from 1990
to 1997, there were seven major fires that burnt down 21 temple
buildings and 15 classical architecture specimens.
</P>
<P>
In a joint effort with public security and customs authorities,
the administration is now considering revising the existing
regulations on protecting cultural relics and heritage sites
because even though police work hard at protecting the nation's
heritages, because of the large returns, criminals still try and
now with more sophisticated equipment and weapons.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Likely to Win Majority in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- By the ongoing trend, the Nepali
Congress is likely to win a clear majority in the House of
Representatives as it still leads by a clear margin Thursday on
the fourth day of vote counting.
</P>
<P>
So far 163 candidates have been declared elected to the
205-seat house with 91 of them from the Nepali Congress. And the
party was leading in 14 constituencies, initial results show.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML) was the runner-up with 57 winners. It was leading in
eight constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP) came third with seven
winners, followed by the National People's Front and the Nepal
Sadbhavana Party with three for each and the Nepal Workers and
Peasants Party and the United People's Front with one for each.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) and the
RPP (Chand), which broke away from the CPN-UML and the RPP
respectively early last year, have yet to open their accounts.
</P>
<P>
And worse still, their top leaders all lost, including CPN-ML
President Sahana Pradhan, General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam and the
party's two other influential leaders Chandra Prakash Mainali and
Radha Krishna Mainali and RPP (Chand) President Rajeswor Devkota.
</P>
<P>
But Gautam still can try his luck in the No. 1 constituency of
Kathmandu where elections are rescheduled for June 8 following the
death of CPN-UML candidate Man Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, RPP (Chand)'s parliamentary leader and former Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand lost in one constituency of
Baitadi district in far-western Nepal and was trailing far behind
in another.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of the political parties contested the elections
from two constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML and the RPP (Chand) are not recognized as national
parties yet. They have to win at least 3 percent of the total
votes cast for the status.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting started Monday evening after the second-phase
parliamentary elections concluded in 39 districts of the kingdom.
The first-phase elections were held on May 3 in 35 districts.
</P>
<P>
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was declared elected
unopposed on March 30 as he was the only candidate to file
nomination in Manang district, western Nepal.

BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Industry and Finance Ministries
of Thailand are expected to propose a strategic plan of the Small
Industrial Finance Cooperation (SIFC) to ease the liquidity crunch
faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The SIFC plan, which is expected to help strengthen the
corporation's capability to procure loans for SMEs, will be
proposed to the Council of Economic Ministers next Monday, the
newspaper The Nation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also to be proposed to the meeting is the idea of establishing
a venture capital fund for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop, the newspaper said
an efficiency improvement in financial institutions is needed to
help the manufacturers through the provision of low-cost funding
sources.
</P>
<P>
Without lower interest rates, local manufacturers are not able
to be competitive in the world market, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to End Price Support Policy for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will give up its policy of
state intervention to support farm product prices and resort to a
new plan to stabilize returns for farmers, the Bangkok Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the government will oversee production,
instead of prices, to match supply with demand and thereby
stabilize the market, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be required to register with the government and
supply the authorities with production figures.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangkok Post, price support cost the Thai
government about 46 billion baht (1.26 billion U.S. dollars) a
year, much of which was wasted, finding its way into the pockets
of politicians and other vested interests.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that subsidies are banned under the World Trade
Organization rules banning subsidies and that if the government
continued extending subsidies, Thai products could face trade
barriers abroad.
</P>
<P>
The new plan would merge recommendations from the commerce,
agriculture and industry ministries, which would take joint
responsibility for matching production with demand.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry would take charge of the program while
the Commerce Ministry will look for new export markets and the
Industry Ministry seek ways to add value to farm products.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Cholera on Rise in Ratanakkiri, Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 56 rural villagers in
Ratanakkiri province in Cambodia were killed by cholera and as
many as 900 persons have fallen ill since the first cholera case
was reported in mid-March, the Cambodian Ministry of Health said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that reports it received show that cholera
was widespread in 15 villages in six districts of Ratanakkiri. The
long distance between villages and health centers made it hard to
treat and control the disease.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Health told Xinhua Thursday that
a special team was already sent to the villages to investigate the
situation there. A medical team was also sent by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of cases in Ratanakkiri was reported about two
months ago. Most of the victims were minorities and cholera spread
easily and quickly because the villagers have little knowledge
about the disease and medical staff in provincial health centers
also lack the skills and experience to treat cholera.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is epidemic in Cambodia and it occurs most often when
the seasons change.
</P>
<P>
It was the second outbreak of cholera this year and the the
last one was in Takeo and Kampot provinces in January, reportedly
killing at least 23 people.

<HEADLINE> Annual Meeting of Tibet Government Advisors Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the top advisory body of the regional
government, has ended its second annual session in the regional
capital of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Basang, vice-chairwoman of the CPPCC Tibet Regional Committee,
delivered a speech at the seven-day session's closing meeting on
Wednesday, saying that "in 1959 Tibet carried out the democratic
reform, which toppled feudal serfdom and made some one million
former serfs masters of their own destiny."
</P>
<P>
The history of development in Tibet over the past four decades
has shown that only the Communist Party of China and socialism can
save Tibet and promote the region's development, added Basang.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that this year will mark the 50th founding
anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Macao by the Chinese government,
and the 40th founding anniversary of the CPPCC Tibet Regional
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"All CPPCC members and organizations in Tibet should earnestly
perform their duties of political consultation and democratic
supervision, work harder still to consolidate and develop the
current political situation of stability and unity, serve the
cause of safeguarding the unity of the motherland, and improve
ethnic solidarity," Basang urged.
</P>
<P>
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, was
also present at the closing meeting.

<HEADLINE> Economist: Insurers Should Be Allowed to Invest in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese economist Xiao
Zhuoji said recently that China's insurance firms should be
allowed to invest in the stock market, according to today's China
Securities News.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the stock market would not only expand insurers'
revenue base, thereby shoring up their strength against risks, but
would also help produce a stable stock market, the economist said
at a symposium on risk prevention for insurers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's stock market has been in sustained
depression since July 1998, a refection of the macroeconomic
situation both in China and the world as a whole, Xiao said the
government should encourage more institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
He added that the safety of the insurance fund should not be a
cause of concern provided market regulators are doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance law provides that insurance firms can only
invest their money in bank deposits, treasury bonds, and projects
approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank's six interest-rate cuts over the
past two years have shattered the revenue base of the insurance
firms, who are concerned that their payment ability may be
severely challenged if this situation is allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Although insurers have urged the government to allow them to
invest in corporate bonds, mortgages, and industries, top
officials in the government are still cautious about this issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has spent
more than 9 billion rupees (130 million U.S. dollars) to help 2
million families during the past four years under its Samurdhi
(welfare) program, the official Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Samurdhi Authority official said the program has changed from
a simple income transfer scheme to a much more comprehensive
program.
</P>
<P>
The Samurdhi program now encompasses banking, insurance,
savings, job-oriented training, infrastructure development and
self-employment.
</P>
<P>
A Samurdhi Security Fund was established to assist
beneficiaries to meet the expenses of their urgent obligations. A
Samurdhi Janatha Project is in place to create employment
opportunities in the agricultural sector and step up production.
</P>
<P>
A rural community program aimed at providing small-scale rural
infrastructure facilities for low-income groups was also created.
</P>
<P>
Samurdhi Banking Societies have provided credit to 63,000
members to implement projects in agriculture, fisheries and
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, poor people still account
for 70 percent of the total population of 18.5 million in Sri
Lanka and  more than a quarter or about 3 million of them are
living below the poverty line.

CHONGQING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Six tombs dating back to the
Warring States period (475-221 B.C.) have been found in Fengjie
County in the Chinese city of Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Impossible Till NATO Halts Bombings: Yugoslav Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia
Borislav Milosevic stressed Wednesday that any peace negotiation
is impossible until NATO ceases its air raids.
</P>
<P>
If NATO stops air raids, Yugoslavia will start bilateral talks
on the partial autonomy of Kosovo, the return of ethnic Albanian
refugees and the entry of international peacekeeping mission,
Milosevic said in an interview with the Finnish News Agency in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
When launching its military operations against Yugoslavia, NATO
cared neither about the autonomy of Kosovo nor the status of
ethnic Albanian residents, but regarded the country as a test site
for its strategy. It is only because NATO strategists wanted to
examine the feasibility of its military system that the raids,
which would be judged by history as savage, lasted so long time,
Milosevic noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. attempted to "re-deploy" its troops in Europe through the
war, he said, for instance, to dispatch its troops to Croatia. If
Yugoslavia rejected peace talks under NATO military pressure, he
noted, NATO would decide to send in ground troops. Under such
circumstance, Yugoslavia would have no choice but to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the "international peacekeeping mission," Milosevic
emphasized the mission should be grouped by civil staff coming
from those countries approved by Yugoslavia and led by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia would accept no peacekeepers from the NATO member
countries, but welcome those from China, India, Egypt and Latin
America, in addition to the major mediator for Kosovo peace --
Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO began its bombing on March 24, several thousand
people have been killed, infrastructures systematically destroyed,
causing huge disasters to the nation. To avoid further damages,
Yugoslavia would compromise in some points but would never give in
on sovereignty or issues of vital national interests.

COLOMBO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Paddy production in Sri Lanka in
1998 reached a level of 2.7 million metric tons, just 4 percent
short of the record high in 1995, the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paddy output represented an 11-percent increase over the
previous year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The annual average paddy yield had also improved by 1 percent
to 3,636 metric tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The rise in output was due to improved production methods and a
16-percent increase in the area under paddy.
</P>

Production during the minor season increased by 16 percent to
911,000 metric tons and the main season by 22 percent to 1.78
million metric tons, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The dry zone of the country, which encompasses the

<HEADLINE> HK to Excel by Cybernating Traditional Strengths (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Amid an economic slowdown, Hong
Kong, the traditional regional financial center, is striving to
build itself into a regional hub of information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Yet facing the fierce competition from Asian neighbors such as
Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong,
with a few technical disadvantages, is digging deep into its
strengths and potentials to see what can be cybernated.
</P>
<P>
An integrated hi-tech base, the Cyberport, has already been
planned. And education is stressed to give young people a vision
as well as the knowledge of IT.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced plans for the 13.7-
billion-dollar Cyberport, which combines residential blocks and hi-
tech office space, during his March budget speech.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the port will attract IT companies to
Hong Kong and turn the territory into a regional hi-tech hub.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, Hong Kong's legislature, the Legislature Council,
approved government funding for the Cyberport, a key
infrastructure for leading-edge applications and services.
</P>
<P>
Information Technology and Broadcasting Secretary K.C. Kwong
said that the project was "urgently required" by Hong Kong and
that a delay resulting from public tender, which could take from
six months to more than a year, "will not be acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Arguing for Hong Kong's bid to become a regional IT hub at an
international conference, Kwong said Hong Kong's opportunities lie
in electronic commerce and Internet content hub.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure, a
supportive market environment and bilingual capability, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a favorable environment for IT development,
according to Kwong, Hong Kong has taken the initiative to improve
electronic service delivery, adopt e-commerce in a wider range,
build public key infrastructure and form a governing legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates visited Hong Kong in March
and inked an interactive TV project with Hongkong Telecom, he
suggested that Hong Kong's bilingual portal was a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that there is only one "real" silicon valley -- the
one in California that has been attracting world talents, he
believed that other places like Hong Kong can "well be positioned
to become regional IT hub." Gates said his company is interested
in participating in the Cyberport development.
</P>
<P>
President of Intel Corporation Craig Barrett said during his
trip to Hong Kong in April that Hong Kong has opportunities to
make itself an Asia Pacific Internet hub, thus playing a
leadership role in information technology.
</P>
<P>
Intel also participates in the Cyberport by establishing a
joint-venture. Intel's Chief Technology Officer for China Robert
Yung said Hong Kong needs to increase bandwidth and lower cost and
rely on innovation in e-commerce solutions.

<P>
Richard Li, whose Pacific Century Group will play a leading
role in the Cyberport development, said the project will alleviate
five of the seven most important concerns for IT companies in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
These concerns include high costs of office and residential
rents, the high cost of labor relative to productivity,
environmental pollution and the need to build a critical mass of
IT talent.
</P>
<P>
"It will make Hong Kong the Internet-business gateway between
China and overseas markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order not to lag behind in tomorrow's economy, Li said, Hong
Kong needs to leverage its traditional strengths in sourcing,
transport, distribution and services.
</P>
<P>
The Cyberport will create a strategic cluster of leading-edge
IT-applications companies and leverage Hong Kong's world class
services infrastructure, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the education front, Hong Kong has spent a great sum of fund
and effort in the IT area. Secretary for Education and Manpower
Joseph W.P. Wong said the government is committed to promoting IT
in education so that the young people can "grow up with the
knowledge, skills and vision to play an active part in the next
century."
</P>
<P>
To turn the vision into reality, the Special Administrative
Region government announced a five-year strategy entitled "
Information Technology for Learning in a New Era" last November.
</P>
<P>
The four key components of the strategy are to enhance Hong
Kong students' access to IT and the Internet, to provide training
and support for all teachers, to use IT to support teaching in the
school curriculum and to foster a community-wide culture which
helps promote IT in education.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Region government has set aside a
capital sum of 3 billion HK dollars (384.6 million U.S. dollars)
and will spend an annual amount of 560 million HK dollars (71.8
million U.S. dollars) to implement various initiatives in its
strategy.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong's major universities, students have benefited from
cyber-learning and experienced the latest Internet technology such
as Java application.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the SAR government announced the allocation
of IT coordinator posts to 120 public sector schools to develop
and implement their IT-based initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The selected schools consist of primary, secondary and special
schools.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in the
reduction of poverty nationwide in past years, claiming that
between 250,000 and 300,000 households each year are escaping the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News on Thursday quoted
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs
(MOLISA) as saying the number of households classified as poor
fell from 30 percent in 1992 to 15.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
MOLISA claimed that chronically poor households have also
fallen in number over the same period from 700,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government defines a poor household on the basis
of a maximum of 13 kilograms of rice per person per month.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, the Vietnamese government has
invested around 18,000 billion Vietnamese dong (about 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars) to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty through
national socioeconomic development programs.
</P>
<P>
These include incentives for ethnic minority people to
establish a sedentary farming existence, immigration to develop
new economic zones, the development of rural transportation and
irrigation networks and rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will
implement three of its nine planned projects this and next year to
eliminate hunger and reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
They include encouraging production and developing professions,
helping poor households undertake business activities and
encouraging agricultural and forestry development and a project
aimed at establishing sedentary farming communities and new
economic zones for internal migrants.

MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Millions of locusts invaded
agricultural farms in the Philippines' Southern Dumaguete City and
are now moving to other towns of Negros Oriental Province,
Philippines News Agency (PNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PNA quoted local agricultural technicians as saying migratory
locusts are moving and currently infesting the province's
agricultural farms and vast sugarcane plantations.
</P>
<P>
According to PNA, the locusts has left several hectares of corn
plantation without leaves in the province.
</P>
<P>
The local government had earlier launched a campaign to
eradicate the locusts infestation, apparently to no avail,
prompting observers to suggest that another method that could
permanently put a stop to the recurring plague, PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Some municipal governments in the province have adopted
programs to encourage farmers and children to gather locusts in
exchange for rice.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said chemical spraying cannot solve the
problem because the pests just go from one place to another.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Reserves Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign reserves
declined to 15.92 billion U.S. dollars in the week ending on May
14 from 16.05 billion dollars in the previous week, Bank Indonesia
said in its latest weekly report.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the decrease in the country's net
foreign reserves to the repayment of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, it said net international reserves were still above
the 15.4 billion dollar target set by the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Gross international reserves -- net foreign exchange reserves
plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts -- went down from
25.94 billion dollars from 26.05 billion dollars for the previous
week, The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted the weekly report as
saying.

<HEADLINE> China's Aid-the-Poor Projects Focus on Science Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's aid-the-poor projects will
focus more on teaching farmers to apply scientific and
technological means in their agricultural production, said Han
Deqian, Vice-Minister of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Han emphasized that greater efforts will be made to upgrade
farmers' skills in crop growing, preventing natural disasters, and
minimizing losses caused by fierce market competition.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister made the remarks at a conference that opened
yesterday in Beijing to confer awards to 1,317 individuals who
made contributions to the country's aid-the-poor programs over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
China has 42 million poor population living mainly in remote
mountainous areas, the Loess Plateau of Shanxi and Shaanxi
provinces, and areas prone to natural disasters, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Han said science departments should speed up the introduction
of updated farming skills in these areas, and help farmers develop
a resource-based, environmentally friendly economy.
</P>
<P>
China launched its anti-poverty campaign in 1978, with the aim
of helping poor people in rural and remote areas become better off.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology started projects to aid
the poor through spreading science and technology in the late 1980
s. The projects were mainly targeted at six poor counties in Anhui,
Hunan, Jiangxi and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the Jinggang Mountains areas of east China's Jiangxi
Province, the number of poor dropped from 900,000 in 1990 to 300,
000 last year, while farmers per capita net income increased to 1,
635 yuan (197 U.S. dollars) last year from 375 yuan (45 U.S.
dollars) in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Redundant Silk Processing Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China is urging its silk sector to
reduce its surplus processing capacity and develop a number of
competitive brands, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country must intensify macro-control over the sector and
pursue technological progress to ensure the industry's
revitalization, Yi Hui, director of the State Cocoon and Silk Co-
ordinating Group (SCSCG), was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
China produces and exports 70 percent of the world's silk, but
has encountered unprecedented difficulties since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The excess processing capacity of China's silk-spinning plants
and the Asian financial turmoil have incurred a 2-billion-yuan (
240 million US dollars) deficit in the sector in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The country will strictly control distribution of silkworm
eggs and mulberry growing acreage to make sure cocoon production
does not exceed 400 million kgs in 1999," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, targets for 1999 are aimed at cutting the
filature processing capacity by 36 percent and the silk-spinning
processing capacity by 28 percent, or 190,000 spindles.
</P>
<P>
Yi also stressed the importance of exploring the domestic and
global markets by cultivating a group of competitive silk brands
and the use of funds for research and development.
</P>
<P>
Funds going to the research projects are expected to reach 35
million yuan (4.2 million US dollars), he said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Cabinet Resigns En Masse After Upper House Vetoes Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The entire Dutch coalition cabinet
resigned Wednesday after a bill that would allow the Dutch public
to veto some government decisions via referendums failed to obtain
the necessary two-thirds majority at the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
Hans Wiegel, the only legislator who voted against the bill,
said the bill would give the public too much power over government
policy.
</P>
<P>
The centrist Democrats 66 party, which formed the ruling
coalition along with the right-leaning Liberal Party and the left-
of-center Labor Party, had threatened to quit the government if
the bill was vetoed by the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Wim Kok informed Queen Beatrix of the
resignation after an emergency session. A vote in the upper
chamber hasn't caused a government to fall since 1907.
</P>
<P>
Kok's government, which came to power in August last year, has
become one of the shortest-lived governments in the Dutch history.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Striving to Reduce Impact of Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- In the Asian financial crisis, which
has swept the region for nearly two years, commodity prices
continued to rise, local currency suffered devaluation, investment
dropped and more local and foreign enterprises closed in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Myanmar kyat against the U.S. dollar kept
falling from 160 per dollar at the beginning of the crisis in July
1997 to about 350 at present.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in 1998 went on plummeting to 247 million
dollars from 1.3 billion dollars in 1997 and from 2.3 billion
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, agriculture, construction, transport and real
estate got no foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar blamed the fall in foreign investment on the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 26 foreign companies, mainly from South
Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan, have pulled out of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Myanmar government adopted more measures to
prevent the impact of the crisis from going worse although the
impact in the country was not as serious as in the Southeast Asian
nations which were directly hit.
</P>
<P>
Seeing that economic turmoil is partly due to the weakness of
the agricultural sector, the mainstay of the country's economy
accounting for 36 percent of the GDP and 35 percent of the export
value, Myanmar has been encouraging domestic private entrepreneurs
to invest more in the sector by allowing them to reclaim large
plots of vacant, virgin, fallow and wet land in the country for
extensive farming since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 467,370 hectares of such land in six
divisions and states have been reclaimed to cultivate various
crops to boost the country's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government also adopted some new plans for
collecting more taxes in the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Exemption of customs duties on the import of agricultural
implements such as related machinery, pesticide and fertilizer was
 among the measures taken in an effort to promote agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The latest measures cover higher customs duties for imported
luxury goods and an 8-percent commercial tax on the foreign
currency included in the proceeds of sale or total proceeds of
sale received by any person from any production and sale of goods
or from the purchase and sale of goods.
</P>
<P>
The government will also control expenditure from the state
reserve fund beginning April, the start of fiscal year 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, state economic enterprises and cantonment
municipalities will be permitted to take loans from abroad for
their projects on condition that the amount of loans actually
received by the execution of loan agreements shall not exceed 70
billion kyats (233 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
As another effort to reduce the effect of the Asian financial
crisis, Myanmar is also speeding up the privatization process. In
January, the country's Privatization Commission further announced
the privatization of 68 other state-owned enterprises including
factories, rice mills, cinemas and hotels.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead in NATO Bombing of Belgrade Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO missiles bombed a hospital
near the center of Belgrade overnight Wednesday, killing at least
three people, Studio B television quoted doctors at the hospital
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Milovan Bojic from the cardio-vascular department of the
Dragisa Misovic hospital, located in the Dedinje district 3.5
kilometers from the city center, said that three people had been
killed in his department.
</P>
<P>
Bojic is the director of the hospital and also Serbia's Deputy
Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Moma Jakovljevic of the neurological department told the
television that two or three persons had been killed in the attack.
It was not clear yet whether they were the ones that Bojic
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
The operating theaters of the maternity ward of the hospital
had been seriously wrecked and mothers-to-be and babies were being
evacuated, Jakovljevic said, adding that almost all the windows of
the hospital had been smashed and other patients had been injured
by flying glass.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug also reported that three
people were dead in the raids.
</P>
<P>
It reported that NATO aircraft fired three missiles at the
hospital building and a nearby petrol station.
</P>
<P>
Four very loud explosions shook central Belgrade between 00:53
and 00:58 a.m. Thursday local time, following other blasts in
various suburban areas, Tanjug said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Develop Semiconductor Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government planned
to maximize the development of the semiconductor industry by
inviting 20 major manufacturers for investment in the country,
Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the semiconductor industry in the 2000s would
have a large market and higher added value than assembling the
products with a tight competition," Electronics Director of the
Industry and Trade Ministry Ardinsyah Parmain said.
</P>
<P>
According to world semiconductors trade statistics, the world
semiconductor industry has been growing by 23 percent in the
1994-1998 period and its value in 1998 reached 233.1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Parmain said, the world semiconductor market will
increase to 300 billion dollars and the development of the
industry will switch from industrialized countries like the United
States, the European Union and Japan to developing countries in
Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"In the 2000s many world semiconductor producers will be
relocated to the developing countries with semi-skilled and
cheaper labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early in the third millennium, 16 percent of the world
semiconductors will be manufactured in Asia and the Pacific and
the market will be worth 48 billion dollars, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Although a little later than other ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) member countries, Parmain said, Indonesia
will focus its electronics policy on the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Indonesia's semiconductor exports stood only at 130.5
million dollars, which were very low compared with those of
Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, whose exports had reached
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the government is preparing guidelines to
attract investors, especially world semiconductor manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"We have already prepared tax incentives for that purpose, but
things have been delayed by the current prolonged crisis," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Armed Forces to Be Cut by Half in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Commander-in-Chief Owe
Wiktorin on Tuesday submitted to the government a formal proposal
for massive cuts in the number of military regiments, conscripts
and officers across the forces.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Sweden's armed forces are to be cut by half
in the coming five years. The army will be cut to six brigades
including two mobile forces while the air force's wing to five.
The number of the navy's warships and submarines are to be reduced
to 12 and five respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile they will cut the size of the standing 14,100
officers to 9,500, 9,000 civilian staff to 6,550 and 18,500
conscripts to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, subject to parliament approval, followed a deal
between the government and the opposition in February to cut
defense spending by 12 billion crowns (1.5 billion U.S. dollars)
in 2002-2004.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1998-99, Sweden's defense budget was 44.3
billion crowns (5.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
While submitting the proposal, Wiktorin also urged the
government to re-examine the security policies before a formal
decision was made in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the current Kosovo crisis was an example that the world
security situation was getting worse.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Supreme Court Drops Marcos Children's Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court denied
Wednesday the belated pleas of three Marcos children to resurrect
a 75-25 compromise accord on the family wealth forged by their
mother with the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin Thursday quoted a court resolution as saying
that a case already terminated by final judgment cannot be
resurrected by any party and that the three Marcos children failed
to present new evidence that would warrant their intervention.
</P>
<P>
The unanimous resolution was written by Associate Justice
Artemio V. Panganiban, the same magistrate who wrote the December
9, 1998, decision that struck down the 75-25 agreement as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would have ceded to the government 75 percent of
all the wealth said to have been stashed away by the late
President Ferdinand Marcos and his family, with 25 percent going
to the heirs.
</P>
<P>
More than a month after the decision was handed down, the three
Marcos children filed a motion to intervene in the case and a
motion for partial reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
In denying the motions, the Supreme Court said, "the December 9
decision has become final and executory. The movants are now
legally barred from seeking leave to participate in a case
terminated by final judgment."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the court said the Marcos children "did not
offer any plausible excuse for such late quest to assert their
alleged rights."
</P>
<P>
Besides, it said, the court had passed upon the so-called 75-25
agreement and had it nullified.
</P>
<P>
In nullifying the agreement in the December 9 decision, the
Supreme Court said, the contract was void because of so many
violations of the country's 1987 constitution.

CARACAS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan authorities seized 395
kilograms of cocaine in the capital Wednesday, which they suspect
were en route to Holland, said judicial police (PTJ).
</P>
<P>
During the operation, the police also detained four people.
</P>
<P>
The PTJ had been investigating the group for three months
before making the arrests. They had been tipped that a group
working in Caracas would receive a shipment of cocaine which was
bound for a foreign destination.
</P>
<P>
The investigation eventually led to the discovery of the owner
of the seized cocaine, which had been sent from Colombia and was
to be forwarded on to Holland via the port of La Guaira, in
Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The PTJ are looking for Dutch persons believed to have come to
Venezuela to prepare the drugs for shipment to their country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Citizens Don't Believe NATO's Explanation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest telephone survey of over
800 Chinese citizens indicates that no one believes the missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was a "tragic mistake"
as NATO has explained.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, conducted by the popular Beijing Youth Daily and
a polling company, 40 percent of the respondents say NATO's
intention was to test China's reaction. Sixteen percent say that
NATO aims to silence China's opposition to the bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Another 14 percent say the United States is bullying countries
which dare to say no to the only superpower in the world. Seven
percent say the U.S. is showing off its power. Six percent of the
people say the United States is so arrogant that it has gone crazy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper vents its impatience in waiting for NATO's
investigation result, saying if someone is reluctant to talk about
the details of an issue, he is trying to cover something up, he is
lying.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that the popularity of the United
States among Chinese citizens has dropped by 24 percentage points
after the bombing, with 83 percent saying that the United States
is hegemonic. However, the paper says that if the United States
and NATO could meet all the requests raised by the Chinese
government, their popularity would go up by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent say the United States is hypocritical, and
56 percent say it is barbaric and crazy. The respondents also use
"insane" and "Nazi" to describe the United States, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Most of the citizens say they will study and work harder than
usual to make China stronger, as this is the best way to channel
their indignation. About 91 percent of youth under the age of 25
say the most important thing at present is to think it over calmly.

<HEADLINE> Panama Rejects U.S. Military Presence Beyond 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A top Panamanian legislator
said Wednesday nothing justifies a U.S. military presence on
Panama's soil after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Oyden Ortega, chairman of the parliament's Foreign Relations
Commission, made the statement in reply to a letter from U.S.
President Bill Clinton regarding the proposal to establish a
multilateral center against drugs on Panamanian territory.
</P>
<P>
There are differences over the nature of the organization --
whether it should be military or civilian.
</P>
<P>
"The country (Panama) is strengthening its neutrality and needs
no foreign military presence," Ortega said. Besides, "Panama at
present does not have any military forces of its own."
</P>
<P>
The Torrijos-Carter agreements, signed in 1997, provide for the
total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama as well as the
neutrality of the Panama Canal after it returns to the Panamanian
control on December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The area of the canal, where they propose to create the anti-
drug center, should be exploited more as a commercial zone than as
a military zone," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, UN to Launch Cities Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and a United
Nations agency for cities jointly launched on Wednesday the Cities
Alliance, a multi-donor partnership to develop strategies to
improve the living conditions of the urban poor and upgrade slums
and squatter settlements.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn said that "the Cities Alliance seeks to marshal the
forces of localism and globalism to improve the quality of urban
life."
</P>
<P>
"With more than 60 percent of the world's population living in
cities by 2025, governance of cities is critical to achieving
sustainable development. Experience has shown that the prospects
for success in our fight against poverty are much brighter where
city governments have their own development strategies and have
the means to implement them in consultation with local residents,"
he went on.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Topfer, Under Secretary General and Acting Executive
Director of the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (UN
agency for cities), who also attended the launching ceremony, said
that "by combining our organizations' experience in dealing with
urban problems and mobilizing capital, the Alliance will create
opportunities for cities to share best practices in health,
transportation, sanitation, power distribution and job creation."
</P>
<P>
The Cities Alliance is a mechanism by which local initiatives
and practices such as these can be transferred to other cities to
promote sustainable, healthy urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the Alliance will provide funds to help municipal
governments design development strategies that meet their cities'
needs, ensuring that urban-dwellers' concerns are addressed in
national plans.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, more than five million U.S.
dollars in seed funding, along with staff and administrative
support for the Alliance, have been committed by the bank, the UN
agency for cities and the government of Japan, with additional
pledges of support from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Most Swiss Support Sion's Bid for 2006 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Most Swiss hope that the
southwestern Swiss city of Sion to host the Olympic Winter Games
in 2006, according to a lastest opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
Four out of five Swiss feel that the event would be a "good
thing", said the survey carried out by Switzerland's German-
speaking television channel, DRS. They are also confident and
optimistic about the chances of Sion winning the bid: two thirds
think that the 2006 games will be held in Sion, Valais.
</P>
<P>
"This new survey reveals that 79 per cent of the Swiss
population judge the organization of the Olympic Games in
Switzerland to be a positive move," said Sion 2006 Switzerland
Candidature Committee in its press release.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is even one point higher than the results obtained
by the same institute at the beginning of the year," said the
committee. "It is thus evident that the corruption scandals
surrounding the International Olympic Committee have by now means
affected popular support among the Swiss in favor of the Olympic
Games."
</P>
<P>
Because Sion is within the French-speaking area of Swistzerland
which has German, French and Italian as official languages, the
survey found, those in the French-speaking area and young people
are the most enthusiastic. The French-speaking people and the
young people are respectively no less than 84 and 86 per cent in
favor of the Olympic project.
</P>
<P>
The candidature committee considered as particularly important
and highly motivating the figures for the French-speaking area and
those for the young people aged 15-24 because they are a perfect
illustration of the extraordinary support from those most
concerned by the project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, questions of the environment (52%), funds and costs
(50%), and infrastructure (34%) are those most frequently asked
about the aspects that cause the greatest concern among the Swiss.

<HEADLINE> Exports in Northeast Coastal City Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) --The latest statistics show that the
export value for the city of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning
Province reached 1.13 billion U.S. dollars this April, up 11.2
percent compared with the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
But in March the city's exports were some six percent less
than that of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, the most important export and import city in northeast
China, has attracted huge investments from foreign enterprises
with its fine harbor, convenient transportation, and beautiful
environment, and there are now over 7,000 foreign-funded
enterprises in the city, including two-thirds of the country's
Sino-Japanese firms.
</P>
<P>
Vice-director of the Dalian Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Commission, Liu Dechun, said that foreign-funded
enterprises have played an important part in the city's export
business, and their export value accounts for 73 percent of the
city's total with value for this April alone at 830 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Asian countries are still the main importers despite
the financial crisis. The export value to these countries accounts
for 71 percent of the city's total and is growing, and the growth
rate of exports to Europe, North America, and Africa for the same
month also substantially increased.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor in charge of exports and imports, Nan Changming,
pointed out that the city's severe punishment of smugglers has
contributed to this rapid growth, and the international market, on
the whole, has been recovering.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for growth is the development of new export
products. The export value of the China Hualu Matsushita Video Co.
Ltd. last year exceeded 40 million U.S. dollars, and that of the
Dalian New Shipyard last year reached 130 million U.S. dollars,
and is expected to reach 250 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Nan said that exports of over ten foreign trade firms directly
under the supervision of the local government have also been
growing as a result of reform on their operational systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
urged NATO to stop bombing on Yugoslavia to pave way for a United
Nations' involvement in searching for an end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Kosovo in a parliament session, D'Alema said China
and Russia's role in the process could not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
If NATO continues its bombing, China and Russia would not agree
to attend any Security Council meeting for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"So NATO must first halt bombing on Yugoslavia," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament that Italy is making efforts to seek an
end to the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Stop bombing does not mean a unilateral cease-fire, it only
opens a chance for a political act, he said, adding that the idea
of sending ground troops to the area is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, the parliament adopted a motion by the ruling
party, urging NATO to suspend its bombing as a prelude to a
meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema is to leave for Brussels Thursday for talks with NATO

MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is optimistic that
the economy would have grown by an average of 5.2 percent to 5.8
percent in terms of gross national product (GNP) at the end of
President Joseph Estrada administration in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post Thursday quoted preliminary data from '
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) as saying gross
domestic product (GDP) within the six-year period will post a
similarly robust growth at an average of 4.7 to 5.3 percent.

</P>
<P>
The MTPDP generally charts the country's economic course until

expectations that agricultural output which consist a substantial
portion of the economy, will consistently rise.

<P>
Moreover, the industry which is around three-fourths of the GNP
and the GDP is foreseen to move upward consistently.

<P>
JINAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Adopting animals has become
increasingly popular with citizens in Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qian, a sophomore at Shandong Polytechnic University, and
his 36 classmates adopted a red-crested crane from the city zoo
until April of next year at a cost of about 400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
With an admittance card the zoo issues to those who adopt
animals, Wang and his classmates may visit the crane whenever they
want and even hold a birthday party for the bird.
</P>
<P>
"We adopted the bird because we think university students
should show more care for animals who are endangered by the
deteriorating ecological environment, " Wang Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the city zoo said local residents are
enthusiastic about adopting animals. "Dozens of citizens call us
every day inquiring about the matter since the phone number of the
hotline for animal adoption was made public in April."
</P>
<P>
Some ten animals representing an equal number of species at the

<HEADLINE> Dannish Players Begin to Take Show at Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Shuttlers from hosts Denmark
began to take the limelight of the World Badminton Championships
in the men's and women's singles second round matches here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Gade Christensen, top seed at the tournament, defeated
Haryanto Arbi of Indonesia 15-6, 15-3 for a place in the top 16.
</P>
<P>
The world top ranked player, All England Open Championship
winner in Birmingham, England two months ago, needed only 31
minutes to brush aside the Indonesian rival.
</P>
<P>
Gade Christensen, in the third round, will meet Yong Hock Kin
of Malaysia, who beat Heimo Gotschl of Austria 15-0, 15-1 in 24
minutes.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Gade Christensen's girlfrield Camilla
Martin, third seed in the women's singles, only took about ten
minutes to blank Vlada Tcherniaskaya of Belarus in a second round
match Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who needed three sets to beat Ellen Angelina of
Indonesia in the first round on Tuesday, did not lose a point in
the second round, beating the Belarussian at 11-0, 11-0.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world badminton powerhouse China suffered another
setback in Wednesday's matches when Dong Jiong crashed in men's
singles and Zhou Mi was ousted in women's singles.
</P>
<P>
Dong Jiong, seeded 15th at the tournament, came down from first
set victory to veteran player Ardy Wiranata of the United States
at 5-15, 15-11 and 15-14 while Zhou Mi, sixth seed in women's
singles, lost to South Korean Lee Kyung Won 9-11, 11-8 and 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Dong Jiong, one of the medal hope for China in men's events,
could not control his pace when he was at the leading place 9-1 in
the second set.
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I just told myself to be patient, and did my
best to win points," said Wiranata, formerly a famous Indonesian
shuttler.
</P>
<P>
"After I took the second set and levelled the total score at 1-
all, Dong Jiong slowed down and I guessed he tried to make me
tired," said Wiranata. "But when he slowed down, he made many
errors, which gave me chance to take points."
</P>
<P>
When the final set was played at 14-all, Wiranata only asked
for one point despite that Dong Jiong had serve in hands. "I was
too tired at that time, so I decided to take a chance," said
Wiranata.
</P>
<P>
With the result, Dong Jiong became the only victim among the
seeds in men's singles second round matches.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese men's medal hope Sun Jun, second seed in the
championships, trounced Rasmus Wengberg of Sweden 15-8, 15-3. Sun
Jun will take on Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia in the third round
for a place in the quater-finals.
</P>
<P>
Taofik, 10th seed in Copenhagen, secured his place in the top
16 with a 15-10, 15-5 win over Bertrand Gallet of France.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Mi, a promising star for China, was not in her top form
Wednesday, which she managed to take one set back before conceding
the match to Lee Kyung Won.
</P>
<P>
"I did not feel well today, " said Zhou Mi, who suffered from
running stomach before the match.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Morgen of Wales continued her winnig streak on Wednesday,
beating Justine Willmott of England 11-6, 11-7 in the women's
singles.
</P>
<P>
The Welsh, the best shuttler in Britain, produced arguably the
biggest victory in her career by eliminating top seed Ye Zhaoying
of China in the first round on Tuesday, preventing the Chinese
player from being the first one to make a hat-trick of world title
for three times.
</P>
<P>
Morgen will take on Ella Karachkova of Russia in the third
round. The Russian outplayed Asian Games gold medal winner Kanako
Yonekura of Japan 11-6, 11-6 for a place in the final 16.
</P>
<P>
The day's only shock was produced in the men's doubles when
China's Yu Jinhao and Chen Qiqiu overwhelmed top seeds Danny
Kantono and Budi Ariantho of Indonesia 15-17, 15-3, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team coach Liu Xinmin said that they had been looking
forward to the victory. "It is a revenge for us, as we have not
win a match in men's doubles against Indonesians for one year."
</P>
<P>
The World Championship will continue Thursday with top eight
finishers to be decided in men's and women's singles events.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Pensions will be boosted to 26 percent of average weekly
earnings, but other welfare recipients will have their
compensation cut back as part of the Australian federal
government's compromise plans to remove food from the proposed
goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
-- Veteran trade unionist Mahendra Chaudhry was sworn in
Wednesday as Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, despite
tensions in his own coalition over the appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- An unexpectedly strong push for drug law reform, including
gathering support for public-funded safe heroin injection rooms,
is emerging at the ongoing drug meeting attended by officials of
Australia's premier state New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Low interest rates could be at risk and the critical current
account deficit could worsen if the Australian federal government
dipped into the 1999-2000 budget surplus to secure a goods and
services tax deal with the Australian Democrats Party, Treasury
Secretary Ted Evans warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia could soon have a second national stock exchange
following the launch Wednesday of a 160 million U.S. dollar
takeover bid for the Sydney Futures Exchange by share-registry and
software giant Computershare Ltd.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Votes New Ban on Kosovo Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Armed Services
Committee on Wednesday voted to impose new spending restrictions
on President Bill Clinton's conduct of the military operation in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After a discussion, the committee endorsed a provision that
none of the 288.8 billion U.S. dollars defense spending bill for
the fiscal year 1999 may be used for the conduct of combat or
peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The panel rejected an attempt by the Democrats to block the
measure on a vote of 31 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Democrats in the committee criticized the recent conflicting
votes by the full House refusing to endorse the air campaign and
also rejecting efforts to withdraw troops or declare war on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, committee Republicans insisted they were just trying
to reclaim congressional decision-making over war powers,
demanding that the Clinton administration explain why the U.S.
launched the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Floyd Spence, a Republican and the panel's chairman, said the
measure will force Clinton to come to Congress first to request
funds in a separate piece of legislation if he wants to continue
the military campaign beyond September 30.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Private School Tax Breaks Measure Clears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Finance
Committee Wednesday passed a bill which allows parents to
contribute up to 2,000 U.S. dollars a year to accounts and
withdraw the money tax-free for private school expenses.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was vetoed by President Bill Clinton last year,
cleared the panel after majority Republicans shot down a
Democratic attempt to substitute a version of Clinton's 25-
billion-U.S.-dollar school construction proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party believes federal help is better spent on
giving parents freedom to choose the best schools than on
construction projects that don't address the quality of classroom
education, Republican Senator Phil Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
"Many working Americans, taxpayers, are trapped in these
failing schools," Gramm said. "They are more capable than we are
of deciding what is best for their children."
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to reach the Senate floor in June
or July. The current law lets people use such money only for
higher education. The proposal would expand that to allow
withdrawals for kindergarten through 12th grade expenses in
public, private, or home schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton argued last year that the cost of the accounts -- about
2.6 billion U.S. dollars of the bill's overall 10-year price tag
of 7.6 billion U.S. dollars -- is money better spent to repair or
replace crumbling public schools.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Values Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. home values soared in the
first three months of this year, registering a gain of 7.2 percent
from the corresponding period a year ago, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest gain in home values underscores the strength in the
economy which, coupled with low mortgage rates, have sustained a
booming housing market, said First American Real Estate Solutions,
a nationwide real estate information company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the California-based company said, some regions are
experiencing more modest increases relative to 1998, signaling a
market slowdown in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Within the top 36 metropolitan areas covered by the report, 16
have seen a slowdown in the home value appreciation rate. In New
York, for instance, the annual gain of 17 percent last year has
dwindled to a drop of 0.7 percent during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, U.S. second largest city next to New York, has
emerged as the top performer on the housing market among the
metropolitan areas in the report. Throughout most of the 1990s,
Los Angeles was mired in a deep housing recession with home values
declining by as much as 30 percent from their peak in the late
1980s. But despite a market turnaround, a typical homeowner in Los
Angeles who purchased a house in 1990 is still likely to be in a
negative equity situation by about 14 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Lower House Wednesday
approved a motion calling for a halt to the bombing of Yugoslavia
in order to favor the passage of a United Nations Security Council
resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The motion was presented by the ruling center-left majority,
which amended it to stress any bombing halt should be the premise
for U.N. action, not a unilateral truce.
</P>
<P>
The motion was approved by 308 votes to 189, with 60
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
It urged the government to work towards a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"This halt is aimed at allowing the Security Council to be
called, on the basis of an agreed resolution, and then to verify
the willingness of the Yugoslav government to apply it," the
motion said.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, two days after the start of the NATO campaign, the
Italian Lower House approved a motion committing the government to
work with its NATO allies towards a resumption of negotiations and
a suspension of the bombing.

interbank trading.
</P>
<P>
The designated foreign exchange trading banks will decide the
exchange rates in RMB yuan against other convertible currencies
according to the tone of the international exchange market and the

<HEADLINE> Global Positioning Services Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 19 (Xinhua) -- While global positioning
services (GPS) have been available since the 1980s, the technology
will finally be utilized in a commercial market expected to be
worth 14 billion U.S. dollars by 2005, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States now dominates the GPS hardware and software
market at 65 percent, but production of GPS equipment in other
countries will account for half of the equipment by that time,
said Allied Business Intelligence (ABI), a U.S. technology
research think-tank specializing in communications and emerging
technology markets.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, ABI said, GPS has largely been adopted by
two user segments which represent extremes in the technology's
development. At one end lie applications which require precise
measurements like surveying and reference timing. At the other are
consumer applications like small craft navigation systems and
hand-helds for outdoor enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
In-vehicle navigation system right now has a mass market only
in Japan. But ABI said that this is all about to change. In the
United States, the system is moving from rental cars and luxury
vehicles to mid-priced vehicles and will be an option for most
domestic automobiles and trucks within a few years. By 2005, the
system will account for one-third of the world market for GPS
applications, ABI predicted.
</P>
<P>
Recent advances by microchip producers have reduced the size
and power requirements of GPS receivers to a level where they can
be incorporated into cellular phones or any other personal
communications device.
</P>
<P>
According to ABI, vehicle/freight tracking will be also a large
market for GPS. Mobile units will combine bar-code readers and
wireless local area network (LAN) transceivers with GPS to enable
freight tracking for an improved flow of goods and better cost
control tracking.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO Plans 45,000 Force for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is
planning for a force of about 45,000 troops to keep peace in
Kosovo after the end of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
NATO's Military Committee had agreed that the KFOR, the Kosovo
Peace Implementation Force, should number 45,000 to 50,000 troops
and this was being considered by the alliance, Pentagon spokesman
Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The United States may contribute 7,000 to 8,000 to the force.
The alliance originally estimated it would need 28,000 and 4,000
of them will be Americans.
</P>
<P>
The United States still believes that "We need an agreement
or a U.N. Security Council resolution" first for the deployment
of the KFOR, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
There are already about 13,000 NATO troops in Macedonia and
6,000 in Albania, according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Investigation of Rocket Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
directed Defense Secretary William Cohen Wednesday to investigate
a troubling string of six U.S. rocket failures.
</P>
<P>
"It is vitally important that we fully understand the root
causes behind the recent launch vehicle failures and take
corrective action," Clinton said in a memo to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the defense minister to coordinate his
investigation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other
organizations and to report preliminary findings within 90 days,
with a final report due in six months.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine months, six U.S. space launches using
expendable rockets have ended either in destruction or with
satellites stranded in useless orbits.
</P>
<P>
Three of the incidents involved military payloads atop the
heavy-lift Titan IV rockets while the other three were commercial
payloads on small Delta III and Athena vehicles. Losses have
totaled 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With 52 U.S. launches since the beginning of 1998, the six
failures represent a failure rate of more than 10 percent -- twice
the rate experienced in the previous six years.
