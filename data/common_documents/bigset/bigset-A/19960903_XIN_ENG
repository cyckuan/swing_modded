<HEADLINE> WHO Issues New Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Although chemical disinfectants in
water treatment might occasionally form undesirable by-products, health
risks from these chemical compounds are extremely small compared with
inadequate disinfection, said World Health Organization (WHO) in a
new publication issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest edition of the WHO Guidelines for
Drinking-Water Quality, the risk of waterborne infectious disease is
very high when no disinfection is used and drops very sharply when
adequate levels of disinfection are maintained.
</P>
<P>
The estimated risks to health from disinfectant by-products are
several orders of magnitude lower than the real risks associated with
inadequate disinfection, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Guidelines are intended to be used as a basis for development
of national standards that, if properly implemented, will ensure the
safety of drinking-water supplies through the elimination, or
reduction to a minimum concentration, of constituents of water that
are known to be hazardous to health.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, an estimated 80 percent of all diseases, and
over one third of deaths in developing countries, are water-related.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that water sources must be protected from contamination
by human and animal waste, which can contain a variety of bacterial,
viral and protozoan pathogens and helminth parasites. Those at
greatest risk of waterborne diseases are infants and young children,
the sick and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The health risk due to toxic chemicals in drinking-water differs
from that caused by microbiological contaminants which can lead to
acute health problems.
</P>
<P>
The problems associated with chemical constituents arise primarily
from their ability to cause adverse health effects after prolonged
periods of exposure, the Guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern are contaminants that have cumulative toxic
properties, such as heavy metals, and carcinogenic substances. Over
100 chemical substances have been examined for the latest edition of
the WHO Guidelines.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Suggests Provisional Peace Accord with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States should
sign a provisional peace accord with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the day marking the 51st anniversary of
U.S. intervention in South Korea, the spokesman reiterated the
DPRK's stand for a new peace mechanism to replace the existing
Korean Armistice Agreement signed in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said U.S. troops should withdraw from South
Korea, citing bitterness brought by the United States to the
Korean people and its threat to peace in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a U.S.-South Korean proposal for four-party talks
on a permanent peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula, the
spokesman insisted that the talks would be "undesirable" unless
they covered the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Countries proposed for the four-party talks were the DPRK, the
United States, South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. position on troop withdrawals was
not clear yet, adding that the DPRK would wait and see.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The central and western parts
of China should give full scope to their resource advantages and
open still wider to the outside world in order to boost economic
growth and raise their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
During the first five years of the decade, the autonomous
region scored great achievements in petroleum and gas exploration
and kept the country's oil and gas production stable, said
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, while on a week-long inspection tour of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which ened
today.
</P>
<P>
He called on oil workers to step up oil and gas exploitation,
noting that the new oilfields should be managed with advanced
techniques that can bring about high economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the status of agriculture in
Xinjiang must be raised.
</P>
<P>
Now that the central government is carrying out preferential
policies for the development of the central and western regions,
Xinjiang has opportunities to become a major production area for
cereals, cotton and petroleum, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government and the people of various ethnic groups
in Xinjiang wish to maintain a sustained and steady local economy,
political stability and ethnic unity, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Probes Child Prostitution Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A judicial inquiry has been
ordered into the alleged activities of child prostitution rings in
Athens following reports published recently in the Greek press.
</P>
<P>
Xeni Dimitriou, a public prosecutor who handles juvenile
affairs, instructed Athens security police to launch an inquiry
into the city's child prostitution rings and to question
journalists who have investigated the issue.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "Eleftheros Typos" (Freedom Press) said today
that police had searched more than 89 sites in the capital where
young prostitutes were believed to hang out, and had confiscated
many pictures and porno films featuring minors.
</P>
<P>
Athens dailies recently highlighted the existence of Albanian
and Greek rings who forced children into prostitution on Athens'
streets.
</P>
<P>
Since the emergence of the Belgian child sex scandal, police in
Greece were beginning to think that cases of missing children
might be linked to sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
"Although in Greece we don't have worrying signs of rings
committing criminal acts against children, we are on the alert and
trying to create the necessary infrastructure for the protection
of children," says Public Order Minister Costas Geitonas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported today that Athens police arrested
two men found molesting two ten-year-old girls in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Fruitful Results Achieved From Open Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Relatively easy access to
government archives has proved fruitful since the practice became
possible in China in 1980, playing an important role in promoting
the country's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoneng, secretary-general of the Chinese Organizing
Committee of the 13th International Congress on Archives which
opened here today, made the remarks during a press conference for
the event.
</P>
<P>
Access to government archives is available for those documents
created 30 years ago, according to the Chinese law on
archives. Those that are economic, scientific, and technological,
and are less than 30 years old can also be accessed.
</P>
<P>
During construction of the Yangpu Bridge in Shanghai, builders
referred to more than 2,000 archival documents for information and
ultimately saved more than 34 million yuan (4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Statistics on more than 300 key projects in Tianjin
municipality, north China, show that open archives brought in
economic benefits of 5.2 billion yuan during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan period(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Many foreign scholars, students, and research institutes also
benefited from China's rich information resource of archives, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 million files and 34 million volumes of data are
presently stored in 3,662 archives across China, and the same
information is also collected in archives of government
institutions at and above the provincial level as well as in large
enterprises.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International
Congress on Archives (ICA) will make important contributions to
the world's archives undertakings, a Chinese official in charge of
archives said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Archives undertakings help protect humankind's cultural

<HEADLINE> Britain Gives Green Light for Eurofighter Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo has announced that Britain is ready to go ahead
with the production of the 40 billion pounds (60 billion U.S.
dollars) Eurofighter advanced combat jet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Portillo
said that Britain intended to buy 232 of the Eurofighter plane,
which is considered as one of the best fighter planes in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is now ready to commit to production of this
Eurofighter and we want to buy initially 232 of them," Portillo
said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary stressed that "it means 14,000 jobs in
Britain and it is also a very good news for British industry and
indeed for the Royal Air Force."
</P>
<P>
Total development and production cost for 232 Eurofighters to
be ordered by Britain is estimated at 16 billion pounds (about 25
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first British Eurofighter plane is expected to be delivered
by 2001 so that they can enter service in 2002, according to local
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed plane has a "look and shoot" system, which
means when the pilot turns his head towards the target, a missile
is automatically fired.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter has been jointly developed by British Aerospace
Plc, Germany's Daimler Aerospace AG, Alenia Spa of Italy and CASA
of Spain and the four nations must all give their approval before
production starts.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Germany will try to delay the project
because of budget pressure on the German government in the run-up
to the European Union's monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the commitment of the other European partners,
Portillo said: "I don't believe the Germany can afford to drop out
of the project. I am giving them a nudge and I very much hope that
they will be ready to commit to production."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine also
urged Britain's Eurofighter partners to follow suit, saying "we
want a decision as quickly as we can get it."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, opening today, Heseltine
said: "our assessment is the Eurofighter is the best available
combat aircraft to meet the needs of the post-Cold War strategic
environment."

<HEADLINE> No Date Set for Netanyahu-Arafat Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite of intensive talks,
Israeli and Palestinian officials today failed to fix a date for
a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks between the two sides hit a snag over the issue
of Israeli troops' redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Netanyahu's
chief political adviser Dore Gold held intensive talks this
morning at the home of Terje Larsen, the U.N. coordinator for the
territories, in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, together with his wife and Norwegian diplomat Mona
Juul, have facilitated the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and
Palestinians and a recent series of secret talks to break
the deadlock of peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the two sides have bridged some
gaps in arranging a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting, but no date has
been announced after the two leaders were briefed on the
latest talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has discussed the matter with Foreign Minister
David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. His media
adviser Shai Bazak said that no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat was briefed by Erekat who flew to Gaza after
his talks with Gold. Arafat later told reporters that the two
sides had not reached common ground on such a meeting. He insisted
that Israel should implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israel complained that the Palestinian side was changing its
mind by reversing an earlier agreement to discuss the issue
of Hebron. The Israeli side demanded a revision of the Hebron
pullback in order to achieve wider security control over the
volatile town where over 400 Jews living among 200,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said the Palestinian side initially agreed
to discuss the revision of pullback in secret talks conducted
under the auspices of Larsen and his wife in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian representative in East
Jerusalem, said that while the meeting between Netanyahu and
Arafat was preferable to take place this week, the Palestinian
side would not pay any price for it.
</P>
<P>
He added the two leaders must discuss the implementation of
signed agreements during the meeting, rather than provide
only a photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
A Netanyahu-Arafat meeting is expected to help ease the
growing tension between the two sides over the last week
after Arafat called for large-scale protests against Israel's
hardline policies on the expansion of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza as well as its restriction of Palestinian
activities in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu gave a clear signal that he would
meet Arafat soon, thereby reversing an earlier hardline stand. But he
added such a meeting would only be based "on developments
and not on a calendar date."

<HEADLINE> Announcement of Lebanon's Election Results Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Official announcement on the
results of the parliamentary election in Beirut Sunday, which was
expected to be made public this afternoon, has been delayed due to
a difficulty to determine the list of winners.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that the problem was a
difference of only one vote between two Shiite candidates.
</P>
<P>
But the anonymous sources declined to specify the details of
the stalemate which has forced Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr
to delay the announcement for several hours.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics until the midnight, three Shiite
candidates were in the lead.
</P>
<P>
They were Mohammed Berjaoui, an incumbent parliamentary deputy
and candidate of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, Hussein Yatim, a
member in the alliance of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, and
Mohammed Yousef Beidoun, an ally of former premier Salim Al-Hass,
the main rival of Hariri.
</P>
<P>
But the information, which was leaked out by election officials
at midday when the cote counting process was ending, showed that
Beidoun and Yatim appeared to be winners.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Shiite Hezbollah has reportedly lost one
seat in the house after its candidate and incumbent deputy, Ali
Ammar, was defeated in the first round of election in Mount
Lebanon on August 18.
</P>
<P>
If Berjaoui is defeated, this will be another blow for the
militant group, which played a major role in the resistance
against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, no matter what the result is, it is certain that Prime
Minister Hariri and his allies will win most parliamentary seats
in Sunday's election in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Even if Berjaoui takes place of Yatim, Hariri and other
members in his alliance will still win 13 out of the 19 seats
allocated for the capital.
</P>
<P>
After the victory in the general election, Hariri will have a
dual-capacity of a deputy in the house and the prime minister of
the government.
</P>
<P>
There were 92 candidates, 43 from four contesting coalitions
respectively headed by Hariri, Hoss and incumbent deputies Adnan
Traboulsi and Najah Wakim.

voter registered in Beirut.
</P>

LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Angola has not made any
progress in its peace process in the past two months, United
Nations special envoy Blondin Beye said here today.
</P>
<P>
After having a meeting with President Eduardo Dos Santos, Beye

<HEADLINE> TUC Seeks 3 billion Pounds for Jobs, Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Up to three billion pounds
(4.65 billion US dollars) should be allocated in November's budget
for a package of measures to address job insecurity and
unemployment in Britain, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) says in
its budget submission published today.
</P>
<P>
The TUC, which will hold its annual conference in Blackpool
next week, today sent Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the
Excheque, details of its proposals for the autumn budget, which,
it says, could cut the unemployment rate to five percent from the
current 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The submission to Clarke calls for a large-scale back-to-work
program supported by improvements in training for those
unemployed and for people still working but who are likely to be
affected by industrial change.
</P>
<P>
The TUC's proposals involve investment in community
infrastructure, new training and work schemes for the long-term
unemployed, making the market for labour less risky and improving
information about the labour market.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, said: "Britain's
crisis of job insecurity, unemployment and under-investment should
be tackled in the Budget and not sacrificed in favor of tax cuts
designed to give the present government an electoral advantage".
</P>
<P>
"The government must end its reliance on its failed
hire-and-fire policies and pursue schemes that will ensure social
investment, schemes for the long-term unemployed and improvement
in our country's skills base," he added.
</P>
<P>
The TUC says that the package it calls for will create at least
360,000 jobs and help stimulate a faster growth rate next year as
the country's economic recovery continues.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Issues Ultimatum to Israel over Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today gave Israel
three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians,
otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic
summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum was issued by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny said that Egypt demanded Israel to take immediate
actions in implementing the signed agreements with the
Palestinians. The actions included redeploying Israeli troops from
Hebron, conducting further redeployments under the Oslo accords,
opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
lifting the closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Egypt wants deeds but not words from the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny issued the stern warning only one day after Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy paid his first visit to Egypt, during
which he held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic
summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank
town of Hebron, saying, "I cannot imagine that the economic
summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not
happened yet."
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron
pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of
extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early
March. The new Israeli government promised to conduct the
pullout, but demanded certain revisions.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of implementation, it will be a very serious
situation. It is impossible to imagine that we can talk about
regional cooperation when the peace process is obstructed or
paralyzed. It would be illogical, out of the question," Moussa
added.
</P>
<P>
Levy said today Moussa's view was exactly that of Mubarak,
who was responsible for issuing the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
In a strong reaction to Egypt's threat, the Israeli government
today warned Cairo against "making things worse" by issuing such
an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a
statement blasting Egypt for issuing "an unfortunate threat that
can only raise the tension in the region." An Israeli official
pointed out that Egypt needs the Cairo summit more than Israel
does.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the
Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Although Egypt is the first Arab country that established
diplomatic ties with Israel, the two states have been slow in
normalizing their relations, which are often marred by the
disputes over the peace process and bilateral frictions.

LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the
Angolan-Chinese Friendship Association and Chamber of Commerce,
Adriano Junior, said today the bilateral trade has been
buttressed since the organization was set up a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Adriano told reporters here that the chamber, which was
established in August in 1995, has helped promote the direct
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the volume of the Sino-Angolan direct trade had
been very low and most of the Chinese products had been imported
into Angola from a third country.
</P>
<P>
Adriano said his organization also set up a computerized data
bank on Sino-Angolan trade for consultation of the Angolan
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Angola is China's third largest trade partner in
Africa, and the bilateral trade volume reached 60.87 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs to Discuss Iraqi Attacks on Kurdish Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will hold a two-day meeting in the
Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh to discuss Iraq's attacks on the
Kurdish region in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported that during the meeting scheduled
for September 7, the ministers of the GCC, which includes Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), will review the contacts between the GCC and the United
States, which sent envoys to the GCC states and a number of other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chief of Staff, and Robert Pelletreau, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, started Sunday a tour
of the region for consultations on how to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops Saturday
into northern Iraq to "crush Iranian-backed Kurdish separatists"
that held parts of a mountainous enclave protected by U.S.-led
coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest military attack by Saddam's army in five
years following the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it launched the attack because another Kurdish
faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, was cooperating with
Iraq's longtime foe Iran.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of Iraqi troops, including three tank divisions
equipped with heavy weapons, had reportedly attacked and seized
Arbil, the main Kurdish city in Northern Iraq, which has been
under protection by a western allied air force based in southern
Turkey shortly after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Sunday its troops were ordered to pull back from the
area, only one day after the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have caused grave concern among the GCC countries
which worried that the Iraqi attacks on the Kurdish area could pose
danger to the whole region.

CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat presided over an emergency meeting of the
Palestinian leadership to discuss the grave situation of the peace
process in Gaza City, which began Sunday night and continued into
the early hours of today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the meeting was attended by
cabinet members of the Palestinian Authority, members of the PLO
Executive Committee, National Council Speaker Abu Ala, members of
the PLO mainstream Fatah Central Committee and senior aides to the

the final outcome of the outgoing round of intensive talks between
the Palestinians and Israel, which have failed to make any headway
so far.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Redina reiterated the Palestinians'
"clear and firm stand," which rejects re-negotiation of the
already agreed agreements, specially the re-deployment of Israeli
forces in the West Bank town of Hebron, safe passages between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, the freeze on settlement activities and
the release of Palestinian detainees from Israeli jails.
</P>

The meeting further reviewed contacts between the Palestinian
Authority and the Israeli government, efforts by Arab and other
foreign states, and ideas offered for a meeting between Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

A meeting was scheduled for today between the PLO Executive
Committee member Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu's top political
advisor Dore Gold, who are supposed to discuss prospects of a

<P>
KHARTOUM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese Interior
Ministry today confirmed that two people died and seven others
injured in mass riots over bread shortages in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Sudanese took to the streets in the capital of
Khartoum Sunday night to protest over the shortage of bread after
most bakeries in the city stopped work in the wake of a government
order on fixing the sale prices.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry statement deplored the incident, saying
that one of the two killed in the riots was a woman.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the first day for the fixed price to come into
effect, but most bakeries stayed closed, causing over-crowdedness
at the few bakeries that operated.
</P>
<P>
Unable to get the bread, angry masses marched in protest
against the shortage in various parts of the capital.

JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
circle today urged the government to take harsh measures to clamp
down on spiraling crime and restore law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical the government does not continue to encourage
the perception that more concern is being displayed for the
perpetrator of crimes than for the victims," said Joe Hlongwane,
president of the National African Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, told the 200 delegates at its 32nd conference.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting in the city of Durban today, Hlongwane
criticized the current criminal and justice systems in South
Africa for granting bail too easily and for lenient jail
sentences.
</P>
<P>
"The nothing-to-worry-about statements made by some political
leaders were not constructive in combating the rampant crime that
is engulfing the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi said crime and
lawlessness posed a serious threat to black empowerment and
growth.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, who is also leader of Inkatha Freedom Party, the
second largest party in the coalition government in Pretoria,
said he agreed with delegates that the continued influx of
illegal immigrants into South Africa is also threatening the
empowerment of black people.

JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of the
Palestinian population in Jerusalem amounts to 195,000, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Key foreign policy advisers
of U.S. President Bill Clinton met on Monday to review the

which Iraq announced was under way, a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, Secretary of State

Iraqi troops crossed the 36th parallel, designated by U.S.-led
allies as a "no fly" after the Gulf War in 1991, and captured the
Kurdish city of Irbil over weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has made it clear it was ready to
retaliate even as Saddam Hussein began withdrawing his troops from
the city to avoid a showdown with American forces.
</P>
<P>
White House deputy spokesman Jim Fetiz said there is evidence
the Iraqi army is ready to conduct more attacks in the eastern
part of northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM on Results of Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the results of
Sunday's election in Beirut here this evening, Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri attributed the crushing victory he and his
allies scored to the government's programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his allies won most parliamentary seats in
Sunday's election in Beirut, according to the results of the
third of Lebanon's five-phase general election which was
announced officially by Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr earlier
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Sunni prime minister and candidates in his "Beirut's
Decision" coalition won 14 out of the 19 seats allocated for the
capital, leaving four to oppositions and another to a
pro-government independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the polling was in favor of a certain path, a
certain way of work and a certain program," Hariri said, noting
that "the citizens were voting for this program, for this plan
and not for a certain person."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held upon the announcement of the
outcome of the election, Hariri stressed that every one, no
matter whether inside the parliament or outside it, can serve
the country and make contribution to public work.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his previous promise to the Beirutis to represent
them in the house, and expressed his readiness to cooperate with
those deputies not in his bloc.
</P>
<P>
On the defeat of a candidate of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in Sunday's election, the prime minister pointed
out that the resistance against the Israeli occupation on
Lebanon's lands "is not limited to a side or a party."
</P>
<P>
"All the people are resisting and the inhabitants in south
Lebanon are resisting," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called on the Lebanese people to denounce extremism and
to follow a moderate path.
</P>
<P>
After lossing one parliamentary seat when its incumbent
parliamentary deputy, Ali Ammar, was defeated in the first phase
of election in Mount Lebanon, another deputy of Hezbollah,
Mohammed Berjaoui, was also defeated in Sunday's election in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist group, which plays a role in the
resistance against Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon, has
remarkably eight seats in the current house, which was elected
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the multi-billionaire Hariri, 52,
rising from the south Lebanese port city of Saida, to
participate in the general election as both a candidate and
voter registered in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire prime minister has won popular support in
Lebanon for his ambitious post-war reconstruction projects to
enable Lebanon to regain its position as one of the economic and
trade centers in the Arab Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After the victory in the general election, Hariri will have a
dual-capacity as a deputy in the house and the prime minister of
the government.
</P>
<P>
There had been 92 candidates in Beirut competing for the 19
out of the total 128 seats in the half-Christian-half-Moslem
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The last two rounds of election will be held respectively in
south Lebanon on September 8 and in the Beqaa on September
15.

cooperation, noting that friendship and cooperation between the

its economic growth and improve living standard of its people, he
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> London Stocks Surge on Buoyant Oil Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
ended mixed today, with London recouping some recent losses on
buoyant oil shares while Frankfurt slipping on the absence of Wall
Street for a public holiday.
</P>
<P>
British shares surged 16.8 points and finished around their
best levels of the day although Wall Street is closed today for
the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
Buoyant oil shares following the United Nations' decision to
delay implementation of an oil-for-food deal after last weekend's
incursions by Iraqi troops into Kurdish areas helped the London
market regain some of its recent losses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a stronger-than-expected UK purchasing managers'
index today had little impact on the market although the data
dimmed hopes of another interest rates cut when the Chancellor and
the Bank of England governor hold their monthly monetary meeting
this Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed lower today after a lacklustre session.
Dealers blamed Wall Street's weakness last Friday and today's
absence of US markets for a holiday for the losses.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 share index ended 6.37 points higher as
shares posted modest gains in quiet trading during the day, helped
by firmer bonds and bullish oil stocks, although trade was also
hampered by a lack of domestic news and Wall Street's closure.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 16.8 points higher at 3,884.4. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended down 10.95 at 2,532.88. In Paris, the CAC-40

ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Last year was an especially

<HEADLINE> France Seizes 20 Tons of Cannabis, Arrests 4 Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- French police seized 20 tons of
cannabis drug from a clandestine drug distributing center in
Rouen, northern France, and arrested four drug traffickers last
week, said the French government today.
</P>
<P>
The operation, launched on August 30 by the Central Office of
Repression on Unlawful Trafficking of Drugs, was one of the
biggest drug busts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
French police were tipped by their Spanish and Colombian
colleagues before arresting four French, Belgian and Colombian
drug traffickers in a warehouse they rented for keeping and
distributing drugs.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were sent by the Cali drug cartel of Colombia on a
German cargo ship, Humbolt Express, which started from the Anvers
Islands in the South Pole and called at Havre, Belgium, before
stopping at Bilbao, Spain, on August 22.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, which are worth 200 million francs (40 million U.S.
dollars), were contained in a 24-ton container and packed in 850
plastic sacks.
</P>
<P>
The last drug bust in Europe took place on January 2, when
Spanish police seized 36 tons of hashish in the Spanish port of
Marin.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Co. Clarifies Oil Find Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A local company said
today research data indicated existence of rich petroleum
deposits at Mandawa valley in Lindi Region, but that the actual
location of the deposits would only be verified by test drilling.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by Tanzania Petroleum Development
Corporation (TPDC) Deputy Managing Director Salvator Ntomola said
the media gave the wrong impression that the oil deposits had
been verified in the county.
</P>
<P>
Some media covering preparations by a locally-registered firm,
Dublin International Petroleum (Tanzania) to drill two test wells
in Kilwa last weekend reported that deposits totalling 4.4
billion and 640 million barrels had been located at Mita-1 and
East Like-1 respectively in the Mandawa valley.
</P>
<P>
The TPDC deputy managing director said earlier study carried
out by BP, Shell and Dublin International indicated that much
petroleum may be found in the area, but stressed that the actual
deposits could only be discovered by test drilling.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Mita-1 area covering 125
square kilometers, will be tested by digging a 7,000-feet well,
while another well will be dug at East Lika-1 for testing
purposes as well.
</P>
<P>
"We have not discovered oil barrels, but there are prospects
of getting some whose quantity shall be known after the tests at
the two sites," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The well drilling program expected to start next month, is
estimated to cost 15 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
TPDC entered into agreement with the Dublin Company last July
for exploration of hydrocarbons (oil and gas).
</P>
<P>
The Dublin ccompany, according to Ntomola, will carry out
fresh study and re-process some of the data collected by the
previous studies by Shell and BP.

<HEADLINE> New Versions of Boeings Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing company today said
it has launched a new version of the 757 twinjet and is offering
for sale two new models of Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
said today that the stretched 757-300 and longer-range and
higher-capacity 747s are new and derivative Boeing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new 757-300 adds an important new member to
the 757/767 family -- one that offers lower operating costs while
retaining the important features and capabilities of 757.
</P>
<P>
The new 757 will offer about 20 percent more passenger capacity
than the 757-200. German holiday airline Condor Flugdienst is
planning to order up to 24 such airplanes.
</P>
<P>
For about a year, Woodard said Boeing has been working with
more than a dozen airlines in preliminary design and configuration
studies of two new 747s to join today's 420-passenger 747-400.
</P>
<P>
The 747-500X is an airplane capable of carrying 462 passengers
up to 10,000 miles -- 1,600 miles beyond today's 747-400 -- with
10 tons-plus of extra cargo capacity.
</P>
<P>
The 747-600X has seating for 548 passengers and a range of
about 8,900 miles.
</P>
<P>
Woodard noted that Boeing forecasts the need for nearly 16,000
airplanes over the next 20 years, worth more than 1 trillion U.S.
dollars. Of that total, he said, large airplanes (400 seats and
above) account for 18 percent of the total in terms of dollars and
only 7 percent in terms of units -- far less than either the
"single-aisle," 737-757 market or the "intermediate twin-aisle,"
767-777 market.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that the future belongs only to big
airplanes," Woodard said, explaining that the single-aisle and
intermediate twin-aisle segments each account for 41 percent of
the future market in delivery dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the market calls for a larger airplane, Boeing could develop
the 747-700X model.
</P>
<P>
"We could `re-body' the 747-600X with a wider fuselage, while
retaining the existing wing, systems, engines, struts and landing
gear," he explained. "The 747-700X would carry up to 650
passengers and have a design range equal to that of the 747-400."
</P>
<P>
"Our experience is that the cost to develop derivative
airplanes is substantially less than the cost of all-new
airplanes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Boeing is currently focusing on developing the
747-500X and -600X.

<HEADLINE> Dar University to Expand Student Enrollment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The University of Dar
es Salaam (UDSM) has decided to expand student enrollment and
start admitting privately-sponsored students this academic year.
</P>
<P>
Mattew Luhanga, vice-chancellor of the university, told a
press conference here today that the move is aimed at raising the
number of intellectuals in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania has already lagged behind regionally in the
number of students enrollment at the university level compared
with other Sub-Saharan countries.
</P>
<P>
The University of Dar es Salaam, the largest university in
Tanzania, has only 3,800 students. The East African country has a
population totalling 25.6 million.
</P>
<P>
But another East African country of Kenya has 50,000 students
in its five public universities and 200,000 students have been
receiving tertiary level education.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, which is also an East African country, Makerere
University alone had 7,000 students, despite its lower population
compared to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Luhanga said even a small country like Swaziland, with a
population of 800,000, had about the same number of university
students as Tanzania. Swaziland's university students account for
about 0.5 percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
"If Tanzania were to match Swaziland, it would have to
increase its university enrollment to 150,000 students for the
1996/97 academic year," said the vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"That would be an increase at about 17 to 18 times the current
number of university enrollment and yet we are not providing
enough resources for the very small enrollment we have at the
moment," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
According to Luhanga, 408 students will join the University of
Dar es Salaam, out of whom 310 have been admitted at the hill
under private sponsorship arrangements and the remaining 96 under
government sponsorship.

<HEADLINE> UN Freeze on Iraqi Crude Leads to Oil Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices rose sharply today
after the United Nations announced Sunday that it would delay
arrangements for limited oil sales by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in October
settled at 21.99 U.S. dollars per barrel, up 1.21 U.S. dollars, at
the International Petroleum Exchange, according to the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
"Oil prices will remain strong well into next year if the
freeze on Iraqi oil remains," the agency quoted Leo Drollas,
deputy-director of the Center for Global Energy Studies, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The revenues of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will increase by 2 billion U.S. dollars during the last
quarter of this year if the freeze stays in place, Drollas
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday announcement of the United Nations was in response
to Iraq's attack on a U.N.-policed safe haven in northern Iraq
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the United Nations struck a deal with Iraq,
which allows the latter to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months in order to buy food and medicine for its
people.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Disapproves US Military Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Apparently in disapproval of the
U.S. military action against Iraq early this morning, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that the use of force will not
undermine the Iraqi ruling regime, but the Iraqi people themselves
will suffer.
</P>
<P>
Amr Moussa said that the latest developments in Iraq will not
only affect the Iraqi people, but also shake regional stability.
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by Egypt's news agency MENA, Moussa said
that Egypt is following with great concern developments of the
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the U.S. announced that 27 cruise missiles
were launched at "selected air defense targets" in Iraq in
response to the Iraqi army's weekend attack on the Kurdish "safe
haven" established by U.S.-led forces after the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and 19 others wounded in the attack, a
statement issued by the General Command of the Iraqi Armed Forces
said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not specify the localities which were
targeted by the U.S. attacks, saying only that "the cowardly
missiles fired by the aggressors targeted civilian-populated areas
in the suburbs of our cities, a number of military positions
(posts) and residential buildings."
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated Egypt's call for maintaining Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the
U.N. should be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"We want the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution
986 under which Iraq is allowed to export limited amounts of oil
in exchange for food supplies," the foreign minister was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egypt stressed non-interference in Iraq's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the principles
and objectives of the U.N. Charter must be respected to ensure the
maintenance of Iraq's sovereignty and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Military moves and the use of force in both the north and south
of Iraq escalate tension in the country and the entire region and
jeopardize the lives of civilians, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> (updated)  Clinton Defenses U.S. Missile Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
justified his order to launch missiles at Iraq as "a strong
response" to Iraq's recent military movements in the northern part
of the country this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the White House, Clinton said that the limited
withdrawals announced by Iraq did not change the reality that its
troops still controls Arbil, and remain deployed for further
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"these acts demand a strong response, and they have received
one," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. objectives "are limited, but clear: To
make Saddam pay a price for the latest act of brutality, reducing
his ability to threaten his neighbors and America's interests."
</P>
<P>
The United States is extending "the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq," he said,
</P>
<P>
"This will deny Saddam's control of Iraqi airspace form the
Kuwaiti border to the southern suburbs of Baghdad, and
significantly restrict Iraq's ability to conduct offensive
operations in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the second objective of the U.S. action is "to
protect the safety of our aircraft enforcing this no-fly zone, our
cruise missiles struck Saddam's air defense capabilities in
southern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.N. plan to allow Iraq to sell amounts
of oil to purchase food and medicine for its people, including the
Kurds "cannot go forward", until the United States is sure these
humanitarian supplies can actually get to those who need them.
</P>
<P>
He described Iraq's actions in the past as "violence and
aggression", adding that the U.S. answer to that recklessness "
must be strong and immediate."
</P>
<P>
"We must reduce Iraq's ability to strike out at its neighbors,
and we must increase American's ability to contain Iraq over the
long run," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also reaffirmed his foreign policy that when the U.S.
interest and the security of its friends and allies is threatened,
"we will act with force if necessary."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that China's
current policy of openness and reform will not change.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a group of former US congressmen headed
by Louis Frey Jr., chairman of the US Association of Former
Members of Congress, Qian said that China will adhere to its
foreign policy of peace and independence, as well as the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, in order to create a peaceful
international environment for its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He described the so-called "China threat" as baseless, adding
that if China does not develop its economy, and 1.2 billion
Chinese people -- 22 percent of the world's population -- live in
poverty, and this will not be favorable to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to pursue normal and friendly Sino-US ties on the
basis of mutual respect, he said, adding that issue of Taiwan is
at the core of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The three Sino-US communiques mandated the principles that
should be followed to deal with the Taiwan issue, and both the US
administration and congress should keep to these principles.
</P>
<P>
Frey said that he was pleased to see the positive trend that
has recently appeared in US-Chinese ties, and that he is confident
that the future of US-Chinese relations will be very bright.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Considering to Raise Interest Rate, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) is considering to raise interest rates higher than expected
unless it sees clear signs of a slowing economy, The Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed would increase the key short-term interest rate, the
federal fund rate, as early as at its next policy-making meeting
on September 24 after analyzing a series of employment and
inflation indicators.
</P>
<P>
The report said that an interest rate hike would be as high as
one-half a percentage point which is twice what the markets and
many analysts are now expecting.
</P>
<P>
"We're at a critical juncture," the Journal quoted a Fed
official as saying. "We need to see more evidence of moderating
growth."
</P>
<P>
A second U.S. Fed official said that any rate increase "has to
be enough to be convincing" but would not likely to be the first
of a series.
</P>
<P>
The Fed is concerned that if labor markets tighten, rising
wages could outpace productivity growth and fuel inflation, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that government figures on unemployment and
payroll growth to be released this week and next week's consumer
and wholesale prices reports would be especially important to
Fed's decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in
the second quarter following a 2 percent pace in the first three
months. Latest government reports showed the economy is still
developing strongly although the Fed predicted it will slow down
in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed was divided on whether the short-term rates should
be increased in the past few months. Several Fed presidents have
been pushing for higher rates in recent months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If the rates are boosted, it would be the first such move since
early 1995, and the end of what officials have termed an
experiment with higher growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed cut the federal fund rate, the interest rate that
banks charge each other for overnight loans, for three times
between July 1995 and January 1996 to spur the slowing-moving U.S.
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of
leading economic indicators increased 0.2 percent in July to
103.1, its sixth straight monthly increase, said the Conference
Board today.
</P>
<P>
The New York based research institute reported that the leading
index increased 0.5 percent in June and 0.2 percent in May. Over
the six months from January to July, the index increased 2.7
percent, the research group said.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period through July, all eleven leading
economic indicators advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's calculations show that six of the eleven
leading economic indicators rose in July. The most significant
negative contributors to the composite leading index in July are
average factory workweek, stock prices, and vendor performance.
</P>
<P>
The index of coincident indicators and index of lagging
indicators, two other indexes designed by the Conference Board,
also increased by 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively,
showing a further increase in economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Solana: U.S. Attack on Iraqi "Justified" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana today said the U.S. attacks on Iraqi targets this morning
were "a justified, measured and proportionate reaction" to Iraq's
military operations against rebel Kurds inside the exclusion zone
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States action was a "clear message" for Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein that he should "immediately withdraw" his forces
from the exclusion zone, "stop any brutal attacks and comply fully
with the United Nations resolutions".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile raids, which lasted about 45 minutes, took
place in broad daylight, a few minutes after air raid sirens were
heard over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said up to 30 cruise missiles were launched.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, the Pentagon said, were launched from Navy ships
and at least one Air Force B-52 bomber, which was used to launch
similar missiles at the start of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Their "selected" targets were Iraq's defense installations,
including surface-to-air missile launch sites, radar installations
and air defense control towers.

BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and 19
others wounded today in the U.S. missiles attacks on Iraq, a
statement issued by the General Command of the Iraqi Armed Forces
said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a televised national address hours after the U.S. attacks,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called upon the Iraqi Armed
Forces to resist against U.S. aggression by attacking the planes
of the "aggressors" which violate its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president also announced that Iraq on longer
recognizes the no-fly zones imposed by the United Nations in the
south and north of the country, while downplaying the damage
incurred by the U.S. missile attacks against Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that most of the cruise missiles the U.S. launched
against the Iraqi areas at about 9:00 a.m. (local time) this
morning were shot down and destroyed. The attack caused only minor
damages, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president described the U.S. missile attacks as a
"cowardly" act, saying that the Iraqi government and people "are
steadfast and firm and as strong as reinforced pillars which
cannot be moved by the wind of evil."
</P>
<P>
"Fight, resist these aggressors and teach them a new
unforgettable lesson," Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces reportedly fired today 27 cruise missiles at
"selected Iraq air defense targets" in southern Iraq to punish
President Saddam Hussein for a weekend assault on Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Following the news of the U.S. missile attack, the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad remained calm and the traffic was normal. No
extraordinary measures have been seen here to prevent any
possible panic or chaos among the inhabitants.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today criticized the
United States for its military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A state-run radio said that Washington should act sooner to
prevent Saddam Hussein from attacking the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should undertake preventive actions to stop Iraq
from attacking the Kurds, it added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces fired 27 cruise missiles on the "selected defense
targets" in southern Iraq this morning in retaliation for Saddam
Hussein's weekend assault on Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
The radio noted that the U.S. attack did not serve the
interests of the Kurds because Americans have no desire to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian government kept silent today over the
U.S. operation and no official reaction was available for the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets with British Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that to maintain good
cooperation between China and Britain not only benefits bilateral
relations, but also the smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Jeremy Hanley here today, Qian said that the
improvement of bilateral ties is evidenced by British Deputy Prime
Minister Heseltine's visit to China in May and the current China
tour of British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Ian Lang.
</P>
<P>
Hanley noted that China's reform and opening-up, as well as the
subsequent economic development, are of great historical
significance. He said it is pleasing that relations between
Britain and China are withnessing rapid improvement, and said that
he hoped that this momentum would be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Hong Kong, Qian said China has no
intention of interfering in the administration of the British Hong
Kong government over Hong Kong before July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The measures that will be taken by the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administration Region after that date should also not
be bothered by interference from outside, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong entered a 13-year transition period
when China and Britain reached the joint declaration to revert
Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
It is a regrettable that during this period, many actions going
against the guidelines of the agreement have occurred and caused
problems, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the remaining period before the return of Hong
Kong -- more than 300 days -- a cautious attitude should be taken
in order to ensure a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Hanley said China and Britain share common interests and
responsibilities over the issue of Hong Kong, and the British side
will seek good bilateral cooperation to ensure a smooth transfer
of Hong Kong. Britain is also willing to develop its long-term and
broad-based cooperation with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hanley arrived here on Sunday at the invitation of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry. During his stay, he held talks with Chinese
Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan on bilateral relations and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Hanley also met with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council. Moreover, an exchange
of notes was conducted between the two countries on the mutual
establishment of consulates general.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today expressed worries about U.S. attack on Iraqi
targets, according to a television report.
</P>
<P>
The state-run IRIB television reported from Kenya that
Rafsanjani also expressed hope that the existing confrontations
in Iraq would come to an end.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces fired some 27 cruise missiles on what the Clinton
Administration called "selected air defense targets" in southern
Iraq in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's weekend attack against
Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president is on the first leg of his six-nation
African tour, which takes him to Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe,
Uganda and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran has so far kept
silent over the U.S. missile operation.
</P>
<P>
The state-run radio criticized the United States for the
military action against Iraq, saying that it should act sooner
to prevent the Iraqi army from attacking the Kurds.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Formation of Hong Kong SAR Provisional Legislature Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A proposed plan has been
worked out for the formation of the future provisional legislature
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted at the third session of the Provisional
Legislature Panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
SAR, held from September 2-3 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the future provisional legislative
council of the Hong Kong SAR shall be composed of Chinese citizens
from among the permanent Hong Kong residents who have no right of
residence in any foreign country, however, permanent Hong Kong
residents who are not of Chinese nationality and who have the
right of abode in a foreign country may also be elected as members
of the provisional legislature, but they will make up no more than
20 percent of the total of 60 councillors as decided by the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The provisional legislature will be elected by the Selection
Committee. Candidates for councillor must be at least 18 years old
and be permanent Hong Kong residents as prescribed in Article 24
of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
They must also support the Basic Law and be willing to pledge
loyalty to the Hong Kong SAR, the panel members said.
</P>
<P>
Members suggested that candidates should be nominated by the
Selection Committee members, and the nominees can become
candidates after their qualifications are approved by a meeting of
the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The election will be conducted by secret ballot, with winners
decided by the number of the votes they receive.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee will be responsible for the
nomination and the election, as well as for handling complaints.
</P>
<P>
Members also offered opinions on specific nomination issues,
the voting process, measures for securing the correct proportion
of the councillors who are not Chinese nationals and who have the
right of residence in foreign countries, and other matters.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan will be submitted to the fifth plenary
session of the Preparatory Committee, scheduled for early October,
for approval after examination, so that the work on the formation
of the provisional legislature can start timely once the Selection
Committee is formed.
</P>
<P>
The panel welcomes people in various sectors in Hong Kong to
continue to put forth their opinions and suggestions on matters
related to the the formation of the provisional legislature,
before the proposed plan is adopted.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee, said here today that Japan should take
the correct approach toward its history of aggression, so that it
can be better prepared for the future.
</P>
<P>
Meeting former Japanese Prime Minister Noburo Takeshita here
this afternoon, Li warned against the attempts of some Japanese
right-wingers who advocate militarism to "erase the history of
Japan's invasion of China."
</P>
<P>
"We must pay close attention to this trend," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman cited China and Japan as the neighbors who
have much in common in terms of history and culture, and said that
the two peoples have a long history of friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Since the forging of diplomatic ties more than two decades ago,
there has been marked progress in bilateral relations, and their
economic and trade cooperation, in particular, has maintained good
development movement, Li added.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some problems in bilateral relations
that should not be overlooked, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the war against China launched by Japanese
militarists half a century ago had brought great sufferings to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"It requires joint efforts from both the Chinese and Japanese
sides to heal the wounds deep in the hearts of the Chinese
people," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita said the past war had brought tragedy not only to the
people in Asian nations, but also to the Japanese people
themselves.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Japanese people, too, do not wish to see that
tragedy repeated, and are willing to develop Sino-Japanese
friendship on the basis of soul-searching about historical truths,
"which is not only in line with the wishes of the two peoples, but
is also beneficial to peace for mankind."
</P>
<P>
Takeshita was here for the "21st Century Forum," sponsored by
the CPPCC National Committee, to be held September 4-6.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Further Strikes Depend on Assessments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- United Statesd military
officers said today that Air Force B-52 bombers and two Navy ships
in the Persian Gulf launched 30 to 50 cruise missiles at air
defense targets in Iraq, in a military retaliation ordered by
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
They said the possibility of further strikes would depend on
damage assessments and on whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
would ease his attacks on the "no fly" zone, north of the 36th
parallel. Thne zone was proclaimed by the U.S.-led allies after
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Targets struck inside Iraq earlier today included
surface-to-air missile launch sites, radar installations and
command-and-control installations, a senior military officer
said. But no sites in Baghdad were targeted, he added.
</P>
<P>
The strike came after a hectic weekend, mixed campaigning with
international diplomacy and military preparations.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that Clinton had crossed swords with
Saddam. In 1993, Clinton ordered U.S. warships to fire 24 Tomahawk
cruise missiles at intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in
retaliation for an assassination plot against former
U.S. President George Bush.

BONN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Breaking hours of silence over
United States air raids on Iraqi targets this morning, Germany
expressed cautious support for the military action.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with German television, German Minister of
Foreign Affairs Klaus Kindel said the U.S. government informed
Germany of its plan before launching missile attacks on military
targets in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE: Profitable Gas Industry in Transition Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) is optimistic about a brisk natural
gas business for transition economies. It is prompted by growing
demand and promising returns for investment the industry badly
needs.
</P>
<P>
Gas demand would rise to 800 billion cubic meters by the year
2010, compared to 638 billion consumed in 1995 in the transition
economies, the Commission said in a press release issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called transition economies, represent the world's
largest gas market, accounting for 29 percent of the global
consumption in 1995. They also possesses 39 percent of the world's
total gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation alone boasts about 49,000 billion cubic
meters, or 33 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE expected economic growth and increasing
environmental concerns to lead to sustained long-term growth in
gas demand in the region, where gas consumption dropped steadily
from 785 billion cubic meters in 1990 when economic upheaval
started, to last year's 638 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Commission predicted a growing gas market share of total
primary energy needs. It said the region itself should reinforce
its role as a leading gas exporter, increasing exports to central
and western Europe and the emerging markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It said growth in gas demand and exports would require
development of gas infrastructure. Meanwhile, investment was
needed to finance new production, transportation, storage and
interconnection projects.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Yamal-Europe project linking the gas-rich
Yamal Peninsula to Europe, through Belarus and Poland, would
require a total of 36 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) should play a fundamental role
in the future, the Commission said. After six years of economic
transition, most countries in the region had attracted only small
volumes of FDI, falling far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the huge gas potential of the region, the gas industry
there has not yet been receiving its fair share of the investment
capital it so badly needs", said an official of the UN/ECE's Gas
Center.
</P>
<P>
The Commission blamed this on the investment risk perceived as
a result of the incomplete restructuring and reform in the region,
and on reluctance of the governments to privatize the energy and
gas industry which they viewed as a strategic sector of economy.
</P>
<P>
In transition economies, FDI has been improving slowly over the
past few years, from accounting for one percent of the global
total in 1992, to three percent in 1993 and five percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets With Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chineses People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here today that the Chinese government
attaches importance to its relations with the United States, and
hopes to build good bilateral ties with it.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with former US Secretary of State Dr. Henry
Kissinger, who was invited to attend the "21st Century Forum" to
be held tomorrow, Li expressed his hope that Kissinger will
express his views fully at the forum, which includes discussions
on issues of international common concern, and turn-of-the-century
development trends of Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the forum should contribute to the peace and
development of Asia and the world in the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Dr. Kissinger for his special contributions to the
development of Sino-US relations, saying that relations between
China, the largest developing country, and the US, the largest
developed nation, not only concern the interests of both
countries, but will also have impact on the world situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a sober estimate of the achievements we have made
and the problems we have confronted," Li said. "We should strive
for a peaceful international environment in a bid to concentrate
on economic construction."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, China has no intention to be at odds with
any other countries, but instead wants to advance its friendly
relations with all countries in the world, including the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that Dr. Kissinger's positive influence will
continue to make new contributions to the development of bilateral
relations, and also to the increased understanding of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said the two countries should get along well with
each other, noting that the policy of "containing China" will go
nowhere and is completely erroneous.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see that more and more Americans have
realized that sound, smooth U.S.-China relations are in the best
interests of the U.S. This is of major significance for the peace
and prosperity of the 21th century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger also said that he is willing to go on contributing
his share to the further development of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Gives Banquet to Welcome Forum Attendants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The tremendous progress
achieved in science, technology and economic globalization have
allowed countries to forge even closer relations, which are
characterized by interaction, interdependence and mutual restraint.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remarks in Beijing this evening during a dinner speech for guests
attending the 21st Century Forum sponsored by the CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said there are many questions of universal concern, most
notably if an international environment that is favorable for
national development can be created; if the host of major problems
facing mankind as a whole can be reasonably resolved; if the world
can continue to make coordinated and sustainable development; and
if the correct direction of development of human society can be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Before tackling these problems, a sober analysis and assessment
of the realities facing countries must be made, and farsighted
vision for the future should be realized based on facts, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In convening this high-level academic meeting, Li said he
wished that well-known specialists and scholars throughout the
world will exchange views on broad issues concerning major trends
in world development, and also a number of key issues typical to
this period of time.
</P>
<P>
They should keep in mind the need to promote mutual
understanding, friendship and cooperation, and make a common
contribution to a peaceful, stable and more prosperous new
century, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, China needs an
international environment of lasting peace in order to focus on
its economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a coalition of all political parties, organizations,
representatives of all ethnic groups and people of all circles,
and as a body of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation in China's political system, CPPCC has an abiding
interest in cultivating friendly relations and cooperation with
people from other countries, so that it can play an active role in
safeguarding world peace and progress, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the guests will speak out freely in order
to make intellectual contributions to the future of mankind and
also to aid China's own development.
</P>
<P>
Present at the banquet were Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister
of Singapore; Noboru Takeshita, former PM of Japan; Helmut
Schmidt, former federal chancellor of Germany; and Henry Kissinger
and George Shultz, who each have served as US Secretary of State.

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Great potential exists for
long-term, stable and friendly cooperative ties between China and

Schmidt said that German leaders are willing to maintain and
develop good economic and political relations with China. He hoped
that some difficulties existing in bilateral relations will soon

is bright.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian government
has arrested four people, including two senior aides of the
country's first president, Mamuzu Banda, on charges of conspiracy
and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
They are treasurer-general of the Malawi Congress Party John
Tembo, former government hostess Cecilia Kadzamira, a retired
police officer, and Mr. Tembo's son, the Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state radio said today the arrests follow the detention
two years ago of three men, including journalist Chimwemwe
Mputahelo, who are said to have confessed to being implicated in
the charges.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's inspector-general of police Patrick Chikapa said the
alleged confessions have prompted fresh investigations into the
murder and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tembo and Mr. Kadzamira, who were the right-hand aides of
Malawi's former president, were earlier cleared and set free by
the country's high court.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Justifies U.S. Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton said this morning that the U.S. missile attack on
Iraq was designed as an "answer" to Iraq's recent military actions
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a prepared statement at his White House Oval Office,
Clinton said: "We must make it clear that reckless acts have
consequences."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the missiles were sending a message to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that he must pay a price when he
threatened his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and two Navy ships in the Gulf
launched 27 cruise missiles at military targets in southern Iraq
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action was taken after the reported withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Irbil, a city in the exclusion zone, under
United Nations protection since the end of 1990-91 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi troops had moved to the city a few days earlier to
support one Kurdish faction against others.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Iraqi withdrawal was limited, that the troops
still controlled Irbil and the withdrawn troops were threatening
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"The present deployments and the things we have seen convince
me that at least he (Saddam Hussein) is maintaining the potential
to take further military action in the area," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Troops Movement Toward Sulaimaniya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Taraq Aziz today denied reports on troops movement toward the
northern Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, 400 kilometers north of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency INA, Aziz said that
such claims have not been confirmed by anybody and it was "one of
the silly excuses used by America, the master of lies and
distortion, to launch its cowardly attack on Iraq today."
</P>
<P>
He said that Sulaimaniya controlled by the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani, one of the two rival
Kurdish factions, was not originally within the plan by the Iraqi
military to support the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) headed by
Masoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the Iraqi military operation was "limited and
successful" and Iranian agents supporting the PUK had been driven
out of the city of Irbil. Tehran blames Washington and Baghdad for
the flareup of violence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi forces had started to return to their previous
positions and the whole withdrawal would be finalized today, said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Since the KDP and PUK signed a ceasefire agreement in 1994, the
two factions have been locked in a series of fightings over the
revenues of transit trade through the Iraqi Kurdistan autonomous
region. The western allies led by the U.S. created a safety haven
in the area to provide protection for the Kurdish people in 1991 in
defiance of Iraqi government's opposition.
</P>
<P>
the Iraqi deputy prime minister ridiculed the U.S. policy and
said that the latest missile attacks against Iraq would in no way
impair Iraq's resolve and its decision to protect its people and
defend its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Another statement read over Baghdad TV later today said that 27
U.S. cruise missiles fired today at southern Iraq killed five
people and wounded 19 others including 11 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the General Command of the armed forces said a
unspecified number of houses were also destroyed but it did not
mention where the U.S. missiles struck.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Calls on Iraqi Army to Resist US Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today called upon the Iraqi Armed Forces to resist against
U.S. aggression by attacking the planes of the "aggressors" which
violate its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president also announced that Iraq on longer
recognizes the no-fly zones imposed by the United Nations in the
south and north of the country.
</P>
<P>
This came after U.S. cruise missiles attacked what Washington
termed as "selected military targets" in Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a televised national address, Saddam said that most of the
cruise missiles the U.S. launched against the Iraqi areas at about
9:00 a.m. (local time) this morning were shot down and
destroyed. The attack caused only minor damages, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president described the U.S. missile attacks as a
cowardly act, saying that that the Iraqi government and people
"are steadfast and firm and as strong as reinforced pillars which
cannot be moved by the wind of evil."
</P>
<P>
He said that as from today Iraq does not recognize the no-fly
zones in both south and north of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Right from now, (we) consider their damned vague lines north
of 36 parallel and south of 32 parallel as canceled and (there
are) no more existing," he said, adding that the Iraqis will hit
with efficiency any target of the aggressors' planes which violate
the airspace of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Following the news of the U.S. missile attack, the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad remained calm and the traffic was normal. No
extraordinary measures have been seen here to prevent any
possible panic or chaos among the inhabitants.

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua)-- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton wound up nine days of campaigning with two
Labor Day celebrations in Wisconsin, trying to appeal to moderate
voters and Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
-- Bob Dole opened his fall campaign by describing the race as
a choice between "old-style liberalism" and a conservative vision
that would roll back the Government.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraqi troops pulled back from the northern Kurdish city of
Erbill, United Nations officials said, but the Clinton
Administration reiterated its vow to punish President Saddam
Hussein for the incursion.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- College dormitories have been hotbeds of many wild trends
over the years, from gold-fish-gulping to acid-tripping, but one
recent campus phenomenon is strikingly un-wild -- the rising
popularity of drug-, alcohol- and tobacco-free dormitories.
</P>

should move to drive inflation lower.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Explain Its Car Policy to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is ready to explain
its national car policy to the World Trade Organization (WTO) if
Japan takes the issue to the world body in the near future, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We will explain the background for the issuance of the
policy," Minister of Trade and Industry Tunky Ariwibowo said in
response to Japan's plan to officially raise the issue to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Tsutomu
Makino reportedly said that he would question Indonesia at the WTO
regarding the preferential treatment it gives to the import of
components of Timnor cars from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 CC sedan car is manufactured by Indonesia's national
car producer Pt. Timor Putra Nasional (TPN) in cooperation with
South Korea's Kia Motors.
</P>
<P>
The government introduced the car policy in February this year,
which exempts local producers of a national car from import duties
and luxury taxes that add about 60 percent to the car price in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Under the car policy which would eventually require a
60-percent local production content, only Pt. TPN qualified for
the exemptions.
</P>
<P>
According to Makino, the special treatment given to Pt. TPN
violates WTO rules as it is discriminatory in nature.
</P>
<P>
Tunky said Indonesia will give the WTO the same explanations it
has already given to Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has studied the national car policy
well before it was issued under the presidential instruction No.2
1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Tunky, the car policy is very important for the
development of Indonesia's automotive industry.

U.S. forces reportedly fired 27 cruise missiles on Iraq today

<HEADLINE> France: Iraq Has Not Violated U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- France said today that Iraq had
violated no United Nations resolutions in launching attacks on
rebel Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said: "We
don't see that the resolutions of the U.N. have been jeopardized
by the Iraqi actions."
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the excuse used by the United States to
launch missile attacks on military targets in southern Iraq this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said the raids were in retaliation for the violation
by Iraq of the "No Fly" zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said: "Iraq is in its home anywhere and this
intervention (in northern Iraq) followed a request written in
black and white by one of the most important Kurdish movements."
</P>
<P>
He said France was "attached to the sovereignty of Iraq in the
framework of internationally recognized frontiers."
</P>
<P>
He said France wished to see that the U.N. Oil for Food program
for Iraq was applied as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But, he also said, France "understands that, for security
reasons, this plan could be delayed because of military actions in
northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the French foreign ministry expressed worry over the
situation in the Gulf region after the U.S. air raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, France's extreme rightist Front
National party Tuesday expressed its "total solidarity" with the
Iraqi people, saying that the U.S. raid "above all dishonors
American politicians."
</P>
<P>
"Bill Clinton, who ducked military service during the Vietnam
War yesterday, did not hesitate today to hit a country to its
knees and let innocent civilians pay for the prize for his
electoral ambitions," said Front National in a communique.

independent foreign policy, safeguarding their national
sovereignty, maintaining national stability, enhancing national
unity and improving people's livelihood through economic
development, the premier said.

<P>
These achievements have also contributed to the stability and
development of Africa, he added.
</P>

between countries according to the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence. He said that all countries, big or small, rich or
poor, are equal members of the international community and the
people of all countries have the right to choose their political
system and development mode in line with their conditions, without
foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
China wishes to strengthen cooperation with Equatorial Guinea
and other developing countries in international affairs, he said.

Equatorial Guinean people greatly treasure their friendship with
the Chinese people, and deem the Chinese as their most reliable
friends, he said.

invest in Equatorial Guinea in order to expand the economic links
between the two countries.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that the missile attack by the United
States on Iraq this morning is against the principle of justice.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think such reaction (the U.S. missile attack),
particularly during the (presidential) election year in the U.S.,

Anwar said that Malaysia has always advocated continued

unilateral action by one country against another.

He said that Malaysia will make known its official stand on the

Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said that the U.S., as a major power, should not resort to such

he told reporters after closing the China-Asia forum here.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Tallest Building on Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China will have the world's
tallest building by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 100-storey skyscraper complex will climb 1499 feet to
become a new landmark in Chongqing, a large city and business
center in west China's Sichuan Province. It will inch its way
above the current world's highest building, a still unopened
structure in Malaysia, by just 23 feet.
</P>
<P>
But its dizzy-days with its head in the clouds will be short
lived for the Chongqing tower block. Work is soon to start on an
even bigger giant, a 140-storey building in booming Guangzhou,
capital city of south China's Guangdong Province. That
cloud-buster is expected to be completed by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a 68-storey steel-structured building,
Diwang (King of the Land), in Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong
Province will be completed before the end of this year. It will be
the fourth-tallest building in the world.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese capital is not being left out of the
high-building stakes. A 118-storey building, to be called Reform
Building, is to be built in Beijing by the Land Group of China.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Criticizes Iraqi Troops' Attacks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said today that the Iraqi troops
attacks on the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)-controlled city
of Irbil has led to the U.S. military operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said, "We never supported Saddam's aggression and we
will not be supporting it at any time. We have always made that
very clear."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ciller as saying that
"according to information I received from President Clinton, the
situation has taken on a new dimension with the U.S. intervention
against 16 targets."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. this morning launched cruise missiles attacks against
selected air defense targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that she had told Clinton that the military
operation against Iraq should not damage Turkey's fight against
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for
self-rule in the southeast of Turkey since August 1984 and over
21,000 people have been killed in the conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels since then.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said Turkey is playing an active role in protecting the
base of peace and civilians in this region and in removing the
civilians to other areas, adding that Turkey will continue to
play this role.
</P>
<P>
She said that she did not receive a U.S. request for using
Incirlik air base in Adana, southern Turkey, from which the
U.S.-led allied forces attacked the military targets in northern
Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> China's Membership in WTO Crucial: Malaysian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today that China's
membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is crucial.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is inextricably linked to the international
trading system.... Being the 11th largest trading nation in the
world, China's membership in the WTO is therefore crucial," he
said at the closing ceremony of a two-day China-Asia forum here.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged like-minded countries to thwart attempts to
include issues like labor rights, human rights, good governance
and environment in the work of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said that the WTO should not allow the above issues to be
used as a pretext for trade protectionism and that the
organization should concern itself only with those matters
directly related to international trade.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Asia Pacific region is undergoing a "rigorous
and dynamic" economic transformation, the minister said that the
Chinese economy, with its impressive growth rates, is contributing
significantly to this economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the constantly changing international political
environment, it is essential for Malaysia and China to promote
consultation and cooperation in a spirit of mutual respect and
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
"We both share a common aspiration to achieve and maintain
peace and stability in our region and a desire to establish even
closer bonds between the countries in this part of the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that Asia would continue to be the
fountainhead of economic vitality and dynamism in the world in the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Internal Debt Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's internal debt has
swelled following its continued borrowing from the banking system
to meet short-term expenditure requirements, according to the
statistics of the Bank of Zambia today.
</P>
<P>
It marked an increase in the government borrowing from 99.294
billion Kwacha (about 83 million U.S. Dollars) in July to 168.911
billion Kwacha (about 141 million U.S. Dollars) by the first week
of August.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the depletion of government assets at the
Bank of Zambia where its current account position recorded an
overdraft of 11.527 billion Kwacha (about 9.6 million U.S.
Dollars) from deposits of 32.313 billion Kwacha (about 27 million
U.S. Dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to continue borrowing domestically
as long as donors withhold their funds, but this may affect
negatively the productive sector and the economy because the more
money there is in circulation, the higher the possibility of
creating an inflationary economy.

KUWAIT CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has expressed

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hariri, Biggest Winner in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Although there are still two
rounds to be held before Lebanon's 1996 general elections wind up,
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri has appeared to be the biggest
winner as he will head a largest bloc in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his allies won most parliamentary seats in Sunday's
election in Beirut, the third of the five-phase general elections
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Sunni prime minister and candidates in his "Beirut's
Decision" alliance won 14 of 19 seats allocated for the capital,
leaving four to oppositions and another to a pro-government
independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hariri got 78,714 votes, the highest among all other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his election victory after the official results
were announced, the billionaire-turned premier said that the
outcome showed that the people support his "policy and approach."
</P>
<P>
Hariri repeated his previous promise to the Beirutis to
represent them in the house, and expressed his readiness to
cooperate with deputies of all sides in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
His victory showed that the prime minister has achieved his
declared aim of forging a strong parliamentary bloc that might
end up with a total of 24 members after seven candidates in the
alliance won in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
This would make him the most-favored candidate to form a new
government following the general elections and enable him to steer
more easily through the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a majority of the pro-government deputies in the
next half-Christian, half-Moslem parliament can now be safely
anticipated since pro-government candidates have won some 60 of
the 82 seats in the first three rounds of the election.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 46 of the totally 128 seats will be decided in
the fourth and fifth rounds, to be respectively held in southern
Lebanon on September 8 and in the Beqaa on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's constitution says the president should be a Maronite
Catholic, the house speaker a Moslem Shiite and the prime
minister a Moslem Sunni.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers do not expect a change in the present
three top leaders, or "Troika," after the election.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hariri, Biggest Winner in Lebanon's General Elections (II) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main losers were the Moslem fundamentalists, who have lost
four seats in the first three rounds of elections which have been
held.
</P>
<P>
Only one candidate of the Sunni fundamentalist group of Jamaa
Al-Islamiya, Khaled Dhaher, gained a seat in the second round in
northern Lebanon on August 25.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, three fundamentalist groups lost three seats in the
house, one for the pro-Syrian Sl-Ahbash, a Sunni religious
organization, one for the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah, and one
for the Jamaa Al-Islamiya.
</P>
<P>
This was the second blow for Hezbollah, or Party of God, after
its incumbent parliamentary deputy, Ali Ammar, was defeated in
the first round in Mount Lebanon on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The militant group, which plays a role in the fighting against
the Israeli occupation of a strip in south Lebanon, has eight
seats in the present parliament, which was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The losses seemed to confirm Hariri's earlier remark that the
election battle was between "extremists" and "moderates."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hezbollah's defeat in Sunday's election in the
capital, the prime minister pointed out that the resistance
against the Israeli occupation on Lebanon's lands "is not limited
to a side or a party."
</P>
<P>
"If a party or its representative lost in an electional
constituency, that does mean a loss of the resistance," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called on the Lebanese people to denounce the extremism
and to follow a moderate path "because Lebanon is a country unable
to live in the extremism."
</P>
<P>
The billionaire prime minister has won the support in Lebanon
for his ambitious post-war reconstruction plan, which will
rehabilitate the country's position as one of the economic and
trade centers in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After the victory in the general elections, Hariri will have a
dual-capacity as a deputy in the house and the prime minister in
the government.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competitions are expected in the last two rounds of
election in south Lebanon and in the Beqaa after the two main
rival Shiite groups, the Amal Movement of House Speaker Nabih
Berri and Hezbollah, failed to map out a joint list of candidates
in the two constituencies.

"Our new vision is for Singapore to possess world-class science
and technology capabilities in areas that best support our key
industries and spur the growth of new high value-added
industries," said Minister For Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong
when unveiling the plan.
</P>
<P>
"We have finalized the new five-year National Science and
Technology Plan, which we are calling NSTP2000. NSTP2000 will
involve a government outlay of four billion Singapore dollars
(about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars)," Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it might take Singapore 10 to 15 years to achieve
this vision. "But we are prepared to begin our tasks today, and
take bold steps towards this vision," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) said that the
development of a strong science and technology capability will
support the restructuring and upgrading of Singapore's existing
industry and business clusters, and pre-position Singapore for new
emerging industry clusters.
</P>
<P>
The vision is for Singapore to build a world-class science and
technology base in fields that match Singapore's competitive
strengths and that will spur the growth of new high value-added
industries, said the NSTB.
</P>
<P>
It said that Singapore aims to achieve leadership or
near-leadership by the year 2000 in key technologies supporting
industry clusters where there is already a significant competitive
and technological edge.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: HK's Economy Fosters Bright Prospects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is
fostering bright prospects despite the fact that its economic
growth rate has slowed down in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the August update of the economic forecasts for
1996 recently issued by the Hong Kong government, the overall
gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow by 4.7 percent in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the figure is below the growth rate of five
percent forecast earlier, but it does not mean a beginning of a
new recession.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the slowing pace in Hong Kong economic growth
has nothing to do with the potential of the territory's economy on
the whole, which is expected to be further boosted in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
According to their analysis, the slow pace of Hong Kong's
economic growth resulted from the effects of the slowdown in its
external trade in the first half of 1996, which was more abrupt
than initially expected and led directly to weaker overall
economic growth during the period.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong's total export
growth registered 4.4 percent, down from the 18.2 percent growth
in the same period in 1995, while total imports growth also fell
to 3.1 percent from 15 percent of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hong Kong's GDP growth rate touched a low of 3.1
percent in the first quarter before it rebounded in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the downward trend in Hong Kong's external trade growth,
economists of the Standard Chartered Bank pointed out that the
slowdown of the economic growth is the result of Hong Kong moving
further towards services-based economy.
</P>
<P>
They said that it reflects the increase in manufacturing and
cargo handling capabilities of the Chinese mainland, which makes
it unnecessary for such cargo to go through any further processing
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
An expert of Salomon Brothers, one of the world's leading
investment banks, said that due to a slowdown in intra-regional
trade in Asia, a slowdown in exports has been recorded in many
economies including Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and
Singapore in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Freris, Salomon's chief regional economist, said that
the current decline in export growth in the Asian economies
reflects a series of cyclical developments and there is no
evidence of common trends pointing to a long-term loss of external
competitiveness in the economies.

<TEXT>
<P>
In fact, the latest report from the Census and Statistics
Department shows that by the end of July, the value of Hong Kong's
total export growth picked up by 4.9 percent over the same period
of last year, rising a 0.5 percentage point over the June's
figure.
</P>
<P>
As far as other sectors are concerned, the cyclical
developments are becoming increasingly favorable.
</P>
<P>
The property market, one of the pillar sectors in Hong Kong's
economy, is on recovery. A total of 67,445 sale and purchases
agreements of building units were lodged in Hong Kong in the first
six months of this year, representing increases of 43.5 percent and
36 percent respectively over the figures recorded in the second
half of 1995 and the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of the considerations involved in the sales
and purchases, amounting to 185.42 billion HK dollars (23.92
billion US dollars), indicated increases when compared with the
first as well as second half year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales are on rise while inflation declines. Retail sales
from January to June this year rose five percent in value and 0.4
percent in volume over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price
index (CPI A), rose by an average of 6.5 percent in the first half
of this year, which was significantly slower than the increases of
9.3 percent in the first half and 8.1 in the second half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
As for the labor sector, labor market conditions continued to
improve in recent months. The seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate edged lower to 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 1996 and
2.9 percent in the three months ending July, from 3.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1995 and 3.2 percent in the first quarter of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the local stock market had turned more active since
the beginning of 1996, with daily turnover in the first half of
1996 averaged at five billion HK dollars (645.16 million US dollars),
52 percent higher than that in 1995. The Hang Seng Index closed by
the end of June at 11,020, 947 points or 9.4 percent higher than
at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Hong Kong's financial sector was stable. In
the first half of this year, most of the banks listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange achieved a 25 percent increase in their
profits, which is higher than the forecast.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the total assets
of exchange fund stood at 485 billion HK dollars (62.5 billion US
dollars) by July, an increase of 5.3 percent over the amount by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong still provides a competitive advantage to overseas
firms which are on steady increase. The number of newly-opened
overseas firms increased by 12 percent to 324 in the first half of
this year over a year ago. The total number of overseas-funded
enterprises now exceeds 4,500.
</P>
<P>
Based on the positive factors, economists held that there is no
need to worry about the slowdown in Hong Kong's current economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Hong Kong's GDP is expected to pick up
further in the coming months and Hong Kong's economy is fostering
bright prospects in the future.

BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein today announced he would no longer recognize a United
Nations-sanctioned ban on Iraqi military in northern and southern
Iraq, while downplaying the damage incurred by the U.S missile
attacks against Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, pay no attention to damned imaginary no-fly
zones above the 36th parallel and below the 32nd parallel,"
Saddam told his armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech hours after the U.S. missile attacks,
Saddam said Iraq's air defense forces had shot down a large
number of U.S. missiles, adding that the attacks had caused
"minimal damage."
</P>
<P>
He said he had instructed his forces to ward off any flying
target in Iraq's airspace.
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S. attacks as "a cowardly act hiding behind
technological progress," Saddam urged Iraqi military to "drive
back aggression" and teach the Western allies a new lesson.
</P>
<P>
"Fight, resist these aggressors and teach them a new
unforgettable lesson," Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Washington, the
U.S. launched this morning 27 cruise missiles at "selected air
defense targets" in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton ordered the strike in retaliation for Iraqi
troops' assault at the Kurdish city of Irbil, the largest city in
the allied protected "no-fly" zone established in northern Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> HK Museum Attendance "Pitiful": Urban Councilor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Museum of Art
has been blamed for giving local art a bad showing and for failing
to meet the cultural appetite of the local residents, an Urban
Councilor claimed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ada Wong Ying-kay said that public attendance at the museum was
"pitiful considering we spend so much money on it," local
English-language newspaper "South China Morning Post" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The museum witnessed a sharp drop in attendance since moving
from the City Hall to the Cultural Center in 1991. Last year's
figure of visitors was 140,000, against 300,000 a year before.
And a bigger budget of 68 million HK dollars (8.7 million U.S.
dollars) was registered last year.
</P>
<P>
A survey commissioned by the council has found that those who
visit the museum are giving local contemporary art a miss -- only
25 percent said Hong Kong art was a motivating factor, and 16
percent said they were no wiser about the local art scene after
reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people are dissatisfied with the variety of Hong
Kong art," said Wong. "We also want to know why people find it
boring to go to the museum."
</P>
<P>
Of 955 people surveyed at the museum, only one in three said
they would return.
</P>
<P>
But the average working person was giving the museum a miss,
according to the survey. In the space of a month, only 23.1
percent of visitors were from the working population.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 30 percent of visitors were tourists, 34.9
percent students, 9.6 percent retired and 2.6 percent jobless.
</P>
<P>
Of the working people who visited the museum, 24.2 percent were
professionals or upper-middle managers, and only 8.9 percent
lower-grade workers, the survey found.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Councillor Abu
Zayad today strongly condemned the U.S. missile attacks against
Iraq as a crime that would affect adversely Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
This is the first reaction from the Palestinians, after Israel
expressed support for the U.S. military actions.
</P>
<P>
Zayad, member of the 88-seat Palestinian Council, told Israel
Radio that U.S. President Bill Clinton was using the military
attacks to win the incoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the military operation as "another crime" against
the Iraqi people by the U.S., saying that the Palestinian public
was enraged by this action.
</P>
<P>
Zayad also warned that the attacks would affect negatively the
Middle East peace process and relations between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy warships and Air Force B-52 bombers fired some two
dozens of cruise missiles into southern Iraq this morning in
response to the Iraqi military attacks against the Kurdish city of
Irbil in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has expressed support for the military
operation, and saw no threat from Baghdad as a result of the
missile attacks. It said that it was following the situation
closely and would take actions if necessary. During the 1991 Gulf
war, Israel came under Iraq's Scud missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has not yet made any
statement on the U.S. military attacks at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf war, PLO leader Yasser Arafat, now the PNA
president, took side with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, a
position that has cost him dearly.

<P>
The existing bilingual on-train announcements, in English and
Guangdonghua (Guangzhou dialect), were formally done verbally by
drivers. They were digitalized with a female voice three years

</P>

The taped system might be due for updating and customers and

CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today strongly condemned the U.S. missile
attack on targets in Iraq early this morning.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the attack was a violation of the
sovereignty of an Arab League member state, an intervention in its
internal affairs and a breach of international law.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing foreign intervention in northern Iraq, Abdul-Meguid
said that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
He said the military action will only lead to further
escalation of the tension there and jeopardize the regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Pentagon announced early today that cruise
missiles were launched at "selected air defense targets" in Iraq
in response to the Iraqi army's weekend attack on the Kurdish

</P>
<P>
Negm said that the U.S. attack targeted Iraq's civilian and

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames US for Conflict in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran has accused the United
Stated of being the real cause of the conflict in northern
Iraq and insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahomud Mohammadi said that
Iran was closely following up the development in the area,
according to the official news agency IRNA today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that the crisis in northern Iraq
could only be settled through peaceful means and the crisis could
not possibly be resolved through military operation.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the world community of the sudden surge of Kurdish
refugees to Iran in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the military operation against the Kurds
in northern Iraq would end up in useless massacre, unwarranted
influx of refugees and forced migration of the masses to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman outright rejected Iran's intervention in the
present conflict, saying that the cooperation between Turkey,
Syria and Iran was the best solution to the crisis of the
northern sector of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if any incursion of anti-Iran groups from the
Iraqi territory into the territory of Iran takes place, it will be
met with severest possible military measure.

<HEADLINE> Dole Supports Missile Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole today voiced his support for U.S.
missile strikes on selected Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered
the attack early in the morning, Dole expressed his hope that the
attack "marks the beginning of decisive action" by the Clinton
administration to end Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's "defiance
of the world community."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy ships and Air Force B-52s in the Gulf region have
launched at least 27 missiles--14 Tomahawks and 13 cruise
missiles--on Iraq in alleged retaliation against the capture of a
Kurdish stronghold by Iraqi troops, U.S. news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goal in Iraq should be to force Iraq to withdraw
troops from northern Iraq, release Kurdish prisoners and halt
interference with the Kurds, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Republican candidate has been waging intense
campaigns for the November 5 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Dole has repeatedly criticized Clinton for his "weak
leadership" in punishing Iraq, which both the U.S. government and
the Republican-controlled Congress have described as "sponsor of
international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Dole, former U.S. Senate majority leader, is expected to expand
his remarks on the situation in Iraq after U.S. attacks in a
speech later today to a convention of the American Legion, the
country's largest veterans' organization.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses Non-Interference in Iraq's Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today stressed
non-interference in Iraq's internal affairs and said that Iraq's
sovereignty and the integrity of its territories must be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the principles
and objectives of the U.N. Charter must be respected to ensure the
maintenance of Iraq's sovereignty and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the U.S. missile attacks on targets in Iraq
early this morning, the spokesman said that Egypt is following up
with deep concern the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Military moves and the use of force in both the north and south
of Iraq escalate tension in the country and the entire region and
jeopardize the lives of civilians, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt calls for the full respect of U.N. Security Council
resolutions and appeals to the parties concerned to adopt stances
that are consistent with international legitimacy, in a bid to put
an end to the causes of tension and spare Iraqis, Arabs and Kurds
alike, further woes and casualties," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Early today, the Pentagon announced cruise missiles were
launched at "selected air defense targets" in Iraq in response to
the Iraqi army's weekend attack on the Kurdish "safe haven"
established by U.S.-led forces after the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, John Shalikashvili, chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert Pelletreau, assistant
secretary of state for Middle East affairs, met with officials in
Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt before the U.S. attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The lightning tour by the U.S. officials was very probably
aimed at seeking support from these Arab states for the
U.S. military action.

PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- France maintained silence this
morning after U.S. armed forces raided Iraq with cruise missiles
to punish Saddam Hussein for violating the "no-fly" zone in

in the northern provinces of Iraq."

LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has denounced a report
of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) which indicates
worsening human rights violations in the country, saying ICJ is
not qualified to question the country's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The Gzneva-based ICJ group last week released a 239-page
report, describing the political situation in Nigeria as
"appalling".
</P>
<P>
The report urged the military government to abrogate
immediately all its executive devices which violate international
human rights norms and calling for the abolition of all military
tribunals.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Nigerian government said it is not under any
obligation to respect ICJ's decision.
</P>
<P>
The group is not an international organization of which
Nigeria is a member, Auwalu Yadudu, legal adviser to the head of
state, said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UN has sent seasoned human rights advocates who made their
observations and did not reach the conclusion as the ICJ, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A UN fact-finding team visited Nigeria in April and its
reports later submitted to the Secretary-General is believed to
be in favor of Nigeria and has been under attack by some western
countries.

European Union to continue their policies regarding travel
restrictions for the agents of the Nigerian governments and their
collaborators.

Information and Publicity Bwendo Mulengela as saying on Monday
that "the issue of Dr Kaunda's continued leadership" was
definitely not on the agenda of the party national council, which
is scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
"We are only going there to fill vacant positions and discuss
the matters related to this year's elections," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
After a constitution amendment bill was signed into law last
May, which bars Kaunda from contesting the presidency because his
parents are foreign immigrants, a few of other parties and even
some UNIP members suggested that UNIP elect a new leader to
replace kaunda to contest the elections.

JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel expressed today

Iraq, and saw no threat from Baghdad as a result of the attack.

<P>
The U.S. Ambassador to Israel Matin Indyk has briefed

Speaking after meeting with visiting German Defense Minister
Voler Reuhe, Netanyahu said Israel, the U.S. closest ally in the

He said that Israel, which had come under the Scud missile
attacks from Iraq during the Gulf War, saw no need to be panic.
</P>

"We have no specific signs pointing to any special problems
from Israel's perspective, therefore, there is no reason for
making special preparations or for concern on the part of
Israelis over the possibility that Saddam Hussein will strike the
country," he said.

He added that, as Israel was in close contacts with the
U.S. government, it would take any actions if necessary.

KUWAIT CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Further attacks on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Say Missiles Hit Iraqi Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Several cruise missiles
launched by the U.S. military hit Iraqi targets early this
morning, U.S. Defense Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, the Pentagon said, were launched from Navy ships
and at least one Air Force B-52 bomber, which was used to launch
similar missiles at the start of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Their "selected" targets were Iraq's defense installations,
including surface-to-air missile launch sites, radar installations
and air defense control towers.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which lasted about 45 minutes, took place in broad
daylight in Iraq, a few minutes after air raid sirens were heard
over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said up to 30 cruise missiles were launched.
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier, the U.S. State Department had warned all
Americans to leave northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vowed to retaliate Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein since he sent his troops to storm the Kurdish-controlled
city of Irbil in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The area provides the Kurds' safe haven, which was designated
by U.S-led allies after the Gulf War in 1991 to protect the
Kurdish minority from Iraqi military forces.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had spent the weekend trying to convince allies
to stand behind whatever military action it might take.
</P>
<P>
However, administration officials said Saudi Arabia was opposed
to any military assault on Iraq from U.S. bases in the country.
Jordan also expressed similar reservations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government
said yesterday preparations to restock the country's main
livestock districts are almost complete.
</P>
<P>
The national coordinator of the cattle lung disease project,
Eric Molale, said in Gaborone that a committee has already been
set up to over see the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The two targeted districts, Ngamiland and Okavango in
northwestern Botswana, bordering Namibia, are the worst-hit in
the country by the killer cattle lung disease.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government has so far spent more than 30 million
U.S. Dollars on an effort to eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan authorities have destroyed more than 200,000
cows to control the disease from spreading.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Tells Israelis Not to Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told Israelis today that there was no need for panic
following U.S. missile attack on Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after being briefed by the
U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, Netanyahu said it was
unlikely for now that Iraq would attack Israeli targets in
retaliation for U.S. missile attacks on it.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see right now a danger of this conflict spilling
over in our direction," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Israel was closely monitoring the
developments and was in close contact with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at
Israeli targets, aiming to draw the Jewish state into the
fighting and breaking up the Arab rank against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States this morning launched 30 to 50 cruise
missiles at selected Iraqi air defense targets in retaliation for
Iraq's Saturday assaults on Kurdish rebels in northern
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Preparing for Donors Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is preparing for a
conference of donor countries due be held in Brussels next month
to consider aids and investments to Lebanon, the Beirut Nida
Al-Watan daily quoted a government minister as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, minister of state for financial affairs, said
that "Lebanon is making efforts for the conference of the donor
countries, or the consultative committee, that is why I recently
visited Washington where I met a number of American officials."
</P>
<P>
The consultative committee was proposed by the United States in
a cease-fire understanding which ended the 17-day Israeli blitz
against Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri has announced that his
country needs some 5 billion U.S. dollars in the next five years
to continue the reconstruction of war-devastated infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has expressed its determination to
provide helps and has taken necessary steps in this purpose," he
said. "U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to preside
the conference which is to be held at the beginning of October."
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura said Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war had weakened the
country's middle class and led to the inflation and "the
government is working hard to improve the life of citizens."
</P>
<P>
"Of course we are undergoing difficulties, but we are trying to
find a way to get us out of them," he said, denying that the
country was in a "catastrophic danger."
</P>
<P>
The minister called on all the Lebanese "to cooperate in order
to overcome the difficulties deriving from the changes taking
place in the world."

<HEADLINE> Japanese RTC to Take over Debts of Failed Credit Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Resolution and Collection
Bank, the Japanese version of the U.S. Resolution Trust
Corp.(RTC), was formed today to take over debts of failed credit
unions, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. RTC, set up in 1989, is a governmental organization
responsible for disposing of real estate and other property of
financial groups.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC was founded on the basis of the reorganized
Tokyo Kyodou Bank, which was established in January 1995 with an
aim to clear up the bankrupt Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and
Anzen Credit Bank, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Kyodou Bank suffered a cumulative loss of 34.1
billion yen (341 million U.S. dollars) in its annual account
settlement on March 31, since most of loans taken over from Tokyo
Kyowa and Anzen became nonperforming due to the fall in land
values.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC bank now holds 40 billion yen (400 million
dollars) of capital, which is expected to rise to 160 billion yen
(1.6 billion dollars) on September 25 when Deposit Insurance
Corp., a security body for depositors, invests 120 billion yen
(1.2 billion dollars) in.
</P>
<P>
Then the staff of the new bank will also increase from
currently 170 to more than 200.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based bank has decided to open an office in Osaka,
which will be in charge of the transfer of healthy and recoverable
loans from the failed Osaka-headquartered Kizu Credit Union to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC is also planning to take over and recover bad
loans of three other failed credit unions in western Japan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Cruise Missiles Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The just concluded
U.S. missile attack on Iraq was ordered by President Bill Clinton,
the Department of Defense said early today.
</P>
<P>
"At the direction of the president, the Department of Defense
has launched cruise missiles to attack selected air defense
targets in Iraq," the Pentagon announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"No further details are available at this time," said the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official said Clinton was expected to make a
formal statement on the mission at 8 a.m. U.S. eastern time (1200
GMT).
</P>
<P>
The military strike came after Clinton returned from his
campaigning tour on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton held meetings with White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake on board
Air Force One in Milwaukee, and talked with French President
Jacques Chirac by telephone.
</P>
<P>
One of Clinton's aides said decisions had been made when the
meeting between Clinton and his advisers was finished.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters in Milwaukee
on Monday that the United States had evidence that Iraqi troops
were moving deeper into the Kurdish autonomous area north of the
36th parallel, designated by U.S.-led allies to protect the Kurds
from Iraqi military forces.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must
not go unpunished even as he pulls his troops out of Irbil, a
Kurdish city close to the 36th parallel, which was captured by
Iraqi troops over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Famous Brands Lubrication Oil Flood to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign famous brands of
lubrication oil will claim 40 percent of the Chinese vehicle
engine-oil market within two years, "China Petrochemical News" has
reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the year before China opened its lubrication oil
market to foreign brands, Mobil, Shell, Esso, and other
lubrication oil producers shared only 5.6 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, their share raced ahead to 16 percent of
the Chinese lubrication oil market, which is reported to have an
annual demand for 2.8 million tons, to meet the needs of more cars
on China's roads.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, Germany, Japan and other countries
have already set up 25 foreign funded lubrication oil joint
ventures, with a total production capacity of 450,000 tons
annually.
</P>
<P>
Mobil and Shell have each set up a solely-funded lubrication
oil joint venture in Tianjin, north China's largest industrial
center, with investments of 300 million US dollars and 260 million
US dollars, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Archives Circle Calls for International Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An international
rapid-response system should be set up to rescue priceless
archives in emergency situations, a conference in Beijing has been
told.
</P>
<P>
A delegate at the International Congress on Archives taking
place in China's capital called for global rules to be drafted to
set up a network capable of saving a country's heritage for
mankind during disasters, wars or conflicts.
</P>
<P>
V.P. Tarasov, an official at the Russian State Archives
Bureau, warned that "if a country loses part of its archives, it
means that we lose part of the world cultural heritage."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the rescue of state archives in urgent situations,
Tarasov suggested the launch of state-level and international
fast-speed archives rescue activities, and called for the early
drafting of international rescue plans.
</P>
<P>
Almamy Stell Conte, Curator of Guinean State Archives
explained that "cooperation" indicates that every country should
be equal in participating in archive exchanges, and all
participants should share the benefit.
</P>
<P>
He urged developed countries to offer personnel training and
help with the compiling and circulation of archive records for
developing countries, while cooperation among developing countries
should place emphasis on exchanges of information, archive lists
and publications.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the chaotic state of archives' bureaux in Central
and East European countries because of war, Jerzy Skowronck, Head
of Poland's State Archives Bureau, urged those countries to
cooperate by providing needed archives and documents for other
countries. It would help archivists in those countries to have
more complete records of their own countries' histories, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that hundreds of thousands, and possibly
millions of documents that legally belong to Poland are still kept
in filing cabinets in Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said after German troops cracked down the Warsaw Uprising
during World War II, some precious documents were taken to Germany
from the Warsaw Central Historical Documents Archives, and the
troops destroyed all the preserved archives.
</P>
<P>
The official said many other Central and East European
countries share similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relevant sides should discuss ways for
returning archives. He expected at least to have microfilmed
copies of archives, or co-publishing of documents by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The archivists at the conference called on all countries to
cooperate on the protection of archives.
</P>
<P>
They held that archives in each country are an organic part of
the world civilization, and their protection is the common
responsibility of mankind.
</P>
<P>
In a move to protect precious and rare archives and books, the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has started
a "World Memory Program."

<HEADLINE> Value of Zimbabwe's Mineral Output to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
expects the value of mineral production in the country to double
to one billion U.S. Dollars by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Mines Minister Swithun Mombeshora is quoted in the latest
publication of the Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC) as saying
interest in Zimbabwe's mining industry continued to rise, as
evidenced by the number of exploration licences issued by his
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Platinum, which only a few years ago was a weak feature in the
country's mining industry, has now become the major point of
activity, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, no "wild speculation" to say that the total
mineral prodiuction value of 604 million U.S. Dollars in 1995
could rise to one billion Dollars by the turn of the century, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
With 92.5 percent of the country's surface area yet to be
explored, prospecting continues to rise in 1996, with 30 new
applications registered, diamond and gold being of particular
interest, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 241 exclusive prospecting orders have so far been
issued and there are 150 applications pending.
</P>
<P>
The minister believes that the mining industry would soon play
a dominant role in the development of Zimbabwe's economy, given
the ever-present fear of recurring droughts which "have reduced
the prominence of agriculture".

<HEADLINE> Situation in Gulf Region Extremely Dangerous: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Gulf
region is "extremely dangerous" after U.S. launched a missile
attack against Iraq Tuesday, a Russian foreign ministry source
said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the Gulf region has taken an extremely
dangerous turn. Everything now depends on what the Americans do
next," said the source.
</P>
<P>
The air raid would lead to "an uncontrollable situation", the
source was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States launched several dozen missiles
from Navy ships and Air Force B-52 bombers against "selected air
defense targets" in Iraq early this morning, according to the
U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
The air raid, whose targets were Iraq's command-and-control
installations, anti-aircraft missile launching sites and radar
stations, was seen as a retaliation for Baghdad's attack against
Kurds in a U.N.-sanctioned safe zone in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets US Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Qiao
Shi said that the parliaments and governments of China and the
United States should increase exchanges so as to enhance mutual
understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress (NPC), made the remark in Beijing today while
meeting a delegation from the US Association for Former Members of
Congress, led by its chairman Louis Frey Jr.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the delegation, Qiao said that the
development of Sino-US relations has not been easy to come.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations between China and the US, both as
big countries in the world, was of great significance for both
sides, and for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as
well as the world at large, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that so long as the two countries strictly
abide by the principles set in the three Sino-US joint
communiques, Sino-US relations can develop smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The "one China" principle is the core of the three Sino-US
joint communiques, for the issue of territorial integrity and
sovereignty concerns the national sentiments of the entire 1.2
billion Chinese people, Qiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
China's clear-cut stand on this issue will never change,
Qiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
As to the Hong Kong issue, he said, China is to realize
smoothly the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and China
is confident of Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Louis Frey Jr. said that the US and China are two great
countries striving for development, and they need to establish
cooperative relations with each other.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qiao also answered questions put forward by
the visitors.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member delegation arrived in China on September 1 at the
invitation of the NPC's Foreign Affairs Committee. They are also
scheduled to visit Xi'an, Shanghai and Guilin.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President to Make Important Address on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein will make later today an important address to the Iraqi
people and armed forces and the entire Arab nation on "the
treacherous aggression on Iraq," Baghdad TV announced today.
</P>
<P>
The address will be Iraq's first official reaction to the
U. S. cruise missile attack on selected Iraqi air defense targets
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens sounded here this morning as reports said the
United States has approved a military strike to punish Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his troop movements into the Kurdish
controlled areas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The alarm sounded at 9:25 a.m. local time (05:25 GMT), but the
Baghdad radio did not report the alarm. It abruptly stopped
morning talk shows and began playing national songs.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Washington, a Pentagon
official said between 30 and 50 missiles had been launched by
U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and from Navy ships in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that any of the missiles had hit the
capital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The assault was launched to retaliate for Iraqi government
troops' attacks on the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil, the main
city in the allied protected "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered the assault, the
Pentagon said in a statement. "At the direction of the president,
the Department of Defense has launched cruise missiles to attack
selected air defense targets in Iraq," it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the attack was launched because there
was evidence that the Iraqi troops were pushing deeper into the
Kurd-controlled areas in northern Iraq and killing political
opponents in the areas they were seizing.
</P>
<P>
This came as the White House accused Iraq of "unjustified
behavior" in attacking the Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq,
and political analysts said that it also had some link to the
projected U.S. general election in November.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was believed to be eager to beef up his campaign
position by ordering the attack, which reminds the Americans of
the triumph the U.S.-led coalition forces gained in driving the
Iraqis out of Kuwait in the Gulf war five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also consulted allies and spoke with his national
security team.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in the Middle East showed concern over the
U.S. attacks on Iraq. In Cairo, an official of the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry said that the government is discussing the
situation and working out an official position if the U.S. asks
for passage for its warships through the strategic Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops captured Irbil Saturday in the biggest offensive
in five years since the Gulf war in 1991 to dislodge a Kurdish
faction in northern Iraq, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, at
the request of its rival faction, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party.

BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has prepared plans to
immediately evacuate Thai workers in Iraq to safe places if the
situation in that country worsens, Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay
Virawan said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai diplomatic mission in Baghdad is ready to facilitate

</P>
<P>
The Thai embassy in Iraq has prepared contingency plans to move
Thai workers in Iraq to the safe places once the situation

</P>
<P>
During the weekend, Iraq President Saddam Hussein sent three
tank divisions into northern Iraq to help a Kurdish faction
involved in a bloody power struggle with another Kurdish group and
captured main Kurdish city of Arbil.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military forces around the world were on alert after
the White House warned Saddam Hussein his incursion into a Kurdish
safe haven in northern Iraq would not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department on Monday urged all
American citizens to leave Iraq.

late Monday night and sent a message to the Turkish government
on the U.S. military operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Marc Grossman submitted a message
from Clinton to Ciller on the situation in the region at the
Turkish Foreign Ministry earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that "at this stage", the U.S. did
not ask for using the Incirlik air base in Adana, southern
Turkey, from which the U.S.-led allied forces attacked the
military targets in northern Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that she would have another telephone
conversation with Clinton on the latest developments in the
region this evening.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets British Minister of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said in
Beijing today that he hopes China and Britain will increase
consultations and cooperation to achieve the smooth transition of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Jeremy Hanley, Britain's Minister of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lu said that the
smooth transition of Hong Kong will not only accord with the
interests of Hong Kong itself, but also with the fundamental
interests of China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Both countries should enhance cooperation on the question of
Hong Kong, on the basis of seeking a common ground, while
reserving minor differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
The common ground refers to the realization of the smooth
transfer of power in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and to the
maintenance of its stability and prosperity after 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
After accomplishing this task, minor differences will be easily
resolved, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best to solve minor differences before July 1,
1997. If some of the differences can not be solved by that day, it
doesn't matter. We can first put them aside and they can be
resolved gradually by the Hong Kong people themselves after the
establishment of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he was confident that with concerted efforts, the two
governments of China and Britain will be able to strengthen
cooperation to achieve the smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hanley said this was his first visit to Beijing, adding that he
was pleased to note that successful high-level meetings had
occured over the last year or so.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased that the relationship between the United
Kingdom and China has been improved. The atmosphere in the
discussions has become very constructive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides reached agreements on many issues which
were looked upon as very difficult even one year ago.
</P>
<P>
It is not only good for the stable transition of Hong Kong, but
also beneficial to relations between Britain and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hanley and his party arrived in China on September 1 as guests
of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His current visit is
aimed at continuing consultations at vice foreign ministerial
level to improve bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> US Launches Missile Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warships and B-52 bombers
in the Gulf this morning launched between 20 to 30 missiles to
attack selected air defense targets in Iraq, reports reaching
here from Washington said.
</P>
<P>
The assault was launched to retaliate for Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's attacks on Kurds in a U.N.-imposed safe zone in
northern Iraq,
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad before the missiles were
fired at the Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered the attack, the
Pentagon said in a statement. "At the direction of the president,
the Department of Defense has launched cruise missiles to attack
selected air defense targets in Iraq," it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the attack was launched because there
was evidence that the Iraqi troops were pushing deeper into
Kurd-controlled areas in northern Iraq and killing political
opponents in the areas they were seizing.
</P>
<P>
This came as the White House accused Saddam of "unjustified
behavior" in attacking the Kurdish safe haven in northern Iraq,
and political analysts said that it also had some link to the
projected U.S. general election in November.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was believed to be eager to beef up his campaign
position by ordering the attack, which reminds the Americans of
the triumph the U.S.-led coalition forces gained in driving the
Iraqis out of Kuwait in the Gulf war five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also consulted allies and spoke with his national
security team.
</P>
<P>
Regional countries showed concern over the U.S. attacks on
Iraq. In Cairo, an official at the Egyptian Ministry said that
the government is discussing the situation and working out an
official position if the U.S. asks for passage for its warships
through the strategic Suez Canal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Henry Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren today expressed the hope that in the coming 21st century,
the Sino-US relations would score "new and bigger developments" on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Rong made the remarks while meeting with former US secretary of
state Henry Kissinger and his wife here in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Rong, who met with Kissinger for the second time this year,
said China and the US still shared many common interests under the
new world situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should maintain contact and have
dialogue with each other on the basis of mutual respect and
equality.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he said, the two sides will be better able to
understand each other, remove misunderstandings, and make
bilateral relations "grow further along a healthy track."
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said that China has a history of 5,000 years of
civilization while the US just has a history of more than 200
years, and so, mutual respect for each other, and treating each
other equally constituted the basis of the development of US-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that US-China relations will develop
better in the future.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Rong hosted a luncheon at his residence in
honor of Mr. and Mrs. Kissinger and their party.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger is in China to attend the first meeting of the 21st
Century Forum, which opens tomorrow (Wednesday) in the Chinese

ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched
a missile attack against "selected air defense targets" in Iraq
early this morning, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The attack, with several dozens of cruise missiles in the first
round, was apparently in retaliation for Iraq's military operation
in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official was quoted by the local press as
saying that U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and Navy ships had joined
in the attack, termed as "surgical" by experts.
</P>
<P>
The targets were Iraq's command-and-control installations,
anti-aircraft missile launching sites and radar stations.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the military action came as the attack was
wrapped up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who ordered the mission, was expected
to make a formal statement at 8 a.m. U.S. eastern time (1200

<HEADLINE> US Launches Missile Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
launched cruise missiles to attack selected air defense targets
in Iraq, according to reports reaching here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens sounded here this morning as reports said the
United States has approved a military strike to punish Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his troop movements into the Kurdish
controlled areas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The alarm sounded at 9:25 a.m. local time (05:25 GMT), but the
Baghdad radio did not report the alarm. It abruptly stopped
morning talk shows and began playing national songs.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Washington, a Pentagon
official said between 30 and 50 missiles had been launched by
U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and from Navy ships in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
There was no indication any of the missiles had hit the
capital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The assault was launched to retaliate for Iraqi government
troops' attacks on the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil, the main
city in the allied protected "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered the assault, the
Pentagon said in a statement. "At the direction of the president,
the Department of Defense has launched cruise missiles to attack
selected air defense targets in Iraq," it added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retaliates Iraq With Cruise Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Navy and Air Forces
have launched "several dozen" cruise missiles at some of Iraq's
air defense targets this morning, with an aim to retaliate Baghdad
for its attacks on a Kurdish-controlled city in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A senior Defense Department official was quoted by the local
press as saying that the strike is over and "every missile has
been launched" as planned.
</P>
<P>
The official, on condition of anonymity, confirmed the end of
the air raid only 15 minutes after the Pentagon announced the
launch of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action, "at the direction of the president," is in
reprisal for the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's weekend attacks
on the Kurdish city of Irbil in a U.N. safe zone in northern Iraq,
said the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
According to a Pentagon statement, the cruise missiles were
aimed at selected air defense targets in Iraq. But it gave no
more details.
</P>
<P>
The missile attacks followed U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision to impose economic and military punishments on Iraq,
considered a powerhouse in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Monday that the
U.S. had evidence that Saddam's troops were moving deeper into
Kurd-controlled areas, instead of pulling back from the original
point of its attack.
</P>
<P>
And the White House accused Saddam of "unjustified behavior" in
attacking the Kurdish strongholds and warned that such action will
have consequences.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the decision after consultation with allies and
meeting with his national security team.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of the close ties between Kurds and Iran, who
is Iraq's long-term enemy, Saddam Hussein ordered his troops on
Saturday to pass the U.N. safe zone and launch attacks on Irbil.
Iraqi troops overran the city later that day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu-Arafat Meeting Expected Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was expected today, though there has been no official
announcement so far, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Barring the last-minute glitches, Israeli and Palestinian
officials seemed to have cleared all controversial issues through
intensive talks that lasted until late Monday night, the Jerusalem
Post said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted senior Israeli officials as saying that such a
meeting could take place today perhaps at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat held
talks in Tel Aviv with Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Dore Gold
on nailing down this crucial meeting. But no announcement was
made after the two briefed their respective boss on the ongoing
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew evening paper Yediot Aharonot also reported that
the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting could take place today. But it added
that Netanyahu only enjoys a small majority support in the
cabinet to his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
While quoting a report of the AFP as saying that the Netanyahu-
Arafat meeting would even take place this morning, Israel Radio
said that it still remained unclear if it would come today as
both sides remained suspicious with each other.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Hebron issue remained the main dispute
between the two sides. Israel demanded discussion on revising its
troops' redeployment from the volatile West Bank town, but was
rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials Monday protested the "change of mind" on the
part of the Palestinians, who they said initially agreed to
discuss the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
Another Hebrew evening paper Ma'ariv reported that Norwegian
mediator Terje Larsen, sponsor of the Oslo accords and recent
series of secret talks between Israel and the Palestinians, went
to Gaza Monday to convince Arafat to accept Israel's offer for a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat said Monday that the two sides still remained apart
on arranging his meeting with Netanyahu, an he insisted that
Israel should implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
In a further sign of increasing pressure on Netanyahu to meet
Arafat, the major Hebrew paper Ha'aretz reported that U.S.
President Bill Clinton would refuse to receive Netanyahu next week
if he did not meet Arafat by then.
</P>
<P>
A Netanyahu-Arafat meeting is expected to help ease the rising
tension between the two sides over the last week after Arafat
called for large-scale protests to oppose Israel's hardline
policies on settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu gave a clearest signal that he would
meet Arafat soon, reversing an earlier strong stand. But he added
such a meeting would only be based "on developments and not on
dates."

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched
a missile attack against "selected air defense targets" in Iraq
early this morning, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The attack, with several dozens of cruise missiles in the first
round, was apparently in retaliation for Iraq's military operation
in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official was quoted by the local press as
saying that U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and Navy ships had joined
in the attack, termed as "surgical" by experts.
</P>
<P>
The targets were Iraq's command-and-control installations,
anti-aircraft missile launching sites and radar stations.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the military action came as the attack was
wrapped up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who ordered the mission, was expected
to make a formal statement at 8 a.m. U.S. eastern time (1200
GMT).

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames US for Conflict in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran has accused the United
Stated of being the real cause of the conflict in northern
Iraq and insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahomud Mohammadi said that
Iran was closely following up the development in the area,
according to the official news agency IRNA today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that the crisis in northern Iraq
could only be settled through peaceful means and the crisis could
not possibly be resolved through military operation.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the world community of the sudden surge of Kurdish
refugees to Iran in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the military operation against the Kurds
in northern Iraq would end up in useless massacre, unwarranted
influx of refugees and forced migration of the masses to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman outright rejected Iran's intervention in the
present conflict, saying that the cooperation between Turkey,
Syria and Iran was the best solution to the crisis of the
northern sector of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if any incursion of anti-Iran groups from the
Iraqi territory into the territory of Iran takes place, it will be
met with severest possible military measure.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Announce act against iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
returned to the White House from a campaign tour on Monday evening
amid signals that the United States is planning military
retaliation on Iraq for its attack on the Kurdish city of Irbil in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
One of his aides said on the way back to Washington that
Clinton talked with White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake on his airplane Air Force
One in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
He said decisions had been made when the meetings were finished.
</P>
<P>
Asked about timing of any move against Iraq, the aide said:
"Stay close to the president."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that no
announcement was expected from Clinton until Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announce on Monday it started pulling its troops out of
Irbil, 30 km north of the 36th parallel, designated by the
U.S.-led allies to prohibit Iraqi troops from striking against the
Kurds living in northern iraq.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry dismissed the withdrawal as insignificant,
saying: "We see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal
back to their original forward positions."
</P>
<P>
He said there are some other evidence that shows Iraq was
moving deeper into the Kurds' enclave, and its objective was to
capture Sulaymaniyah, an administrative center for the Kurdish
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
McCurry told reporters that Clinton had consultations with a
number of allies, seeking their cooperation in a possible strike
on Iraq, "especially the government of Great Britain". The
president also talked with French President Jacques Chirac by
telephone, but McCurry disclosed nothing about their discussion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two top officials, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
John Shalikashvili and Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau, made urgent visits to Jordan,
Saudi Arabia and Egypt in two days to consult with their officials
on possible united action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government reportedly expressed reservations,
saying that Jordan "will not be part of any effort that involves
military operations" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There are contradictory reports on Saudi attitude toward any
operations: some said Shalikashvili had secured a pledge from
Saudi Arabia to cooperate in any measures to punish Iraq while
others said Saudi Arabia was adverse to any military assault on
Iraq from U.S. bases in its country.
</P>
<P>
McCurry told reporters that no matter what kind of response the
United States had got from its allies, it will surely take action.
</P>
<P>
"When we must act we must act even if it means acting alone,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials here disclosed that the Pentagon has not contemplated
any ground action, and the Air Force or the Navy would be expected
to be involved in any military retaliations on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was said there are numerous choices for Clinton to take for
the military action, including launching cruise missiles either
from Navy ships or submarines or from Air Force B-52 long-range
bombers, four of which are now positioned on Guam.
</P>
<P>
According to CNN, B-52s has taken off from Guam.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is in the Persian Gulf with a
full complement of about 70 warplanes aboard. and aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise in the Mediterranean Sea is ready to move out on
short notice, possibly soon moving into the Red Sea with her
battle group.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is assembling an "air expeditionary force" of
30-40 fighter planes that could deploy to the Middle East,
possibly Jordan, as a quick reaction force.
</P>
<P>
There are also 100 land-based American combat aircraft in and
around Saudi Arabia which are capable of striking at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Marines has already notified an amphibious group of Marines
aboard Navy ships to be prepared to deploy to the Middle East. It
was said they are equipped with combat helicopters, fighters and
amphibious vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 vehicles were
damaged at the Victoria park in Dhaka on Monday when angry student
supporters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
went on rampage during their processions against the arrest of a
student leader.
</P>
<P>
Acting president of the BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra
Dal (JCD) Nasiruddin Pintu was arrested on Sunday night and sent
to the Dhaka central jail Monday on afternoon. Police brought
five specific charges against him including killing, rioting,
carrying of explosive and anti-state activities.
</P>
<P>
Activists of BNP's front organizations, especially the student
groups, on Monday brought out several processions protesting the
arrest of the student leader and demanding for an immediate
release of Pintu.
</P>
<P>
Some police officers admitted that the arms recovered from
Pintu was not illegal and he produced necessary papers and
authorization of the arms to the police.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the JCD will observe strike in all the
educational institutions in the country on September 5 to press
home their demand.
</P>
<P>
Observers here worried about the deteriorating situation in the
country caused by growing opposition student movements in various
campus.
</P>
<P>
The student movement is likely to be a signal of country-wide
opposition agitation against the government, they said, adding
that if it is so, the country would be once again locked in
violent government-opposition conflict which had been for more
than two years before the June 12 parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Special-Priced Commodity Fair to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Bargain hunters are
expected to flock to a special-priced commodity fair in China's
Hebei province later this week.
</P>
<P>
The event is expected to shift a stockpile of goods - and
generate instant income for enterprises needing ready money for
their cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
The event is scheduled to be held between September 6 and 8 by
the Ministry of Internal Trade and Hebei Provincial Government and
is aimed at providing a ready market for the country's stockpiles
of goods worth over 300-billion-yuan (36.144 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The venue for the event will be in Shenzhou City, 90 kilometers
away from Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province, where China's
only market for special-priced commodities was set up by the
Ministry and Hebei provincial government two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fair is expected to facilitate the distribution not only of
stockpiles, but also brand-name products, special and new
products, especially goods which enterprises badly need to sell to
generate income, pointed out an Hebei government official.
</P>
<P>
Stockpiles nationwide have already caused problems such as
shortage of funds, and inability to pay debts, commented an
official of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The special-priced market, which provides a diversified way of
trading, includes spot transactions, direct selling and barter
trade, has mainly attracted direct selling dealers and trading
agents.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that among the participants at the fair will be
about 100 military-turned-civil product enterprises, as well as
many motorcycle-makers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has brought in new
rules to stop ships and boats from polluting its rivers and sea.
</P>
<P>
The rules raise explicit requirements on the supervision,
management, anti-pollution measures and legal responsibility
concerning the prevention of water pollution by ships and boats.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules polluters who fail to report, or take
appropriate measures, on pollution, will face fines of between
30,000 yuan (3,614 US dollars) and 50,000 yuan (6,024 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the rules follow mounting pollution problems,
largely due to a number of chemical enterprises located on the
banks of the Huangpu River, and oil terminals at Shanghai Port.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai's port handled 9.66 million tons
of dangerous goods in the first half of this year, of which
510,000 tons were shipped by bulk carriers, and the rest in 9,600
standard containers.

DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The maiden budget session of
Bangladesh's parliament was prorogued last night amid a walkout of
the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) MPs in protest
against the obstruction of deliberation by the ruling party MPs.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury read out President Abdul

the ex-BNP dominated parliament.

Earlier, the maiden session of the house, which was elected

bills, including the law commission bill and the private export
processing zone bill.
</P>

Beginning on July 14, the session witnessed stormy debates on

and campus violence. The opposition BNP staged walkout on six

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) on Monday ordered former communications
minister Sukh Ram to return to India from Britain for
interrogation on or before September 10, The Times of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
The summons have been sent to the former minister through the
Indian High Commission (embassy) in London, CBI sources said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI issued the summons in view of the former minister's
suspected role in a telecom equipment supply deal scandal and
recovery of the huge cash amount from his various residences in
India.
</P>
<P>
The former communications minister was on a trip to Britain
when CBI raided his residences last month.
</P>
<P>
Sukh Ram, who claims to be under strict medical supervision in
London, had earlier told the CBI that, in view of the medical
advice, he would not be able to return to India before September
15.
</P>
<P>
CBI sources said that if the former minister fails to return to
India by September 10, it would have little option but to take the
drastic step of issuing a warrant against him, revoking his
passport and issuing a "Look-out" notice through the Interpol to
bring him back.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Cooperation on Illegal Immigrant Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is calling for
cooperation from neighboring countries to tackle the influx of
illegal immigrants who have brought social and health hazards to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on regional security organized by the
Thai Foreign Ministry here on Monday, Thai National Security
Council Secretary-General Gen. Charan Kulavanijaya said economic
migration should be dealt at the highest government-to-government
levels.
</P>
<P>
Charan told representatives from 12 countries and regions that
the influx of illegal immigrants, estimated at one million, has
become one of the biggest threats to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal immigrants, especially those from Myanmar
and Cambodia, has increased dramatically after a recent government
decision to legalize those who have been working in Thailand for
two years, Charan was quoted by local newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Thai ambassadors in neighboring countries to
promote the understanding of the situation in Thailand.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- By-elections to India's
vacant Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) and Rajya Sabha
(upper house) seats and to 66 state assembly seats will be held on
October 11, the Indian Express newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The schedule was announced by the Election Commission on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three Lok Sabha seats to be contested fell vacant following

Narasimha Rao and Atal Behari Vajpayee and the Janata Dal leader
Biju Patnaik. All three had been elected from two constituencies
in the recent general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Rajya Sabha by-elections will be held also for three seats,
one in Karnataka and two in Maharashtra.
</P>
<P>
Among those expected to contest the by-polls are Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda, Welfare Minister Balwant Singh Ramoowalia and
Planning Minister Y.K. Alagh, who are not members of either House
of Parliament at present.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, they have to become members of either House
within six months of being inducted into the Council of Ministers.
 The Gowda government assumed office on June 1.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court Monday
expressed its dissatisfaction over the investigation by the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into a 18-Million-US dollar
bribery scandal, the Hawala case, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
But the court did not say anything more on the issue after CBI
chief Joginder Singer assured the court of better results on the
case, which shocked the entire the country's political circle
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Hawala is a network dealing with illegal foreign exchange
transactions in India. In the case, many top politicians were
charged with receiving money through Hawala dealers after awarding
lucrative official contracts to foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The apex court expressed dissatisfaction over the slow progress
of the case during the hearing of a public petition alleging
inaction by the CBI in the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Opposition Regrets Price-Hiking Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's main opposition,
the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), has expressed
its regret over the new government's decision to hike prices of
oil products, coal, electricity and heating power, the Mongolian
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the MPRP said that the decision, important as
it was, was hastily made without any investigation and reference
statistics and that it would undoubtedly aggravate the hardship of
people's life.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that the Democratic Union, which
was formed mainly of the Mongolian National Democratic Party and
the Social Democratic Party and secured most seats in the Great
Hural (national assembly) in elections in June this year, should
take responsibility for the consequences of their reckless
decision.
</P>
<P>
Under the government decision, prices of oil products and coal
would be increased by 20-60 percent and 45-48 percent respectively
as of September 1. The prices of electricity and heating power
would rise 60 percent as of September 10.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Prime Minister Mendsaihani Enhsaihan made the
decision known to the local press prior to its implementation. At
a later session of the Great Hural, he explained the government
decision and called on the Mongolians to understand and support
the government action.
</P>
<P>
As the oldest and largest political force in the largest
pastoral country, the MPRP, formed in 1921, currently has 82,000
members and had stayed in power until the June 30 parliamentary
elections this year, when it lost two-thirds of the seats to only
25 in the 76-seat Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic Union, consisting of four smaller
parties, got the upper hand and won all but the rest of the seats
in the legislative body.

<HEADLINE> Australian Retail Trade Strong In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Consumer demand proved to be
higher than most economists had expected in Australia, taking the
local financial market by surprise.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
the retail trade volume rose by 2.4 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis to 10.44 billion Australian dollars (8.25 billion
US dollars) in July from 10.2 billion Australian dollars (8.06
billion US dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest monthly increase in retail trade since May,
1994. The July figure was 6.4 percent higher than in the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Before the figures were released, local economists used to
expect a flat to negative growth of turnover in July.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures were in contrast with the otherwise sluggish
outlook of the economy, showing that consumer demand still had
some puff to push both the economy and inflation up.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that end-of-financial-year clearance sales by
department stores helped to boost consumer demand. ABS figures
showed that department stores contributed to half of the 2.4
percent increase in retail sales in July.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures proved to be a surprise for the local financial
market. The Australian dollar strengthened to 79.09 US cents from
Monday's close of 78.97 US cents after the release of the figures.
Australian bond prices fell, while the stock market slipped lower.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the figures nullified any further interest
rate cut in the short term.

BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's domestic oil
consumption averaged 113.7 million liters per day in the first
half of the year, up 9 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Ministry, daily petrol consumption in
the country rose by 10 percent to 18.9 million liters, 13 million
liters of which was premium petrol.
</P>
<P>
The daily consumption of high-speed diesel was at 48.5 million
liters, a moderate increase of 13 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
However, daily demand for bunker oil edged up only 2 percent to
28 million liters because the electricity generating authority of
Thailand is using more natural gas to generate electricity.

</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar will help develop the economic ties between

the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government is to create a good environment for

<HEADLINE> New Project on Drinking Water to Be Launched in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A new project on drinking
water and sanitation in rural Nepal is to be launched next month
with nearly 600,000 people expected to benefit from it, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth rural drinking water and sanitation project,
supported by a soft loan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will
be constructed in 40 districts in the country's eastern,
mid-western and far-western developmental regions with a total of
300 sub-projects, according to the Housing and Physical Planning
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The 20.6 million-US dollar project is expected to be completed
within five years with 20 million dollars of ADB loan while the
balance of the cost will be borne by the government and local
drinking water users in the form of labor contribution, ministry
officials said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth drinking water project in Nepal with the ADB
assistance since the first such project began in 1982, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has provided a total of 40.2 million dollars in soft
loan for drinking water projects in Nepal, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the new project, thousands of local social groups
throughout the project areas will be provided training on drinking
water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Local consumers will also be given information and encouraged
to build low-cost toilets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister for Housing and Physical Planning Balaram
 Ghartimagar, 64 percent of the country's 20 million population
has access to drinking water facilities at present and the
government is working to provide clean drinking water to all the
people by 2000.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of drinking water supply in the capital
city of Kathmandu, the government will soon implement a major
water diversion project to bring water from the Melachi river,
about 30 kilometers northeast of Kathmandu, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Melachi project, expected to be
completed by 2000 with an estimated cost of 185 million dollars,
will provide 170 million liters of water supply daily to
Kathmandu, where the present daily demand is at around 130 million
liters but only 110 million and 60 million of that is met in rainy
and dry season respectively.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Nominees Busy Campaigning in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton celebrated Labor Day on Monday with a rally in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and fresh attacks on Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole's tax-cutting plan.
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee and De Pere, Clinton, who has been nominated by
the Democratic Party for re-election, laid out his blueprint for
the next century and said Dole's 548-billion-U.S.-dollar
tax-cutting plan would balloon interest rates and make mortgages,
credit cards and car loans more expensive for the middle-class,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the country simply cannot afford it and taxpayers
would have to pay for their tax cuts in the end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in St. Louis, Missouri, Dole called himself a
"bridge to lower taxes" and said his tax proposal -- including an
across-the-board 15-percent cut in the income tax rate -- amounts
to "one big plan (that) gives Americans back more of their
hard-earned money", according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp, called Clinton's bridge
to the 21st century -- a phrase the president has used frequently
-- "a toll bridge" for which "every inch of the way, you pay and
pay and pay".
</P>
<P>
But Clinton's attacks on the Dole tax plan resonated with the
Labor Day crowd at a city park. Clinton won Wisconsin in 1992,
and polls show him running farther ahead in the state than
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Prior to reaching Wisconsin, where he campaigned in Green Bay
and Milwaukee, Clinton has reportedly addressed some 350,000 to
400,000 people in more than 30 speeches over eight days.
</P>
<P>
While criticizing Dole's tax-cut plan, Clinton sought to
describe his 110-billion-dollar tax-cut plan as more responsible
because much of it was tied to education.
</P>
<P>
Dole, in the meanwhile, reminded the St. Louis rally that
Clinton had promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992, but it never
came through.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip to Wisconsin was said to be aimed at courting
the labor vote.
</P>
<P>
Union membership comprised just 14.9 percent of the U.S. work
force in 1995, down from a high of 34.7 percent in 1954. Still,
unions were a strong political voice after the 1994 mid-term
elections.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Edouard Hits Northeast U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Edouard today
struck the area of Cape Cod on the northeast coast of the United
States, overturning roofs, uprooting trees and leaving more than
35,000 customers without power.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which once packed winds blowing at a steady 200
kilometers per hour (kph), just gave a glancing blow to Cape Cod
and island communities that had been emptied of thousands of
holiday weekend tourists.
</P>
<P>
The damage by Edouard was lighter than expected as it moved
straight northward over the open ocean toward Nantucket, south of
Cape Cod in Massachusetts, after it took a right turn early in the
day. Its center was no closer than 130 kilometers from Nantucket,
where wind gusts peaked at 145 kph.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Edouard headed northeast toward Canada's Nova
Scotia at 19 kph and the maximum sustained wind around the storm's
center was down to 120 kph.
</P>
<P>
Boston's Logan International Airport reopened today after being
shut down overnight, but flights were delayed because many
airlines had moved planes elsewhere as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
About 900 people spent the night in emergency shelters across
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hurricane Fran was gaining strength as it headed
toward the Bahamas and the United States late this morning, and
forecasters were urging residents of the Southeast to prepare for
the storm, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Fran was expected to be off the coast of Florida in the next 72
hours.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Directive Approving Retaliation Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton has signed off on a directive approving military and
economic punishment on Iraq for its military maneuver in northern
Iraq, a U.S. official said Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The official did not provide a timetable, only indicating that
the action "is very likely", which coincides with speculations
growing in Washington about U.S. military movement against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said several times that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein would not go unpunished, even as his troops have
been pulling out of the Kurdish city of Irbil, which is located 20
kilometer north of the 36th Parallel designated as a safe haven by
the U.S.-led allies to protect the Kurds from Iraqi military
forces.
</P>
<P>
Irbil is reportedly in the hands of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, that was alleged to have invited Iraqi troops to help drive
another Kurdish faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, out of
the region.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters on board Air
Force One traveling with President Clinton that reports of Iraqi
forces leaving Irbil "is not significant".
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence of an Iraqi redeployment," he said.
"But we see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal back
to their original forward positions."
</P>
<P>
He said the evidence showed that Iraq was moving deeper into
the Kurds' safe haven. He concluded that Saddam's military forces
are aimed at taking over Sulaymaniyah, an administrative center
for the Kurdish autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said preparations for any military action
ordered by Clinton has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has been assembling as an air expeditionary force
with 30 to 40 fighter planes to the Middle East and two aircraft
carriers have been told to be ready to move out on short notice.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate
in Brazil reached 5.82 percent for the first seven months of this
year, hitting a four-year high since the recession of 1992.

<P>
During the 1992 recession, the jobless rate in Brazil was 5.76
percent, and it dropped to 5.4 percent in July, 1994, according to
figures from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.

High interest rates and the dilemma of the country's industries
are the main causes of the high jobless rate.

In the first half of this year, industrial production in Brazil
fell 9.1 percent as compared with the same period of last year,
and many small and medium-sized industrial companies have declared
bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa stressed on Monday that Thailand's priority was to
strengthen relations with its bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister made the remark when he was delivering
his first major speech on foreign policy since July last year at a
seminar of Thai ambassadors stationed in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that Thailand would continue to promote mutual
interest, security and prosperity with all economies in east and
southeast Asia, especially those bordering countries, through
sub-regional frameworks, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area, Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Asia-Europe meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also make a determined effort to strengthen the
ASEAN regional forum and convert it into a security mechanism for
the Asia-Pacific region in particular, he was quoted as saying by
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The most challenging task for Thailand and east and southeast
Asia was economic issues, Banharn said, urging the ambassadors to
spare no efforts to promote trade with and investment in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Thai diplomats to take care of Thai workers
living aboard, especially those fishermen who had been detained by

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Asks Myanmar to Meet Criteria of AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar must meet the minimum
requirements of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) before it can
become a full member of the ASEAN, according to Thai Foreign
Minister Amnuay Iravan.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly welcome Myanmar in Joining the ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations), but whether it will be next year is
up to Myanmar, because joining the ASEAN is joining the AFTA which
has a minimum requirement," Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar applied to join the ASEAN in August when its Prime
Minister Than Shwe visited Malaysia. Myanmar gave no time-frame,
but Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed was quoted at the
time as saying that he would like Myanmar to become a full member
next year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is moving towards a free trade zone with tariff rates to
be reduced to between zero and 5 percent by the year 2003. As the
first step, aspiring members of AFTA have to reduce tariffs to 20
percent, Amnuay was quoted today by the local newspaper Bangkok
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members are also required to allow for "minimum economic
freedom" which includes reduction of trade and non-trade barriers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said the economic obligation for aspiring ASEAN members
is in place, adding that both ASEAN foreign and economic ministers
had realized that the interests of AFTA as well as those of
political dialogue had to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we (ASEAN) do, we have to be realistic," he said.
The ASEAN could not just be concerned with scoring political
points, but also had to look at realities, the foreign minister
added.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Opens in Marshall Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The annual summit of the
South Pacific region opened in Majuro, capital of the Republic of
the Marshall Islands this afternoon (local time) with a fresh
focus on economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state of most of the 16 South Pacific Forum members
attended the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Amata Kabua, president of Marshall Islands and chairman of this
summit, addressed the 300 delegates from the member states at the
official opening held in the Parliament, or Njtijela.
</P>
<P>
Ieremia Tabai, forum Secretary General and former president of
Kiribati, also made a speech at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Major issues to be discussed among the leaders at the summit
include trade, economic development, environment and security.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the secretariat of the forum said that the
leaders would look at ways to establish the region as part of the
world trading system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South Pacific island nations needed to find
the most effective way to compete in an increasingly open trade
environment in the world.
</P>
<P>
The removal of preferential trade arrangements with the
European Union, Australia and New Zealand would force the island
nations to improve efficiency and competitiveness of their
economies, which were now the major obstacles for them to join the
world trade system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to produce quality goods that can compete with those
from China, Singapore, Malaysia and other countries," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The forum members have yet to decide whether to participate in
the world trade system as individual nations or as a trading
group.
</P>
<P>
The leaders would look at ways that maximized the benefits that
could be achieved with the limited resources in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting will have an introduction to the forum theme.
The leaders will discuss the theme during an informal retreat at
the Outrigger Marshall Islands Resort on Wednesday. The forum will
resume in the formal session on Thursday, concluding with the
issue of a communique.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific Forum has 16 full members, namely Australia,
Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of
Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and
Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
Seven dialogue partners will also attend the post-summit
meeting. They are Britain, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the
United States and the EU.
</P>
<P>
France was one of the dialogue partners. But its dialogue
partner status was suspended last year.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Indonesia Still Needs Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has stated that his country will continue to enhance the
mobilization of foreign capital, saying Indonesia's increasing
requirements made it impossible to rely solely on domestic
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
While opening an international ministerial level conference on
development of infrastructure at the State Palace last night, the
president said that it was necessary for Indonesia to enhance
international cooperation, either bilateral or multilateral.
</P>
<P>
Only through cooperation could human resources and technology
be used to optimum level, Soeharto added.
</P>
<P>
By introducing deregulation policies, the government was trying
to induce greater participation of the private sector in the
development of infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the six Five-Year development plan (from 1994 to 1999), the
private investment was projected to meet 77 percent of the
country's investment needs for development, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the need for investment funds, the president said
for infrastructure development alone during the next 10 years, the
country would need an estimated 200 billion US dollars. The
government was expecting the amount to be provided by the private
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The private investment in Indonesia made rapid progress in the
last 10 years as could be seen from the development of toll roads,
power plants and communication facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial-level representatives from Australia, Cambodia,
Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos,
Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were attending the
conference.
</P>
<P>
They will mainly discuss the way of effective cooperation to
meet the region's estimated 1.5 trillion US dollars in
infrastructure needs, among others.

<HEADLINE> Rural Guizhou Supplied with Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Bringing power to the people
has helped rural industries in boost their output ten-fold in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of rural households in China's remote
Guizhou Province are now supplied with electricity thanks to the
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
But there are still eight million farmers who have not yet been
able to make both ends meet.
</P>
<P>
According to economists, the lack of electricity is one of the
major factors causing farmers to suffer.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Guizhou is the only province in the country
which has no plain area - 87 percent of its territory is karst
land.
</P>
<P>
While building a state power grid the provincial government has
adopted preferential policies to encourage localities to construct
small and medium-sized power projects.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that rural industrial businesses are
mushrooming in areas supplied with power. Their annual gross
output value has gone up from 2.5 million yuan a decade ago to 240
million yuan at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Every cloud has a silver
lining - especially for water-starved Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Continuous downpours in the Chinese capital have ensured that
the city's supplies of water are ensured for two years, experts
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in Beijing is almost 50 percent up because of the
heavy downpours since July.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall has risen to 485 millimeters, increasing by 49 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
As much as 3.89 billion cubic meters of water have been stored
in 16 large reservoirs around the city, an increase of 350 million
cubic meters over last year.
</P>
<P>
The underground water level has also rose by 1.03 meters
between June and July, bringing relief to the city's scarce water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has now been ensured of enough water supplies
for next two years. The city's water conservancy department made
the prediction after completing a survey of the city's

<HEADLINE> IFOR: Bosnian Trouble Spot "Quiet" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Mahala has
been quiet after the Bosnian village saw some renewed ethnic
tension last week, the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) said
today.
</P>
<P>
Major Brett Boudreau, an IFOR spokesman said at a daily news
briefing here that IFOR troops have established checkpoints on
both sides of Mahala, a war-damaged Muslim village on the
"Republika Srpska" side of the demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
Boudreau said that IFOR on Saturday stopped and checked
identifications of 80 Muslim men on their way to Mahala from the
side of the Muslim-Croat Federation. Ten of them believed to be
Bosnian Army soldiers were turned back, while the rest were
allowed to enter the village.
</P>
<P>
"The majority remained overnight, and the area was quiet last
night," said Boudreau, adding that IFOR is continuing patrol in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Serb police apparently attempted to enter the village on
Saturday, but were turned away at IFOR checkpoints, An IFOR
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Serb police clashed with Muslim refugees
returning to the village, which led to the detention of 45 Serb
police by IFOR for violating weapon-prohibiting rules in the
demilitarized zone. They were released in the evening after
turning over their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered a six-hour siege in the nearby town of
Zvornik of a U.N. police station by angry Serbs, who roughed
U.N. police monitors and destroyed their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. International Police
Task force (IPTF), said today that the police force "are concerned
with the fallout of Mahala incident."
</P>
<P>
He said the Serb population in Zvornik was resentful of Muslim
resettlement in Mahala and an anti-IPTF campaign was being
conducted by the local radio station.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Mexican judge issued an
arrest warrant Monday for former Wbc super lightweight champion
Julio Cesar Chavez on charges of tax evasion, according to the
annoucement of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said Chavez and two others involved in the
company Gonzalez Carrasco S.C. were suspected of owing 10.5
million pesos (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who earlier this year lost his World Boxing Council
super lightweight crown to Oscar de la Hoya, of Los Angeles, was
listed as president of the firm.
</P>
<P>
A judge in the northwestern city of Culiacan, the Sinaloa state
capital 1,000 kilometers northwest of Mexico City, also issued
warrants for the arrests of Daniel Viesca Monsivais and Jaime
Vicente Garate Urena on tax evasion charges. The firm rents office
buildings and runs a gas station in Culiacan.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who several years ago was hailed by promoters as the
best fighter, lost to de la Hoya dropping his record down to
97-2-1 with 79 knockouts, following a loss to Franky Randall and a
controversial tie with Pernel Whittaker.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks after the fight with de la Hoya, Chavez was sued

<HEADLINE> US Regards Iraqi Pullout Insignificant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The White House today
dismissed the pullback of Iraqi troops from Irbil as insignificant
and said Saddam must not go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Iraqi troops from Irbil, captured over
the weekend, started today and was reportedly continuing with the
Kurdish city left in the hands of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters on board
Air Force One traveling with President Bill Clinton for a campaign
tour that the news of Iraqi forces leaving Irbil "is not
significant."
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence of an Iraqi redeployment," he said.
"But we see no indication that they are preparing withdrawal back
to their original forward positions."
</P>
<P>
He said Saddam must not go unchallenged. The 20,000 American
troops in the Persian Gulf remain on high alert and two senior
envoys, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili and
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Robert
Pelletreau, traveled to Saudi Arabia and Jordan Sunday and are now
in Cairo holding talks with Egyptian officials on possible action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton has "a defined course of action" to take
against Saddam. But he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's key foreign policy advisers met at the White House
today to review the whole situation in the region after Iraq
announced the withdrawal of its troops from Irbil, 20 km north of
the 36th parallel, which was designated by U.S.-led allies as a
"no fly" zone to protect the Kurds from Iraq's military forces
after the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Accord Reached on Albanian Children's Return to Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have agreed on
the normalization of the educational system for Albanian children
and youth in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the agreement at a press conference here
today, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic expressed
satisfaction with the accord.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic said the agreement was "an important step, in the
first place, of civilizational and humanitarian significance" and
the ethnic Albanian children in the province should no longer
"suffer the consequences of political differences."
</P>
<P>
The accord envisaging the return to schools of ethnic Albanian
students and teachers was signed by Milosevic in Belgrade and
Rugova in the provincial capital of Pristina Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new move finally ended the six-year boycott of the state
school system by the province's ethnic Albanians, which had
continued in spite of repeated calls by Serbian authorities for
the return of young ethnic Albanians to regular schools.
</P>
<P>
It will help ease tension in Kosovo where the ethnic Albanians,
who account for 90 percent of the 2 million population in the
province, have often clashed with local Serbs and Serb police.
</P>
<P>
"Due to its social and humanitarian importance, this agreement
is beyond any political dispute. The concern which both of the
undersigned feel very strongly for the future of the Albanian
children and youth of Kosovo has led them to reach an agreement,"
the Serbian prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
"When young people seriously commit themselves to their
educational and cultural formation, so as to become responsible
citizens, the victory of civilization itself will prevail instead
of the ones over the others," according to the accord.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic also promised that the government of the Republic of
Serbia, for its part, "will do everything necessary for the
agreement on the normalization of the schooling system in Kosovo
to be successful and efficient."
