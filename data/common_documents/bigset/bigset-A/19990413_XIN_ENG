<HEADLINE> Albright Says NATO Needs Patience With War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Medeleine Albright said here Monday that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) needs "patience and pereverance" over the air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After NATO foreign ministers had their special meeting on
Kosovo crisis at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Albright told
reporters that "what has become evident with the military campaign
is that it is systematically biding into and destroying the
machine of repression."
</P>
<P>
The whole campaign "requires patience and perseverance and I am
sure that in the long run or in the medium run even that he (Mr.
Milosevic) is going to be feeling this."
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told there was no plans of ground troops
deployment. After the special ministerial meeting, reporters were
also told that the 19 foreign ministers of the alliance did not
talk about matters concerning ground troops. But some journalists
wondered if the ministers privately discussed certain aspects of
such deployment.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she had discussions on this subject and if the NATO
would change its policy when some turnaround situation would
emerge, Albright said it was not appropriate for her to reveal
anything about any topics she discussed with her counterpart
ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are looking at the whole situation very
carefully, having very open and frank discussions as we are
dealing with this common problem and the question about turnaround
all that I suggest you ask the military," she told an ABC
correspondent at a news briefing after the NATO ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Now, instead of diplomacy backed by the threat of force, we
must use diplomacy in support of force," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, we have damaged but not destroyed his (Mr.
Milosevic) capability. Again and again, Milosevic has raised the
stakes. He is willing to take additional damage, and we must be
willing to bring additional power to bear," she said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO operations will continue until our conditions are met,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
During its special meeting, NATO issued a 15-point statement
including five-point demands to Yugoslavia:
</P>
<P>
- ensure a verifiable stop to all military action and the
immediate ending of violence and repression;
</P>
<P>
- ensure the withdrawal from Kosovo of the military, police and
paramilitary forces;
</P>
<P>
- agree to the stationing in Kosovo of an international
military presence;
</P>
<P>
- agree to the unconditional and safe return of all refugees
and displaced persons and unhindered access to them by
humanitarian aid organizations;
</P>
<P>
- provide credible assurance of his willingness to work on the
basis of the Rambouillet Accords in the establishment of a
political framework agreement for Kosovo in conformity with
international law and the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
NATO also said in the statement that it shares a common
interest with Russia in reaching a political solution to the
crisis in Kosovo and wants to work constructively with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Albright will meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Oslo
on Tuesday in bid to "bridge differences" in U.S.-Russian ties
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We must also keep trying to engage with Russia. Clearly, it is
in Moscow's interest as well as our own that Russia be part of the
solution," she told reporters this afternoon at a news briefing.

<HEADLINE> Ghana,  Nigeria dominate drug trafficking scene: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Franklin Asamoah Mensah, a United
Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) officer said in Accra Monday
that Ghanaian and Nigerian drug trafficking networks continue to
dominate the drug scene.
</P>
<P>
 He said statistics from those arrested from the sub-region,
Europe and North America also indicate that drug couriers of a
variety of west African nationalities are being used to diversify
and subsequently dodge traditional courier profiles, the Ghana
News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
 Mensah was speaking at the opening of a five-day workshop on
the assessment of the drug situation in Ghana. It is aimed, among
other things, at finding modalities to check drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
 It is also meant to train personnel who will in turn train
others to go into the field to undertake an assessment of drug
abuse and illicit trafficking.
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is organized by the Dakar-based UNDCP regional
office for west and central Africa and is attended by participants
from Ghana and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
 Mensah said there is limited reliable data on drug
cultivation, production, manufacture, trafficking and abuse and
this is a major constraint when trying to assess the drug
situation in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
 He said the workshop is therefore to discuss the problem of
data and avoid delaying potentially needed actions.
</P>
<P>
Mensah said any selection of "demand reduction strategy"
within a country should be based on assessment of the prevailing
drug abuse problem.
</P>
<P>
He said cannabis is the most prevalent in west Africa and its
main producers are still assumed to be Ghana and Nigeria followed
by Senegal and Cote d' Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
 Initially four countries in west Africa -- Cote d'Ivoire,
Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal -- had expressed to the UNDCP the
necessity to gauge the drug abuse situation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Holds Ceremony to Mark Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel Monday held a ceremony
in Jerusalem to mark the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes'
Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in the Yad Vashem Museum, which is
dedicated to perpetuating the memory of the 6 million Jews who
perished in the Holocaust in the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and other dignitaries took part in the one-hour
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Weizman said the Jewish people will
never forget the Holocaust and will not let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu contended that if the state of Israel were
established before World War II, the Holocaust might have been
avoided.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel must remain strong in the future so as to ensure
the security of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also mentioned the 112 refugees from the
warring Serbian province of Kosovo, who arrived in Israel on
Monday. He said it is Israel's moral obligation to take in Kosovo
refugees and provide them with humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, six people were chosen to kindle the
memorial flames. They represent the Holocaust survivors who
settled in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The memorial activities, which began at the sunset of Monday,
will continue to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sirens will sound throughout the country for two minutes on
Tuesday morning, when traffic will come to a halt and people will
stand for two minutes in silent tribute to the memory of the
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
And a wreath-laying ceremony at the Yad Vashem Museum will
also be held on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Says Russia and U.N. Should Play Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Monday that Russia and the United Nations should play
their roles in solving the Yugoslav crisis, while calling on NATO
to continue its military pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In his third radio-television speech since the beginning of
NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, Chirac said that the Western
allies "widely agree" that the U.N. Security Council and Russia
should be fully involved in the process of seeking a political
solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"All the discussions I had in the past several days have made
appear...a wide convergence of views on the role of the Security
Council and the necessary association of Russia in the search for
a political solution to the conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
He again justified the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and
said that the bombings are producing effects.
</P>
<P>
"There is not any doubt as for the responsibility of the Serb
regime which is the origin of this crisis and which continues
methodically its criminal action of ethnic cleansing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to act with emergency
in favor of the displaced people in Kosovo while maintaining a
military pressure on Belgrade until it has satisfied "the just
moral and political demands."
</P>
<P>
The French president said that more aid should be sent to
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro which are subjected to a massive
influx of refugees from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Ministry of Health (MOH) survey
in Ghana has identified Northern and Upper West regions as
trachoma-endemic areas.
</P>
<P>
Trachoma is a major cause of blindness.
</P>
<P>
The survey commissioned in 1996 and conducted at Daboya in the
West Gonja district of the Northern region revealed that 23.6
percent of the people have "active trachoma", which makes the
disease a public health problem, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Sylvester Anemana, Northern Regional Director of Health
Services who announced this at the opening of a four-day trachoma
assessment training workshop in Tamale Monday, said further
surveys are needed in the Northern,
</P>
<P>
Upper East and Upper West regions to determine trachoma
prevalence and control.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop organized by the MOH for 25 eye nurses
from Northern and Upper West regions will discuss "community
identification and mobilization for trachoma", "examine the eye
for trachoma" and "trachoma grading and reliability test".
Dr Anemana said under the medium-term health strategy, trachoma
and other endemic diseases would be drastically controlled.
Trachoma alone afflicts about 150 million people, he said, and
expressed the hope that through the active participation of
community health volunteers, the disease can be controlled in
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr David Adiepenah, Northern regional
opthamologist, said trachoma, also known as the "forgotten
disease", plagues most rural dwellers, many of whom fail to report
for treatment. He said the MOH, in conjunction with the World
Health Organization's trachoma initiative and non-governmental
organizations, has set the year 2020 as the target for the
disease's complete eradication.
</P>
<P>
Dr Adiepenah said the fastest and economic way to achieve this
 objective "is by fighting the disease at where it is". Mr George
Ziniel, Regional Chairman of the Ghana Red Cross Society, said the
Swiss Red Cross Society has promised to equip the eye clinic at
the Tamale Regional hospital with a microscope to help in the
fight against trachoma.

<P>
Speaking at the 130th convention of the Inter-Parliamentary

<P>
Angog quoted the Angolan leader as saying at the Brussels

U.N. role in international affairs" and jumping the international
order based on the principle of respect for a nation's
sovereignty.
</P>

Almeida said the Balkan issues must be dealt with through
serious and authorized mediation, and that in this regard, full
consideration must be given to the causes of the issues and to the
interests of the parties concerned.

TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri here on Monday denounced the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for launching airstrikes on
Yugoslavia "without any consultation with the Muslim countries."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud

about massive displacement of the Muslim Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, the two
officials also exchanged views on bilateral relations,
parliamentary cooperation, the Afghan issue and endeavors to
resolve problems in the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the continuation of fighting in Afghanistan, Nouri
said "secret hands" have always tried to hinder unity and
solidarity in the Islamic world. He did not elaborate, however.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, as two important and strategic
countries of the region, will help bolster unity and solidarity in
the Islamic world through deepening their relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Al-Faisal said he was happy to see further
expansion of relations and cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the Muslim countries would make
more efforts to solve the problems in Kosovo and Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Set up State-Owned TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to launch
the country' s first state-owned television station in July, the
Chairman of the Tanzania Broadcasting Commission (TBC), Mark
Bomani, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The broadcasting services of the national station will first
start in the capital Dar es Salaam and its neighboring Coast
Region, then gradually extend to other parts of the country,
Bomani told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
At present, all television stations in the country are
privately owned and the government has been facing financial
constraints in starting a television station.
</P>
<P>
The TBC chairman also called on local and foreign investors to
come forward and cooperate with local owners of television and
radio stations to broaden their services in the country,
especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He urged television and radio station to create their own
programs in Kiswahili language or English, saying that
broadcasting too many foreign programs are eroding Tanzanian
cultural norms.
</P>
<P>
Bomani said although there are many good programs like news
bulletins and special reports about the country's economy,
politics and social activities, the programs need to improve as a
number of them are terrible, threatening the growth of the new
generation.
</P>
<P>
Private radio and television stations began to be licensed to
operate in Tanzania at the beginning of 1994, but they are not
allowed to cover more than 25 percent of the country's territory
according to the 1993 Broadcasting Act.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop for television and radio broadcasters held in the
central region of Morogoro last week, Bomani urged the authorities
to review the act and raise the restriction.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Vaccines for Animal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq sent a letter to the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday demanding urgent
supplies of vaccines for foot and mouth disease (FMD) rampant
among animals in the country, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, said the Iraqi government is in urgent need of these
vaccines as FMD is threatening livestock in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said the supplies of the vaccines must be distributed
according to the national vaccination plan worked out by expertise
in Iraq to exterminate this epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He added all Iraqi animals might be exposed to further
epidemics in the light of reports warning of new infections in
adjacent countries due to the lack of vaccines against FMD.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has demanded the U.N. compensation for its citizens for
their losses caused by the spread of FMD among livestock which
led to the shortage of red meat and dairy.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Iraq set up a strategic vaccination project
capable of producing 12 million doses annually for preventing
animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
The project was suspended due to the 1991 Gulf War and most of
its production and diagnosis equipment were destroyed in 1996 by
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media have reported that some 1.5 million heads of
cattle and sheep have died of FMD so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Bangladeshi Leaders Agree to Enhance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li Peng
exchanged views with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Monday on international and regional issues of common concern, and
they agreed to further enhance bilateral relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Monday evening, Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
informed Hasina of the Chinese government's views on
multi-polarization, diversification and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attaches importance to the friendly
relations of good-neighborliness with its neighboring countries,
including Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
China is now focusing on economic development, and therefore
needs stability at home and wishes to have a peaceful environment
in the world, especially in the areas surrounding the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the positive contributions that Bangladesh
has made in promoting regional stability and world peace by
pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality and non-alignment, said
the Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Li's current visit to Bangladesh, Hasina said that
Bangladesh has received uninterrupted assistance from China in its
national economic development, which the Bangladeshi people will
never forget.
</P>
<P>
She said that the major challenge facing the country is to
eradicate poverty, and hence she wishes to develop economic and
trade cooperation with friendly countries including China, so as
to promote the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Both Li and Hasina also agreed that it is imperative to enhance
 solidarity and cooperation among developing countries, especially
at a time when the world situation is undergoing profound changes,
and when opportunities and challenges coexist.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both China and Bangladesh are located in Asia, and
are developing countries, they agreed that to develop long-term
friendship relations of good-neighborliness is in conformity with
the long-term and fundamental interest of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, who last visited this South Asian nation in 1989 as
premier, arrived here on Monday afternoon on a two-day goodwill
official visit to Bangladesh, the fifth leg of his six-nation
European and Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Establishment of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Monday voiced Tehran's support for establishing an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people's historical rights should be respected,
said Khatami while meeting with Farouk Kadoumy, Chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state would be a prelude to restoring the rights of the oppressed
Palestinian people and liberation of the entire holy land of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Palestine belongs to the Palestinian people, Khatami said,
adding that nobody has the right to offer anything on behalf of
the Palestinian people or compromise their principles.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Palestine's destiny cannot be determined
without the votes of all Palestinians, including Muslims, Jews
and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Iran condemned the compromising process in the Middle East,
and the compromise is a vain process from legal, ideological and
analytical points of view and would not be effective in reality,
said Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that justice would prevail not only in
Palestine, but elsewhere in the world and said that justice might
be suppressed but would not be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Islamic Republic of Iran would never
recognize the Israeli regime and it believes that usurpation,
aggression and assassination do not reserve any right for
anybody.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that defending the Palestinian people's rights
and struggles, and condemning the aggressions on them have been
intermingled with Iran's Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The bond between Iranian revolution and people and
Palestinian people is historical and cannot be broken easily, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) have been strained after the PAN signed a peace accord
with Israel in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy thanked Iran for its support for the Palestinian
people and briefed Khatami on the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Previous experience has shown that Israel is not for peace and
the U.S., which has played a key role in creation of the Israeli
entity, is incapable of forcing the regime to withdraw from the
occupied lands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy, who arrived here on Friday, also noted that
Israel would continue its policy of developing Jewish settlements,
devastating Palestinian homes and occupying their residential
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Education Coverage Doubles in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education of
Ethiopia said Monday that the national education coverage has
doubled over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Public relation head of the ministry, Shimeles Letike, said
that the national education coverage which was only 19.6 percent
in 1993 has currently reached 42 percent, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shimeles said the five-year National Education Development
Program launched in 1997 aims at increasing the over-all education
coverage to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the progress made so far there could be a
significant rise beyond the targeted coverage within the next
three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shimeles said the National Education Development Program has
given special attention to the rural parts of the country, adding
that efforts are also being made to balance education distribution
in urban and rural areas.

KUWAIT CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and the United States
signed here Monday a Glob agreement aimed at increasing
environmental cooperation among schools in the two countries, as
well as in other countries.
</P>
<P>

<P>
For his part, Al-Ghanem said "we cannot live in a world
without cooperation with others and exchanging views and
information."
</P>
<P>

Crisis
</P>
<P>
 NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry J.
Rawlings Monday welcomed United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's call on Russia to play a role in finding a
peaceful solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs Albright's invitation to Russia is in the right
direction," Rawlings said in Accra, adding that NATO's bombing is
creating a lot of discomfort and could escalate and spill into
Albania, a Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings who has called for a negotiated settlement to the
crisis in Yugoslavia said Belgrade has already been made aware
that it cannot carry out "the murderous campaign" it did in
Bosnia a few years back.
</P>
<P>
He made these points when a Japanese envoy called on him at
the Castle, Osu, to seek Ghana's support for his bid to become
Director-General of United Nations Education and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
 Koichiro Matsuura, Japanese ambassador in France, said his
candidature has the full backing of the government of Japan.
</P>
<P>
 Matsuura, who was in Ghana between 1961 and 1963, spoke about
his country and said from a humble beginning "Japan now has the
capacity and the will to help other countries."
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings said several candidates have emerged for the post
which is now being occupied by Mr Federico Mayor of Spain.
</P>
<P>
He told Mr Matsuura: "among the various candidates we find you
one of the most capable. Your chances are as good as those of the
others."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said in seeking to create a just world, the role of
UNESCO is vital in view of the need to step up its education
programs. "The role of UNESCO cannot be ruled out."

<HEADLINE> UK Offers $70m to Back Rwandan Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain promised Monday to offer
about 70 million U.S. dollars to help boost the small central
African country's budget in the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed by the visiting British Secretary of
State for International Cooperation, Clare Short and Rwanda's
Vice-President, Major General Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
The pledged assistance will serve to help Rwanda to enhance good
 governance, conflict resolution, human resources, education, and
health services, a story by the Rwanda News Agency reaching here
Monday said.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwandan Minister of Finance, Britain has already
disbursed 50 million U.S. dollars pledged during last June
Stockholm (Sweden) Round- Table of donors, and 10 million more to
the Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
This Monday, Clare Short also signed an agreement with Kaberuka
 equivalent to eight million dollars in support of Rwanda's
revenue collection office, the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA).
</P>
<P>
''We hope that the signing of this protocol will seal our
determination to extend it to other areas of cooperation,''
highlighted Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Today's British aid to Rwanda marked a turning point in the
disbursement of foreign assistance to Rwanda pledged in Stockholm,
Sweden, in June of last year, the Rwanda News Agency story said.
</P>
<P>
With the outbreak of war in Congo (K), donor countries froze
their financial aid to Rwanda for fear that it might be used for
the military campaign of its troops in Congo.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain supports the current mediation efforts aimed
at brokering a peace deal in Congo, Short told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
''We want a just peace which includes security concerns of
Rwanda which we fully understand,'' she underscored.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
and several others wounded Monday afternoon by a roadside bomb
in south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated on a road near the Israeli-held
Beaufort Castle position just on the verge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery forces bombarded the villages
near the Beaufort Castle which are believed to be hideouts for
Hezbollah guerrillas. There has been no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The blast raised to eight the number of the Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In February, a total of seven Israelis, including a
general, was killed during the Hezbollah separate ambushes.
</P>
<P>
The mounting Israeli losses rekindled the heated debate inside
Israel over a withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
In another development which follows the killing of the Israeli
soldier, Hezbollah announced that one of its fighters was killed
during his operation against an Israeli position inside the
border enclave. But it did not provide any details.

MAPUTO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the signatory
states of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Use,
Storage, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Land-Mines and
their Destruction will be held in Maputo between May 3 to 7, a
senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said at a press conference here

from 150 countries and organizations have been invited to the
meeting.
</P>

countries which lack the means to do so, like Mozambique, help
from international community is needed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Praises Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of fresh
U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the
West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday
pledged to further expand settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said
while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land
between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to
local television reports.
</P>
<P>
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million
U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between
the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and
planned for high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's tour came only one day after a senior U.S. envoy
publicly slammed Israel's intensified settlement activities in the
West Bank in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin
Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the
ongoing expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the
Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a
responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can
affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that
the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and
the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion
of existing Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996,
millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of
new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the
Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, his main rival in the May elections for prime
ministership, accuses Netanyahu of giving in to Jewish settlers
to ensure their support for his power.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the industrial park, Netanyahu asked some
100 settlement leaders to work for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four
tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba
outside Hebron Monday.
</P>
<P>
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's
perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military
area and ordered them to leave.

<HEADLINE> Solana Says Yugoslavia Must be Integrated by Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Javier Solana, told reporters
here Monday that the countries of the Former Yugoslavia and their
neighbors must be brought into the European mainstream.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we begin to look beyond the crisis in
Kosovo," Solana told a news briefing after NATO foreign ministers
finish their special meeting here at NATO headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"They must all be able to enjoy the same peace, security and
prosperity as the other countries of Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The years of confrontation must come to an end in southeastern
Europe or there will be no future for its people," the NATO chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the military bloc issued a 15-point statement during
its special ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the
NATO's decision-making body. "NATO's air strikes will be pursued
until President Milosevic accedes to the demands of the
international community. President Milosevic knows what he has to
do," the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The 19 allies also insist on a five-point demands to
Yugoslavia, demonstrating their determination to keep the war
against Yugoslavia going on.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief of allies stressed their goal of going after
war for peace. "Today we confirmed that we will play a full part
in a comprehensive approach to stabilize this region. Such an
approach which should address the political, economic, security
and humanitarian aspects must involve a number of instiltutions
but NATO will have its role to play," he said.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Elected SPD Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
was elected with weaker support than expected the new chairman of
the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) by a special party
congress Monday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder won 370 of the 487 valid votes, with 102 oppositions
and 15 abstentions. About 515 delegates of the SPD took part in
the congress.
</P>
<P>
One month after the surprise resignation of the popular SPD
traditionalist Oscar Lafontaine both as party chairman and finance
minister, Schroeder is to formally head the party.
</P>
<P>
The SPD has showed its ability to make responsible decision,
Schroeder said after the congress, adding that the cabinet
governed by the party could now go out of the hard time.
</P>
<P>
As an unopposed candidate for party chairman, Schroeder has got
the worst result in SPD's history since 1946. Nevertheless,
Schroeder was able to consolidate his power with the victory.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal written in the press that the party does
not love me, and I would say there is some truth to this,"
Schroeder admitted.
</P>
<P>
"What I want is something else, I want respect for my work and
your support for my job," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the congress, the SPD delegates passed despite
opposition from the party pacifists a resolution backing NATO
strikes against Yugoslavia until Belgrade withdraws its troops
from Kosovo and allows the refugees to return home.

Jordanian officials have expressed satisfaction with the
visit. They hailed as "constructive and cordial" Abdullah's talks
with Fahd, which touched on bilateral ties and a number of other
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between Saudi Arabia and Jordan were affected by
Amman's siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War triggered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which had been the largest donor for Jordan,
suspended its nearly 200 million U.S. dollars in annual economic
aid and cut its oil supply to the country after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the two Arab kingdoms have been
making efforts to amend the damaged ties, which saw a boost since
Jordanian King Hussein's death and Abdullah's succession to the
throne of the Hashemite Kingdom on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has sent several ministers to Jordan to
follow up closely the financial situation there and promised to
provide necessary help.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh has granted Jordan 250 million dollars since last
February, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It also deposited 450 million dollars at the Jordanian central
bank in an effort to help the Jordanian economy, the agency said.

GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) before the end of 1999 is vital both for
China and the WTO, said WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The recent meeting of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and
U.S. President Bill Clinton (in Washington) has brought the
negotiation for China's entry to the WTO very near its

"Seeing from the WTO point of view, it is also positive that a

<HEADLINE> Trimble Says IRA Can Bring Peace by Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Assembly's first
minister David Trimble said on Monday the peace process in
Northern Ireland was now dependent on the commitment of republican
groups to turn their back on violence.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who is also Ulster Unionist leader, told BBC Radio 4's
Today program the peace declaration issued two weeks ago had the
"potential" to work but questioned the republican's commitment to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said what was at stake was a question of whether Sinn
Fein leaders and the people for whom they speak were actually
committed to the agreement or not.
</P>
<P>
"But the question is whether the organizations for which they
speak are committed to the agreement and are prepared to turn
their back (on violence)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was speaking ahead of a week of renewed negotiations to
find a solution to the stalled process.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Unionists refuse to form the assembly's
executive with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins decommissioning its
weapons. But Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, insists
decommissioning is not a precondition laid out in last year's Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern are expected to mount another attempt to restart the
peace process on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the political parties involved will hold separate
meetings on Monday to formulate their opinions on the Hillsborough
declaration proposed by the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam will lead discussions
between the pro-agreement parties on Tuesday and will be joined by
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews and his Junior Minister Liz
O'Donnell.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday expressed deep regrets over the canceling of
peace talks by Agfhanistan's warring party the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban leadership decided over the week that they would
not resume the negotiations which had started in Ashkabad,
Turkmenistan, last month, which was under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by U.N. spokesman's office said "The
Secretary-General is concerned that this development will lead to
the intensification of fighting between the Taleban and the United
Front, thus inflicting more suffering on the people of Afghanistan
and more destruction in an already devastated country."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will resume consultations with the two
sides, as well as with other Afghans, interested Members States
to explore the scope for agreement on confidence-building measures
which might help to contain the current level of fighting and
might hopefully draw the two sides back to peaceful discussion,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan warring parties the Taleban and the opposition
alliance held peace talks last month in Ashkabad, Turkmenistan,
under the U.N. auspices. During the talks, the two sides agreed
in principle on the creation of a coalition government to
include all of the country's political forces. They also agreed
to continue their talks this month.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government on
Monday named Bosse Ringholm, president of the Labor Market
Committee, as new finance minister to replace Erik Aasbrink, who
resigned from the post on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Aasbrink attributed his resignation to the lack of support from
Prime Minister Goran Persson on economic policies lately.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Persson told a news conference on the day that
the change of finance minister, a key portfolio in the cabinet,
will not affect the government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Ringholm also told the conference that the key task awaiting
him is to boost economic growth while maintaining the nation's
social security system.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the main reason for Aasbrink to quit the
job lied in the fact that Persson and Aasbrink shared different
views on tax policies.
</P>
<P>
They said Persson wants to cut taxes in order to boost economic
growth, while the former finance minister insisted not to do it
until the government's financial situation allows to take the step
in the future.

BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed and
several others wounded Monday afternoon by a roadside bomb in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated on a road near the Israeli-held
Beaufort Castle position just on the verge of the Israeli-occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north

Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries to Jointly Attract Investment: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel Monday expressed belief that the 14
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries would make
joint efforts to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries are likely to align their incentives to attract
investment, but this could take some time because of their
different needs and market conditions, Manuel told a media
briefing in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Manuel made the remarks when 11 members of the 14-nation
trading bloc are currently negotiating a free trade agreement,
which was the subject of a two-day conference organized by the
Trade and Industry Department of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Manuel noted that more effort was needed to minimize conflict
between SADC countries competing for the same investments and care
had to be taken to minimize market distortions.
</P>
<P>
He said the wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo
were hampering policy implementation within the SADC, adding war
represented the worst kind of tax on future generations because it
destroyed infrastructure and left countries with huge debts.
</P>
<P>
Mfundo Nkhulu, chief director of African trade relations in the
Trade and Industry Department, said it was hoped the the SADC free
trade agreement would be implemented at the beginning of next
year.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, established in 1992, consists of Angola, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia, Mauritius, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Seychelles and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Russia Duma Postpones Yeltsin Impeachment Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Party leaders in Russia's State
Duma, lower house of parliament, agreed on Monday to put off
indefinitely a vote starting the impeachment process against
President Boris Yeltsin, planned for Thursday, the Agrarian Party
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov told the press that a new date
would be set after the Duma adopted detailed voting rules and
other procedures. The party leaders form the majority of the
managing Duma Council, which will make a formal decision on the
postponement.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin told the Russian parliament on Monday
that he opposed plans to postpone a vote in the State Duma lower
house, which was scheduled for Thursday to formally launch
impeachment proceedings against him, the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of his telephone conversation with the Duma
speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, earlier today, the president
reiterated his position that the issue should either be considered
now or dropped for good," said a Kremlin spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said he believed the vote could hardly take place
before mid-May. He said a working group would begin drawing up
regulations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov and other parliamentary leaders have said that they
think it unwise to move ahead on impeachment when Russia is
opposing NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has urged lawmakers not to vote
for impeachment. In a television address on Saturday he said the
move risked destabilising the country.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-led Duma seeks to impeach Yeltsin on five charges,
including undermining the Soviet Union, dissolving the Soviet-era
parliament in 1993 and launching an ill-fated war in the rebel
region of Chechnya in 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
If any of these charges wins 300 votes in the 450-seat Duma, it
will go to the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court for
examination. A final decision on impeachment would be up to the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary experts say that only the Chechen charge has a
small chance of getting the required 300 votes in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that some Duma leaders, headed by Seleznyov, had
suggested that the vote be put off because Yeltsin is spearheading
Moscow's opposition to NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, an
issue which has consolidated feuding Russian political forces.

HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat here Monday that he has so far received positive
response from all the countries he has visited to consult on his
intention to declare Palestine an independent state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Some of the places visited so far included the European Union,
Sudan, Germany, Japan, Russia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after a two-hour meeting with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Arafat said he was happy with the support
and the work being done by an international committee preparing
for the independence celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader who arrived in Harare Sunday night
briefed Mugabe on progress in the need to declare a Palestinian
state and sought the Zimbabwean leader's support.
</P>
<P>
"I had a positive and fruitful discussion with Mugabe,
especially on the consultation on establishment of independence
celebrations for the state of Palestine," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he believed confrontation on the move could be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
"I will be briefing my brothers about that advice soon," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians had for many years been calling on all countries
to support an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo agreement of 1993 set an independent Palestine state
by May this year, but the Israelis have been resisting efforts to
declare Palestine a sovereign country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Takes Tax-Hikes as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese new government, which
took office last December, finally tabled a bold measure Wednesday
to raise revenues by tax hikes, a sovereign remedy expected to
revitalize the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The tax increases, which includes a controversial 20-percent
more tax in gasoline, was announced on Wednesday night following a
weekly cabinet session along with the 1999 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill pegged revenue for 1999 at 3.2 billion dollars, and
spending at 5.5 billion dollars, compared with the respective
figures of 2.9 billion dollars and 5.2 billion dollars for 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the increase in petrol price alone could
add at least 120 million U.S. dollars annually to the treasury
coffer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also decided to raise taxes on
non-essential imported commodities such as liquor, cigarettes,
flowers, jewelry, yachts, wrist watches, cheese, fireworks, cloths
and furs that are beyond the poor classes' consumption.
</P>
<P>
These sweeping tax increases on commodities would ensure
another 1.5 million dollars a month for the treasury income.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Anwar Khalil has explained that the price
hikes were aimed at raising more revenues and thus meet the
targeted 1999 budget deficit of 40.2 percent of expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese economy is undergoing a record recession since the
end of the 1975-1990 civil war with public debt climbing to 18
billion dollars, among the highest in the world on the per capita
basis.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit, which finished at 14 percent of gross
domestic product last year, though down from 24 percent in 1997,
is viewed by economists as dangerously massive.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Salim Hoss attributed the main
responsibility to the haphazard spending in the post-war
reconstruction drive by the six cabinets under former Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's austere economic policy, most
of the country's economists and politicians said this is a first
step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Former House Speaker Hussein Husseini hailed the budget bill as
"based on the country's true capacities."
</P>
<P>
He called on various sectors, including all economic and social
institutions and unions to support the government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill provoked stiff opposition from the country's
largest trade union group General Labor Confederation (GLC), which
groups about 35,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
"We have incessantly counseled the government against this
(gasoline) tax. We have publicly warned that the gasoline price
is political sulphur but the government has turned a deaf ear,"
said GLC Chairman Abu Rizk.
</P>
<P>
The former Hariri government had also tried to raise revenues
by increasing gasoline price but abandoned in light of GLC's
protest threat and strong opposition of House Speaker Nabih Berri,
a long-time political rival of Hariri.

The union has again threatened to take to the street, saying
the gasoline tax will affect all classes and make unendurable
living conditions of the middle-income and low-income classes.

<P>
Political sources said that even if protests happened, it
would be of limited impact in view of the consensus reached among
President Emile Lahoud, Hoss and Berri on the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is now busy preparing a five-year plan, which aims
at eventually eliminating the budget deficit and bringing down
public debt, and will submit it along with the budget bill to the
parliament for debate which is expected to take place next month.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the tax plan is of greater significance
than the budget bill because it would present a clearer view of
the government's economic policy in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Poll Delay May Harm Confidence in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Any delay in the upcoming
elections could negatively affect investor confidence in South
Africa, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
International investors had already discounted the fact that
the election would take place and that irrational statements would
be made, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the series of court actions by opposition parties
aimed at extending voting rights to South Africans abroad could
prove problematic if they caused a delay in the poll, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of June, in parts of the country it is almost
impossible to have people standing in queues. Winter sets in --
it's very very uncomfortable for people.
</P>
<P>
"You are then looking at a much later period (for the poll)."
</P>
<P>
Manuel said this would have a number of negative consequences,
including a delay in the next parliament session.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing from our perspective is that the
election be allowed to proceed on June 2 and run its course,"
Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Following a court ruling that South African prisoners should be
allowed to vote, opposition parties lodged law suits, demanding
the voting rights for those working or otherwise staying abroad at
the election day.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) vowed to continue its war against Yugoslavia
when foreign ministers of the alliance met here Monday at NATO

The military bloc issued a 15-point statement during its
special ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the
NATO's decision-making body. "NATO's air strikes will be pursued
until President Milosevic accedes to the demands of the
international community. President Milosevic knows what he has to
do," the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The 19 allies insist on a five-point demands to Yugoslavia:
</P>
<P>

immediate ending of violence and repression;
</P>
<P>
- ensure the withdrawal from Kosovo of the military, police and
paramilitary forces;
</P>
<P>

political framework agreement for Kosovo in conformity with
international law and the Charter of the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba said
here Monday that more than 80 percent of Zambia's economy is now
in private hands.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 1999 Zambia-United Kingdom Cooperation Week,
Chiluba said that "we have in less than seven years brought an
economy which was 80 percent in the hands of the state to 180
degrees round to more than 80 percent in the private sector hands
today."
</P>
<P>
He said that British investment in Zambia has always been
significant. Today more and more British firms are investing in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Britain has for the past eight years maintained the top
position in investment in Zambia with pledges totalling 250
million U.S. dollars, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain remains one of the largest bilateral aid donors
to Zambia and has been actively involved in the development of
zambia's health and education sectors, small and medium
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said, "many enterprising Zambians want an opportunity for
business not charity, we want more business as a country, not just
aid."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia wants debt write-off because "it will give
us opportunity to develop and we are happy the UK has championed
the call for better terms on debt repayment."
</P>
<P>
He urged Britain to carry on the message to the meeting of the
G7 next june.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Commission Opens 1999 Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Disarmament Commission opened its 1999 session here Monday with
focus on conventional weapons, nuclear-weapons-free zones and a
General Assembly special session.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, Jayantha Dhanapala,
under-secretary-general for disarmament affairs, said sustainable
disarmament had lagged far behind sustainable development, but the
Disarmament Commission had an opportunity to contribute to the
former by shedding light on common objectives, as well as on the
differences that divided States.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala said the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones
challenged international diplomacy and yet, the nightmare of a
world full of "nuclear-weapon-full zones" should be a motivation
to continue the efforts.
</P>
<P>
As for the possible convening of a fourth special session of
the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, he said there was an
urgent need to weave the epochal international changes into the
multilateral disarmament order, but to seek end results when the
Commission's charge was to promote agreement on the agenda and
timing would be putting the cart before the horse.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of formulating conventional arms control
guidelines, he said advocacy on practical disarmament measures
need not compromise the right to self-defense nor draw attention
from nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Like development, disarmament was also a process, and one that
must be sustained over many years, pursued through many venues and
opened to contributions from many entities, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Cooperation With Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Monday called for further cooperation between Iran
and Saudi Arabia to stabilize oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
If Iran and Saudi Arabia adopt a unified stance in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), it will
produce very effective results, Rafsanjani told visiting Saudi
Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tehran-Riyadh cooperation would encourage other
oil producing states toward more cooperation, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Stability in the oil market demanded political determination
of the oil producing countries, said Rafsanjani, current chairman
of the powerful advisory State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
He called on OPEC to draw up specific plans and make necessary
forecasts so as to protect the production and sale of oil.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal said that Iran and Saudi Arabia, in light of their
strategic situation in the region, can forge a more suitable
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two countries in the area of oil
was a successful example of mutual cooperation in OPEC, he said,
expressing regret that the OPEC policies in the past were
monopolistic and that overproduction was the cause of rivalry
between the member states.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped for stronger cooperation among the OPEC members,
particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the oil
market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Air Base to Back Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- President Clinton Monday
visited Barksdale Air Force Base, which has been sending B-52 and
A-10 bombers on missions to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Barksdale is home to the 2nd Bomb Wing, which has members
deployed in Europe as part of the NATO mission in Yugoslavia.
Clinton was meeting privately with air crews that recently
returned from flying combat missions over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He called the plight of ethnic Albanian refugees "a human
tragedy that touches everyone," and said it is incumbent upon the
United States to stanch the crisis before it escalates into a
wider war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We would like to nip this conflict in the bud
before it destabilizes all of Europe. We don't want American
soldiers... to die on distant battlefields in large numbers."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was accompanied by Defense Secretary William Cohen;
Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff;
and Sens. Mary Landrieu and John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters the NATO airstrikes are taking a toll on
Serb forces, lowering their morale and prompting some to desert.
</P>
<P>
He said there is "a growing consensus and a strong consensus"
in Congress for the current air campaign, and that the Clinton
administration will not consider the possibility of ground troops
since the NATO command has not requested them.
</P>
<P>
However, "should it become necessary, we'll take it under
advisement," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton came to deliver a message of support to the men and
women in uniform and their families.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Washington, Clinton will gather House and
Senate leaders at the White House Monday night for a report on the
Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
National security spokesman David Leavy said Clinton expects to
review the air campaign and discuss an emergency appropriation to
finance the Kosovo mission. He will meet with a larger group of
lawmakers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the president has faced relatively muted criticism over
his handling of the Kosovo operation and reliance on air power
amidst a growing refugee crisis caused by the warfare.
</P>
<P>
With Congress returning from a two-week recess Monday, that
dynamic could change as lawmakers challenge Clinton's
determination against ground forces.

LONDON April 12 (Xinhua) - Europe's major markets bounced back
in late trading on Monday as Wall Street recovered from early
falls, but ended largely in the minus column.
</P>
<P>
After sliding more than 70 points in the first 30 minutes of
trade, the Dow clambered back up. By the London close, the Wall
Street's benchmark was down only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the recound, the FTSE 100 ended down 31.6, or 0.5
percent, at 6441.2, having bottomed out at 6377.2 just after
midday.
</P>
<P>
A bearish mood had gripped London from the start of trade as
investors reacted to a profits warning from US computer giant
Compaq late Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, UK analysts said that fundamentals remain positive for
the London equity market, particularly after last week's wave of
rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the only major European bourse to close higher on
the session, trade continued to draw some upward momentum from
last week's half-percentage-point rate cut by the European Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax index of leading shares closed up 33.6 points at
5167. However, trading was thin with one trader saying that
investors were not attracted by the German market with uncertainty
over the policies of the government, especially over wage
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed slightly down in Paris in thin trading with
earlier losses largely recovered as Wall Street bounced back from
its opening declines.
</P>
<P>
The Cac-40 index, which at one point was down 50 points, closed
down 8 points at 4335.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says no Consensus in NATO or U.S. for Ground Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) --U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Monday that there is no consensus in the United States,
the Congress or NATO for introduction of ground troops into the
fight in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"And there is no need, according to our commanding officers, so
until such time as that changes... we would not even consider it,"
Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, calls increased in Congress for just such an option as
members began returning to town after a two-week spring recess.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made his assessment at Barksdale Air Force Base, La.,
where he accompanied President Clinton on a trip to thank the
service personnel who have been responsible for some of the B-52
and A-10 bombing attacks against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said the bombing campaign is showing results.
</P>
<P>
"We are systematically choking off the Yugoslav army and
security forces in Kosovo by cutting their supply lines," Cohen
said. "As we isolate and weaken the Serb forces in Kosovo, we are
launching aggressive attacks against troops on the ground by
hitting staging areas, headquarters and forces in the field....
</P>
<P>
"NATO's campaign is showing results," he continued. "We're
seeing decreasing military mobility and eroding morale" among the
Serbs, who are seeking to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Congress returns from two weeks off to debate whether
to sanction the use of ground troops to drive Serbian forces out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his aides have emphasized they will not negotiate
with Milosevic, and the only way he can stop the NATO airstrikes
is to remove his troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to return,
give Kosovo autonomy and let in NATO peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain, who recently returned from a trip to the
Balkans with Cohen, said he would seek a resolution giving the
president the authority to use all means necessary, including
ground troops, to "achieve the stated goals" in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Develop New Male Contraceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Monday
they have developed a pill-patch combination method of
contraception for men.
</P>
<P>
The success of clinical trials using the method brings an
easy-to-take reversible male contraception a step closer, Dr Fred
Wu and colleagues, of Manchester Royal Infirmary, told the British
Endocrine Societies annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
The researchers carried out their trials on 23 local male
volunteers who took a progesterone hormone pill, while wearing a
body patch containing the sex hormone testosterone.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were divided into three different groups,
receiving low, medium and high levels of the progesterone pill.
</P>
<P>
Most of the men in the high and medium groups showed no active
sperm after three months. When they stopped taking the pill, their
sperm counts gradually returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
The method has still to be optimized, but this work will lead
to a more user-acceptable method of male contraception, the
researchers believed.

JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (xinhua) -- visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Monday night described his talks with South African
president Nelson Mandela as satisfactory, but declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was speaking at Mandela's Johannesburg residence after

The Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement earlier

Arafat, who arrived in South Africa Monday afternoon, will
leave the country Monday night , officials said.

Mandela met Arafat in Helsinki last month where the statehood
option was discussed. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Help West African Countries Implement Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) said here on Monday it had decided to
work with the Organization of African Unity and the Economic
Commission of West African States to implement an arms moratorium
in 16 West African countries.
</P>
<P>
UNDP said the goal is to reduce the number of small arms and
weapons that fuel the region's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is providing 2.1 million U.S. dollars in funding for the
13 million dollars effort.
</P>
<P>
The arms moratorium has been launched as part of UNDP's
Program for Coordination and Assistance for Security and
Development in Africa, which addresses security challenges in the
region that are linked to the proliferation of small arms.
</P>
<P>
Activities under the moratorium include the establishment of
arms database, education and public awareness campaigns, training
for security forces, a review of legislation governing the
purchase of small arms, and the collection and destruction of
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks U.N. Body to Determine Legal Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday asked the
International court of Justice to determine the legal consequences
of NATO's military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia asked for the highest U.N. legal body's opinion in a
draft resolution submitted to the U.N. General Assembly committee
which deals with strengthening and upholding of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution said individual nations and regional
organizations cannot use force against sovereign states without
the authorization of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"No considerations, whether political, economic, military or of
any other kind, may be used to justify the threat or use of force
in violation of the Charter of the United Nations," the draft
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It requested the international Court of Justice to give its
opinion on the legal consequences such unauthorized intervention
would have for the United Nations and for peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
Russia brought its position to the Security Council last month
and demanded an end to NATO's military strikes against Yugoslavia,
but it was blocked.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the United
States edged up a modest 0.2 percent in March as falling food
costs helped to offset the biggest increase in energy prices in
more than two years, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in the Consumer Price Index was up
slightly from 0.1 percent gains turned in for both January and
February, but still showed that inflation is remaining under
control.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer inflation is rising at an annual
rate of 1.5 percent, slightly lower than the 1.6 percent price
rise recorded for all of 1998, the best performance on the
inflation front since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Economists are expecting prices will advance at a faster clip
this year as the global economy begins to recover from last year's
severe financial crisis and prices of commodities such as oil
begin to rise as demand picks up.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices jumped 1.6 percent in March. It was the first
increase since a small 0.1 percent rise last October and the
biggest one-month gain in energy prices since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose 3.7 percent in March, their biggest rise
since August 1997. Analysts expect gasoline prices to continue
rising in the months ahead as refiners pass on the costs of a 27
percent surge in crude petroleum prices following the decision of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut back on
production in an effort to firm up prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the big gain in energy prices last month was partially
offset by a 0.2 percent fall in food costs, the biggest one-month
drop in this category since September 1997. The price declines
were led by a 5.5 percent plunge in the vegetable prices. The
price of tomatoes dropped by 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent rise in overall inflation was slightly below
analysts expectations. They had been looking for a 0.3 percent
jump in March because of the rapid run-up in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, inflation
was well-behaved with the so-called core inflation rate rising
just 0.1 percent, matching the small increases recorded in January
and February.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares increased by 4.7 percent last month. During the
first three months of this year, airline fares jumped 41.8 percent
at an annual rate, the sharpest increase for any of the major
categories in the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
While economists believe that rising energy costs will add
probably 0.6 percentage point to overall inflation this year, they
look for inflation to remain tamed in other areas.
</P>
<P>
If that forecast is correct, it should give the Federal Reserve
the leeway to leave interest rates unchanged.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia continuing and
military commanders seeking another dramatic increase in the
number of warplanes, the alliance's 19 foreign ministers launched
a diplomatic offensive Monday to convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that he must halt military action in Kosovo
before the bombing raids cause the destruction of his country.
</P>
<P>
-- A federal judge Monday held President Bill Clinton in
contempt of court for giving "intentionally false" testimony about
his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky in the Paula Jones
lawsuit, marking the first time that a sitting president has been
sanctioned for disobeying a court order.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon plans to approve the deployment of 300 more
warplanes to use against Yugoslavia, deepening American
involvement so significantly that President Clinton will almost
surely have to call up Air Force reserves, senior officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian parliamentary leaders voted to delay indefinitely a
planned vote on the impeachment of President Boris Yeltsin,
stepping back from another showdown between the Kremlin and the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration will try to sell a hostile
Congress on a WTO China pact that it doesn't yet officially back.
Meanwhile, Europe is set to start its own WTO talks with China.
</P>
<P>
-- In Jakarta, a son of Suharto was charged with corruption.
Meanwhile, the World Bank delayed 600 million U.S. dollars in
loans, fearing misuse with elections near.

<HEADLINE> France Suspends Cooperation With Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- France decided to suspend its
cooperation with Niger on Tuesday after the assassination of
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara and the coup by a group of army
officers last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"France decides to suspend immediately and until a new order (
is established) all military cooperation with the authorities of
Niamey, as well as programs of civil cooperation which do not
directly benefit the people," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France is Niger's biggest trade partner and aid provider.
</P>
<P>
"France reiterates with firmness its condemnation of the coup
which has cost the live of President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara and
is a step back for the democracy in Niger," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Army commander Daouda Mallam Wanke, who on Sunday succeeded the
presidency of Niger and is leading ruling Council of National
Reconciliation consisting of 14 military officers, has promised to
hand over power to a civilian government after a nine-month
interim period.
</P>
<P>
Paris provided Niger with a public development aid of 440
million francs (73 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, and sent Niamey
structural readjustment aid of 90 million francs (15 million U.S.
dollars) and 115 million francs (19 million U.S. dollars) in 1997
and 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
France has also helped the Niger government reach a national
pacification with the rebellious Touareg minority tribe in the
north of the country over the past several years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Up 0.2 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose 0.2
percent in March to a seasonally adjusted 239.6 billion U.S.
dollars as consumers rushed spring shopping for an early Easter
and spent big tax refunds, the Commerce Department said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, which represent about a third of the nation's
economic output, have kept increasing for eight months in a row,
reflecting the strong consumer demand as a result of rising
incomes and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The modest rise in March came on top of big sales gains of 1.3
percent in January and 1.7 percent in February, the biggest
monthly jump in five years. Both the January and February figures
were revised upward from previous estimates -- February's
substantially, from 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the March rise, tax refunds were up nearly 20
percent compared to this time last year and usual holiday shopping
sprees came early, since Easter fell on April 4.
</P>
<P>
Also driving the recent stretch of robust sales: Unemployment
is near a 29-year low, stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones
average of industrial stocks have hit record highs and interest
rates are tame.
</P>
<P>
Americans' appetite for shopping is helping keep economic
growth brisk even though the country's export sales are slow
because of global economic problems that began two years ago in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In March, sales of durable goods, items expected to last three
years or more, fell 0.2 percent, after rising a big 2.7 percent in
February. The March decline was the first since July.
</P>
<P>
Automotive sales were off 0.5 percent and sales at building
supply and hardware stores fell 0.4 percent, also after much
larger gains the month before.
</P>
<P>
Sales at furniture stores, however, continued to rise, by 0.2
percent in March. Low mortgage rates have fueled a home-buying
boom that has led to spending on new furnishings.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile auto sales, total retail sales were up 0.5
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and gasoline were up 0.6
after rising by 1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Sales at apparel and accessory shops jumped 1.6 percent and
rose 0.7 percent at department and general merchandise stores. At
grocery and other food stores, sales dropped 0.5 percent after a
1.5 percent increase in February, and bar and restaurant patronage
declined by 0.4 percent. Drug store sales were up 1 percent and
sales at gasoline service stations rose 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Send More Soldiers to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to deploy an
additional 1,800 troops to the Balkans, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That will bring the total British contingent of armed forces
in Greece and Macedonia to just over 6,300, Blair told at the
House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The troops are to reinforce its units close to Kosovo. But a
spokesman for the British government played down any suggestion
that a ground offensive was moving closer.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said details of the planned deployment would be
announced by Blair in a statement later to the House of Commons,
which reassembled on Tuesday after its Easter break.
</P>
<P>
The extra troops will join some 4,000 British troops already in
Macedonia, originally earmarked as part of "an international force
", which is in fact formed by NATO troops only, to implement the
now largely defunct Rambouillet peace deal.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman stressed that the move was not part of a
build-up for a land invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They would be part of a security force NATO wants to deploy in
the Serbian Province of Kosovo once the air strikes against
Yugoslavia were over and Serb forces had been withdrawn, he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain has repeatedly ruled out any possibility of invading
the province by sending ground troops to fight their way into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The line on this hasn't changed," the Downing Street spokesman
told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, Britain had nearly 10,000 personnel in the
Balkans region, including 4,700 in Greece and Macedonia, and 4,500
peacekeepers with the NATO-led Multinational Stabilization Force (
SFOR) in Bosnia and Croatia.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Says It Can Give No Assurance of Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) said on Tuesday that it could not give the
Security Council assurances about the disposal of Iraq's
prohibited weapons programs and their possible reconstitution.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said in a report that it has not received the
cooperation from Iraq necessary to conduct its work.
</P>
<P>
The report, the seventh on UNSCOM disarmament and ongoing
verification and monitoring activities, covers the period from
October 6, 1998 to April 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was not possible to pursue any
disarmament activities in the chemical weapons area. Iraq's
unilateral claim of August 1998, that all outstanding issues had
been resolved, was in contrast to UNSCOM's findings on the status
of verification of Iraq's declaration in its prohibited chemical
weapons activities. Iraq refused to provide documents and
evidence for the further verification.
</P>
<P>
The report said during inspections of its banned biological
weapons programs, Iraq refused to provide requested documents, and
it also hindered an inspection team sent to the country from 3 to
10 december 1998 to conduct in-depth inspections of key biological
sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- France will deploy 700 ground
troops in Albania to carry out NATO's "Allied Harbor" operation.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Tuesday that NATO
troops will not only be engaged in transportation and distribution
of food, but also guarding refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
"France will participate in this operation by deploying 700 men,
" he said at the National Assembly, or the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
France has already sent 58 warplanes, seven warships including
the aircraft carrier Foch, and 6,000 soldiers to participate in
the NATO operation against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also admitted that a NATO bombing killed 10 passengers
riding in a civilian train in Yugoslavia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the death of 10 passengers in a train during the
attack on a bridge," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the event as a tragic but isolated incident
falling short of the rules of action of the alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of British Parliament
Members (MPs) on Tuesday condemned the killing of civilians by the
NATO bombing of a passenger train in southern Serbia as an
"atrocity".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Committee for Peace in the
Balkans, which is chaired by Alice Mahon, a Labor Party MP, the
MPs said "NATO is now killing Yugoslav civilians virtually every
day in its undeclared and illegal war."
</P>
<P>
"The statement by NATO secretary general, Javier Solana, that
NATO is not waging a war on Yugoslavia and has no quarrel with the
people of that country, must sound like a sick joke to those whose
friends, relatives and children are being killed by NATO bombs,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not at war, what they are doing is straightforward
murder. There are penalties for people who just go out and murder
other people," Alice Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
"What is humanitarian about the bombing of civilians on a
passenger train? There is no military solution to the complex
problems of Yugoslavia and I call again for NATO to stop the
bombing," the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
failed to bridge differences on the ways to settle the Kosovo
crisis Tuesday, but said that they would continue to work together
for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian position has not changed," Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters in Oslo, Norway, after a first
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright since NATO
launched air raids against Yugoslavia three weeks ago. "The most
important thing is to keep up an active dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a step forward, perhaps not as big a step as we
hoped, but a step forward nevertheless," Ivanov said after four
hours of talks in a hotel at Oslo airport.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said that the two countries would continue
working together for peace. She stressed that any peacekeeping
force for Kosovo must have a NATO core.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov again urged NATO to stop its air strikes so as to help
secure a peace accord. He said that the question of a peace force
was one of the most complicated issues in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been strongly opposing NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia and has frozen its relations with the 19-nation
military alliance. The Albright-Ivanov talks revealed the U.S.
efforts to improve ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Oslo meeting, Albright' spokesman James Rubin said
Russia had a "potentially constructive role" to play in ending the
clashes in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Urges End of NATO Military Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said
today that China urges NATO to immediately stop its military
intervention against Yugoslavia to bring the Kosovo issue back to
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, made the
remark in a meeting with Manuel Jose Alvarenga de Sousa Santos,
chief of staff of the air force of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Noting that NATO's wanton and indiscriminate bombing against
Yugoslavia is the concern of peace-loving countries and people in
the world, he said that the Kosovo issue, an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, should be solved by concerned parties in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should respect sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia," Fu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Portuguese relations have been developing
well in political, economic and other areas since the two
countries established diplomatic ties two decades ago. He added
that military-to-military relations have also developed further.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that Alvarenga's current China
visit will promote cooperation between the two countries and armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Alvarenga said that he had a good conversation with Liu Shunyao,
commander of the PLA air force, and he gained a better
understanding of the progress the PLA air force has made in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two air forces will maintain
high-level exchanges of visits and further increase cooperation in
education and training.

<HEADLINE> Russia Considers to Withdraw Peace-keeping Troops From Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Dmitriyevich Sergeyev said Tuesday that Russia was considering to
withdraw its peace-keeping troops from Bosnia in view of the
current situation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said his country is weighing all possible options,
including the withdrawal of peace-keeping troops from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Soon after NATO began military actions against Yugoslavia on
March 24, Russia declared that its peace-keeping troops in Bosnia
have been put under the direct command of the Russian defense
minister and Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of general staff of the
Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev added that Russia plans to send more warships to the
Mediterranean Sea in the coming days. The warships will escort a
new floating dock to the Mediterranean Sea to replace an old one
off the Syrian coast.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that NATO could possibly launch a ground
war against Yugoslavia. He based the assumption on the facts that
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia have become intensified and
the number of warplanes, taking off either from ground or sea, has
been increased.

<HEADLINE> No Confederation with Palestinians: Jordanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Raouf Al-Rawabdah Tuesday ruled out any plan to establish a
confederation with the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdah, who is accompanying Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on a three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates, said
Jordan will not form a confederation with Palestine, the official
news agency WAM reported.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the history, all confederation experiments ended up
in separation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, in Jordan, do not talk about a confederation. But we are
aspiring to a progressive form of unity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rawabdah indicated that a referendum will be held by
the peoples of Jordan and Palestine to determine what form the
unity between them will take after the establishment of a full and
sovereign Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will decide later this month
whether to announce statehood on May 4, when a five-year interim
autonomy period ends according to agreements signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Like other countries, Jordan has been persuading Arafat to
delay the declaration until after the May 17 Israeli elections,
fearing that an early announcement could lead to the victory of
Israeli hard-line politicians.

<HEADLINE> China Largest Auctioneer Handling Dunhuang Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Some rare documents from the
Chinese relics site Dunhuang that were lost for nearly a century
will be sold at auction next week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 6 items include a hand-written Buddhist scripture
translated by Xuan Zhuang, a famous monk from the Tang Dynasty (
618-907), according to Tuo Xiaotang, who is in charge of Chinese
Rare Books for China Guardian Auctions, the auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
Although these items are only a tiny part of the Dunhuang
documents that have disappeared, collectors will no doubt be
interested, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, a Taoist priest, Wang Yuanlu, stumbled on a cave in
what is present-day Gansu Province that contained more than 50,000
documents and relics dating from the 4th century to the 10th.
</P>
<P>
In subsequent years, many expeditions went there to acquire the
documents and relics like Buddhist sculptures and frescoes. The
government of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ordered the remaining
documents from Dunhuang to be transported to Beijing in 1907. But
after they were put in the imperial city, many were stolen.
</P>
<P>
Tuo says that the six items are some of those that were
transported to Beijing and they bear the seal of Duan Fang, a
senior dynastic official, from 1909.
</P>
<P>
Auctioneers estimate that the documents will bring as much as
50,000 yuan (6,000 U.S. dollars), but there may be a lot of
competition.
</P>
<P>
China's Cultural Relics Preservation Law prohibits such items
from leaving the country. There are as many as 50,000 of the
documents and relics in other countries. Britain alone has more
than 13,600.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Dunhuang scholars have repeatedly appealed to the
owners to return the rare documents and some patriotic businessmen
have bought Dunhuang items to return them.

YANGON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- As beautiful girls in colorful
festive dresses are singing and dancing at the central water
throwing pandal in front of the Yangon Mayor's Office building,
the three-day 1999 Maha (Great) Yangon Thingyan Water Festival
began here Tuesday afternoon, one day ahead of the Water festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival, part of which is also Myanmar's New Year Day,
started with merry-makers throwing water on people and motor
vehicles passing by. As a matter of fact, water throwing is a
traditional way of expressing blessings of the Myanmar people.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, apart from celebrating the festival in the
traditional way, people learned to use water gun and water pipe to
sprinkle water on one another. Even foreign diplomats and tourists
joined the local people to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Although the country is in difficulties economically this year,
the festive atmosphere remains as high as in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Water throwing pandals were built in various townships in the
capital and both traditional and modern entertainment programs
were presented by popular singers and dancers. Song and dance
competitions are also held at some pandals.
</P>
<P>
The water festival will be celebrated for three days in the
country. The New Year Day will be marked on Saturday when water
throwing comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
Festive activities also include offering of food to monks,
washing and cleaning of monasteries, pagoda platforms and images
of the Buddha, filling water pots in monasteries, washing of heads
of elderly people with scented water and offering them neat, clean
and warm clothes as a gesture of respect.
</P>
<P>
Water is a symbol of cleanliness. So people here believe that
celebration of the Water Festival can wash away evils of the old
days and bring the people into the New Year.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday released a statement slamming NATO's bombing of a Yugoslav
passenger train, saying the destruction of civilian targets could
not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the train was hit by a NATO missile on
Monday when it was crossing a bridge on its way from Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav rescue officials, 10 people were killed
and 16 injured in the attack, during which one carriage of the
train was destroyed completely.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, keeping up its strong opposition to NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia, said in the statement that "routine NATO air strikes
on civilian objects, leading to crack down of innocent, peaceful
citizens, can only prompt deep indignation,"
</P>
<P>
"While expressing condolences to the relatives and other close
ones of the deceased, we demand a quick end to the NATO bombings
in Yugoslavia and emphasize the necessity of urgent measures to
switch to the political regulation of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Russia has frozen ties with NATO to express its dismay at the
bombing campaign. Russia has preferred to use diplomacy to seek
peace rather than resorting to military action.

JINAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Today was the last day of an 11-
year Sino-German agricultural aid project in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the German Ministry of Foreign Economic
Cooperation say that this was the largest and most successful of
its kind. The Germans provided aid to the people of economically
backward parts of Shandong in a project focused on solving water
shortages, halting soil erosion, water-saving irrigation, and
highway and electric power systems in villages near the Yimeng
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The project started in 1988 in 3 counties and grew to 5 cities
and 11 counties and gave villagers access to tapwater, saving them
time in their farm work.
</P>
<P>
Per capita incomes last year were more than 1,800 yuan (217 U.S.
dollars), more than 6 times the amount when the project began.
</P>
<P>
The German government has provided 184,000 tons of wheat, 36.95
million Deutschmarks, and 684 people for consultation during the
11-year period, worth 140 million Deutschmarks, while the Chinese
have provided some capital, technicians, management staff.

<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA on Tuesday warned ticketless Manchester United fans not to
travel to the Italian town of Turin for next week's European Cup
semifinal second leg against Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Blockades will be erected around the Stadio Delle Alpi making
it impossible for spectators without tickets to get near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said: "We are sending this message as an urgent appeal to
Manchester United supporters to refrain from traveling to Turin
without tickets. To do so will simply be a waste of money, as all
tickets have now been sold."

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Market to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices for grain and edible oil
in China this year will remain stable on the whole despite small
fluctuations, according to overseas edition of Monday's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Due to good harvests in consecutive years, China is abundant in
wheat stock, as the total wheat supply for 1998-1999 is expected
to hit 160 million tons, while consumption is expected at about
120 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices are expected to rise in May as the drought that
hit China's major wheat-growing areas last winter may reduce wheat
output this year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's wheat consumption will reach 170 million tons this
year, and the price in major wheat-growing areas and sales areas
is likely to stand at 1,325 yuan per ton and 1,475 yuan per ton,
respectively, before new wheat is harvested in.
</P>
<P>
Corn price is expected to recover in later half of this year,
but only within a narrow margin, as China enjoyed a good corn
harvest in 1998. The price in major production areas and major
sale areas is projected to stand at 1,225 yuan per ton and 1,375
yuan per ton, respectively, before new corn enters the market this
year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's consumption of rice averages 120 million tons on
an annual basis and the increasing rice stocks because of
harvests in the past years will narrow the changes of price within
9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of edible oil market look good this year. The
price bottomed out in September last year as a result of declining
output of palm oil worldwide and China's severe crackdown on oil
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
However, the rising trend will not go far as the increasing
import of edible oil has narrowed the margin of price rise and
meanwhile, domestic market price is already higher than world
market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Govt. May Face Serious Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The in-coming civilian government
of Olusegun Obasanjo may face serious financial problem with
Nigerian budge deficit for the first quarter of 1999 hitting 38
billion naira (about 422 million U.S. dollars), This Day newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the first quarter of this year has surpassed
the estimated overall budget deficit of 34 billion naira for the
whole year, said the paper which obtained the figure from the
just-ended Paris meeting of donor countries sponsored by the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government's foreign reserve which stood at 7.1
billion dollars last December has now gone down to 4.2 billion
dollars, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
With the external reserve already down below the minimum
allowed and with alternative revenue generating also not
encouraging, Obasanjo may have serious financial problems unless
there is a massive injection of funds from donor agencies, the
paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the deficit of the first quarter is a very
bad omen as the situation may worsen dramatically as the in-coming
civilian government is likely to spend more money than it can
make.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted one economist as saying "the terrible thing
about the whole development is that the present administration had
hoped it would make good money from the proceeds of the
privatization exercise, but that is no longer feasible as sale of
assets is yet to begin."
</P>
<P>
Even though the crude oil prices have increased to over 12
dollars per barrel as against the nine dollars, which was used in
calculating the oil revenue for 1999, the improvement in the crude
oil prices does not help much as Nigeria must cut its oil
production in line with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) directives.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has reportedly
issued a statement saying that the crude oil production of the
west African country will be reduced from 2.033 million barrels
per day to 1.855 million barrels starting from May.
</P>
<P>
The external reserve position is also considered not good as it
can barely finance one month of imports as against three months
which Nigeria had maintained since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government promised that it would finance the
deficit for 1999 through a number of options including some
concessionary loans from the multilateral donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, the Nigerian government is still
discussing with the donor agencies and none of these discussions
has been translated into concrete assistance.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Ponders Response to Killing in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet has debated
possible retaliation after an Israeli soldier was killed by a
roadside bombing in south Lebanon Monday afternoon, Israel Radio
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local daily revealed Tuesday that Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon had offered Syria a deal via Moscow in
which Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon before the May
elections and open negotiations with Damascus immediately after
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the cabinet held an emergency session Monday
night to discuss the government's strategy in Lebanon, including
what retaliatory action to take.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met several hours after 21-year-old Noam Barnea
was killed by a roadside bomb while patrolling the security zone
in south Lebanon. Hezbollah guerrillas have claimed
responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The killing of Barnea brought to eight the number of the
Israelis who have lost their lives in the security zone since
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The other seven, including a brigadier-general, were killed in
two attacks in less than a week in late February, which triggered
a large-scale retaliatory air raids on Lebanon by the Israeli
army.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz quoted security sources as saying that
similar action will be possibly taken this time.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said the latest bombing occurred not far from
the village of Arnoun just outside the security zone, marking the
third time within a month that Hezbollah guerrillas have used the
village to stage attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has warned of harsh response if Hezbollah guerrillas
continued to attack Israeli military targets in the security zone
from civilian villages.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire understanding brokered by the United States after
a major Israeli offensive against Lebanon in 1996 bans the
warring sides from attacking on or from civilian villages.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the defense committee of the parliament Monday,
before the bombing in the security zone, Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said Syria must rein in Hezbollah activities, saying
"nothing happens there without their approval."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to end Israel's occupation
of the security zone it carved out in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, has rejected an
Israeli proposal that Israel pull out its troops out of the
security zone on condition that the Lebanese government make
necessary security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has insisted that any solution to the Lebanese issue
must be a broad accord which will also guarantee the return of
its Golan Heights seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said that Sharon, who is on a visit to Russia, has
asked Moscow to serve as the intermediary between Israel and
Syria in a deal in which Israel would pull out from Lebanon first
and open talks with Syria later.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharon proposal, Israel would complete the
withdrawal from south Lebanon before the May 17 elections. During
this period, Damascus has to prevent any cross-border attacks on
Israel by Hezbollah or other groups.
</P>
<P>
Then, if Netanyahu is re-elected, the Israeli government would
immediately begin negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights
and a peace agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal, partly aimed at boosting Netanyahu's chance
of re-election, did not mention to what extent Israel is willing
to make concessions on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Syria would reject the proposal. Damascus
has insisted that Israel should have to promise a complete
withdrawal from Golan before any negotiations are resumed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off in early 1996. Since coming
to power in june that year, Netanyahu has pledged that he would
never give up the Golan Heights because of its "vital strategic
significance" to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Offering Syria Deal on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon Tuesday strongly
denied offering deal to Syria on peace talks and troops withdrawal
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The denial is in response to an article in local daily Haaretz's
Tuesday edition, which said that Sharon, who is in Moscow on a
two-day visit, had asked Russia to pass on his two-part proposal
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Israel offers to complete the withdrawal from
south Lebanon before the May 17 elections and in return, Damascus
has to prevent any cross-border attacks on Israel by Hezbollah or
other groups in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Then, if Netanyahu is re-elected, the Israeli government will
immediately begin negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights
and a peace agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war and Syria has vowed not to resume the peace talks, which
have been stalled since 1996, with Israel unless it agrees to
return the strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman, said the report was
"another incorrect story by the newspaper."
</P>
<P>
Sharon told Israel Radio from Moscow that the report is "a
lie," saying he had not discussed the Lebanon issue with Russian
officials.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting public pressure sparked by rising Israeli
casualties in south Lebanon, the Israeli government has been
seeking ways out of the conflict in the security zone, set up by
Israel in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main power-broker Syria have rejected an
Israeli offer last year, which conditioned the troops pullout on
Beirut's security guarantee for its north.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to clinch a broader deal with Israel, in which
Israel will agree to relinquish the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Sharon proposal, partly aimed at boosting
Netanyahu's chance of re-election, did not mention to what extent
Israel is willing to make concessions on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Syria is expected to reject the proposal
since Damascus has insisted that Israel promise a complete
withdrawal from Golan before any negotiations are resumed.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power in 1996, Netanyahu has pledged that he
would never give up the Golan Heights because of its "vital
strategic significance" to Israel.

<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao told the opening ceremony that
China pays great attention to water conservancy works and has made
great progress in this regard over the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to China's special natural and geographical
conditions, the rapid expansion of its economy and the growth of
its population, water conservancy problems are becoming
increasingly acute.
</P>
<P>
"Disastrous flooding, a shortage of water resources, and the
deterioration of the ecological environment have become the three
leading problems relating to water that have restricted the
sustained growth of China's economy and other aspects of the
society," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said the disastrous flooding in China last
year has brought the entire nation to a consensus that more
investment must be made in water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that China can learn from the Netherlands with its
advanced technology and rich experience in flood control and the
protection of a water environment. The two countries have
conducted effective cooperation in river dredging, the protection
of the water environment, and water management, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a "Memorandum of Understanding on
Integrated Water and River Basin Management" on Tuesday following
the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Says Regional Crisis Get Members Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian regional economic
crisis has helped the member nations of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to get closer together, ASEAN
Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Severino told journalists at the start of a four-day Australian
visit that the nine ASEAN members had got closer together on
security issues and financial regulation during the course of the
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Australia's involvement as an ASEAN dialogue
partner was crucial, "we in ASEAN feel that Australia has a
critical role to play, not only in the economic prosperity of
Southeast Asia, but also in the stability and the peace of the
region."
</P>
<P>
"And so we look to the collaboration of Australia in these
endeavors of recovery and social protection, and also in examining
the ways by which we can straighten out the deficiencies in our
corporate and financial sectors."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei,
Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos and Myanmar, while Cambodia is
a prospective member.
</P>
<P>
Severino admitted that ASEAN's prestige as the region's leading
multilateral forum had been severely dented by the Asian meltdown.
</P>
<P>
But he said far from being the harbinger of ASEAN's
disintegration, the turmoil has in fact helped bring the member
nations closer together.
</P>
<P>
"The opposite has happened, and instead of ASEAN being in
disarray, the crisis has impelled ASEAN to come together closer
and strengthen its cooperation and its integration," Severino
said.
</P>
<P>
It has also accelerated the formation of a South East Asian
free-trade area and boosted the possibility of a single regional
currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Severino said he also hoped the prickly issue of independence
for East Timor would also be sorted out soon, either through
domestic efforts, or via U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia
and the troubled province's former colonial master, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that we wish all of these efforts well, so
that violence is reduced or eliminated," Severino said.
</P>
<P>
The island has been wracked by violence over recent months, and
Indonesia's new President B. J. Habibie has promised the East
Timorese will be able to decide in a ballot later this year if
they want more autonomy from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Severino will be holding talks with Deputy Prime Minister and
Trade Minister Tim Fischer and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
and senior Australian officials during his visit.
</P>
<P>
He will also be key-note speaker at a meeting here of the
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, or PECC.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Long-Distance Education Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
long-distance education and educational development in the 21st
century opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
About 100 experts and scholars from a number of international
organizations including UNESCO, and 15 countries and regions
attended the conference, which was organized by Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Vice-Minister of Personnel Xu
Songtao said modern long-distance education, characterized by
computer network technology and multi-media digital technology,
has promoted the application of knowledge and will have a profound
impact on the development of education in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Like other countries, China has been increasing investment and
intensifying research in this regard, said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, about 40 percent of the country's scientists
and researchers now participate in adult education such as on-the-
job training courses, and that since 1990, some 70 million people
have attended these types of classes.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, participants will discuss such
topics as long-distance study's impact on education and social
development, new concepts in long-distance education and study,
technical support for long-distance education, subject-matter for
long-distance education, and the management of long-distance
education.

<HEADLINE> British Official Expresses Confidence in HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Derek Fatchett, visiting
British minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,
said here Tuesday that British confidence in Hong Kong remains
high.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Foreign Correspondents'
Club, Fatchett said it is the welcoming evidence that China
remains committed to giving Hong Kong the high degree of autonomy
promised in the Joint Declaration and to preserving Hong Kong's
special characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the qualitative improvements in Sino-British
relations would not have been possible without the successful
handover of Hong Kong; or the successful implementation of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
On the special characteristics that Hong Kong continues to
preserve after the handover, he said freedom of expression is
alive and well in Hong Kong. So is pluralism.
</P>
<P>
Noting a number of difficult tests, not least in the economic
field that the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has faced since the handover, Fatchett said he was
confident that Hong Kong would move on from recession and the
shock waves of the financial crisis, well positioned as a more
competitive force within the region.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentals remain stronger here than in many parts of the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said British interests and confidence in Hong Kong
remain high, adding: "We respect the autonomy of the SAR;
interfering is not on our agenda." "Our interest in Hong Kong,
one of our major partners in Asia, extends across the spectrum."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Britain is the largest foreign investor in Hong
Kong, with more than 1,000 British companies based here.
</P>
<P>
Its share in all foreign investment in manufacturing and
services in Hong Kong amounts to around 27 percent. "We receive 80
percent of Hong Kong's steadily growing investment in Europe", he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said international confidence not just measured by
statistics, but also by intangible factors such as belief in the
rule of law, the integrity and independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the fact that the Hong Kong SAR government has
restated its commitment to upholding the rule of law as an
imperative and a duty", he added.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett arrived here Monday on his first visit to Hong Kong
since it returned to China on July 1, 1997. Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, met with
him on that day.
</P>
<P>
He spoke on environment and business at a breakfast hosted by
the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong Tuesday and this was
followed by a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave here for Beijing Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Defends Nationalization Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi has called upon his countrymen to value and preserve the
achievements of nationalization since independence of the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi made the call in response to questions of some members
of parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
The legislators from the largest opposition party, the
Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), had reportedly demanded
that the private properties including real estate nationalized in
the early period after independence be returned to their original
owners.
</P>
<P>
In his previous speeches, Mocumbi noted that in late 1980s the
government had corrected some slips made in the nationalization,
but he stressed that those nationalized in line with the laws
would not be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican people should value and preserve what they have
achieved, especially in such fields as education, health and
housing, Tuesday's Noticias newspaper quoted the prime minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Despite differences in political belief, it is our common
responsibility to maintain fast economic growth and to constantly
increase people's incomes and solving the structural problems in
Mozambique," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his government was happy that it had
strengthened social peace and economic stability and brought
perceptible benefits to the people, which has won acknowledge and
appreciation from the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister admitted that there is a lot to do
in the management of the state and the national development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Lack Creativity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of 12,000 middle
school and university students in China revealed that Chinese
youth still lack creativity.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind in China and jointly
conducted by the Ministry of Education, the Chinese Communist
Youth League Central Committee, and the China Association for
Science and Technology, found that most of the youngsters have
little knowledge of the structure and functions of the brain.
</P>
<P>
Ma Kangmei, one of the experts conducting the survey, said that
only 4.7 percent of the respondents have strong self-confidence,
curiosity and determination, and are likely to raise questions,
all qualities associated with creativity.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that only 14.9 percent of the youngsters
have great imaginations and the ability to probe into questions
and gather information.
</P>
<P>
Although 68 percent of the respondents agreed that intellectual
competitions are helpful to increasing the ability to observe,
analyze, and solve problems, only 33 percent of them had ever
participated in such activities.
</P>
<P>
Ma said most Chinese youth are affected by stereotypical
thought, and are likely to blindly respect authority. And this
tendency grows stronger with age.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that youthful creativity has no
connection with gender, and that this traditional concept hinders
the full development of female creativity.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dutch Queen's Visit to Boost Trade Ties with China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his meeting with the visiting
queen yesterday evening, said her current visit will definitely
cement the understanding and friendship between the peoples of the
two countries, as well as consolidate Sino-Dutch ties.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the queen, Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Economic Affairs Annemarie Jorritsma-Lebbink is
leading a large trade delegation of presidents and general
managers of more than 50 renowned Dutch companies to hold friendly
and constructive talks with their Chinese counterparts on the
promotion of bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the queen and the Dutch trade delegation fully
demonstrates the country's wishes to expand economic and trade
cooperation with China, said an official of the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and the Netherlands have witnessed great progress in
bilateral economic and trade cooperation in recent years. The
trade volume between the two countries amounted to nearly 6
billion U.S. dollars last year, 15 times of that in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands ranks fourth among China's European trading
partners, while the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong are the largest
Asian markets for Dutch products.

<P>
Chinese light industrial products, cereals and oils, food,
livestock products, garments, textiles and toys can be seen
everywhere in the Netherlands, through which those products are
often shipped to other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Dutch products such as Shell lubricating oil, Philips household
electrical appliances, Lux soap and Wall's ice-cream are well-
known and welcomed by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is also the fourth largest European investor in
China. Almost all of the renowned Dutch companies have established
enterprises or offices in China, and Dutch capital flowing to
China has kept at a double-digit growth rate since 1994.
</P>
<P>
By last February, Dutch contractual investment in China
totaled 3.467 billion U.S. dollars, serving the electrical,
telecommunications, household electrical appliances and chemical
sectors of China's coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok during his visit to China in 1995
agreed to extend to China some 1.25 billion Dutch guilders in
mixed government loans, and one-half-billion Dutch guilders in
commercial loans at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation
in technology. By the end of last year, the two sides had signed a
total of 268 contracts involving 551 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the two countries are expected to increase
cooperation in the areas of petrochemicals, shipping, and

Last year, sales in the domestic computer market surged 13.9

COLOMBO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga will reshuffle her cabinet early next week to pave the
way for some ministers to take up new posts following her ruling
party's victory in last week's provincial polls.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Nandimitra Ekanayake, Minister for Social

<HEADLINE> WIPO to Hold Inaugural Meeting of Policy Advisory Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) will hold the first meeting of the Policy
Advisory Commission (PAC) on April 15, the United Nations agency
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, an initiative proposed by Dr Kamil Idris when he took
over as WIPO Director General in November 1997, is composed of
eminent personalities with a proven leadership track-record.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting to be chaired by Idris, PAC members will offer
their insights on the significance of placing intellectual
property in a wider economic, social, and cultural context.
</P>
<P>
"This will help the organization in its quest to demystify
intellectual property which until recently has been seen primarily
as a domain for lawyers and technical information experts," said
WIPO.
</P>
<P>
The PAC will consider how to create broader awareness of the
benefits of a robust intellectual system to spur human creativity
and promote economic development and cultural well-being.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Neslon Mandela said Tuesday that increasing trade and investment
between South Africa, China and Russia was of great importance
within a framework which promoted development,joint ventures and a
more equal balance in trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business breakfast in Midrand, a city between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, Mandela said economic relations with
the two countries were important to improve the lives of millions
of South Africans.
</P>
<P>
South Africa regarded China and Russia as important partners
for cooperation in the multilateral arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They can help reorient the international and multilateral
institutions that regulate the world's political, social and
economic systems, so that they better serve the needs of
development and better reflect the democratic ideals of our age...
so that they support, rather than hinder the rebirth of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks ahead of his visit to China and Russia
due to start from late April. In addition to China and Russia,
Mandela will also visit Hungary and Pakistan, Mandela's office
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to arrive in Russia on April 27 on the
first leg of a four-nation offical trip, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia were among the last few countries that Mandela
would bid farewell to before retiring after the June 2 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki, chairman of the ruling African National Congress,
and current deputy state president, will become top leader of
South Africa after the election.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Minister Vows to Care for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will give
special attention to policies and laws that relate to the aged, a
Kenyan cabinet minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs, National Heritage, Culture and Social Service
Minister Shariff Nassir said Monday that the new policies,
contained in the 16-year poverty eradication plan released last
month, will address income security, health care and public
education of the aged.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens have a right to basic needs, the Daily Nation
newspaper Tuesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Opening a six-day African Regional Workshop on Aging, Nassir
said that they should be enabled to "live in dignity and security,
have access to cultural, spiritual and recreational resources and
be free from physical and mental abuse."
</P>
<P>
He said issues related to the poor and the old should be
addressed from the grassroots as they also determine the level of
democracy and good governance in a country.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has for long been engaged in wars and killing, and we
don't have enough time to think about our aged," Nassir added.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the African Gerontological Society,
was attended by delegates from more than 10 African countries.
The World Health Organization's aging and health chief Alex
Kalache also participated in the workshop.

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- There will be a great increase in
the number of Chinese TV plays to be made this year, as many as 15,
812 are in the works, an increase of 77.8 percent compared with
last year, and the most ever in one year.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has
strengthened regulations concerning the production of TV plays,
and plays without certificates will not be permitted, as the
production, publication, and broadcasting of the TV shows will be
under stricter control.
</P>
<P>
One significant change is that among the nationwide TV
production companies applying for permission this year, 62.3
percent are private, exceeding state-owned ones for the first time.
</P>
<P>
There are 36 private TV production companies in Guangdong
Province alone among the applicants, indicating the rapid
privatization and expansion of this sector.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, China to Enhance Tourism Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and China hope to
strengthen their cooperation in tourism to improve the development
of the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed the hope at a meeting between the
visiting Director of the Chinese National Tourism Administration
He Guangwei and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen at his Takhmau
residence Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen warmly welcomed Director He and his party to Cambodia.
The two sides exchanged information on tourism in both countries
and believed there is great potential for development.
</P>
<P>
He and his party began their four-day visit on April 10 at the
invitation of the Cambodian Tourism Ministry. The aim of their
visit is to carry out a tourism agreement signed by the two
countries during Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to China in
February.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he believed that their visit will surely boost the
friendly cooperation in tourism between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
While saying great changes had taken place in Cambodia in many
fields, including social orders, Hun Sen pointed out that there is
the need to enhance promotion to increase the confidence of
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia is striving to improve transport,
communications and infrastructure and strengthen security to
attract more foreign tourists. "It is important to develop
Cambodia's tourism," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the prime minister said Cambodia will
consider offering some facilities to Chinese tourists, such as
granting them an entry visa upon landing at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Director He said that with the continuous development of
China's economy and the improvement of the people's living
standard, more and more people will surely hope to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is rich in scenic spots and cultural heritage. The
centuries-old temples such as Angkor Wat are regarded as some of
the world's most magnificent monuments and were the center of a
Cambodian empire.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Cambodia's most promising industries.
According to Minister of Tourism Veng Serivuth, the number of
tourists this year increased about 25 percent from the same period
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Parliament Speaker Refuses to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's parliament speaker has
rejected an invitation to visit Iran because a main street in
Iranian capital Tehran is named after the assassin of the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Fathi Sorour, speaker of the People's Assembly
(parliament) said the invitation was extended to him by an Iranian
parliamentary delegation he met in Brussels, Belgium, where he is
attending an international parliamentary conference, the Arabic
El-Messa daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sorour said he will not go to Iran as long as the name of
Sadat's assassin, Khaled al-Islamboli, is on any street there.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed diplomatic ties with Cairo in 1979 after Egypt
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran later further angered Egypt by naming a main street in
Tehran after Khaled al-Islamboli, a Muslim militant who shot dead
Sadat in 1981 over the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The street name is one of the thorny issues preventing closer
ties between Egypt and Iran although the two countries have
expressed readiness to improve bilateral relations and exchanged
visits by cultural and economic delegations.

<HEADLINE> Don't Waste Chance for Economic Recovery: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Tuesday his call on all sectors to unite behind
his administration's efforts to speed up the country's recovery
from the regionwide economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Tuesday morning, the president said the
Philippines still has the best chance to recover from the crisis
ahead of other countries in Asia and the Pacific and, in fact, has
been showing strong indicators of recovery.
</P>
<P>
"I won't stop thinking and working to uplift the lives of the
poor. The result has so far been good. Our interest rate, for
example, has dropped tremendously, compared to the rate on my
first day in office," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is doing well. This presents us an opportunity to
unite for economic recovery. Let us not waste this chance,
considering that our neighbors were hit harder by the crisis while
we managed to fare better," Estrada added.
</P>
<P>
The president said his administration has already adopted
business-friendly policies to encourage the business sector to
pursue its role as the government's agent of growth.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to help each other. We have been supporting
the private sector by leveling the playing field. We want the
private sector to play an active role in national progress," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Willing to Meet Milosevic on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said here Monday that he is willing to meet with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to find out a way to end the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
 Annan, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day official visit
to Spain, made this clear at a press conference held after holding
talks with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on the
situation in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The UN head expressed optimism at the perspective of a
political settlement of the conflict in the Balkans, saying he
hadn't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's proposal on ending the crisis was "
constructive," but he didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Annan put forward a "peace plan," which includes a
Yugoslavia-opposed article that Belgrade should allow foreign
military presence in the troubled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Annan's proposal has little difference from that
of NATO, for the military bloc had already explicitly hailed it.

MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine President Joseph
Estrada rejected Tuesday the request of the National Democratic
Front (NDF) to free a female guerrilla and 50 political detainees
following the release earlier by the rebels of a military sergeant
and a police officer it had kept hostage.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview this morning, the president said the
government never made any such deal with the NDF for the release

</P>
<P>
"We never had such a deal. We only said that we will give the
NDF until Monday, April 19, to release all the hostages. But we
never struck any deal about the release of the female guerrillas
and the detainees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF had released Police Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal and
Sgt. Alipio Lozada as part of its commitment to release all
government hostages it had kidnapped.

<HEADLINE> Inflation of E. African States Under Control: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- All members of the East
African Cooperation (EAC), Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have
succeeded in bringing inflation under control after carrying out
prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
A report on the macro-economic performance in east Africa for
1997/98 said that the inflation rates in the three countries have
fallen to a single digit level.
</P>
<P>
According to the report released at the EAC Monetary Affairs
Committee meeting in Tanzania's northern of Arusha Monday,
inflation in Kenya dropped to 2.3 percent in March this year from
12.3 percent in the same period last year, while Uganda's
underlying inflation was 2.3 percent by the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, underlying inflation declined to 9.6 percent in
1998, the Daily News Tuesday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that real gross domestic product
(GDP) decelerated and remained below target largely because of the
El Nino weather phenomenon which adversely affected the
performance of the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of Kenya's GDP growth to 4.8 percent was
attributed to fall in investments, insecurity and bad weather,
whereas Uganda's GDP increased by 5.5 percent due to strong
recovery in food production.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's GDP growth fell to 3.3 percent in 1998 from 3.5
percent in the previous year due to the El Nino-charged heavy
floods which resulted in the reduction of agricultural production.
 Agriculture accounted for more than 50 percent of Tanzania's GDP.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Kenya's challenge is to improve its
economic growth to attain the targeted goal of seven percent by
next year. Tanzania is faced with an uphill task, while Uganda is
on the right track to reach the target if current economic
strategies are well implemented.
</P>
<P>
The report also observed that the currencies of the three
states depreciated last year in line with the developments in the
current accounts and there was a general decline in the treasury
bill interest rates. The treasury bill rates were reflected in
the deposit and lending rates which remained high.
</P>
<P>
But the report has recommended that the current monetary policy
stance in the three countries should be maintained and even
strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Judges Forms Self-disciplinary Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan judges have set up a
committee to oversee the corruption within the judiciary in a bid
to improve judicial services in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Chief Justice Zacchaeus Chesoni said Monday that the
creation of the committee, which aimed at supervising the
implementation of a report worked out two years ago by the Kwach
Committee which was named after one appeal judge.
</P>
<P>
The Kwach Committee's proposals included the monitoring of
judges' output and performance, opening 24-hour tourist courts at
Kenya's two biggest airports in Mombasa and Nairobi, and the
splitting up of the High Court in criminal and civil and family
divisions.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Chesoni as saying
that the newly-formed judges committee to be headed by Appeal
Judge Evans Gicheru will supervise the transfers of magistrates
and put pressure on judges and magistrates with pending judgements
in their dockets,
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of Appeal and High Courts judges, Chesoni
said the fact that some judicial staff had been charged
demonstrated that some of the recommendations by the Kwach
Committee report were being implemented.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that corruption should be fought not merely because
it is a condition for continued flow of foreign aids but because
it is enemy of democracy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption like AIDS can wipe out a whole nation, " he said.
"The judiciary is ready to chart the way forward, hoping that the
executive and legislative branches will follow."
</P>
<P>
Corruption could not be checked if strategies stopped at the
level of rhetoric, the chief justice added.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institutions and Western donors
have been reluctant to give assistance to Kenya just because of
serious corruption in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt. Owes $282M to Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government owes an all
time high 649.3 billion kwacha (some 282 million U.S. dollars) to
the central bank and other commercial banks by March 19, the
latest statistics from the Bank of Zambia showed.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the government debt represents a rise of nine
percent from the 593.3 billion kwacha (about 258 million dollars)
registered at the end of the fortnight ending on March 5, the
statistics from the central bank indicated.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zambian government's debt with the banking
system was about 563 billion kwacha (about 245 million dollars) by
December 1998, the Financial Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increasing banking system claims on the government implies
continued reliance by the government on its borrowing from the
commercial banks and the central bank to meet its short term
financing requirements, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government borrowing from the commercial banks and central
bank is done through the issuance of treasury bills and bonds.
</P>
<P>
The business community is concerned with increased government
borrowing from the banking system because this is leaving less
credit for the private sector to invest in expansion program and
capital equipment while also pushing up interest rates.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Write Off Mozambique's Debt: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would announce
the scrapping of Mozambique's debt within days, South African
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Day newspaper Tuesday quoted Manuel as saying that
an announcement of the debt forgiveness was only a matter of
formality.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no official confirmation from Maputo, South
African government sources said Mozambique owed the South African
government about 40 million rand (6.45 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This excluded loans by South African parastatals such as
electricity supplier Eskom, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the gesture would include funds owned
to South African state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Manuel, who has been a key proponent of the debt relief
initiative for the world's poorest nations, said that South Africa
would continue to take the lead in pushing for debt relief in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has already written off about one billion rand
(160 million dollars) owed by Namibia since its independence from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, which has an external debt estimated at more than
five billion dollars, is one of the first African beneficiaries of
the international debt relief program supported by the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank.

JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian legislature
would meet on April 27 to decide on the issue of Palestinian
statehood, Palestinian envoy to South Africa, Salman El-Herfi,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislative council would decide whether to unilaterally

A decision will be made public on May 4, the date originally
scheduled for the unilateral declaration of the statehood, South
African Press Association quoted El-Herfi as saying.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Mandela in Johannesburg on
Monday night, as part of a tour of more than a dozen countries, to
discuss the statehood issue.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, EU Begin Talks on Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and European Union (EU)
began investment and trade talks here Tuesday that are hoped will
clear long-standing obstacles in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
A Trade Ministry official, who will join the negotiations, told
the Saigon Times Daily that the meeting, which will last until
Thursday, would center on difficulties encountered by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The difficulty for Vietnam in selling to the EU focuses on
three main points. The first is that garment quotas into the EU
for Vietnam, although notably enlarged, have yet to match
Vietnam's garment capacity and potentiality. Vietnam is seeking
even more quotas.
</P>
<P>
The second involves Vietnamese footwear exports to the EU.
These items require Vietnam's certificates of origin, but the
certificates have recently been faked, thus damaging the prestige
of Vietnamese products. Several EU traders have proposed
decreasing footwear imports from Vietnam, and the two sides will
discuss ways to resolve the counterfeit problem.
</P>
<P>
The third is that Vietnam is still in the No.2 List of
fisheries export countries into the EU. Despite the EU having
recognized 33 Vietnamese seafood processors, it has yet to
transfer these firms to No.1 List, which provides several tax
privileges.
</P>
<P>
The EU also has three main difficulties trading with Vietnam to
be discussed at the meeting. First is Vietnam's import duties on
wines and spirits, which now stand at between 60-100 percent.
These levels are too high for EU companies while most of the wine
consumed in Vietnam comes from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Next the union says Vietnam's current minimum prices for import
duty calfficiates here.
</P>
<P>
According to the Saigon Times Daily, the two sides were
expected to reach a decision soon, as the opportunity to penetrate
the EU by Vietnamese companies would be killed off if by 2001 the
transfer was not endorsed. Results of the talks will have to be
submitted to the Vietnamese Government and a higher EU body for
any final decisions.

PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After marginalizing Russia in the primary phase of
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, NATO is trying to cuddle Moscow in
order to appease Boris Yeltsin and isolate Slobodan Milosevic. The
foreign ministers' meeting of NATO on Monday also called on U.N.
to be involved in seeking a political solution to the Yugoslav
crisis. The idea of ``international protection'' for Kosovo was
also presented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
-- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who was elected
president of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Monday defended
the decision to let Germany to join the NATO military action in
Yugoslavia, the first of its kind since World War II. Germany,
which suffered criminal regime and dictatorship in the past,
cannot close its eyes in front of murder and deportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In his third radio television address since the beginning of
the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, French President Jacques
Chirac Monday warned his countrymen against what he called ``the
spirit of Munich'' in reference to the Franco-British appeasement
policy toward Nazi Germany. He also called on the United Nations
to play a bigger role in solving the crisis of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
-- How to put an end to violence dominated the presidential
election campaign in Algeria which ended on Monday. During three
weeks, the seven candidates to succeed Liamine Zeroual toured
around the country but failed to raise the enthusiasm of a people
abused by violence, which has killed from 30,000 to 100,000 people
since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Former PM Muzzles His Media Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's former Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri has ordered his media to refrain from airing
political programs and news commentaries, and to restrict their
local reporting to non-controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star said Tuesday that Hariri's decision followed
mounting criticism from the cabinet that the Future TV and Radio
Orient owned by him had turned into a tool for the opposition to
discredit the incumbent government.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday night, the main news on Future TV and Radio
Orient focused on the crises in Kosovo and Iraq. Local news was
restricted to straightforward reporting on meetings or visits by
the country's top officials.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to Hariri, the former premier was
not asking for "political favors" in return for the decision to
muzzle what the current Prime Minister Salim Hoss perceived as an
anti-government campaign.
</P>
<P>
"In the higher interest of the country, Hariri has decided
that it was best to defuse the political climate amid the public
debate over the 1999 budget bill," one source said.
</P>
<P>
The source strongly denied speculation that Hariri was
demanding that some corruption files implicating him or political
allies in the misuse or squandering of public funds be closed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the cabinet transferred a report on
suspected financial scandals by Hariri and his three ministers to
the state prosecutor's office for investigation.
</P>
<P>
The construction tycoon, who made most of his fortunes in
Saudi Arabia, came to power in 1992 after the end of the
country's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by his long-time rival Hoss after Emile Lahoud
was elected the country's new president last November.

WELLINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of
Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon Tuesday called on the
Indonesian Government to investigate the violence in East Timor
during Easter.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are conflicting reports about the number of

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (28) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 28 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Why doesn't the Basic Law abolish the death penalty?
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of the Portuguese legal system, there is no
death penalty or life imprisonment for criminal offenders in Macao.
It has been suggested that as the death penalty is practiced on
the mainland and the Basic Law does not contain any provision on
abolishing the death penalty, it will be restored in Macao after
it is returned to China. Such a view is without any basis.
</P>
<P>
Whether there should be a death penalty is a long standing
controversy among scholars of criminal justice. The issue is
treated differently by different legislations. The death penalty
is practiced in some countries, but not in others. Even within the
same country, such as the United States, different practices exist
in different states.
</P>
<P>
Thus, this matter should be dealt with by criminal law.
Countries or territories are fully entitled to decide on their own
whether to have the death penalty in the light of their own actual
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since under the Basic Law the MSAR shall have full legislative
power, including the power to enact local criminal law, it flows
that considering the death penalty is something for the Region to
decide within its autonomy. It is precisely to safeguard and
respect the high degree of autonomy of the MSAR that no rigid
provision on the death penalty is included in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the restoration of death penalty simply does not
arise. As a matter of fact, when consultation took place between
the Chinese and Portuguese sides in 1995 on the new local criminal
code, the Chinese side did not challenge the provision of
abolishing the death penalty in the criminal code.
</P>
<P>
After Macao is returned to China, so long as the legislature of
the MSAR deems it necessary, the provision on abolishing the death
penalty in the current criminal code of Macao can certainly be
retained, and the central government will not in any way intervene
in this issue.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (27) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 14 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Why is it that only permanent residents of Macao who are
Chinese citizens are eligible for assuming important posts such as
the chief executive of the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
It is expressly provided for in Article 25 of the Basic Law
that all Macao residents shall be equal before the law, and shall
be free from discrimination, irrespective of their nationality,
descent, race, sex, language, religion, political persuasion or
ideological belief, educational level, economic status or social
conditions.
</P>
<P>
A view has been expressed that the provision in the Basic Law
that only permanent residents of Macao who are Chinese citizens
are eligible for assuming the important posts such as the chief
executive of the MSAR discriminates against other permanent
residents who are not of Chinese nationality and contravenes the
principle that all are equal before the law. Such a view is
totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
All are equal before the law. This, as a legal principle, means
that everyone is equal before the laws already enacted. In other
words, it means that when the judicial bodies and other authorized
bodies apply law, all the parties involved must be treated on an
equal basis in strict accordance with law irrespective of their
social status. That is why "all are equal before the law" is often
referred by jurists as "all citizens are equal as far as the
application of law is concerned".
</P>
<P>
But the enacting of laws and the application of laws are not
the same thing. In enacting a law, the legislators concerned must
follow the established legislative principles and take into
account various social factors. It is not possible to have
absolute equality in this regard. For instance, it is in
accordance with the principle of state sovereignty that the Basic
Law requires that the important posts of the MSAR such as Chief
Executive must be served by Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it is in keeping with the principle of "Macao people
administering Macao" that the Basic Law classifies the Macao
residents into permanent residents and non-permanent residents and
requires that only permanent residents have the power to vote and
stand for election and can serve as members of the Legislative
Council and civil servants according to law. These provisions of
the Basic Law are designed to ensure the implementation of the
policy of "one country, two systems".

The ethnic minorities' right to education and culture has been
guaranteed. The number of ethnic teachers increased to 833,200 in
1997 compared with 433,000 in 1978; the number of ethnic students
enrolled in schools at different levels increased from 10.248
million to more than 29 million. The proportion of ethnic students
is, respectively, 6.8 percent in colleges, 6.7 percent in middle
schools and 8.9 percent in primary schools; 97.6 percent of school-
age children attend primary schools in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and 7 other major ethnic minority provinces and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five ethnic minorities have their own college graduates
and the number of college students per 10,000 persons of more than
10 ethnic minorities has gone beyond the national average. In old
Tibet, there were no schools in modern sense and the illiteracy
rate was as high as 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, 4,365 schools at all levels had been set up in the
Tibet Autonomous Region and the illiteracy rate dropped by 47
percentage points. The literacy rate in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is now above 96 percent, 2 percentage points
above the national average.
</P>
<P>
China emphasizes the protection of the freedom of ethnic
minorities for their traditional cultures and their freedom in
religious beliefs. In China, ethnic minority freedom is guaranteed
by law to use and develop their both spoken and written languages,
to preserve or reform their customs, and to believe in religions
as they wish. Statistics show that bilingual education in Chinese
and other ethnic languages is practiced in more than 10,000
schools at all levels and in more than 60 ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
There is also bilingual education in middle schools and primary
schools in Tibet, and departments or classes of Tibetan language
have been established in colleges and vocational schools in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Unions Urge Employers to Pay Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions has warned that it will take "national actions" against
those employers who have not yet awarded their workers the 20
percent cost of living adjustment by the the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Union Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said Monday that
only three quarters of employers paid their workers the 20 percent
wage increment, which is stipulated by the agreement signed last
year between the government, labor and employers to cushion the
hiking inflation.
</P>
<P>
the Herald newspaper quoted the leader Tuesday as saying that
the labor movement wanted to ensure that every worker got their
due before going into this year's collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
However, union congress leader did not specify their actions
saying " national action is national action. The modalities will
be worked out."
</P>
<P>
The union is also demanding to reduce working hours from 48
hours a week to 40-45 hours.
</P>
<P>
It has reiterated that it would continue to boycott the
tripartite negotiating forum until the government lifted the ban
it imposed on mass job stayaways last year, as well as upholding
the decision of the opposition National Constitutional Assembly on
the procedure to formulate a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The labor body has resolved to convene a special congress soon
to discuss the formation of a movement to facilitate the formation
of a political party.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Court Takes Lead in Addressing Enforcement Difficulties  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reform measure taken by the Chaoyang District People's
Court involves enforcement procedures that are typically
undertaken by the director and staff of the court's Enforcement
Division, according to the Beijing-based China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Besides hearing cases, Chinese courts are accountable for
enforcing their judgments -- sometimes in the face of active
enforcement -- through law enforcement divisions established since
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The new approach adopted by the Chaoyang court is intended to
speed up the handling of a backlog of judgments that await
enforcement, according to court president Wang Zhenqing.
</P>
<P>
The reform was launched in response to a call from the Supreme
People's Court, which designated this year as a year for law
enforcement in light of the problem's status as the courts' No 1
headache, Wang said.

forces.

circumstances of China's air force.
</P>
<P>
Alvarenga said that recent years have brought continuous
exchanges in various fields between the two countries, contacts
between the two air forces in particular.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying he expects that there will be more
visits to Portugal by other levels of Chinese air force officers
in the near future.

<P>
In accordance with the new approach, eight chief law
enforcement officers have been selected from the Enforcement
Division and each has been assigned three aides, all from the
division.
</P>
<P>
The chief law enforcement officials are to take full
responsibilities for the enforcement of court judgments assigned
to them and are empowered to make decisions related to the
enforcement by themselves, rather than subject all matters to the
director of the Enforcement Division as before, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, this approach is a first in China," he said,
adding that "but this reform measure was carried out strictly in
line with the law."
</P>
<P>
The Chaoyang court has also decided to publicize the judgment
enforcement process, another new for Beijing's local courts.
</P>
<P>
All staff in the enforcement division were required to make
public their names and telephone numbers, subjecting themselves to
public oversight, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
And every litigant will be offered a card to write down their
comments on the work of the assigned law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
The cards should be returned to the internal supervision
sections of the court and will serve as a major criterion to judge
the officials' performance.
</P>
<P>
"All theses measures are being taken to make sure enforcement
is fair and just," Wang claimed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
adopting a three-pronged job preservation and generation strategy
to offset the rise in the unemployment rate, which, it said, is
likely to drop with the recovery of agriculture and the robust
growth of the services sector this year.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Tuesday that the
three-pronged job preservation and generation strategy involves
the following:
</P>
<P>
-- Improvements in the labor market information system,
particularly in job matching. This includes the Philippine
Employment Service Offices and the Philippines-Jobnet.
</P>
<P>
-- Labor-management cooperation, promotion of tripartism,
employment flexibility and worker empowerment.
</P>
<P>
-- Reforms in the labor and employment programs such as the
Workers' Retraining Program, National Apprenticeship Program and
Occupational Health and Safety Programs.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Barican said the reported increase in unemployment
stemmed from the huge expansion of the country's labor force.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment rate increased to 9.0 percent in
January 1999, or 0.6 percent higher compared to the same period
last year.

playing an active role in promoting the progress of human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has so far signed a total of 17 international covenants
on human rights and taken various measures to conscientiously
implement the covenants which China has joined. On this basis, it
signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights in October 1997 and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights in October 1998.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (27) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 27 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Why is it that only permanent residents of Macao who are
Chinese citizens are eligible for assuming important posts such as
the chief executive of the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
It is expressly provided for in Article 25 of the Basic Law
that all Macao residents shall be equal before the law, and shall
be free from discrimination, irrespective of their nationality,
descent, race, sex, language, religion, political persuasion or
ideological belief, educational level, economic status or social
conditions.
</P>
<P>
A view has been expressed that the provision in the Basic Law
that only permanent residents of Macao who are Chinese citizens
are eligible for assuming the important posts such as the chief
executive of the MSAR discriminates against other permanent
residents who are not of Chinese nationality and contravenes the
principle that all are equal before the law. Such a view is
totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
All are equal before the law. This, as a legal principle, means
that everyone is equal before the laws already enacted. In other
words, it means that when the judicial bodies and other authorized
bodies apply law, all the parties involved must be treated on an
equal basis in strict accordance with law irrespective of their
social status. That is why "all are equal before the law" is often
referred by jurists as "all citizens are equal as far as the
application of law is concerned".
</P>
<P>
But the enacting of laws and the application of laws are not
the same thing. In enacting a law, the legislators concerned must
follow the established legislative principles and take into
account various social factors. It is not possible to have
absolute equality in this regard. For instance, it is in
accordance with the principle of state sovereignty that the Basic
Law requires that the important posts of the MSAR such as Chief
Executive must be served by Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it is in keeping with the principle of "Macao people
administering Macao" that the Basic Law classifies the Macao
residents into permanent residents and non-permanent residents and
requires that only permanent residents have the power to vote and
stand for election and can serve as members of the Legislative
Council and civil servants according to law. These provisions of
the Basic Law are designed to ensure the implementation of the
policy of "one country, two systems".

LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Struggling Blackburn Rovers were
dealt a stunning blow with news that star striker Chris Sutton may
not play again this season.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the club on Monday said: "Sutton is still
suffering from the groin injury which kept him out of contention
for the recent England international.
</P>
<P>
"Medical staff at Blackburn are optimistic that the injury will
respond to treatment without the need for surgery."

But Rovers are now resigned, with just six matches left, to
fighting for their Premiership lives without the England star.
</P>

Sutton has battled on recently despite being short of full
fitness but has managed just four goals in 19 appearances.

<HEADLINE> Deng Yaping Less Likely to Attend Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Table tennis queen Deng
Yaping distances herself from the 2000 Sydney Games as she opted
to study in Britain for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who now studies in the Beijing-based prestigious Qinghua
University, said on Tuesday that she will bound for Britain on
Thursday to study at the language center of the Nottingham
University for about one year.
</P>
<P>
The world and Olympic champion, who enrolled in Qinghua
University after the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, has spent over
seven months studying English in Cambridge University of Britain
before she came back to Qinghua early in August.
</P>
<P>
That she studies abroad for the second time strengthens the
belief that she has actually put an end to her playing career
although she promised an immeditate comeback to the national team
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Deng did not appear in the line-up of the Chinese national
squad for the 45th world championships which was left in limbo for
the ongoing Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua said that no matter how
excellent they were, all players are required to go through the
tryout before they are qualified for major events.
</P>
<P>
Deng, 26, has been in semi-retirement since she completed a
singles-double sweep in the world championships in May 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes India for Missile Test (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China today criticized India for
testing a medium-range ballistic missile, saying that it is a
violation of UN resolutions that may trigger off a new arms race
in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side expresses regret and concern over this," said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at today's routine press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The UN Security Council Resolution 1172 called on
India to cease the development of ballistic missiles capable of
delivering nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The missile test by India on April 11 violated the letters and
the guidelines of above-mentioned resolution and could possibly
trigger off a new round of arms race in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side took note of the trend that India and
Pakistan had strengthened dialogue in the past months and
increased trust and achieved certain results, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The Chinese side hopes that the two countries will
peacefully resolve the differences and issues between them through
patient, frank and meaningful dialogue. This conforms to the
fundamental interests of the people of South Asia."

<P>
In November 1997, the Chinese Government decided to transmit to
the United Nations reports by its Hong Kong Special Administrative

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, thus making the relevant
institutions involving the covenants and the international

Mary Robinson, to visit China. The two sides extensively exchanged
their views on human rights issues and signed a Memorandum of
Intent on a technical cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China invited a concerned expert group from the office

<HEADLINE> Non-Government Companies Booming in Hi-Tech Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Non-government hi-tech companies
accounted for 80 percent of the total in 53 state and 58
provincial hi-tech industrial parks, according to statistics from
the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Most of the non-government science and technology enterprises
are involved in the hi-tech industries, which make them highly
competitive in research and development.
</P>
<P>
Many non-government-run hi-tech companies have already been
turning out large amounts of profits and revenue, while some
others are developing rapidly, according to today's Beijing
Science and Technology News.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of output value of such enterprises is usually
higher than the average growth of local industry and agriculture.
The revenue from non-government-owned hi-tech enterprises in
Beijing surpassed 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) in 1997,
or more than 70 percent of the total output value of the city's
industry.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments are now expanding their efforts to create
a still better environment for the development of non-government-
owned companies, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the total income of the non-government
enterprises will increase to 1,000 billion yuan (120 billion US
dollars) from the over 55 billion yuan in 1997, it will account
for some 10 percent of the national economy instead of six percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are a number of large non-government
scientific and technological enterprise companies springing up,
with quite a lot of them listed among the 500 most powerful
companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of non-government hi-tech companies will also
increase by the end of this year to 100,000 from the 60,000 in
1997.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Students in China will soon be
able to apply for university places on-line and the whole system
could be up and running nationwide within three years, according
to sources from the Chinese Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Universities and colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Liaoning and Sichuan Provinces
will try on-line enrollment this summer.
</P>
<P>
Enrollment offices will input applicants' files into computers
and transmit them through CERNET (Chinese Education and Research
Net) to universities and colleges. They will check the files for
suitability and issue admission or rejection slips accordingly.
</P>
<P>
However, some officials have expressed concern about on-line
enrollment. They are fearful that with so many universities and
colleges enrolling students at almost the same time there could be
a jam on the cyber-superhighway. They also point out that not all
universities in China are linked to the CERNET, especially those
in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
But other experts acknowledge that on-line enrollment will make
competition for university entrance more fair as it opens up the
system.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Education say that the on-line
applications will come under the direct supervision of the
admission committees of the relevant universities.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A regional early-warning system
to predict bad weather such as torrential rains, strong winds,
heavy thunderstorms and hailstones has become operational in
Beijing and covers the capital and surrounding areas in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Daily has reported that the system
is made up of two parts: forecasting and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring system includes a network covering northern
China, the Beijing ground observation network, the automatic
network for Beijing's urban areas and radar stations.
</P>
<P>
The range covers medium-scale weather forecasts, radar
recognition of inclement weather and devices for checking rainfall
levels.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Meteorological Bureau has established 12 automatic
stations which can automatically record wind direction and speed,
temperature and precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The early-warning system can also provide the time and scale of
imminent weather disasters, which is of vital importance for flood
prevention and effective communications to tackle the emergencies.
It also means that municipal policy-makers can be forewarned of
approaching disasters.

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An international conference to
discuss innovative therapies based on the integration of modern
and traditional medicines will be held in Beijing late this month.

By offering policy preferences as well as support in funds,
technologies and skilled professionals, the central government has
promoted economic development and social progress, and improved
the living standard of local people in areas inhabited by ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the
regions mostly inhabited by ethnic minorities across the country
increased to 708.7 billion yuan (about 85 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997 from 1978's 32.4 billion yuan (about 3.9 billion U.S. dollars)
, a 21-fold increase and an annual growth rate of 10.9 percent
which was even 1.1 percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The 1997's GDP per capita of these regions, 15 times more than
that of 1978, increased to 4,053 yuan (about 488.3 U.S. dollars)
from 247 yuan (about 29.8 U.S. dollars). The net annual income of
farmers there increased by more than 11 times to 1,482 yuan (about
178.6 U.S. dollars) in 1997 from 1978's 120 yuan (about 14.5 U.S.
dollars). The disposable income of urban residents grew by nearly
12 times to 4,818 yuan (about 580.5 U.S. dollars) in 1997 from
1978's 375 yuan (about 45.2 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the fixed financial subsidies to the Tibet
Autonomous Region by the central government surpassed 1.2 billion
yuan (about 144.6 million U.S. dollars) each year. The central
government invested more than 40 billion yuan in Tibet from the
1950s to 1997. Meanwhile a great amount of goods and materials
were transported to Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Judocas Carry China's Olympics Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, Guangxi, April 13 (Xinhua) -- One judo gold medal in
each Olympic Games is not satiesfatory for China as it is going
into the 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Some talented bigger judocas from the women's section envital
higher golds hopes in the Games, but the ambitious Chinese are
awared of a rough-and-tough road stretching ahead.
</P>
<P>
Song Zhaonian, vice president of the Chinese Judo Association,
said here in the national championships: "We are concentrating our
golds hopes on athletes from above the 63-kilogram categories,
especially in the over-78kg class."
</P>
<P>
China has won two heavyweight Olympics golds from Zhuang
Xiaoyan in the 1992 Barcelona Games (over-72kg then) and from Sun
Fuming in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the Bangkok Asian Games last December, China pocketed home
three golds and one silver from the 63kg, 70kg, under-78kg and
over-78kg classes.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea, who dominated the smaller grades in the
Asian Games, hardly piled up any challenges to the bigger-sized
Chinese women. But the Europeans are the headaches.
</P>
<P>
"The European judocas are developing very fast in the past one
or two years," said Song, who just came back from a 15-day
European tour, "There will be no easy bout on the way to the 2000
Olympics from the qualifying competitions to the finals."
</P>
<P>
"We've lost our overwelming dominance in the heavyweight
category. We must be very careful on every step to the achievement
of our gold medals goal," Song added.
</P>
<P>
A domestic three-stop qualifying series was set up to choose
athletes for the world championship in Britain in October. The
national championship is just one of the three competitions of the
series.
</P>
<P>
Top three judocas with the best combined results from the three
competitions and some international champions need a final
selecting tournament to decide the judoca taking part in the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
"We want to compete in every category in the Sydney Games,"
Song said.

In 1984 nine provinces and municipalities aided Tibet by
undertaking 43 construction projects. The central government and
various regions across the country again in 1994 provided free aid
to Tibet for 62 projects with a total investment of four billion
yuan (about 482 million U.S. dollars). To date construction of 60
of the 62 projects has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The aid and support from the rest of the country has greatly
accelerated economic development in Tibet and remarkably improved
the life of local people.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the economy of Tibet has been
developing at an annual growth rate of 12.9 percent over the past
five consecutive years. And the economic growth rate of Tibet has
surpassed that of the national average for two successive years.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers and herdsmen's annual income reached 1,150 yuan (
about 139 U.S. dollars) on average in 1998. The living expense
income per capita of urban residents that year surpassed for the
first time the national average to reach 5,130 yuan (about 618 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average floor space one Tibet urban resident occupies was
14 square meters, almost five square meters more than that of the
national average. The figure was more than 20 square meters in
rural areas of Tibet, about the same as that in other rural areas
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The population of Tibet grew to more than 2.4 million in 1998
from some one million before the democratic reform of Tibet four
decades ago. And the average life expectancy was extended by 30
years.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua)-- China today criticized India for
testing a medium-range ballistic missile, saying that it is a
violation of UN resolutions that may spark a new arms race in
south Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side expresses regret and concern over this," said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at today's routine press

The Chinese side took note of the trend that India and Pakistan
had strengthened dialogue in the past months and increased trust
and achieved certain results, Sun said.
</P>

He said: "The Chinese side hopes that the two countries will
peacefully resolve the differences and issues between them through
patient, frank and meaningful dialogue, which will be in the

<HEADLINE> Two New Securities Funds Issued in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's two newly approved
securities investment funds, Taihe and Tongyi, offered 1.94
billion shares each at a price of one yuan to the public through
the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, respectively, and sold
them all, according to Shanghai Securities News reports.
</P>
<P>
The Taihe Fund received subscriptions for 41.0 billion units,
and the Tongyi Fund received subscriptions for 22.7 billion units,
but only the people who won the lottery for the right to own the 1.
94 billion shares are now shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The unsuccessful lottery applicants all had their money
returned to them. The founders of the two companies retained the
rights to 60 million shares for each company.
</P>
<P>
The Taihe Fund was founded by the Guangfa Securities Co. Ltd.,
the Beijing Securities Co. Ltd., and the Jilin Trust and
Investment Company, among others.
</P>
<P>
The Tongyi Fund was founded by the Zhongxin Securities Co. Ltd.,
the Hubei Securities Co. Ltd., and others.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that the two new funds drew total subscription
money of 64 billion yuan, which was remarkably less than that for
the six funds issued last year.
</P>
<P>
Of those six funds, the Yuyang Fund received the biggest
subscription, an awesome of 166.5 billion yuan, and the sixth
largest itself drew over 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say this was because when the six funds were issued
last year, they were a relatively new thing for Chinese investors,
and expectations for quick profit were unrealistic. They said
that after one year's performances, investors have become more
rational and realize that securities investment funds are long-
term investment tools and are not for short-term speculation.
</P>
<P>
Ding Wei, a spokesman for the Changsheng Fund Management Co.
Ltd., and manager of the Tongyi Fund, acknowledged that investors
have been less enthusiastic than they were last year.
</P>
<P>
This was good news for subscribers, he said, as they will have
a better chance in the lottery bidding.
</P>
<P>
And Ding denied that investors have been discouraged by the
funds' performance last year, noting that all the funds did quite
well, in view of the poor macroeconomic situation and the bearish
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Tongyi Fund was issued on Friday, while two
new stocks will be offered to the public the next Monday should
also be considered, he said, adding that if an investors
subscribed to these latest funds, his capital would be frozen
until Monday, which would make it impossible for him to buy the
new stocks.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that as a long-term investment tool, securities
investment funds will prove good value and be welcomed by more and
more Chinese investors.

<HEADLINE> NZ Risks Becoming Australia's Economic Colony: Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has been warned of
the danger of becoming an economic colony of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Local media Tuesday quoted Financial spokesman Michael Cullen
of the Labor Party, the major opposition party in the country, as
saying that the number of companies moving to Australia will
become a flood unless New Zealand shakes off the shackles of its
commodity-based economy and embraces the technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports showed that Fernz Corporation, which is New
Zealand's ninth largest listed company and an Auckland-based
multinational chemicals company, is considering to move its head
office to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing major companies moving headquarters to
Australia," Cullen said. "There is a very real risk in the next 10
years that that movement will become a flood, and that we will
simply become a series of branch offices and warehouses for the
Australian economy."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is "in danger of becoming an economic colony of
Australia", Cullen warned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that New Zealand needs to make the transition to a
more knowledge-, skill- and technology-based economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia on Track Towards Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is in a rush to be
Y2K compliant as the new millennium is approaching, and is
progressing well towards the millennium bug rectification.
</P>
<P>
Placing priority on the Y2K issue, the government has formed a
National Y2K Steering Committee under the Energy, Communications
and Multimedia Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government has set aside 850 million ringgit (224 million
U.S. dollars), about 124 million U.S. dollars from its own and
another 100 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank as loans, in
undertaking projects to overcome the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Securities Commission organized a conference on
Y2K as part of its effort to encourage companies to be Y2K
compliant and to create awareness of the millennium bug problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Energy, Communications and Multimedia
Ministry, in cooperation with NatSeven TV (NTV7), also launched a
national Y2K advertising campaign to enhance the public
understanding of the problem.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's conference, First Finance Minister Tun Daim
Zainuddin said the government recognized the importance of the Y2K
problem and is giving it its full attention in efforts to complete
preparations to face the year 2000 millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is working on a framework for a national
Y2K contingency plan which provides a comprehensive blueprint for
the development of realistic and effective contingency plans at
both the sectoral and national levels.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a complete set of the details of the
national plan, which highlights the scope of work that needs to
be done by all parties to address the problem and also what needs
to be done on and after January 1, 2000, will be ready by June
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the Y2K problem, Malaysia's focus is on critical
sectors and agencies whose services affect public safety and
security. The critical sectors identified by the National Y2K
Project Team are energy, telecommunications, banking and
insurance, transportation, health, oil and gas, water supply, and
sewerage.
</P>
<P>
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie
recently described the overall progress as "very satisfactory" as
60 to 65 percent of all the 113 organizations from the eight
critical sectors are Y2K-ready.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector is more at the forefront of Y2k
rectification. According to Bank Negara (Central Bank), which has
adopted a proactive approach to confront the Y2K problem, 74 out
of 77 banking institutions have completed all the three stages of
assessment, renovation and testing in compliance with the Y2K
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Most stockbroking companies in the country, or 78.1 percent of
the total 61, are also ready for Y2K, the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) said in a statement Monday, adding that 93.8
percent would be Y2K ready by the second quarter of 1999 and 95.3
percent by the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KLSE said that of the 457 main board companies
on the KLSE market, 64.1 percent is expected to be Y2K ready by
the second quarter of 1999, 81.4 percent by the following quarter
and 87.1 percent by the last quarter. While from a total of 282
second board companies, 68.8 percent is expected to be Y2K ready
by the second quarter, 84.4 percent by the third quarter and 91.5
percent by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE pledged to continue to monitor the state of Y2K
readiness of public-listed companies and will ensure the timely
disclosure of their Y2K readiness to the investing public.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara expects full compliance from public-listed
companies and banks by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's small and medium scale industries (SMIs), which are
said to be most vulnerable to the Y2K problem, have also been
given special attention in this regard because of their
significant position.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara allocated 1.5 billion ringgit (394.736 million U.S.
dollars) as loans for SMIs to apply for solving their Y2K problem.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines' Fare Hike Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Some major U.S. airlines
Monday gave up their attempts to raise fares, thus the Continental
Airlines-led overall fare increase over the weekend collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines Inc., the nation's fifth-largest carrier,
announced Friday an across-the-board three percent fare increase
for leisure travel and one percent boost for walk-up tickets. The
move was quickly matched by United Airlines, the world's largest
airlines, and Delta Airlines, the nation's third largest.
</P>
<P>
But American Airlines, the world's second largest, and
Northwest Airlines, the nation's fourth largest, said they would
not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
And then, Delta, United and Continental said they pulled back
from the increase over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Airlines typically pull back from an increase in order to
remain competitive if other carriers do not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
But rising fuel prices and slowing revenue growth caused by a
drop in full-fare business travel are likely to force carriers to
try again soon for an increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"With fuel prices up this year versus last year, that's an
incentive for airlines to try to go ahead" and raise fares, said
Brian Harris, airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
Airlines' shares were all down Monday, with United Airlines
shares down 1.1875 U.S. dollars to 77.75 dollars, American
Airlines down 2.0625 dollars to 66.3125 dollars, Delta down 2.0625
dollars to 69.50 dollars, Northwest down 1.0625 dollars to 28.1875
dollars and Continental down 1.3125 dollars to 39.5625 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Study Yugoslavia's Plea to Join Russia-Belarus Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia is positive towards
Yugoslavia's plea to join the Russia-Belarus union but will review
the issue closely, a spokesman quoted Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov spoke highly of the Yugoslav application to enter the
union between fellow-Slav countries, but Russian leaders will
seriously consider the matter, the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Yuli Yarov, chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, told the media in Minsk on
Monday that Yugoslavia's entry into the union is a problem
difficult to resolve in a short time, saying it is a grave
political problem which needs to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
Even if the three countries -- Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia --
formed a loose federation, there would be a long way to go, Yarov
said. He said the forthcoming parliamentary meeting of the Russia-
Belarus union will not discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Moscow Mayor Yuli Luzhkov, who has a
considerable influence in the country's political circle,
expressed support for a three-country union.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that it should occur after the end of the
Balkans war, adding that otherwise it would mean Russia is
voluntarily involved in the crisis, which will trigger another
round of military conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist
Party Gennady Zyuganov affirmed that the Russian Communist party
and all patriotic forces will stand by Yugoslavia's bid to join
the union.

<HEADLINE> Slaney Appeals against IAAF over Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Mary
Slaney filed a suit on Monday against the International Amateur
Athletics Federation (IAAF) and U.S. Olympic Committee(USOC),
accusing them of negligence and fraud in the handling of her 1996
doping case.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 and 3,000 meters champion also attempted to halt an
arbitration hearing against her and prevent the IAAF and USOC
using a testosterone ratio as proof of doping by women athletes.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis,
USOC was accused of failing to ensure that Slaney's 1996 urine
sample was properly stored.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lawsuit says the USOC's duty to protect Slaney
was breached when it used a testosterone to epitestosterone ratio
"as proxy for doping in women" and in the manner it analysed,
probed and supervised the investigation of Slaney's sample.
</P>
<P>
The legal action comes less than two weeks before the IAAF is
scheduled to resume an arbitration hearing in Monte Carlo on an
elevated testosterone to epitestosterone ratio found in a urine
sample provided by Slaney at the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A hearing board of USA Track and Field reinstated the former
world champion in 1999, saying "No doping violation has occurred."
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF decided to continue pursuing the case, referring
it to the arbitration panel.

</P>
<P>
Various non-Communist parties and the CPPCC are now playing an
increasingly important role in political consultation, democratic
supervision and the participation in and deliberation of state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993-1998 period, the CPC Central Committee sponsored 62
various forms of activities consulting with CPPCC members who
represent non-Communist parties, people's groups and different
ethnic groups and different sectors on the state policies,
principles, candidates of state leaders as well as all important
policies, laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 200 non-Communist party members are
now acting as prefecture-level officials in China's provincial
governments and more than 6,000 non-Communist party members are
working in prefecture-level city governments and departments of
provinces as division chiefs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993-1997 period, the CPPCC National Committee put
forward more than 100 important proposals, in the fields of
politics, economy, social and cultural life of the country, to the
CPC Central Committee and the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Protests Romania's Racketeering of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Interior Minister Bogomil
Bonev has voiced protests against racketeering by Romanian
officials towards Bulgarian travelers, official sources told the
Bulgarian news agency BTA on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his Romanian counterpart Constantin Dudu Ionescu,
Bonev said that in the past two weeks the number of complaints
about criminal actions conducted by Romanian officials towards
Bulgarian travelers has greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
In their complaints, the claimants said that charges and fines
were levied and collected from Bulgarians without specifying the
reasons or providing receipts. They said this has been taking
place along the border and inside Romania.
</P>
<P>
Tourists also complained that during their travels in Romania,
they were stopped on a number of occasions by Romanian policemen
under the pretext to check passports, and then they were required
to pay fines or fees, mostly between 20 and 50 Deutsche marks.
</P>
<P>
Bonev said that Bulgaria is aware of the difficulties and
problems the Romanian police are experiencing because of the
increased traffic along the Bulgarian-Romanian border following
the refugee crisis in Yugoslavia, but it also considers predatory
"racketeering" by public officials to be unacceptable under any
conditions.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The death sentence handed down
recently on an official held responsible for a bridge collapse
which killed forty people has sparked off a huge interest in law
books amongst construction firms and relevant officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Book Mansion,the largest book store
in Asia, copies of the four major construction laws were among the
stores top 10 best sellers in March, and hundreds of books and law
reports are being sold every day.
</P>
<P>
Since March 1 through April 12, the bookstore sold 4,234
copies of the Contract Law, 1,856 copies of the Constitution and 1,
235 copies of the Law on Product Quality.
</P>
<P>
The infamous incident of the collapsed Qijiang bridge in
southwest China's Qijiang County and the subsequent sentences has
sounded alarm bells amongst the country's construction contractors.
</P>
<P>
The 180 meter long by seven meter wide Rainbow Bridge collapsed
on January 4th, killing 40 people. Another 14 people were injured
and damage was estimated at 6.31 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that the steel bridge, erected by a private
contractor in February 1996, was of inferior quality, and that the
accident resulted from official dereliction of duty and loopholes
in engineering and construction.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shiyuan, former deputy secretary of the Qijiang County
Committee of the Communist Party of China, was sentenced to death
for taking bribes and for dereliction of duty in the nationally
televised trial in early April which attracted hundreds of
millions of viewers. Others involved were given heavy jail
sentences and fines.
</P>
<P>
A buyer of 10 copies of the Criminal Law and another 10 copies
of the Law on Product Quality said that he is an inspection
officer for construction quality, and was planning to open a
course for construction contractors.

The director, deputy directors and members of the villagers'
committee are all directly elected by eligible voters in a village
through a secret and competitive election, and they can be removed
from their posts if they do not perform well.
</P>
<P>
All major village affairs in connection with villagers' rights
and interests, such as land-contracting plans and land for
building houses, are all submitted to the villagers' committee for
deliberation and approval.
</P>
<P>
The routine affairs of the village are democratically
administered through villagers' meetings and governed by villager
self-management regulations and village regulations in a
democratic form, and the villagers conduct democratic supervision
upon the work of villagers' committee and matters concerning
villagers' interests through village's budget records and other
important information made public by the committee.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, more than 900,000 village committees had
been elected, with a total of 3.788 million villagers' committee
cadres now in place across the country.
</P>
<P>
To date, the system of villagers' self-management has been
established in a preliminary fashion in 60 percent of China's
villages. Villagers' committees have generally conducted three to
four elections, with the participation rate of eligible voters
standing at over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The practice of open and transparent village affairs has been
established in most of China's villages, and in 11 provinces and
cities including Hebei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanxi and Tianjin, such
practice has been introduced in more than 90 percent of villages.
</P>
<P>
In November 1998, the NPC Standing Committee adopted the newly
revised Organic Law on Villagers' Committee, which is aimed at
perfecting the system of villagers' autonomy, promoting the
building of grass-roots democracy in rural China, and providing a
firm legal guarantee for the masses to directly exercise
democratic rights.

III. Judicial Guarantee for Human Rights
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the National People's Congress and its Standing
Committee have promulgated 351 laws and decisions concerning legal
issues; the State Council has formulated over 800 administrative
regulations and ordinances; and local people's congresses and
their standing committees have adopted more than 6,000 local laws
and regulations. A relatively systematic legal establishment now
provides fundamental legal guarantees for various aspects of
social life and human rights of citizens.
</P>
<P>
China cracks down on criminal offenses in accordance with law,
and guarantees the safety of the livelihood and property of its
citizens, as well as various other aspects of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Public security and judicial departments have consistently
cracked down on serious violent crimes such as homicides,
robberies, rape and the illegal use of explosives.
</P>
<P>
People's courts across China handled some 480,000 cases of the
first instance and sentenced more than 530,000 criminals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition to investigating and punishing crimes and
protecting the rights of victims according to law, judicial
departments have also paid close attention to safeguarding the
legal rights of defendants and criminal suspects in terms of legal
aid, defense, applications for withdrawal of judicial personnel,
appeals, charges against infringements of legal rights and
obtaining compensation.
</P>
<P>
Various courts in the past year concluded 1,431 cases of state
compensation in strict accordance with the State Indemnity Law and
ensured the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.

In 1998, courts at all levels extended great efforts to promote
open trials and intensify social and media supervision over court
proceedings. Open trials were conducted in all first instance
cases, with the exception case the law defines as inappropriate
for a public hearing. In terms of second instance cases, courts
adopted open trials and related verdicts or rulings were announced
publicly.
</P>
<P>
Trials of various major cases were televised or broadcast live.
The general public has voiced total support for 11 higher people's
courts and 58 intermediate courts which have permitted televised
cases.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court issued its "Regulations on Strictly
Enforcing the Open Trial System" in March 1999. The regulations
contain stringent standards for the scope of trials open to the
public. The regulations specifically stipulate that all
proceedings and aspects of trial-related activities must be open
to the public. They also provide for relevant mechanisms which
guarantee implementation of the open trial system.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Govt to Crack Down Illegal Fishing on Mekong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government is
determined to take tough measures to stop illegal fishing now "in
a state of anarchy" in Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, local
reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers warned last week that a failure to
take actions could lead to the virtual extinction of fish in some
Cambodian waters.
</P>
<P>
The directive instructed the co-ministers of Defense and
Interior, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF)
commander-in-chief, police directors, and all levels of local
authorities to "take strict and suitable measures against armed
men who get involved in fishing offshores."
</P>
<P>
The government's new directive also called for a crackdown on
fishing out of season, selling baby fish to foreign countries, and
on foreign boats fishing in Cambodian waters.
</P>
<P>
A fisheries expert estimated recently that more than 100
motorized illegal trawlers regularly ply the waters of Mekong
River between Kandal and Kompong Cham provinces. They were able to
do so by paying as much as 400 U.S. dollars a day in bribes, a
government official was quoted by the Cambodia Daily as saying
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing has become a mounting concern in recent years, as
the number of fish has steadily decreased. Fish stocks are now
believed to be at an all-time low. Enforcement of the nation's
fishing law has been stymied by corruption and lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
The government measures are expected to at least prevent
anarchic activities.

IV. Citizen's Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the protection of citizen's
labor and social security rights. In order to protect citizen's
rights of employment, the state offers employment services and
directions through developing various employment agencies, creates
jobs, opens job training classes and adopts many other measures to
promote the workers' employment and re-employment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, with the economic development, China
has created non-agricultural jobs of more than 250 million, and
130 million laborers have been changed from the agricultural to
non-agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had established over 34,000
employment agencies. With their help, a total of 8.737 million
people found jobs that year. The registered unemployment rate in
cities and towns was 3.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A re-employment project aiming to solve the problem of the
jobless and the laid-off workers was initiated in 1994, and has
been carried out nationwide.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, all of the state-owned enterprises with
laid-off workers had set up re-employment service centers and 99
percent of the laid-off workers had registered with the centers,
with 93.2 percent of them receiving living expenses from the
centers. With the help of the re-employment project, 10.425
million workers laid off by state-owned enterprises were re-
employed in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Hotels See Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Pushed by a boom in tourism,
occupancy rates in Bangkok hotels are steadily rising as the
economy begins to revive slowly, a leading Thai hotelier said.
</P>
<P>
Most hotels were reporting occupancy rates of about 60 percent,
while international train hotels were doing even better, Prakit
Chinamornphong, secretary of the Thai hotels Association, said in
remarks published by Tuesday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
The last three years have been hard on Bangkok hoteliers, with
several new properties opening just as the economy started to
slump. The struggle to fill 65,000 rooms led to price wars, but
tourist stays in the capital declined because of concern about
traffic and pollution.
</P>
<P>
Many hotel owners, most of them well-known business families in
need of cash to pay down debts, have put their properties up for
sale. Foreign investors have been shopping, but the prices they're
offering don't match owners' expectations.
</P>
<P>
But the situation has been changed for the better. "Foreign
tourists and business travelers are beginning to come as Thailand
is gradually becoming well-known because of the Amazing Thailand
campaign," Jan Heesbeen, director of marketing for the JW Marriot
Hotel, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile the government continues to promote and advertise
the country, and the cheap baht is attracting foreigners to shop
and visit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, Thailand, particularly Bangkok, has not stopped
developing its basic infrastructure, while other capitals in this
region have stopped their projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the first three months of this year, we attracted more
international meetings from this region. The upturn in the economy
and the stable foreign exchange rate is bringing back business and
the trend for the hotel industry in Bangkok is slowly heading up,"
Heesbeen said.

The Chinese government also took effective measures to
seriously organize rebuilding projects in the floods-hit areas and
ensured that no major epidemic diseases prevailed.
</P>
<P>
It also guaranteed that people in the flood-hit areas spent the
winter safely and ensured a smooth rebuilding of their homeland
and resumption of their normal life and production.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 witnessed the further spreading of the Asian
financial crisis which serious harmed the economic profits of many
Asian and Latin American countries and resulted in the
deterioration of the living conditions of hundreds of millions of
people and had a deep impact on China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government positively responded to the Asian
financial crisis, successfully protected the country from the
effects of the crisis, achieved relatively rapid growth of the
economy and people's living standards have further improved.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the GDP rose by 7.8 percent over the previous year,
the per capita income of the rural residents was 4.3 percent up
over the previous year in real terms and per capita disposable
income of urban residents increased by 5.8 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China encountered pressure and endured great
economic losses because many neighboring countries devalued their
currencies by a large margin. But China has been maintaining it
would not devalue the Renminbi and has been making every possible
effort to help certain countries.
</P>
<P>
China made its own contributions to maintaining stability of
the world economy and reducing the harmful impact of the financial
crisis on people's subsistence and development conditions, winning
universal praise from countries worldwide.

<HEADLINE> China Deserves WTO Membership: Australian Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China deserves a place in the
World Trade Organization (WTO), a leading Australian newspaper
said Tuesday, hailing as a welcome development that China will
become a member of the WTO by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review described as a major step
forward the undertaking of the United States late last week that
it firmly supports China's entry to the WTO by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of universal participation in the rules-based global
trading system took a major step forward late last week with the
agreement by United States President Bill Clinton and Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji on a substantial down payment towards Beijing's
entry to the WTO," the paper said in a lengthy editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Although a final deal is not yet done, and important gaps
remain, the quality of the package makes it likely, if not yet
inevitable," it said.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States should capitalize on the progress
made last week and work to close the deal well in advance of the
November launch of global trade talks," the paper said.

<P>
SOFIA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- CSKA goalkeeper Ivailo Ivanov and
Captain Adalbert Zafirov were attacked when they emerged from the
changing rooms after the half time break of the match between CSKA
and Levski-Kyustendil played on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Protests were issued after the controversial match between the
two teams.
</P>
<P>
In the last match of the 22nd round of the first division of
the national football championship in Kyustendil, the CSKA players
failed to come out after the half time break. They led 1-0
against their hosts.
</P>
<P>
The management of the football club said that CSKA goalkeeper
Ivailo Ivanov and Captain Adalbert Zafirov were attacked by
unknown persons when they emerged from the changing rooms.
</P>
<P>
The players of Levski-Kyustendil and their fans denied any
violence and accused their opponents with unworthy performance.
</P>
<P>
In a special statement CSKA President Iliya Pavlov said that
what happened "has gone beyond any norms of sport competition,
sportsmanship and normal human relations".
</P>
<P>
According to Pavlov, the beating of Zafirov and Ivanov is not
only an unprecedented act of hooliganism but an organized
violation against sport. Pavlov described as an alarming fact
that at time the brutal act was committed the law-enforcement
officials were absent from their position.
</P>
<P>
CSKA Football Club Executive Director Georgi Hristov said that
the club will fight for its rights to the end as the result of the
match will be taken into account by all the clubs in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"We can approach the UEFA committees if we have to," Hristov
told a special news conference about the accident.
</P>
<P>
Already on Sunday the Interior Ministry said that Head of the
National Police Service General Vassil Vassilev has ordered an
immediate investigation of the event.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Ministry is
working on cutting import duties for various products to help
domestic manufacturers reduce their production costs, the Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said the government will soon
announce the cut in import duties as a follow-up to an economic
stimulus package announced on March 30.
</P>
<P>
He said the duties will be cut from the current range of 0
percent to 30 percent to a new range of 0 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
About nine categories of goods will be eligible for the cut,
and their average tax rate will fall by half from the current 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the duties for raw materiel will be cut to 0 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the planned cut in import duties will reduce the
government's tax revenue in the range of 10 billion baht (270
million U.S. dollars) a year.

<HEADLINE> Timeshare Industry Continues Rapid Growth in United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Timesharing, or vacation
ownership, has become the fastest growing segment of the U.S.
travel and tourism industry, up 12.4 percent last year and 10
times since 1980.
</P>
<P>
In a market analysis released Monday, the American Resort
Development Association said the United States continues to be the
world leader in vacation ownership with over two million owners.
There are more than 1,600 resorts in the United States and
domestic sales were estimated at three billion U.S. dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Vacation ownership has become a major vacation option among
baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1965. The average age
of today's timeshare buyer is 49 years old. It is estimated that
more than 75 million Americans will turn 50 during the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The association said that with the largest concentration of
vacation ownership's key demographic coming of age over the next
two decades, the timeshare industry can expect continued growth.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first laboratory for
testing the dynamic structures of large-span bridges is to be
opened in southwestern Chongqing City.
</P>
<P>
Construction experts here said that the lab, attached to the
Ministry of Communications, will be of great importance for
establishing guidelines and rules for the building of such bridges.
</P>
<P>
The lab will carry out simulated tests of earthquakes, strong
winds and vehicle movements to learn how the bridges could be
damaged in those conditions, a major problem for these structures.
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Daily reported that China has been
witnessing a rapid growth of large-span bridges and the key span
of the Shanghai Yangpu compound stayed-cable bridge is more than
600 meters while the key span of Humen suspension bridge in
Guangdong Province is 888 meters.

<HEADLINE> Progress in China's Human Rights Conditions in 1998 (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1998, the First Session of the Ninth NPC heard and
deliberated work reports from the State Council, the Supreme
People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate; and
examined and approved the Plan for National Economic and Social
Development, as well as the financial budgets. It also elected and
decided the new leadership of the state.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC and its Standing Committee have deliberated and
adopted 24 laws and decisions concerning legal issues over the
past one year and more. In March 1999, in particular, the Second
Session of the Ninth NPC made amendments to the Constitution by
adding "implementing the principle of governing the country
according to law and making it a socialist country based on the
rule of law".
</P>
<P>
The elevation of "governing the country according to law,"
which is a basic principle in administering state affairs, into a
constitutional principle, is of great significance to the building
of a democratic and legal system and to the guaranteeing of human
rights according to law.
</P>
<P>
The legislation work has become more democratic. In 1998, the
NPC Standing Committee made public the draft amendments to Land
Administration Law, the drafts to the Organic Law of Villagers'
Committees and the Contract Law and received opinions and
suggestions from all walks of life. Members of the NPC Standing
Committee toured the country to solicit opinions and suggestions
about the formulation and revision of many law drafts.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its standing committee have remarkably intensified
their supervision upon implementation of laws. In the 1993-1997
period, the Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC inspected the
implementation of 23 laws and decisions concerning legal affairs,
including the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and
Interests and Labor Law.

In 1998, the Standing Committee of the Ninth NPC organized six
groups and inspected implementation of six laws and decisions
concerning legal affairs including the Agriculture Law. And
various special committees inspected the implementation of eight
laws, including the law on the autonomy of ethnic minority regions.
The inspections have effectively prompted the implementation of
those laws.
</P>
<P>
People's deputies have been more enthusiastic in exercising
state power. During the First Session of the Ninth NPC in 1998,
deputies put forward 830 proposals, a record number; and put
forward 2,782 suggestions, criticism and opinions, with replies
having been made to each of them by relevant government
departments.
</P>
<P>
At the Second Session of the Ninth NPC in 1999, people's
deputies put forward 759 motions, of which 60 percent are related
to legislation, again a record number, which demonstrated the
increased awareness of the deputies of the importance of governing
the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee also deals with complaint and advice
letters and visits from the people. In 1998, the NPC Standing
Committee received more than 60,000 letters, met over 11,000
ordinary citizens and urged relevant departments to conclude a
number of important cases and solve actual problems and
difficulties for the people.
</P>
<P>
The system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation led by the Chinese Communist Party is an important
component of China's democratic and political system.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has been redoubling efforts to make the social security network
cover more people.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, old-age insurance policies will
increase to 6.28 million by the end of the year, a net rise of 1.
45 million people over the present 4.83 million.
</P>
<P>
As a result the province will see a rise of 1.05 billion yuan
in its total old-age insurance premiums, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province is expected to have 7.54 million
workers taking out unemployment insurance policies by the end of
this year, a rise of 3.55 million over 1998. And the fund levied
from employers against unemployment will amount to 940 million
yuan by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Information from the provincial bureau of labor and social
security said that 53 percent of the province's workers have taken
out unemployment insurance policies, and another 73.2 percent of
its workers have taken out old-age insurance policies, both higher
than the national averages.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of people taking out insurance policies to
cater for old age, jobless, work accidents and medical costs
amount to 13 million in the province, most of whom are people
working in enterprises.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Colombian Government Confirms Avianca Plane Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government confirmed
on Monday night that an Avianca airlines plane had been hijacked,
saying that all the 41 passengers and five crew members aboard
were led into the forest 500 kilometers north of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The government did not specify the hijackers or the reasons why
they led the hostages into the forest.
</P>
<P>
"No one has claimed responsibility for this act," the
government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Air Force General Hector Velasco told local radio stations that
search helicopters had spotted the plane, which disappeared from
radar screens minutes after taking off from the northeastern city
of Bucaramanga.
</P>
<P>
The Fokker-50 plane was reported missing an hour after failing
to land at the Eldorado international airport at Bogota, a 45-
minute flight from Bucaramanga.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Huertas, head of Colombia's civil aviation authority,
Aerocivil, said the Fokker was found "in excellent condition on an
airstrip called Los Avalos," near the town of Simiti.
</P>
<P>
"Police were on the runway, entered the plane, but did not find
any passengers or crew," he said. "We have no further information.
"
</P>
<P>
The area has been the scene of activities of the country's
leftist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
and rebels of the National Liberation Army. However, neither rebel
group claimed responsibility for the disappearance of the
passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
General Rafael Hernandez, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
said the search efforts would continue to rescue the "kidnapped
occupants" of the plane.

<HEADLINE> Bio-safety Legislation Enhanced in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Legislation on bio-safety
administration, to protect human health and the environment, is
about to be strengthened in China.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are becoming increasingly concerned about potential
risks which may arise from the increasing application of gene
engineering techniques, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The central government is drafting a National Framework for bio-
safety Administration. This will provide the basis for a set of
legal regulations to be worked out by the State to standardize
application and management of gene technology and its products,
said Yang Chaofei, department director in charge of ecology
preservation with the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
The regulations will function as a technical guidebook for
professionals to avoid risks, said Yang, who believes the
framework and regulation will boost healthy development of the bio-
industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Headed by SEPA, eight state departments are participating in
drafting the framework, which is expected to be completed around
the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists estimate bio-technology will become a major
sector for economic growth in China during the next century.
</P>
<P>
Gene-transformation could enhance crops' resistance against
adverse natural conditions such as drought and cold, as well as
pesticides to greatly increase grain output to feed China, which
has the world's largest population.
</P>
<P>
China has developed 47 species of gene-transformation plants,
seven of which are under field testing.
</P>
<P>
China, since 1993, has promulgated three sets of regulations:
Gene Engineering Safety Administration, Agriculture Biological
Gene Engineering Safety Administration and Human Genetic Resources
Management.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Writers Condemn NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian writers Monday
condemned NATO's bombings against Yugoslavia and called for a
diplomatic solution within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The bombings that are being carried out indiscriminately by
NATO forces against Yugoslavia form a violation of the
international rights established in the Charter of the United
Nations," said writer Luis Carlos Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian writer, who has published his poetry work in
Colombia, the United States, Mexico and Central America, held that
the United States has no right to intervene in the internal
affairs of a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
"The argument used by NATO for this military interference in
Yugoslavia is so weak that voices of protest have been raised even
in the very member countries of the alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians are fleeing Kosovo in large numbers since the
NATO alliance started the bombing 19 days ago to force Yugoslavia
to agree to a peace plan for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's
Serbian Republic.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian poet and novelist Jose Franco also condemned NATO's
indiscriminate bombing in Yugoslavia and accused it of causing an
exodus of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with the violence that has been unleashed
against this Balkan country and I condemn NATO's bombing," said
the Panamanian author, who twice won the Miro Prize, the biggest
literary prize of this country.
</P>
<P>
"We know how a war begins, but one never knows how it will end,
" added Franco.

<HEADLINE> China to Quadruple Consumption of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will quadruple consumption
of natural gas in about a decade out of concern for worsening
environmental pollution, according to the State Administration of
Petroleum and Chemicals (SAPC).
</P>
<P>
Long-distance pipelines are to be built for gas transmission
from China's gas-rich western areas to the east and the south
where energy resources are in shortage while the demand is great,
said officials at a two-day seminar opened yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Geng, deputy director of the SAPC, was quoted by Tuesday's
China Daily as saying that foreign investors will be invited to
participate in long-distance pipeline construction at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for foreign investors may come for building a gas
pipeline to stretch thousands of kilometers from Russia to China
as the Chinese government is considering introduction of Russian
gas, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The French oil giant Total and Gaz de France, which is hosting
the China-France Gas Industry Policy Seminar together with China
National Petroleum Corp, are among the firms that wish to
participate in China's gas programs.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas now accounts for only 2 percent of energy
consumption in China, compared with the 23 percent world average.
In contrast, coal, which tends to pollute heavily when transformed
into energy, supplies 75 percent of China's energy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is considering policy support in
taxation and pricing, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, subsidies may compensate end-users as the country
will have to maintain high natural gas prices to ensure
developers' revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government
deplores the use of force by NATO in Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister
Jose Eduardo Ritter said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Panama adheres to the position adopted recently by the
countries of the Rio Group, which rejects the use of violence to
solve the ethnic conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo," he
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is worried about the refugees situation
in Kosovo, adding, "We are closely following the removal of
refugees."
</P>
<P>
Recalling Panama's benefits from the diplomatic solution of the
Panama Canal problem, the minister urged parties concerned to
start dialogue to solve the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
"Panama deplores the use of force because it itself has taken
advantage of peaceful means to solve the Panama Canal Problem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Panama signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty with the United States
in 1977, with which it leveled the way for the Canal's recovery
from the U.S. with the help of the UN.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty the United States will return the canal
to Panamanian sovereignty on December 31, 1999, and before this
date, it should withdraw its troops after almost 70 years of
military occupation.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Steps up Construction of Agricultural Hi-Tech Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural hi-tech zone in
Shaanxi Province, which was set up as a demonstration zone for dry
farming in northwest China, is making progress.
</P>
<P>
Founded in July of 1997, the Yangling hi-tech zone, 82 km east
of the provincial capital of Xi'an, covers an area of 22.12 sq km.
It is becoming the country's most important research base for dry
farming.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2002, the zone's gross domestic product will reach
about 2 billion yuan, according to Zhang Guangqiang, deputy
secretary general of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Irrigated farmland in northwest China makes up one-third of the
country's total. However, farm production of the area is backward
due to drought and lack of water.
</P>
<P>
So far, the zone has forged cooperation ties with Israel, the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
It has also reached an agreement with a Hong Kong firm on the
establishment of a farm technology development company, which will
involve 10 million yuan in investment from each side.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the zone has approved 85 projects involving a total
investment of 2.85 billion yuan. Output value of the zone will
exceed 7 billion yuan a year with the operation of all the
projects.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Launch WTO Action on S.Korea Beef Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia will initiate dispute
action in the World Trade Organization (WTO) over import
restrictions on Australian beef exports to South Korea, Australian
deputy prime minister and trade minister Tim Fischer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Given lack of progress on the issue we have been left with
little choice other than to initiate WTO action," Fischer said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that following a successful Australia challenge in 1989
under the then GATT system, South Korea had set in train import
liberalization measures and was required to undertake further
liberalization by 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, however, the pace of reform (in South Korea)
has stalled. In addition to tariff quotas, (South) Korea still
maintains a number of impediments on the sale of imported beef."
</P>
<P>
"Without a road map for dismantling those barriers, the 2001
objectives sanctioned by the GATT/WTO might not be achievable,"
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is Australia's third largest beef market worth an
average of 88 million U.S. dollars a year over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the next step in the dispute with South Korea
would be to proceed with a panel request in May or June.
</P>
<P>
The United States is taking similar dispute action against
South Korea, he said.

<HEADLINE> Non-Beijingers Advised Not to Come to Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- People living outside of Beijing
are advised not to visit the capital when it stages various
activities to mark the 50th founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China, a city official has declared.
</P>
<P>
"This is to ensure a secure and orderly environment for the
celebrations to mark National Day, which falls on October 1," said
Meng Xuenong, deputy director of the Beijing Preparatory Committee
for the 50th Founding Anniversary, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As many as half a million people will participate in the
events which will feature a military and grand parade in the heart
of the city.
</P>
<P>
"It has been our practice for quite a long while to advise
people from outside not to come here if they can possibly help it,
during or after the National Day," added Meng, who is also the
executive vice-mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The municipality is also considering some new ways to cope
with its vast migrant population," Meng said.
</P>
<P>
According to a census conducted last October, Beijing has a
migrant population of approximately 2.859 million, of which 1.85
million are employed or run their own businesses here.
</P>
<P>
"The migrants have contributed a lot to Beijing's rapid
development," Meng said. "But the vast numbers have also put much
strain on the city's infrastructure and management."
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities are now considering a series of new
measures to control the numbers of migrant workers and businessmen,
and reduce them by 300,000 to about 1.55 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Those migrants without living and working permits or business
licenses will be sent back to their home towns," Meng said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beijing intends to offer new preferential
policies to attract more high-tech and management talents to the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Economy Passes All IMF-set Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has met
all of the International Monetary Fund's first-quarter performance
criteria, or the economic indicators used to determine the
country's qualifications to avail itself of the Fund's facilities,
Business World reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's standby facility with the IMF, the
government must meet set targets on net international reserves
(NIR), foreign borrowings, domestic liquidity and public sector
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Official government figures show that as of end-March, NIR --
the net foreign exchange position of the central bank and
commercial banks --stood at 9.847 billion U.S. dollars. This
translates to a 1.83 billion U.S. dollar surplus for the first
quarter, already in excess of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollar target
for the year.
</P>
<P>
On foreign borrowing, outstanding short-term borrowings in the
first quarter as recorded by the Central Bank stood at only 140
million U.S. dollars, or exactly 160 million dollar less than the
target for the period.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing with maturities of one to five years amounted to only
1.8 billion U.S. dollars during the period, or 400 million U.S.
dollars less than the 2.2 billion U.S. dollar target.
</P>
<P>
On domestic liquidity, the Central Bank reported that it has
kept base money and reserve money levels at 18 billion pesos (450
million U.S. dollars) and 30 billion pesos (750 million dollars)
respectively, below the ceilings set with the IMF for the first
three months.
</P>
<P>
Department of Finance simulations also show the government will
meet its 34.2-billion peso (855 million dollar) public sector
borrowing requirement target for the first three months.

The per capita food consumption expenses of residents dropped
continuously. The "Engel's Coefficient," which indicates the ratio
between the expenses of food and other items of consumption,
dropped from 59.5 percent in 1978 to 46.4 percent in 1997 and that
of rural residents went down to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, comprehensive calculation in terms of
economic development, living standards, quality of the population
and quality of people's cultural life and living environment
showed that by 1997, 86.52 percent of the Chinese had reached the
preliminary standards of a comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the living standards of Chinese people have
exceeded the level of having adequate food and clothing, and is
approaching the standards of a comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China is continuing its tremendous efforts on the
protection and promotion of people's rights to subsistence and
development.
</P>
<P>
China was hit in 1998 by rare catastrophic floods. Those hit by
floods were over 200 million people and the direct economic losses
topped 200 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the fight against the floods, the Chinese government
always gave top priority to ensuring the safety of people's lives
in the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The government mobilized people all over the country to take
every possible effort to ensure that people in the flood-hit areas
had food to eat, clothes to wear, clean water to drink, proper
accommodation and access to doctors.
</P>
<P>
All these provided proper arrangements for people in the flood-
hit areas and the measures minimized losses of life and property.

BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has

<HEADLINE> Philippines' T-bill Rates Fall to Pre-crisis Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The yield on the Philippine
government's 91-day Treasury bill fell 51.5 points Monday as banks
aggressively pushed down interest rates in the wake of the latest
cut in the Central Bank's key overnight rates, the Business World
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the 91-day T-bill, which banks use
as a basis in pricing their loans, settled at 10.972 percent, the
first time it went below 11 percent since June 30, 1997, or just
before the start of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But while interest rates are falling, the national government
and monetary authorities are still not getting the desired
result-- an increase in bank lending which will eventually help
jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
Money market traders said banks flocked to Monday's auction,
indicating their desire to put their money in government
securities rather than face the risks of new loans.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Department of Finance is raising the
pressure on banks to lend by reducing anew the amount the
government borrows through the weekly T-bill auctions.
</P>
<P>
The government now borrows 5 billion pesos (125 million U.S.
dollars) weekly from banks through T-bills. It reduced the auction
size by 500 million pesos (12.5 million dollars) last month.
</P>
<P>
With less government securities to invest their funds in, banks
will have little alternative but to start lending to businesses.
</P>
<P>
Monetary authorities have also implemented a number of moves to
encourage banks to lend, including slashing key interest rates and
reducing their reserve requirements.

BRUSSELS -- U.S. Secretary of State Medeleine Albright said
here Monday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
needs "patience and perseverance" over the air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After NATO foreign ministers had their special meeting on
Kosovo crisis at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Albright told
reporters that "what has become evident with the military campaign
is that it is systematically biding into and destroying the
machine of repression."
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told there was no plans of ground troops
deployment. After the special ministerial meeting, reporters were
also told that the 19 foreign ministers of the alliance did not
talk about matters concerning ground troops. But some journalists
wondered if the ministers privately discussed certain aspects of
such deployment. (NATO-Yugoslavia)

GENEVA -- China's accession to the World Trade Organization (

said WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The recent meeting of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and U.
S. President Bill Clinton (in Washington) has brought the
negotiation for China's entry to the WTO very near its conclusion,
" Ruggiero told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing from the WTO point of view, it is also positive that a
full agreement has not been found on a bilateral basis," he said.
"We now have better conditions for achieving a multilateral
agreement which will lead China into the WTO before the end of
this year."

<HEADLINE> China to Limit Number of Laid-Off Workers to 7 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to limit the number
of workers laid off from State-owned enterprises to 7 million this
year, 1 million more than in 1998, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 24.5 billion yuan (3 billion US dollars) will be needed to
take care of these workers this year, Wang Jianlun, vice-minister
of Labor and Social Security, told the daily.
</P>
<P>
Taking better care of laid-off workers and further expanding
coverage of the pension system are being given priority by the
ministry, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Once laid off, workers enroll at enterprises-based re-
employment service centers, where they get a monthly allowance
ranging from 140 yuan to 380 yuan.
</P>
<P>
This allowance is paid by the government, the unemployment
insurance fund and the enterprises themselves, said Mo Rong, an
expert at the Institute of Labor Studies.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers can stay registered at a center for a maximum
of three years. They will be absorbed into the unemployment
insurance network if they fail to get a job with that period, Mo
said.
</P>
<P>
If they are still jobless after receiving unemployment
insurance for another two years, they will only be entitled to a
minimum allowance from funds run by the Ministry of Civil Affairs,
Mo said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the pension system, Vice-Minister Wang said that, by
the end of June, the pension network should have expanded to cover
110 million people, 26 million more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since May last year, the bureaus of labor and social security
have been working to ensure pensions are paid on time and make up
for any delayed payments, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Since September last year, 99 percent of retired workers
receive a monthly pension. some 3 billion yuan of delayed pensions
have been distributed to date, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises are required to pay a contribution into employee'
pension accounts. Some unprofitable enterprises fail to pay their
share, and others simply shirk their responsibility. This led to a
shortage of pension funds, hence the delay in payment, Mo said.
</P>
<P>
A thorough check will be carried out to ensure at least 50
percent of the payment due is collected by the year end, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities announced Monday
that 800 people will be evacuated from an area in western Cuban
because of a forest fire that is burning out of control.
</P>
<P>
The fire started on April 8 in the far west of the island,
known as "Las Delicias," where there is an abundance of pine and
eucalyptus trees. Around 6,000 hectares of the forest are
reportedly burning, but no casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Three planes have conducted 14 flights over the area to douse
the flames with water. The cause of the fire is still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorological sources, the Caribbean region
shared by western Cuba and the southern United States is now under
the influence of dry air currents, which hinders the fighting
against this kind of fire.

ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi

Speaking at the Quirinale presidential palace, Scalfaro

and that the pursuit of peace was a moral duty.
</P>
<P>
"Italy, which is totally faithful to the pacts and accords it
has signed, has a desire and an inextinguishable cry for peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy has come under fire in certain quarters of the U.S.
government for not being a reliable ally and for allowing parallel

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council issued here today an article on China's 1998 human
rights conditions, noting that the protection and promotion of
people's rights to subsistence and development has been China's
top task in the field of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Progress in China's Human Rights Cause in 1998," the
article said China's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by
nearly five times in the past two decades, with the per capita GDP
going up by 3.4 times.
</P>
<P>
Despite the effect of the deep impact of the Asian financial
crisis and the catastrophic floods, China managed to achieve a GDP
growth rate of 7.8 percent in 1998, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the rural residents was 4.3 percent up
over the previous year in real terms, while the per capita
disposable income of urban residents increased by 5.8 percent in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
With the common efforts made by the government and the people
from all walks of life, another eight million rural people in
poverty-stricken areas met their basic need for food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The country's total poverty-stricken population dropped from
250 million in 1978 to 42 million so far. China has witnessed the
quickest decrease in its poverty-stricken population more than any
other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 13,000-word article consists of seven parts: 1. People's
Rights to Subsistence and Development; 2. Guarantee of Citizens'
Political Rights; 3. Judicial Guarantee for Human Rights; 4.
Citizens' Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 5. Legitimate
Rights and Interests of Women and Children; 6. Rights of Ethnic
Minority Groups; 7. Foreign Exchange and Cooperation in the Field
of Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Worries about World Youth Championships Poor Attendance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The world soccer governing body
FIFA said Monday that the cost of matches tickets and mediocre
performance of the host team have caused empty terraces in the
stadiums for the ongoing World Youth Soccer Championships in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said that the turnout at the first-round games was less
than 3,000 on average and only 800 spectators showed up at the
match between Ireland and Australia on Saturday in the south-
western city of Ibadan.
</P>
<P>
The tickets price was blamed for the poor attendance. The
cheapest seats in the tournament cost 250 naira ($2.70) but are
still regarded expensive in a country where civil servants earn
around 100 naira ($1.10) daily.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian side, who struggled to reach the second round,
lost their final group game to Paraguay on Saturday, prompting the
sacking of team coach Tunde Disu.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Marius Schneider said: "It is worrying to us
that spectators are not coming to see the games as expected."
</P>
<P>
Schneider said FIFA was considering lowering prices for tickets
but added that it would be difficult to convince the Nigerian
organisers to accept the plan.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what we can do because the current situation isn't
good," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Issues 1998 Human Rights Conditions (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While promoting people's rights to subsistence and development,
the article said, China pays great attention to the building of a
democratic and legal system, and the protection of citizens'
political rights according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing
Committee have adopted 24 laws and decisions concerning legal
issues since 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the second session of the Ninth NPC that was convened in
March 1999, the amendments was made to the current constitution by
adding the "rule of the country by law and building a socialist
legal state."
</P>
<P>
The elevation of the "rule of the country by law" into a
constitutional principle, which is a basic strategy in
administering the state affairs, is of great significance to
building a democratic and legal system and protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
The article noted China has made eye-catching progress in
promoting democracy in grass-roots units in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Villages across the country conduct rural grass-roots mass self-
management activities that focus on villagers' democratic
elections, policy-making, management and supervision.
</P>
<P>
To date, the system of village autonomy has been established in
a preliminary fashion in 60 percent of China's villages.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed China has rigorously enforced the letter
of the law and strengthened human rights protection efforts in
every aspect of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels extended great efforts to promote open
trials and intensified social and media supervision over court
proceedings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Trials of various major cases were televised or broadcast live.
So far, altogether 11 higher people's courts and 58 intermediate
courts have permitted televised broadcast of some cases.

The article said China attaches great importance to the
protection of citizens' labor and social security rights.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect citizens' rights of employment, the state
offers employment services and directions through developing
various employment agencies, creates jobs, opens job training
classes and adopts many other measures to promote the workers'
employment and reemployment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, all of the state-owned enterprises with
laid-off workers had set up reemployment service centers, helping
99 percent of the layoffs, and 93.2 percent of the layoffs
received living expenses from the centers.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the reemployment projects, 10.425 million
workers laid off by the state-owned enterprises were reemployed in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social relief and social welfare work has developed
steadily, the article said.
</P>
<P>
A system to ensure a minimum living standard for city residents
had been established in 600 cities and 1,242 counties by the end
of 1998, providing relief for more than 3.32 million people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the article said, the right of Chinese citizens to
receive education has been further protected. The state has
increased investment in education, and vigorously created improved
educational conditions for citizens.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, an additional 360 counties, cities and districts met
the demand to make the nine years of compulsory education
universal and basically wipe out illiteracy among the young and
adults.
</P>

The article pointed out that an increasing number of Chinese
women have been involved in the management of the country's
political and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
There are 650 women deputies to the Ninth NPC and 341 female
members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The number of women employees in China has increased as a
result of larger proportion of women employed than before.
According to a survey conducted by the International Labor
Organization in the United States, Russia, India and other 26
countries in 1998, the employment rate of Chinese women reached 56
percent, ranking first among all the other countries.
</P>
<P>
The rights of children are protected in accordance with law,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Project Hope helped 251,800 school dropouts and built
1,855 primary schools, while aiding 53,907 children from poor
families.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed all ethnic groups in China are equal and

ethnic minority groups have their representatives and members in
the Ninth NPC and CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Officials with ethnic minority background amounted to 2.5
million in China today. In 1998, Tibetan officials made up of 74.9
percent of all officials in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>

The state offers the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities with
policy preference as well as funds, technologies and skilled
professionals for the socioeconomic development there.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the financial subsidies to the Tibet
Autonomous Region by the central government surpassed 1.2 billion
yuan (about 144.6 million U.S. dollars) each year.
</P>
<P>

The article said the Chinese government has always attached
great importance to international human rights covenants, which
are regarded as playing an active role in promoting the progress
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has so far signed a total of 17 international covenants
on human rights and tried all out to implement the covenants which
China has joined.
</P>
<P>
On the above basis, the Chinese government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in
October 1997 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
China is now studying and deliberating the two covenants in
accordance with the Constitution and concerned laws.
</P>
<P>
The same as the rest of the world, China has many problems
which should be solved in the field of human rights, the article
said, adding that the Chinese government is willing to learn from
other countries' useful experience in promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
China will persistently accelerate the progress in human rights,
the article said, and meanwhile, it will actively push forward the
healthy development in international human rights progress through
dialogues and cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer club Juventus star
Zinedine Zidane has given Manchester United a boost ahead of next
week's Champions' League semi-final second leg after the French
midfielder suffered a recurrence of his knee injury.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Monday, Zidane was out for three
weeks with a twisted knee before last Wednesday's first leg but
was outstanding on his return in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
However, the injury problem flared up again during Sunday's
game against Bologna, forcing the World Player of the Year to be
substituted at half-time.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come out for the second half because the joint was
giving me trouble," Zidane said. "I told the coach that I didn't
want to go on and he agreed.
</P>
<P>
"But it's strange all the same. I didn't feel anything for the
90 minutes in Manchester but here all it needed was 45 minutes to
cause me problems."
</P>
<P>
Juventus, who face Italian league leaders Lazio on Saturday,
will have to decide later this week whether to risk the World Cup-
winning midfielder.

<HEADLINE>   Utah's Karl Malone Named NBA Player of The Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Utah's Karl Malone, who led
the Jazz to a 4-0 record last week, today was named NBA Player of
the Week for games played Monday, April 5, through Sunday, April
11.
</P>
<P>
Malone averaged 28.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.0
steals per game, while shooting .573 (39-for-68) from the field
and .802(37-for-42) from the free throw line. He ranked second in
scoring, ninth in field-goal percentage, and tied for 11th in
rebounding among league leaders for the week.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that might have been the finest week of Malone's
career," said Jazz head coach Jerry Sloan. "We probably wouldn't
have won once this week without him. He's won a lot of games for
us over the years. And he knows what he has to do. Nobody tells
him. He just keeps on doing it."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday at the Los Angeles Lakers, Malone set a franchise
record by shooting 12-for-12 from the field, scoring 30 points,
grabbing 10 rebounds and handing out five assists in a Jazz win.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he had 38 points, 12 rebounds and five assists in
a defeat of Golden State. Friday night, he recorded 31 points, 10
rebounds, three assists and two steals against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Malone made three consecutive free throws with six-tenths of a
second remaining in the game to propel the Jazz to a 93-92 victory
over the Suns at the Delta Center. The Mailman closed the week
with 16 points, 10 rebounds and two assists in an 85-76 victory
over Houston Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for NBA Player of the Week were Cleveland's
Shawn Kemp, Dallas' Gary Trent, Denver's Nick Van Exel, Detroit's
Grant Hill, Miami's Alonzo Mourning, Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway,
Phoenix's Jason Kidd and Clifford Robinson, and Sacramento's Chris
Webber.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Network, China to Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A San Francisco-based U.S.
enterprise announced Monday that it has signed exclusive
co-branding and revenue-sharing arrangements with China to promote
import and export growth through an e-commerce portal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Business Network, Inc., founded early last year to help
pioneer Internet services in China, said that the arrangements
were signed with six Chinese governmental ministries, and the
portal called "MeetChina.com" will connect the rest of the world
to the vast resources of China.
</P>
<P>
The first vertical market to be represented by the portal will
be the burgeoning Chinese electronics industry, said the Network,
quoting the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry as saying
that the portal is expected to play a significant role in boosting
China's growing export economy by allowing its manufacturers to
deal with foreign buyers directly.
</P>
<P>
Also participating will be one of the key investors in the new
portal, Pacific Technology Venture Fund-China, Inc. -- the venture
capital subsidiary of IDG, the world's leading IT media, research
and exposition company -- and Critical Path, Inc., one of the
world's leading Internet messaging technology companies.
</P>
<P>
The MeetChina.com Web site plans to offer the resources of over
15,000 Chinese electronics companies by the end of July, according
to U.S. Business Network. Other key Chinese industries are
scheduled to go online with the portal later this year.
</P>
<P>
"This revolutionary promotion center and electronic gateway
will allow foreign mass merchandisers to have rapid and direct
access to multiple categories of Chinese electronics products and
companies," said the network company.
</P>
<P>
MeetChina.com will initially host, design and promote the Web
sites of Chinese companies, said the Network, and as the promotion
center expands its activities this year, both sides will share
revenue through transaction brokerage fees, advertising sales and
membership dues.
</P>
<P>
The site is being designed by Total Creative/Skyrocket of San
Francisco.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs Yugoslav Passenger Train, 10 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRDALICA VILLAGE, Southern Yugoslavia, April 12 (Xinhua) --
NATO missiles hit a passenger train in broad daylight Monday in
southern Yugoslavia, killing 10 people and wounding 16 others.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a NATO plane fired two missiles at a
four-carriage train and another two at a highway above the railway
line at 11:40 (0940 GMT) near the village 260 kilometers southeast
of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Nine people died in the raid and the body of the 10th victim
was recovered later from the South Morava River below. More bodies
were feared washed away in the water, local authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 wounded, a female dentist from Nis was in critical
condition, doctors at a hospital in nearby Leskovac said.
</P>
<P>
When a group of reporters arrived at the scene at around 18:00
(1600 GMT), all the bodies were taken away, but fragments of human
brain could still be seen beside the railway base.
</P>
<P>
A blood-soaked cloth was dangling from a window of the skeleton
of a carriage severed into two parts by the blast.
</P>
<P>
The train, originated from Belgrade, was heading for Restovac
via Leskovac and Vranje.
</P>
<P>
The four projectiles, apparently air-to-surface missiles,
damaged the railway bridge that leads up to Greece and the highway
bridge that links Belgrade with Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
Windows were shattered and tiles shaken off the roofs of the
village houses nearby.
</P>
<P>
Voinsta Zivojnovic, chief of the regional government, said all
the train's passengers were civilians but that their total was not
known yet.
</P>
<P>
Many of the wounded were suffering from burns in the aftermath
of the fire caused by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
As the bus carrying reporters left Leskovac, the town where the
wounded were treated, air-raid sirens sounded at 20:40 (1840 GMT),
now almost a daily occurrence for most Yugoslav cities as NATO's
bombing campaign against the Balkan country entered the 20th
night.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Welcomes Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A luncheon attended by 1,000
distinguished guests was held here Monday to welcome Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji to Chicago, the fourth leg of his eight-day
trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon, Lieutenant Governor Corinne Wood of
Illinois told Zhu, "Your visit here today is truly a great honor."
</P>
<P>
The luncheon, which was attended by some business tycoons, U.S.
officials including Secretary of Commerce William Daley and local
officials, was organized by the Mid-America Committee.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Zhu expressed his hope that cooperation between
Illinois and China, particularly in agriculture, will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unprecedented achievement China has made in
agriculture, the country "still need to cooperate with the rest of
the world including the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Zhu also indicated that the agriculture agreement signed
between China and the U.S. last week serves the interests of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Wood stressed that China is a nation that has over the last two
decades made substantial progress in opening its markets and
society to the world.
</P>
<P>
Both Wood and Mayor of Chicago Richard Daley expressed their
strong interest in strengthening relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"Not only do many Chinese-Americans in the Chicago area want us
to build a greater bridge with China, people all across the great
city recognize China's importance to our economy," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, they admire China's rich cultural heritage that
they rarely get a chance to experience," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China is tremendously important to
Illinois and Illinois is important to... China," Wood said in her
remarks.
</P>
<P>
She said that the people of Illinois look forward to working
with Chinese people as partners and friends in the world
community.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier urged the American businessmen to seize the
opportunity in China.
</P>
<P>
"China is a huge market with tremendous potentials. The
friendly relations and cooperation between China and the United
States will bring tangible and boundless benefit to both peoples,"
Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the guests to use their influence to support China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Zhu and U.S. President Bill Clinton last week issued a joint
statement, in which the U.S. side committed itself to strongly
supporting China's entry into the WTO in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the luncheon, Secretary Daley, who is the
brother of Mayor Daley, reiterated the position of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
"It is good for China, it is good for the America and it is
good for the world trade," said the secretary.
