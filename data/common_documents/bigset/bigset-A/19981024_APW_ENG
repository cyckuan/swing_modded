Amnesty International criticizes South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ London-based human rights group
Amnesty International accused the South Korean government Saturday
of trying to control what was supposed to be an independent
national human rights commission.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has promised to launch a watchdog
commission to monitor human rights violations by police,
prosecutors, intelligence officials and other government agencies.
	   But according to the Justice Ministry's draft law, most of the
commission members will be government officials or people
recommended by the justice minister and appointed by the president.
	   The draft legislation ``does not in its present form conform to
international human rights standards. It would result in a
commission which lacks independence and investigative powers,''
Amnesty International Secretary General Pierre Sane said in an open
letter to President Kim.
	   ``We are therefore extremely concerned that the government ...
intends to secure adoption of this law without adequate public
consultation,'' said the letter, a copy of which was faxed to The
Associated Press.
	   On Tuesday, Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon said the government
plan was ``just a draft'' and more public consultation will follow.
	   President Kim, who had himself been persecuted by former
authoritarian leaders, became the first opposition leader to win
the presidency after emerging victorious from elections last
December.
	   He has since promised to promote human rights.

	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ With government troops
packing up to make way for talks with rebels, this bustling
commercial center on the muddy Caguan River has declared itself a
``laboratory of peace.''
	   Yet uncertainty surrounds the white flags of neutrality that
hang across town alongside Colombia's red-blue-and-yellow tricolor.
Business is hurting and some of the more prosperous inhabitants,
mostly ranchers, are fleeing.
	   If all goes as planned, the more than 2,000 soldiers of the 36th
Infantry Battalion will be gone soon. Then, guerrillas of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia will come to San Vicente,
the largest town in a huge expanse of steamy savannah and rugged
mountains.
	   President Andres Pastrana has ordered the army to withdraw by
Nov. 7 from an area the size of Switzerland to assure rebel
negotiators of their safety. He says the pullout will last at least
90 days.
	   It is yet unclear whether the peace talks will be held in San
Vicente, which apparently is the guerrillas' wish.
	   But no one doubts the Western Hemisphere's oldest and largest
rebel band, known by its Spanish initials FARC, will openly assert
the control it has long invisibly exercised over this southern
municipality of 45,000 people at the foot of Colombia's eastern
cordillera.
	   As Pastrana's 2-month-old government and the 34-year-old FARC
prepare for talks, the scales are tipped far in favor of the
guerrillas. At their strongest ever, the insurgents haven't lost a
battle in nearly a decade and hold at least 248 bargaining chips _
soldiers and police officers captured over the past year.
	   Pastrana held a secret jungle rendezvous with the FARC's
commander, Manuel Marulanda, in July to show his commitment to
ending a civil conflict rooted in socialist demands but now pursued
by guerrillas who act more like capitalists.
	   In a speech Thursday, Pastrana said the rendezvous created
conditions for ``a powerful alliance (with the rebels) against the
crime of drug trafficking, terrorism, privilege, corruption, human
rights abuses and disrespect for the environment.''
	   Many Colombians are skeptical about the motives of the FARC,
which has about 15,000 guerrillas.
	   In none of its internal documents does the movement talk of
peace, said Eduardo Pizarro, a political scientist in Bogota, the
capital. ``But the FARC loves to negotiate because it gives them
political visibility, a national presence, television.''
	   The talks will be an international spectacle, and a bitter pill
for Colombia's demoralized military.
	   Critics say the government is making a big, and risky,
concession by withdrawing troops. They worry the rebels will take
advantage to expand their military stronghold in the country's
south and increase their take from drug traffickers, who pay the
rebels for protection.
	   The San Vicente district has 20 square miles (51 square
kilometers) of coca crops, the government says, and it borders
regions that are home to most of Colombia's cocaine production.
	   Doing legitimate business in San Vicente is already becoming
difficult. The local farmers' credit union has gone bankrupt and
it's not yet clear whether banks will shut their doors.
	   Commerce has fallen 60 percent since the army pullout was
announced and worried ranchers have trucked out 70,000 of the
district's 500,000 head of cattle, said Lt. Col. Fernando Cabrera,
the 36th Battalion commander,
	   He said 40 families had left town in defiance of a rebel order
to remain.
	   There is no evidence of an exodus, however. For many people, the
fear is not of the FARC but of right-wing paramilitary death squads
they think could come calling after the peace talks end, looking
for alleged guerrilla sympathizers.
	   For most people, the army pullout won't change life much.
	   In the San Vicente district's more than 200 settlements along
the winding Caguan and tucked into surrounding hills, there is only
one real government _ the FARC. To the east, in the four other
municipalities being left by the army, it's pretty much the same.
	   Many in the region think the FARC wants a semiautonomous state.
	   Marulanda, the 68-year-old rebel leader who has been fighting
for four decades, has so far not specified any demands other than
the release of 452 jailed rebels in return for his captives. In a
Sept. 30 letter to Pastrana, he also insisted ``that no (state)
authority but the mayors'' be allowed in the withdrawal zone.
	   In the small town of Pinalito on the eastern limit of the zone,
the boss is a diminutive FARC commander who goes by the name
Alberto.
	   Alberto is sure the pending peace talks will not end with a
guerrilla demobilization.
	   ``Our goal is to take power,'' he told a reporter. ``We will
never hand over our arms and we will form an army, the army of the
people.''

	   PUERTO BETANIA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels control about
40 percent of the country, and in most places allow people to elect
their mayors and town councils.
	   But the elected officials have no illusions. They ultimately
answer to ``the boys'' or ``the country police'' or ``the tough
guys,'' as the guerrillas are known.
	   In this southern region, which is being vacated by the army
before Nov. 7 as a prelude to peace talks, the country's largest
rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has held
sway for years.
	   A rebel-imposed nighttime curfew on road travel and a drinking
limit of four beers a person is widely heeded. Violators of the
insurgents' civil code either accept their punishments, leave or
die.
	   For three months until September, the FARC banned fishing in the
Caguan River and its tributaries because stocks were depleted. A
man caught disobeying was bound in his net and left for hours on
the riverbank, praying the water wouldn't rise and drown him, said
Javier Salcedo, a mechanic in Puerto Betania.
	   ``Here someone gets killed in the street and everyone knows it
was done by the guerrillas. But nobody can say that,'' said a
councilman in San Vicente, the region's largest town 12 miles
upriver from Puerto Betania.
	   He and two fellow council members, who spoke only on condition
they not be quoted by name, offered a primer on guerrilla justice:
Get rowdy drunk in public and you carry 50 sacks of construction
material to public works sites. Curse someone's mother and it's 150
sacks. Punch someone and it's 500.
	   The last time a Colombian soldier set foot in Puerto Betania was
four years ago during presidential elections, said Salcedo, the
mechanic.
	   In areas where they are mostly in control, the guerrillas
sometimes kidnap elected officials, either for punishment or
persuasion.
	   In May, a congressman kidnapped by the FARC nearly two years
earlier died with three rebels when their boat capsized in the
Caguan. The rebels had vowed not to release him before authorities
finished a highway project from which the rebels alleged he had
been embezzling.

Report: Japan's Daiwa Bank to withdraw from overseas banking
</HEADLINE>
business &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Daiwa Bank Ltd. has decided to close most
international operations and focus on its domestic business as part
of a restructuring plan, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The reported move by Daiwa, which was barred from operating in
the United States two years ago after suffering a dlrs 1.1 billion
loss, is the latest example of a retreat from foreign markets by
Japanese financial institutions.
	   The bank has decided to give up licenses allowing it to engage
in overseas banking and shrink or close all of its 35 branch
offices located outside of Japan by early 2001, the Yomiuri
newspaper said.
	   It will concentrate on strengthening its domestic retail and
asset management businesses to cope with increased competition
triggered by Japan's moves to deregulate the financial industry,
the country's largest mass circulation daily reported.
	   Earlier this week, Japan's Nikko Securities Co. announced plans
to close offices in Malaysia and Thailand. Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
withdrew from retail banking in the United States in March by
selling its American subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank of California.

Defying crackdown, dissident Chinese renew efforts to form party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying a police crackdown, democracy campaigners
in two Chinese provinces have renewed efforts to set up an
opposition party to challenge Communist Party rule, groups reported
Saturday.
	   Emboldened by the government's signing of two key U.N. rights
treaties, dissidents have sought to test the country's 49-year ban
on opposition politics.
	   The pro-democracy activists have been trying to register the
China Democracy Party in at least nine provinces and major cities
since July. But police have detained at least 20 of them _ mostly
for short periods of time _ and all applications have been turned
down.
	   Two dissidents in southern Guizhou province and at least five in
central Henan province sent applications for party branches this
week to civil affairs authorities, a U.S.-based opposition party
and a dissident monitoring group in Hong Kong said Saturday.
	   Hours after Wang Bing telephoned Henan officials to notify them
of the application on Friday, police in Anyang city told the
dissident he must appear for questioning on Monday, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Police also took away another veteran campaigner, Leng Wanbao,
from his home in northeastern Changchun city Friday night and his
whereabouts were unknown as of Saturday morning, the Information
Center said.
	   ``Democratization has already become an unstoppable world trend,
and forming political parties and groups is a basic,
heaven-bestowed human right that cannot be taken away,'' the
Information Center quoted the Guizhou dissidents as saying in their
application.
	   The Henan dissidents noted that ``the twins of dictatorship and
corruption seriously threaten China's social equality'' and only
democratic, constitutional government could stop them, the Chinese
Democracy and Justice Party reported.
	   Both applications stressed that because freedom of assembly was
already enshrined in China's constitution party backers were doing
nothing illegal.
	   Guizhou dissidents Zeng Ning and Wei Dengzhong pointed out that
the government pledged to respect basic rights by signing the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights earlier this
month.
	   China has yet to ratify the treaty or another key rights pact it
signed a year ago. At an unprecedented government-backed
international human rights conference in Beijing last week, the
spokesman for the State Council, or Cabinet, said China would hew
to its own interpretation of rights.
	   In their roundup of would-be China Democracy Party members,
police have indicated that the group has been branded subversive by
Chinese leaders.
	   Another dissident, Chen Zengxiang, was sentenced recently in a
closed trial to seven years in prison. His family has not been told
why, but the U.S.-based Chinese Democracy and Justice Party claims
that Chen was a member of its underground network inside China.

Death toll rises from flooding in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The death toll from flooding in central
Vietnam has risen to 28, with damage estimated at 100 billion dong
(dlrs 7 million) in one of the country's poorest regions, officials
said Saturday.
	   Downpours of 300 to 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rain
earlier this week have raised water levels in most rivers in the
region and submerged large tracts of land.
	   The Binh Dinh provincial flood and storm control committee said
eight people had died there, while Quang Ngai reported seven
deaths. Six people were killed in Khanh Hoa province, four in Ninh
Thuan and three in Phu Yen.
	   The floods have destroyed many homes and schools and damaged
irrigation projects and roads, officials said.
	   Central Vietnam was hit hard earlier this year by the country's
worst drought in at least half a century.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ About 100 protesters called for former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to be tried for crimes against
humanity at a noisy rally outside the Spanish Consulate in
Australia's capital on Saturday.
	   Protest organizer Vlaudin Vega said the majority of the
protesters were political or economic refugees who had suffered
under Pinochet's 17-year rule.
	   The crowd waved placards congratulating Spain on its moves to
arrest the 82-year-old former authoritarian leader, who is in a
London clinic.
	   Vega said about 20,000 Chilean-born people live in Australia and
most were happy with the news of Pinochet's detention.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward southern
China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction on the
Philippines' main island where at least 124 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared three provinces
and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon
island under a state of calamity. He was expected to add more
provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage was
determined.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   By early Saturday Babs had moved out over the South China Sea,
280 kilometers (175 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (95 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   Meteorological officials expect the typhoon to reintensify over
water as it nears Hong Kong by early Sunday.
	   Of the 124 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   No houses were left standing along many streets in Virac, the
island's capital. Dozens of people lined up to use the only
telephone still working on the island.
	   Thirty others died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast. Nine other people were
injured elsewhere in Bicol.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   A six-kilometer (four-mile) section of the only road linking the
region to Manila remained unpassable.
	   The fatalities included 16 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   Eight other people were reported missing.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Doctors in the central Vietnamese province
of Quang Binh have removed two kidneys from a 15-year-old girl who
was born with four of the organs, a hospital official said
Saturday.
	   Dr. Tran Trong Tam, director of Vietnam-Cuba Hospital, said
doctors found that Nguyen Thi Van had an extra pair of kidneys
after she was hospitalized two weeks ago for a urinary problem.
	   Van underwent surgery on Oct. 15 and was discharged a week
later, Tam said.
	   Tam was told by Van's family that she had a urinary problem
since birth, but that they had been too poor to seek hospital
treatment for her.

Strong earthquake jolts remote area in eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.1 rocked a remote island in eastern Indonesia, the
country's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said Saturday.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the
tremor that struck the island of Ternate in northern Maluku, at
6:18 pm (1118 GMT) Friday, said a statement from the agency's
Jakarta office.
	   It added that the quake's epicenter was located in the Maluku
Sea, 61 miles (98 kilometers) northwest of Ternate, which lies
about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in

Malaysian dissident leader's lawyers allege rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for jailed Malaysian
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim, the Southeast Asian country's
former deputy prime minister, told a judge Saturday that their
client's constitutional rights have been repeatedly violated.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad removed Anwar from his posts as
deputy premier and finance chief on Sept. 2 and then had him
arrested 18 days later after Anwar launched a campaign calling for
Mahathir's ouster.
	   Anwar was taken into custody under Malaysia's Internal Security
Act, which allows police to detain suspects indefinitely without
trial if they are deemed a threat to national security. But police
released him from the harsh security provision earlier this month
and shifted him to a regular prison.
	   Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts, and will stand trial on Nov. 2.
	   He has been denied bail and his lawyers have said they are
furious that the court has yet to set a date for an appeal to the
ruling.
	   On Saturday, Anwar's lawyers argued that the authorities
violated his constitutional rights by unjustly detaining him and
then by not filing proper court documents informing them of his
release.
	   ``Legally speaking, Anwar's still incarcerated'' under the
draconian security provision, said one of his lawyers, Sankaran
Nair.
	   The High Court judge, Wahab Patail, adjourned the habeas corpus
appeal until next Wednesday. At that time the prosecution will have
to produce affidavits needed to formally legalize Anwar's release
from the ISA.
	   Meanwhile, Munawar Aness, a potential witness in Anwar's trial,
accused police of stripping him naked and reducing him to a
``shivering shell of a man'' before producing him in court to
testify against Anwar, lawyers said Saturday.
	   Munawar, 51, a former speech writer, and Anwar's adopted brother
Sukma Dermawan, 37, were sentenced to six months in jail last month
after pleading guilty to allowing themselves to be sodomized by
Anwar.
	   The two have since retracted their guilty pleas and are
appealing the convictions on the grounds that their pleas were
coerced.

Azerbaijani president's choice for prime minister approved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's recently re-elected
President Geidar Aliev has chosen the same prime minister to lead
his new government, a longtime ally from the Soviet era.
	   Parliament approved Artur Rasizade's appointment on Friday.
Aliev, who won re-election Oct. 11 in this oil-rich nation on the
Caspian Sea, first named Rasizade prime minister in 1996.
	   Rasizade, 62, is an oil engineer by training. He held various
Communist Party and government jobs in Soviet times, including
deputy premier of Azerbaijan.
	   Aliev, Azerbaijan's former KGB chief and later Communist Party
boss, has ruled his country with an iron hand. The election was
boycotted by the opposition and called undemocratic by foreign
observers.

South Korean naval squadron visits Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two South Korean naval ships arrived in Russia's
Far Eastern port of Vladivostok on Saturday for a three-day visit,
a Russian news agency reported.
	   The frigate Seoul and destroyer Taeyung will be open for tours
by local residents. The South Korean delegation is expected to
visit a Russian S-56 submarine and meet regional officials, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Soviet Union was a long-time ally of South Korea's rival,
communist North Korea, but Russia and South Korea have strengthened
economic and diplomatic ties since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

IOC, SOCOG meet government over tax plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympics organizers said they
were satisfied following talks with the federal government Saturday
on a tax issue which the International Olympic Committee warned
could prove ``a big problem.''
	   IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge, and members of the
Sydney Organizing Committee (SOCOG) met with Australia's new Sports
Minister Jackie Kelly.
	   Although Kelly said the Olympics would not gain a total
exemption from a proposed goods and services tax (GST), she said
SOCOG and IOC had been encouraged by Saturday's meeting.
	   Kelly said SOCOG president Michael Knight's warning of a
potential Aust dlrs 200 million (U.S. dlrs 126 million) budget
blowout under a GST were ``exaggerated.''
	   SOCOG vice-president and Australian Olympic Committee boss John
Coates emerged from the meeting believing the organizers would
receive a blanket exemption.
	   ``I don't want to be overconfident, but I've always thought that
the matter would be resolved, just as always it's not appeared
logical to me that if you're exempt from a tax which is being
replaced by a new tax, then you should be exempt from the new
tax,'' Coates said.
	   ``I think it will be worked out, but I can understand too that
the government has to be careful about the number of exemptions it
gives.''
	   SOCOG had won the bid with the understanding it was exempt from
income and sales taxes. The federal government was reelected
earlier this month on a tax reform platform including a 10 percent
GST.
	   Rogge described the discussions as positive, adding he was
satisfied the federal government had acknowledged the IOC and SOCOG
concerns.
	   ``We are concerned that if a GST was imposed on SOCOG, it would
be a substantial blowout of the budget and there is also a
complication for SOCOG in terms of bureaucracy and administration
involved so we would prefer, obviously, for SOCOG to be exempt in
one or another way from the GST,'' Rogge said.
	   But Rogge said the IOC was ``confident that the problems will be
solved. We are very optimistic about that.''

Asian stock market volatility seen as likely to continue next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The recent volatility in Asian stocks could
continue next week, with bourses caught in a possible tug-of-war
between gloom over the weakness of regional economies and optimism
that a sustained wave of foreign funds will flow into local
markets.
	   Economists and analysts have mixed opinions about the short-term
direction of markets in the region _ one indication that Asian
stocks could be in for another roller coaster ride in the coming
days.
	   Pacific rim markets ended trading this week with a mixed
performance.
	   An strong rally in Tokyo, including a 1,015-point rise in the
benchmark Nikkei-225 during the week's first four sessions, lost
momentum as investors sold off shares to lock-in profits. But the
index still managed a 6.5 percent jump for the week, closing at
14,144.7 on Friday.
	   Most other Asian stock markets chalked up less impressive gains,
however.
	   Daily fluctuations up and down yielded only small advances or
mild retreats by week's end. Main indexes in Hong Kong, Manila,
Bangkok, Sydney, Taipei and Kuala Lumpur all posted incremental
gains, while Singapore, Seoul and Jakarta declined slightly.
	   Friday's 1.6 percent recovery in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
``suggests that there continues to be interest in the region,
whereas we thought people were becoming skeptical,'' said Eugene
Galbraith, group strategist at securities house ABN-Amro Asia in
Hong Kong.
	   Galbraith noted that ``broad based'' buying from American and
European investors since Asia's rebound started two week ago might
continue this week because foreign funds may not want to miss out
on further gains in these markets.
	   But he warned of the danger that Brazil's economic malaise holds
for other Latin American countries _ and the mood of equity
investors in Asia who could easily get spooked by a sudden
deterioration in South American markets.
	   Signs of an emerging recovery in Japan's long sluggish economy,
a critical factor for the entire region, and more progress toward
reforming the ailing Japanese banking industry could help prop up
regional currencies and stock markets, said Desmond Supple,
director of emerging markets economic research at Barclays Capital
Asia in Singapore.
	   ``We are looking for a continuation of the positive trend over
the next few sessions in Asian markets,'' he said, adding that the
rally Tokyo enjoyed this week was proof of more positive sentiment
in the region.
	   But not everyone is so sanguine.
	   Seema Desai, chief Asian economist at Schroders Asia in Hong
Kong, predicts regional markets will be ``flat to down'' next week.
``I don't think we're going to see the strong rallies we saw in
previous weeks,'' she warned.
	   No single event will dominate the direction of trade in the
coming sessions, she said, but ``the old concerns will reassert
themselves.''
	   ``We're getting back to concerns about the fundamentals with
these economies, along with renewed fears of the U.S. economy
slowing down, which could cut into Asian exports,'' she argued.
	   ``We've got a long way to go before actual recovery and
sustained rebounds in markets here,'' Desai said.

Singapore military denies intrusions into Malaysian airspace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore denied Saturday that its air force
had intruded into Malaysian airspace following allegations by its
northern neighbor that six such incidents have occurred recently.
	   ``Investigations found the claims to be without basis,''
according to a statement issued by Singapore's defense ministry.
	   The ministry said it ``is puzzled by these latest allegations of
intrusion and wishes to reiterate that there is no reason
whatsoever for the Republic of Singapore Air Force to intrude into
Malaysian airspace.''
	   Ties between the two Southeast Asian countries have deteriorated
in recent months. Malaysia revoked a longstanding agreement last
month which had allowed Singapore military planes to enter its
airspace without specific prior approval for transit or search and
rescue operations.
	   Singapore had pledged to abide by the decision, but almost
immediately after severing the agreement Malaysia began accusing
Singapore of airspace violations.
	   After repeatedly denying these allegations and requesting
details of the intrusions, Singapore received a note from Malaysia
a week ago outlining the six suspected incidents.
	   According to Singapore's defense ministry, three of the alleged
intrusions took place when no Singapore air force planes were
airborne, and two of the incidents involved other aircraft
altogether.
	   In the final case Singapore said that its air force planes ``did
not overfly or circle over the Malaysian Navy Recruit Training
Center as alleged.''
	   The ministry statement also questioned Malaysia's refusal to
take up an offer from Singapore to engage in talks to resolve the
matter.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ About 100 protesters called for former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to be tried for crimes against
humanity at a noisy rally outside the Spanish Consulate in Sydney
on Saturday.
	   Protest organizer Vlaudin Vega said the majority of the
protesters were political or economic refugees who had suffered
under Pinochet's 17-year rule.
	   The crowd waved placards congratulating Spain on its moves to
arrest the 82-year-old former authoritarian leader, who is in a
London clinic.
	   Vega said about 20,000 Chilean-born people live in Australia and
most were happy with the news of Pinochet's detention.

Northeastern Thai man top dog in barking contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Some people might consider him howling
mad, but Manop Tummuangkhon has won the respect of many of his
neighbors after being crowned top dog in a northern Thailand
barking contest, a newspaper reported.
	   Manop, 35, fended off 34 rivals to win the canine copycat
contest by barking and whining for judges in the Sida sub-district
of Nakhon Ratchasima province, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
	   The man was the unanimous choice of the judges of the event,
which was held to publicize an anti-rabies campaign, the Post said.
	   His ability to mimic man's best friend in a variety of moods,
including belligerence and amorousness, was honed by 15 days of
intense observation of neighborhood dogs, the paper said.

Next spacewalk for Mir cosmonauts set for next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The two cosmonauts on the Mir space station will
take a five-hour spacewalk Nov. 11 to install a meteorite monitor
and other equipment, space officials said Saturday.
	   A Progress cargo ship is heading to Mir on Sunday to deliver the
equipment, food, water, New Year's gifts and an experimental space
mirror designed to illuminate sun-starved northern cities.
	   The French-made meteorite monitor will study a cloud of
micro-meteorites that Mir is expected to enter in mid-November,
officials at mission control outside Moscow said. Cosmonauts
Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev must install it before then
because once Mir is in the cloud a spacewalk would be too
dangerous.
	   The two carried out a brief ``internal'' spacewalk inside the
airless Spektr module in September to boost the power supply.
	   The cargo ship _ the last to go up this year _ was scheduled to
go up earlier this month but the launch was postponed for lack of
funds.

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward
southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction
on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared three provinces
and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon
island under a state of calamity. He was expected to add more
provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage was
determined.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   By early Saturday Babs had moved out over the South China Sea,
280 kilometers (175 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (95 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   Meteorological officials expect the typhoon to reintensify over
water as it nears Hong Kong by early Sunday.
	   Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut and
hemp-producing village along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   The powerful winds flattened the hemp and tore away the leaves
of the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas with
blown-away tops. Virtually every house was damaged.
	   The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.
	   ``Entire families were killed,'' said Eddie Tapel, a local
official. ``Many children will have to quit school because their
families have no more income.''
	   Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

Report: Two policemen detained on killing of trader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two police sergeants were arrested
Saturday on charges of fatally shooting a vendor in the capital, an
Indonesian newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The vendor, Ramli Frans Tamba, was killed during a routine
crackdown Thursday on pornographic materials in Central Jakarta's
region of Senen, the Jakarta Post said.
	   It quoted police chief Lt. Col. Iman Heryatna as saying that one
of the officers shot the victim when he tried to attack with a
dagger after being caught selling a pornographic compact disk to a
minor.
	   Relatives of the victim and eyewitnesses say the 47-year-old
vendor had no dagger and cooperated with the police, the report
said. Police also reportedly did not fire a warning shot.

Piazza, Mets agree on dlrs 91 million, seven-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Piazza and the New York Mets have reached
agreement on a dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract, The Associated
Press learned early Saturday.
	   The deal, the richest in the sport's history, is expected to be
announced by the Mets on Monday, according to people in baseball.
	   Piazza and the team met Wednesday in Los Angeles. The All-Star
catcher was eligible to file for free agency starting Thursday, but
did not.
	   Piazza, 30, hit .329 with 32 home runs and 111 RBIs for the
Mets, Los Angeles and Florida this season. He carried the Mets in
the final month of the season in their bid for the NL wild-card
spot.
	   The contract would be a record for total dollars and average per
season, topping the dlrs 75 million, six-year contract that Boston
pitcher Pedro Martinez started this season.
	   The Mets flagship station, WFAN radio, also reported that Piazza
had agreed to a deal. Early Saturday, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz
denied reports that a deal with Piazza had been completed.
	   Horwitz said Mets general manager Steve Phillips intended to
talk with Piazza's agents over the weekend.
	   Piazza finished a dlrs 15 million, two-year contract this
season. He was traded from Los Angeles to Florida in May after the
Dodgers failed to reach agreement with him on a multiyear deal, and
the Marlins traded him to the Mets a week later.
	   Piazza's deal appears to signal the Mets will attempt to trade
Todd Hundley, due to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next season and dlrs
6 million in 2000 as part of a dlrs 21 million, four-year contract
he agreed to in January 1997.
	   Hundley underwent reconstructive elbow surgery in September 1997
and struggled when he came back this July, hitting just .161 with
three homers, 12 RBIs and 55 strikeouts in 124 at-bats. He
struggled when the Mets tried him in the outfield and may not have
much trade value until he proves again that he's an everyday player
as a catcher.
	   New York also is negotiating with pitcher Al Leiter, who wants
to stay in New York. The sides were said to be close to a four-year
deal worth about dlrs 8 million a year, but the deal was not
expected to be finalized this weekend.

Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki remains sole leader after third round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIBA, Japan (AP) _ Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki shot a 5-under-par 67 to
keep his two-stroke lead after Saturday's third round of the
Bridgestone Open, edging a step closer to his first Japan PGA tour
title in five years.
	   Ozaki, 44, carded six birdies against one bogey for a three-day
total of 13-under 203 on the 7,151-yard, par-72 Sodegaura Country
Club Sodegaura course in drizzling rain.
	   ``My shots were much better than I had expected,'' Ozaki said.
``I think I'm in my best condition.''
	   Nobuhito Sato dropped seven birdies against two bogeys for a 67
for a second place at 205.
	   Australian Steve Conran came in third after shooting a 69 for
8-under 208, followed by Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, who had
a 67 for 209.
	   Seeking his fourth victory this season, American Brandt Jobe
shot a 72 to share fifth place with two Japanese players _ Shigeki
Maruyama and Taichi Teshima _ at 6-under 210. Maruyama shot a 72
and Teshima 71.
	   Jobe stands second on the Japan PGA money earning list with
81.77 million yen (dlrs 693,000).
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, defending champion and current JPGA
earnings leader, shot a 68 to share eighth place with six other
players at 5-under 211.
	   The winner will receive 21.6 million yen (dlrs 183,000) from a
purse of 20 million yen (dlrs 1 million).

Skipper Sohail leads Pakistan's fight back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail brought
Pakistan back into the match with a gritty century against
Australia on the third day of the third and final cricket Test
Saturday.
	   At lunch, the home team, needing a victory to square the
three-match series, was just 41 runs behind Australia's first
innings of 280. Sohail was 133 not out and Shakeel Ahmed not out 1
in Pakistan's 239 for seven.
	   Resuming at the overnight score of 170 for six, Sohail and Wasim
Akram extended their seventh wicket partnership to 98 in 125
minutes -- the highest of the match so far.
	   Akram was dropped by Collin Miller at mid-off off Gavin
Robertson when on 20, with the total at 183 for six.
	   The visitors' lone success in the first session came when Akram
offered no stroke to leg-spinner Stuart MacGill's delivery and was
out plumb leg before after scoring 35 with the help of six
boundaries.
	   Sohail brought up his fifth Test hundred and second against
Australia off 194 balls in 263 minutes. His innings was studded
with 14 fours and a six.
	   The 32-year-old Pakistan captain pulled, drove and cut with
immaculate ease as the visitors struggled to wrap up Pakistan's
innings quickly.
	   Australia took the second new ball but Sohail had little trouble
in facing the Aussie pacemen. Sohail has so far hit 18 fours and a
six and spent 344 minutes at the wicket.

Commonwealth champion caught cheating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Commonwealth Games road
cycling gold medalist Jay Sweet was caught cheating and ejected
from his country's most famous race Saturday.
	   Sweet was disqualified from the Commonwealth Bank Classic after
he was seen holding onto a car and getting a tow for several
kilometers (miles).
	   The 23-year-old, who won the first gold of last month's
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, won the ninth stage of his career
in the race when he claimed stage 10 on Thursday.
	   He was spotted by police during stage 13 Saturday and they
reported the offence to race officials. Also disqualified for the
same offence was fellow Australian rider Shaun O'Neill.

Hong Kong tycoon calls on government to resume land sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Encouraged by signs of recovery in the Hong
Kong property market, two wealthy businessmen have called on the
government to resume land sales early next year, Hong Kong
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Li Ka-shing, chairman of major property developer Cheung Kong
Holdings, said property prices were bottoming out following a
recent interest rate cut and strong rallies in the stock market,
the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.
	   Li added property developers have since raised sales prices on
new flats, the report added.
	   Gambling and property magnate Stanley Ho, based in Macau, said
the property market would improve considerably by next year and
that the government should resume land sales, the paper said.
	   The Hong Kong government early this summer suspended its land
sales until next March in an effort to stabilize falling property
prices.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said in his policy speech early
October that the government will decide whether to resume land
sales next March.
	   Hong Kong's property market went into a free fall following
Asia's economic crisis. Interest rates rose, and thousands of
people were stuck with higher mortgage payments on properties that
had halved in value.
	   Property prices are exorbitant in small, mountainous Hong Kong,
where buildable land is extremely scarce. The sharp decline
frightened the territory, where the property market accounts for
one in 10 jobs and roughly a third of the economy.
	   Lately, the market has shown signs of stability, with some
developers inching prices higher. Meanwhile, big banks cut interest
rates slightly this week, luring buyers back into the market.

Reports: Police chief steps up security amid reported gang threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A police chief of a southern Chinese city where
a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security
following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Gang members loyal to ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung have put
a 4 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 512,000 million) price tag
for the death of Guangzhou police chief Zheng Guoqiang, the Hong
Kong Standard said.
	   The assassination threat was said to have been made in a letter
sent to Zheng, the Standard said, without identifying its source.
	   Cheung has been charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and
murder. The trial, which also includes 35 other defendants, in
Guangzhou 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the border, is closed
to journalists.
	   Zheng has been personally leading a fleet of vehicles escorting
the defendants from jail to the central Guangzhou city courthouse
and back.
	   Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese
businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling
explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong
businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of kidnapping a
merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom
(U.S. dlrs 48,300).
	   Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for security, said on Saturday
the government was unable to seek the extradition of Cheung _ a
Hong Kong citizen _ for trial in the absence of any hard evidence,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Speaking after an anti-crime symposium, she said there had been
no hard proof of crimes committed in the territory despite reports
that two of Hong Kong's wealthiest businessmen had been kidnapped.
	   Security has been tight since Cheung's trial began Monday. The
courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of
concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to
assassinate the defendants to silence them.
	   News broadcasts Saturday showed the defendants being led out
from several vehicles _ including armored personnel carriers _
their legs chained, escorted by soldiers in bulletproof vests
carrying machine guns and pistols.
	   The news blackout has fueled various reports in Hong Kong's
flamboyant media, riveted by one of the most dramatic gang trials
in Hong Kong history.
	   On Friday, The South China Morning Post quoted an unidentified
prison source as saying that Cheung and other defendants were
afraid Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them. They were
only eating food brought in for security officials, the newspaper
said.
	   Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily reported that two bomb threats
have been delivered since the trial began.
	   Cheung reportedly has said that he masterminded the kidnapping
of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   Ming Pao quoted Cheung as saying. ``There would have been no way
that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the
gang's kidnapping spree, had he not been arrested.

Economic slowdown sends more people to farms, streets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's economic slowdown has sent
thousands of unemployed people back to farms, schools and the
streets as hawkers, keeping the jobless rate down, the government
reported Saturday.
	   The unemployment rate was 2.98 percent in September, a 0.07
percent decline from August, according to the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.
	   Taiwan recorded a jobless rate of 2.62 percent in the first nine
months this year, the second lowest in Asia after Singapore, it
said.
	   The agency said 37,000 people left the cities to work on farms
in the past four months, boosting the share of farm employment
among overall employment to 8.94 percent and reversing an exodus to
the cities for the first time in two decades.
	   Another 30,000 people chose to go back to school, and 45,000
newly unemployed chose to work as street vendors or taxi drivers,
it said.
	   Thousands of unemployed women have decided to remain at home,
the agency added.
	   Many of the 285,000 people who lost their jobs in September were
middle-aged factory or office workers.
	   As they may have the most difficulty finding jobs, the
government has set up a fund to provide loans to help them start
their own businesses, officials said.
	   With its rich foreign reserves, Taiwan has endured the Asian
financial turmoil largely unscathed, but it has suffered from
plunging exports in recent months.

Prime Minister Vajpayee announces infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Saturday announced major highway and airport projects, which he
said would boost low confidence in India's economy.
	   India was opening up the insurance business to its private
sector and considering a proposal to permit minority foreign equity
in the sector, Vajpayee told captains of the Indian industry in New
Delhi.
	   ``These are difficult times for Indian and global business.
Globalization has brought in unprecedented turbulence but trapped
in that turbulence is also the hope of nectar,'' said Vajpayee,
reaffirming his Hindu nationalist party-led government's commitment
to economic reforms.
	   Vajpayee inaugurated the 71st annual meeting of the Federation
of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, or FICCI, a grouping
of Indian industrialists.
	   K.K. Modi, president of the FICCI, told Vajpayee that business
was passing through a very difficult time in India and that
investors have suffered heavy losses due to sharp decline in market
capitalization.
	   ``Many of our large basic industries, such as Iron and steel,
cement, paper, chemicals textiles and capital goods are
experiencing unprecedented slow down in demand and terrible squeeze
on margins,'' Modi said in his speech.
	   But the government claims that the economy is expected to grow
by 6.3 percent this fiscal year ending March 31, up from 5.1
percent last year. But the fiscal deficit forecast is 6.1 percent
of gross domestic, against a target of 5.6 percent.
	   Vajpayee lifted the gloom somewhat among nearly 300
industrialists present by announcing that the government would
allow companies to buy back shares to enhance the value to
investors. That had been a long pending demand of the Indian
industry.
	   The government, the prime minister said, will soon start a
7,000-kilometer road project envisaging two six-lane north-south
and east-west corridors costing rupees 280 billion (dlrs 6.5
billion).
	   ``The project will have the scope for maximum private sector and
foreign participation,'' he said.
	   Vajpayee also said the government will identify five Indian
cities for the construction of international airports with a
maximum 100 percent foreign equity.
	   The prime minister called for a radical change in the approach
and functioning of the global commercial banks and rating agencies.
``The World bank and the International Monetary Fund were set up in
the pre-globalization era and at a time when most countries in the
world were either not free of had just won their independence.''

Russia, China criticize NATO expansion, plan closer military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and China are fiercely opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion and proposed airstrikes on Yugoslavia, and plan
to increase military cooperation with each other, Russia's defense
minister said Saturday.
	   Igor Sergeyev also reiterated Russian and Chinese warnings
against a U.S.-Japanese plan to develop an anti-missile defense
system, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``This is a factor which can impair the balance of forces, and
slow down the process of reduction of strategic arms,'' he said in
Beijing.
	   Sergeyev called his talks this week with Chinese officials on
NATO and the Balkans ``very important,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   The U.N. Security Council is considering a resolution that would
allow NATO to enforce a peace accord for the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, but Russia and China remain staunchly opposed. Russia has
religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and China traditionally
objects to military intervention into what it considers an internal
matter.
	   Sergeyev said the two countries planned to expand military
cooperation, ITAR-Tass said. The report did not elaborate.
	   Sergeyev cited his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian as saying
that President Jiang Zemin would visit Russia in late November.
Chinese officials have not announced a date for the trip, but have
said it would be before year's end.
	   Sergeyev also said during his visit that Russia is continuing to
reduce its troops along the Chinese border.
	   After decades of friction, relations between Moscow and Beijing
have improved dramatically in recent years as China has become a
major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's
struggling defense industry. Russia views the new relationship with
China as a counterbalance to what it sees as U.S. pre-eminence in
world affairs.

Russians seize 18 tons of poached fish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards have seized 18 tons of fish
caught illegally in the Caspian and Azov seas this year, a news
report said Saturday.
	   Guards patrolling the Russian waters of the two seas, divided by
the Caucasus Mountains, have also confiscated 43 kilometers (25
miles) of fishing nets and 86 fishing boats, the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted the border guard press service as saying.
	   Poaching is widespread in the Caspian, which is home to most of
the world's sturgeon, prompting Russia to say it would restrict
caviar exports.
	   The Caspian also laps the shores of Iran and the former Soviet
republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan. The Azov is
bordered by Russia and Ukraine.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen supports co-presidency proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen has thrown his
support behind a proposal for the ruling party to share the
presidency of parliament with the opposition, an aide said
Saturday.
	   Both Hun Sen's Cambodia People's Party and the main opposition
party, FUNCINPEC, have staked claims to the top post in parliament,
a dispute that has been a major stumbling block in stalled
negotiations to form a new government following July elections.
	   A behind-the-scenes proposal for the two parties to share the
position with co-presidents has been whispered about since formal
negotiations broke down earlier this month, but Hun Sen is the
first party leader to openly support the idea.
	   Hun Sen spoke of the potential deal in a Saturday meeting with
Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura, Hun
Sen aide Prak Sokhonn told reporters at the Cambodian leader's
heavily fortified residence 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Phnom
Penh.
	   ``There has been a proposal that there should be co-presidents
in the parliament. The prime minister is pleased and agrees with
it,'' Prak Sokhonn said. ``He is now waiting for an answer from
FUNCINPEC.''
	   Prak Sokhonn said the proposal is the second attempt to find an
acceptable post for FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who
was ousted from his position as co-premier last year in a violent
coup d'etat led by Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh fled Cambodia and did not return until a few months
before this year's election, which Hun Sen's party narrowly won.
	   However, the ruling party needs FUNCINPEC's cooperation to gain
the necessary two-thirds vote in parliament to approve the next
government.
	   FUNCINPEC Secretary General Tol Lah said Saturday that there has
been no change in the party's negotiating position and was
reluctant to comment on Hun Sen's support of parliamentary
co-presidents.
	   ``We maintain our old position,'' Tol Lah said. ``I have to wait
until I discuss this with my boss.''
	   Hun Sen's party previously stated that it should hold the
presidency as the majority party in parliament, but FUNCINPEC
argues that it gave up the position to the CPP as part of a
comprehensive power-sharing agreement after it won the 1993
election. The favor, FUNCINPEC says, should be returned.
	   Negotiations between the ruling party and the two-party
opposition have yielded no progress since the Sept. 24 ceremonial
convening of parliament.
	   Claiming that threats of arrest from Hun Sen made negotiations
inside Cambodia impossible, Ranariddh and junior opposition party
leader Sam Rainsy led a slow exodus of opposition lawmakers to
Bangkok after parliament opened.
	   Guaranteeing their safety in a Friday statement, the ruling
party appealed for the opposition to return and resume talks on
Cambodian soil.
	   Prak Sokhonn also said Saturday that King Norodom Sihanouk, who
is expected to leave the country next month for medical treatment
in Beijing, has given a written assurance that the outgoing
government can remain in power until there is a resolution of the
post-election political crisis.

Thai prime minister calls on private sector to promote human
</HEADLINE>
rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Saturday
urged the business community to help combat corruption by adopting
a code of business ethics aimed at greater transparency and
accountability.
	   ``Indeed, we have to encourage business to recognize that its
responsibilities towards society go beyond activities motivated
primarily by profit,'' Chuan said in a speech at a symposium
marking United Nations Day.
	   Many people also abuse the political system for personal gain,
which often translated into human rights violations, patronage,
corruption and cronyism, he said.
	   An effective code of business ethics will eliminate corruption,
which undermines morality and hinders the economic and social
development of a country, Chuan told the audience at the symposium
on Human Rights and Business ethics, held at the U.N. building in
Bangkok.
	   The prime minister called on the private sector and grassroots
organizations to help promote state protection of human rights by
demanding accountability from the government.
	   He noted that Thailand is working on a plan to establish a
National Commission on Human Rights by the end of next year, as
required by the country's new constitution adopted last October.
	   An action plan for the commission is being created with input
from academics, grassroots organizations, the media and
representatives of minority groups, Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
told reporters outside the meeting.
	   A public hearing is expected to be conducted soon to obtain
wider input, he said.
	   The commission will be a constitutional body with an appeals
process, and will come into being after the supporting legislation
for the new constitution is passed, said Surin.
	   ``It's a very determined effort and it has lots of support,
particularly from the government,'' said Surin.
	   The United Nations had recommended that the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional grouping of which Thailand is a
member, address human rights violations, he said.
	   Former prime minister Anand Panyarachun, who also spoke at the
symposium, is heading a committee drafting the action plan for the
Thai human rights commission.
	   He said certain clauses from international agreements on human
rights _ some signed by Thailand, some not _ will be incorporated
in the action plan.
	   In his keynote speech, Anand said systematic persecution of
individuals with political views differing from the government
continues in some parts of Asia. He did not specify where.

Airport closes after plane leaves runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANNON, Ireland (AP) _ Authorities briefly shut Shannon Airport
Saturday after a British Airways Boeing 747 with 263 people on
board ran part way off the runway.
	   There were no injuries and no immediate indication that the
plane was damaged, said a spokesman for the airport in western
Ireland.
	   The plane was on its way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to
London's Heathrow Airport when it diverted to Shannon to take on
extra fuel as it was ahead of schedule, airport officials said.
	   While it was turning on the runway, the nose wheel left the
tarmac and became embedded in soft ground.
	   Aer Rianta, which runs the airport, used tractors to pull the
plane out of the soft ground and the airport was closed while the
plane was inspected for damage. A relief plane was sent to pick up
the passengers and other flights were diverted to Dublin.
	   The airport was later reopened.

Anwar's associate accuses police of brutality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A potential witness in the trial
of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim said he was coerced into
testifying against Anwar after police stripped him naked and
reduced him to a ``shivering shell of a man.''
	   Munawar Aness, 51, and Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Dermawan,
37, were sentenced to six months in jail last month after pleading
guilty to allowing themselves to be sodomized by the former deputy
prime minister.
	   Munawar's lawyer, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, said Saturday that his
client has since retracted his guilty plea and is appealing the
conviction. He said the police ``humiliated and brainwashed'' him
into submission.
	   As a potential witness in the government's explosive case
against the country's former No. 2 man, Munawar's 180-degree
turnaround could come as a big blow for authorities.
	   Munawar pleaded guilty Sept. 19, a day before police arrested
Anwar, who had earlier been sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad as his deputy and finance chief.
	   Anwar is to go on trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and
sodomy, including two involving Sukma and Munawar. He has
repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, saying the charges were
trumped up to defuse his growing challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.
	   Manjeet Singh said he filed two court orders Friday to set off
the appeals process for Munawar.
	   In the court documents, Munawar accused police of invading his
house Sept. 14 without a search warrant, then arresting him under
the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention
without trial.
	   The 51-year-old former speech writer for Anwar said police
handcuffed him, ransacked his house and confiscated his belongings,
including family photographs and mail.
	   ``They were exceptionally rude and asked me to strip naked''
before they forced him to fingerprint a sheaf of unidentified
documents, he said in the court statement.
	   During the six days before he was produced in court, he said
police harassed him and shaved him bald.
	   ``I was then given a dustpan and a small broom and asked to
sweep up my hair,'' Munawar said.
	   He said police blindfolded and handcuffed him whenever he was
moved from cell to cell. Munawar has ordered police and prison
officials to account for his whereabouts during those six days.
	   ``They degraded me and broke down my will,'' he said. ``They
brainwashed me to the extent that I ended up in court on Sept. 19 a
shivering shell of a man willing to do anything to stop the
destruction of my being.''
	   Munawar was admitted to hospital Sept. 23 after suffering a
heart attack. Even then, he said, police threatened him against
filing an appeal against his conviction.
	   The High Court hearing has been set for Nov. 4, two days after
the start of Anwar's trial.
	   Police officials could not be immediately reached for comment
Saturday.

Queen's husband to visit Irish Republic for the first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is
to visit the Irish Republic for the first time next month, his
office said Saturday.
	   Prince Philip, who is also the Duke of Edinburgh, will be in
Dublin on Nov. 10 to inaugurate a millennium project for the Irish
charity Gaisce, which like a British organization headed by the
duke, honors talented young people.
	   He will also meet Irish President Mary McAleese and Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern.
	   The duke's visit is seen as further evidence of closer relations
that have followed the signing earlier this year of the Good Friday
agreement that provided a power-sharing government for Northern
Ireland _ and is being seen as a prelude to a possible visit by the
queen.
	   This week, Ahern confirmed that British Prime Minister Tony
Blair would address a joint session of the two houses of Ireland's
Parliament, the Dail and the Senate, on Nov. 26.

Religious party's massive gathering includes mass wedding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Some 100,000 people are expected at a mass
wedding and gathering on Saturday outside a white marble mosque in
Islamabad, a ceremony arranged by the most influential party
pushing for Pakistan to be governed by laws based on the Koran.
	   ``More than 300 couples will be joined in marriage today,''
Liaquat Baluch, a leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, or Islamic Party, told
The Associated Press.
	   Jamaat, which boycotted elections in 1997, is a small, but
influential party, considered the bulwark of a movement to change
Pakistan from a country where courts rule with British law and
Islamic laws to one in which only Islamic laws based on the Koran
are used.
	   The wedding comes on the second day of a three-day meeting by
Jamaat to establish a ``true Islamic order'' and to oust what they
call a ``corrupt and barbarous ruler.''
	   Pakistan is currently ruled by a government led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, a government Jamaat says is corrupt and
mismanaging the economy.
	   ``We are in an economic mess not because of the sanctions, but
due to the wrong policies of these rulers,'' said Munawar Hasan,
Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general.
	   During the meeting participants will hold a conference to focus
on the country's battered economy.
	   But organizers say the real aim of the wedding and gathering
_which they expect some 100,000 people to attend _ is for Jamaat to
get support for its desire to change Pakistan.
	   ``This mass wedding is part of our efforts to promote simplicity
in the society and eradicate the menace of dowry,'' Baluch said.
``The marriages have been arranged earlier by the parents of young
couples. . . they are taking an opportunity of our gathering to tie
the wedding knots.''
	   In Islamic Pakistan most marriages are arranged by parents.
Often the bride and groom are first cousins or if the marriage
involves people outside the family, the bride and groom meet for
the first time on the day of the wedding or shortly before. The
cost of a dowry often ruins families or prevents poorer women from
marrying.
	   Sharif already has passed a controversial constitutional
amendment in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament,
which would allow the government to ``prescribe what is right and
forbid what is wrong'' according to its own interpretation of
Islam.
	   The amendment must be passed by the Senate to become law and
it's not certain Sharif will get the votes he needs.
	   Human rights activists, major opposition parties and members of
minority religious groups oppose the amendment, saying it will give
the radical Islamic element in Pakistan greater authority to impose
its rules on the majority.

Arafat arrives in Vienna; briefing European Union leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After signing the West Bank
land-for-peace deal, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in
the Austrian capital Saturday to brief European Union leaders on
the historic agreement.
	   Arafat met Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel at a
downtown hotel and travels later to the Alpine resort of
Poertschach to brief European Union leaders, gathered for an
informal summit.
	   Arafat and Schuessel are expected to arrive in Poertschach in
the middle of the afternoon.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. EU members
have supported the Palestinians during many of their disputes with
the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
including Israel's decision to build Jewish housing in areas of
Jerusalem which the Palestinians want as a future capital.
	   The United States vetoed two of European-backed resolutions in
the U.N. Security Council which would have called on Israel to
abandon the housing project.

Korean-American college president released from North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean-American college president
returned to Beijing on Saturday after being held for more than a
month in North Korea for political reasons, South Korean media
reports said.
	   James Jin-kyong Kim, 63, president of Yanbian Engineering
College in China's northern Yanbian province, avoided journalists
at the Beijing airport, Seoul's MBC-TV reported.
	   Kim entered North Korea in early September, along with a
Christian pastor from Seoul, for a 10-day stay. The pastor was
allowed to leave at the end of the trip but Kim was not.
	   South Korean intelligence officials said Kim was held for
political reasons.
	   Kim reportedly was held in North Korea for questioning about
whether he and his business partners had given bribes to North
Korean officials who were purged on corruption or spy charges.
	   Kim, a South Korean-born U.S. citizen, has been active in recent
years in promoting humanitarian and educational exchanges with
North Korea. He set up Yanbian Engineering College in the late
1980s with South Korean donations.
	   Kim traveled to North Korea to discuss building a dental
hospital in Pyongyang, the capital, and an engineering college in
North Korea's free trade zone in Rajin-Sonbong.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrillas in southeast Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla infiltration trails in occupied southeastern Lebanon
Saturday, security officials said.
	   The jets fired at least two air-to-surface missiles at a valley
near the village of Qillaya, said the Lebanese officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 10:20 p.m.
(0620GMT) attack on the area, about 20 kilometers (13 miles)
southwest of Rashaya in the southern Bekaa Valley and about the
same distance from the Israeli border.
	   Rashaya is about seven kilometers (four miles) north of the
border enclave Israel has occupied in the south since 1985.
	   Israeli jets often strike at guerrilla bases and infiltration
trails in south and southeast Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
border zone.

Cambodian king calls on government, wealthy to help feed hungry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk,
faced with hundreds of poverty-stricken farmers camped outside his
palace, called on the government and the nation's wealthy Saturday
to provide food to the hungry.
	   Faced with failing crops after the late arrival of seasonal
rains, about 200 farmers have gathered at the gates of the Royal
Palace in hopes the monarch will help.
	   Their plight has attracted media attention, and Sihanouk wrote
in the margins of a local newspaper article that he will distribute
rice to the farmers, but that he alone cannot support the nation's
poor.
	   ``Every week I give humanitarian assistance to hundreds of
starving people, but it is not possible to feed all the starving
people of Cambodia as their numbers do not cease to grow each
day,'' the king wrote on a copy of the article faxed to news
agencies.
	   ``Our (government) and the rich, the powerful must do something
for the starving as well,'' he said.
	   The farmers, mostly from provinces north and east of the
capital, have said their villages are facing severe food shortages.
They have been forced to forage for bamboo shoots and manioc
tubers, which can be poisonous if prepared incorrectly.
	   The U.N. World Food Program says that several areas of the
country face food shortages every year, but that it is too early to
tell if the lack of rain has caused a genuine food crisis.
	   The WFP is currently supporting almost 1 million Cambodians in a
``food-for-work'' program, which exchanges rice for manual labor on
community development projects.
	   Many farmers migrate to Phnom Penh every year to look for extra
work after they finish transplanting their rice seedling. They
return to their fields before harvest time late in the year.
	   Employment in the capital has been scarce this year amid a
regional economic slowdown and a protracted Cambodian political
crisis.
	   Investment and foreign aid were stifled last year after
Cambodian strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier last year in a violent coup d'etat.
	   A July election was expected to restore legitimacy to the
government, but bickering political parties have failed to reach an
agreement on a new administration.

<TEXT>
	   SAIGOMURA, Japan (AP) _ South Korea's Han Hee-won shot a
bogey-free 68 Saturday to share a four-way lead after the second
round of the Hisako Higuchi Kibun Classic.
	   Han carded three birdies in the first nine and added another one
on the back nine for the day's best score on the 6,290-yard, par-72
Green Briar West Village course in southwestern Japan.
	   Also in the lead with the 36-hole total of 141 were Kim Man-soo
of South Korea, with 3-under 69, Chitose Furukawa, who shot a
1-under 71 and overnight leader Michiko Hattori, with 1-over 73.
	   One stroke behind in fifth place at 143 were South Korean Ku
Ok-hee, who sank three birdies against no bogeys, and Japanese Fuki
Kido, who matched a par.
	   Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen, who won her first career title in June
at the Dunlop Ladies Open, slipped to seventh with a 75, bringing
the two-round total to 144.
	   Of a total of 107 players teed off in cloudy weather, 52 made
the cut for Sunday's final round.
	   The winner will receive 12.6 million yen (dlrs 106,000) from a
purse of 70 million yen (dlrs 588,000).

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new faces on Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit devoted to
brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, gives the
line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and
only in Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   During last-minute agenda fixing, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was to brief the Europeans on a West Bank land-for-peace
accord during a stopover Saturday in Austria on his way back from
talks in the United States.
	   Officials said Arafat would meet in Vienna with the EU's Middle
East envoy, Miguel Martinos, and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, then fly to this alpine resort in southern Austria to
meet with the EU leaders at around 1300 GMT.
	   The EU is the biggest single aid donor to the Palestinians,
having spent some half a billion dollars on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since 1993.
	   The line-up at the top of the EU governments may have changed
with the emergence of Schroeder and D'Alema, some old problems must
still be resolved.
	   The leaders must debate ways of maintaining Europe's economic
recovery, tackle high unemployment and say how they plan to
implement painful agricultural, budget and decision-making reforms
needed if the EU is to take in half-a-dozen newcomers in the years
ahead.
	   The EU will launch a single currency in January _ after years of
debate and the leaders will be urged not to let the euro be the end
of the line.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the EU journey,'' Austrian
Chancellor and summit chairman Viktor Klima said before the summit.
	   Forecasts issued this week showed the financial turmoil sweeping
Asia, Russia and Latin America will drag EU growth down to 2.4
percent in 1999, from a previously predicted 3 percent.
	   That outlook and the emergence of more leftist leaders is
creating pressure for a more hands-on approach to boost growth
through more public investment or cutting interest rates.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies ... must be further
bolstered,'' French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said this week in
Paris. ``A decline in interest rates is essential to that end.''
	   Schroeder and other euro-Socialists have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted that.
They argue rates in key EU economies such as France and Germany are
already among the world's lowest.
	   The EU leaders will be keen to hear British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's views on a common European defense policy. Blair said this
week he may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability
within the NATO alliance.

	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Norway's Andrine Flemmen edged Olympic
champion Deborah Compagnoni for the lead Saturday in the first leg
of a women's World Cup giant slalom.
	   Flemmen twisted her way down the 368 meter (1,207 foot)
Rettenback course to take the lead with a time of 1:06.72.
	   Defending World Cup giant slalom champion Compagnoni, the first
skier out of the start hut, finished .25 adrift, crossing in
1:06.97.
	   Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer clocked the third fastest time
of 1:07.01, followed by France's Leila Piccard, fourth in 1:07.38.
	   Sweden's Anna Ottosson sat fifth, .95 back, while Germany's
Martina Ertl crossed sixth in 1:07.92.
	   Pernilla Wiberg, winner of the overall title in 1997, did not
start.
	   Another notable absentee in the start of the season's races was
last year's overall World Cup champion Katja Seizinger.
	   The German skier, a three-time Olympic gold medallist, injured
both knees in summer training and will likely be out for the best
part of the season.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrillas in southeast Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla infiltration trails in occupied southeastern Lebanon
Saturday, security officials said.
	   The jets fired at least two air-to-surface missiles at a valley
near the village of Qillaya, said the Lebanese officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 10:20 p.m.
(0620 GMT) attack on the area, about 20 kilometers (13 miles)
southwest of Rashaya in the southern Bekaa Valley and about the
same distance from the Israeli border.
	   Rashaya is about seven kilometers (four miles) north of the
border enclave Israel has occupied in the south since 1985.
	   Israeli jets often strike at guerrilla bases and infiltration
trails in south and southeast Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
border zone.

Pakistani Islamist party holds mass wedding

 &UR; EDS: FIXES slug to conform to digest. New to some points. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Some 100,000 people are expected at a mass
wedding and gathering on Saturday outside a white marble mosque in
Islamabad, a ceremony arranged by the most influential party
pushing for Pakistan to be governed by laws based on the Koran.
	   ``More than 300 couples will be joined in marriage today,''
Liaquat Baluch, a leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, or Islamic Party, told
The Associated Press.
	   Jamaat, which boycotted elections in 1997, is a small, but
influential party, considered the bulwark of a movement to change
Pakistan from a country where courts rule with British law and
Islamic laws to one in which only Islamic laws based on the Koran
are used.
	   The wedding comes on the second day of a three-day meeting by
Jamaat to establish a ``true Islamic order'' and to oust what they
call a ``corrupt and barbarous ruler.''
	   Pakistan is currently ruled by a government led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, a government Jamaat says is corrupt and
mismanaging the economy.
	   ``We are in an economic mess not because of the sanctions, but
due to the wrong policies of these rulers,'' said Munawar Hasan,
Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general.
	   During the meeting participants will hold a conference to focus
on the country's battered economy.
	   But organizers say the real aim of the wedding and gathering
_which they expect some 100,000 people to attend _ is for Jamaat to
get support for its desire to change Pakistan.
	   ``This mass wedding is part of our efforts to promote simplicity
in the society and eradicate the menace of dowry,'' Baluch said.
``The marriages have been arranged earlier by the parents of young
couples. . . they are taking an opportunity of our gathering to tie
the wedding knots.''
	   In Islamic Pakistan most marriages are arranged by parents.
Often the bride and groom are first cousins or if the marriage
involves people outside the family, the bride and groom meet for
the first time on the day of the wedding or shortly before. The
cost of a dowry often ruins families or prevents poorer women from
marrying.
	   Sharif already has passed a controversial constitutional
amendment in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament,
which would allow the government to ``prescribe what is right and
forbid what is wrong'' according to its own interpretation of
Islam.
	   The amendment must be passed by the Senate to become law and
it's not certain Sharif will get the votes he needs.
	   Human rights activists, major opposition parties and members of
minority religious groups oppose the amendment, saying it will give
the radical Islamic element in Pakistan greater authority to impose
its rules on the majority.

Mother of all trials melts into theater of the absurd

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY-MEROGIS, France (AP) _ It's the biggest French trial
ever, and it was meant to deliver an unmistakable message: The
state will not tolerate terrorism.
	   But the message has boomeranged.
	   To lawyers, defendants, and the French press, the prison gym
where the trial is being held resembles less a courtroom than a
theater of the absurd.
	   Most of the 138 defendants, accused of helping Islamic
insurgents in Algeria, have refused to attend the proceedings. Most
of the 70 defense lawyers walked out on the first day, saying the
trial is nothing more than a ``show.''
	   Many defendants claim they are victims of circumstance, wrongly
arrested because of family ties to sympathizers of Islamic
militants.
	   Since defense attorneys walked out on Sept. 1 _ the trial's
first day _ Judge Bruno Steinmann has presided over the nearly
empty, cavernous gym beside the Fleury-Merogis Prison, nearly an
hour's drive south of Paris. Police guards, on one day, made up
almost a third of those present.
	   As the trial moved into its final phase last week, Paris' chief
prosecutor called on boycotting lawyers to return. Prosecutor
Jean-Pierre Dintilhac said that a verdict will be rendered with or
without the presence of the defense.
	   Only 27 of the defendants _ all arrested in police sweeps in
1994 and 1995 _ remain in prison. But the tight security at the gym
attests to the seriousness of the charges. Before entering,
visitors are frisked in curtained booths down to their belts and
shoes, which are checked inside and out.
	   Prosecutors contend the suspects made up three separate but
overlapping networks to help the insurgency in Algeria, where
violence since 1992 has left an estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   The defendants are charged with sending arms, money and medical
supplies to fighters or providing documents and refuge for Muslim
militants brought to France.
	   Prosecutors are asking for 10-year prison sentences against the
three alleged network heads, and want another 68 defendants, most
of them Algerians, to be banned from France forever.
	   Boycotting lawyers say they won't be part of a ``show trial.''
The lawyers, with their clients' assent, decided they would not
even deliver final arguments.
	   ``We consider that the best defense is to do everything so that
this trial has not a bit of legitimacy,'' attorney Stephan
Maugendre said in an interview.
	   Maugendre's own client, Nacera Labsi, 47, says she is a suspect
mainly because of her contacts with two nephews, both of whom are
wanted in France.
	   ``If there is someone in this room who can prove I took part in
an act of terrorism, say so now,'' she pleaded recently, her voice
trembling before the judge.
	   Protesting lawyers put forth a series of grievances ranging from
the ``undignified'' courtroom to their inability to gain access to
the 50,000-page court record, because it costs a prohibitive 70
cents per page. They also say the proceedings should be divided
into at least three trials, one for each of the three networks.
	   Many claim their clients languished in jail before being
charged. One defendant, who waited nearly four months to be
questioned, gave birth while in detention. She was freed the day
she was questioned.
	   ``This started with a police sweep, then a phony investigation,
now a judicial masquerade,'' said Mohamed Chalabi, one of the
accused network leaders, in an outburst on the fourth day. ``Stop
wasting the taxpayers' money.''
	   The trial is expected to close next week. The verdict is not
likely for perhaps two months.
	   France has long been haunted by fears that the Islamic
insurgency in Algeria, its former colony, could spill across the
Mediterranean, as it did in 1995, when a series of bombings killed
eight and injured 160.
	   The insurgency in Algeria erupted after the military-backed
government canceled January 1992 elections to prevent a victory by
the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front. More than 75,000 people
have died in the violence.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new kids on the block Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit
devoted to brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next

	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After signing the West Bank
land-for-peace deal, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in
the Austrian capital Saturday to brief European Union leaders on
the historic agreement.
	   Arafat met Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel at a
downtown hotel and travels later to the Alpine resort of
Poertschach to brief European Union leaders, gathered for an
informal summit.
	   Arafat and Schuessel are expected to arrive in Poertschach in
the middle of the afternoon.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. EU members
have supported the Palestinians during many of their disputes with
the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
including Israel's decision to build Jewish housing in areas of
Jerusalem which the Palestinians want as a future capital.
	   The United States vetoed two of European-backed resolutions in
the U.N. Security Council which would have called on Israel to
abandon the housing project.
	   Quoting Austrian foreign ministry officials, the Austria Press
Agency said Schuessel and Arafat would also discuss increased EU
financial help for the Palestinian Authority.
	   The EU accounts for about 60 percent of the financial assistance
which the Palestinians receive. The Europeans are also anxious to
play a role in the protracted Middle East peace process, which has
been long dominated by the United States.
	   Joining in the talks between Schuessel and Arafat were the EU's
special Middle East envoy, EU, Miguel Angel Moratinos, and Austrian
foreign ministry state secretary, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.

Ethnic question center of debate by mayoral candidates

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In their first TV debate Saturday, the two
main candidates running in Taipei's mayoral election tried to mend
the ethnic rift they have stirred up in their campaigns.
	   ``I would rather lose the race than stir up ethnic
confrontation,'' incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition
Democratic Progressive party said at the public debate, the first
ahead of the Dec. 5 election.
	   In his campaign, Chen said, he only stressed his identify as a
native-born Taiwanese rather than challenging that of his main
opponent, Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Nationalist Party.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, was born in Taiwan but his father
emigrated from mainland China when the Nationalists lost a civil
war to the Communist forces in 1949.
	   Among Taipei's 2.6 million people, 25 percent are Chinese
immigrants and the rest are native-born Taiwanese.
	   Ma is known to be among those Nationalists who adamantly support
eventual reunification with China. But to appeal to the ordinary
Taiwanese who is wary of China's attempt to force unification on
the island, Ma has adopted a campaign slogan of ``Taiwan First.'
	   During the two-hour debate, Ma urged Chen not to ``stir up the
most fragile nerve of Taiwanese'' by labeling him as one who might
sell out Taiwan to China.
	   He denounced Chen's campaign aides for telling voters earlier
that electing Ma could turn Taiwan into another Hong Kong, which
reverted to Chinese rule last year.
	   ``One out of four families here has a mixed marriage between a
native born and one whose parents came from China,'' Ma said. ``We
must not widen a wound that has taken us decades to heal.''
	   Chen was elected in 1994 as the first opposition mayor of
Taipei, and the Nationalists named the popular Ma in hope of
recovering the capital.
	   But the ethnic question lingers. Even the New Party candidate
Wang Chien-hsien said in the debate that he would offer his
sympathy to Ma for the lack of personal support from President Lee
Teng-hui, the island's first native-born leader.
	   Wang cited opinion polls as saying most Taipei voters believe
Lee personally cared for Chen more than Ma. The small New Party
also favors reunification with China.
	   Ma objected. ``As head of the Nationalist Party, President Lee
certainly supports his party's own candidate,'' he said.

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward
southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction
on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes and
three other other provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the
southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
	   He was expected to add more provinces to the list once the full
extent of the damage was determined. Officials in calamity zones
will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of
commodities with little red tape.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China,
packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160
kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said.
	   At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), it was located about 370 kilometers (230
miles) west-northwest of Vigan in Ilocos Sur province. Moving at 11
kph (7 mph), it is expected to be 300 kilometers (187 miles)
south-southeast of Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon.
	   Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   The powerful winds flattened the abaca and tore away the leaves
of the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas with
blown-away tops. Virtually every house was damaged.
	   The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.
	   ``Entire families were killed,'' said Eddie Tapel, a local
official. ``Many children will have to quit school because their
families have no more income.''
	   Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

McEnroe into final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Top seed John McEnroe overcame a
let-down after playing old rival Bjorn Borg to beat Henri Leconte
in the semifinals of the Champions seniors tennis tournament
Saturday.
	   McEnroe scored his 16th-straight victory, including six on the
senior tour, over the Frenchman with a 7-6 (12-10), 6-7 (5-7), 10-5
win.
	   It followed McEnroe's victory over Borg on Friday night in front
of what local promoters called a record crowd for seniors tennis of
11,200.
	   ``Something about (Friday) night just felt magical,'' McEnroe
said. ``It was a bit of a predicament today because it was hard to
top yesterday.''
	   The triple Wimbledon champion faces the winner of the other
semi-final between Borg and Johan Kriek in the final.

Hard-line Jewish settlers set to mount bitter oppositon to accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with fresh reaction, settler protests
possible after Sabbath ends &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They're calling it betrayal. Treason. A black
day.
	   Militant Jewish settlers are infuriated by the signing of a
breakthrough land-for-peace Middle East accord in Washington,
considering it a threat to their very existence.
	   In response, they have vowed to fight its implementation and
bring down the ruling colition of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Initial settler reaction was muted by the Jewish Sabbath, which
began at sundown Friday. But a show of anger, possibly including
street protests, was expected after sundown Saturday.
	   In Israel, the biblically mandated day of rest had already
started by the time Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
President Clinton sat down together and signed the agreement
reached during a marathon nine-day summit at a Maryland retreat.
	   Most settlers who are observant Jews did not watch the White
House ceremony on television Friday night, because they refrain
from using machinery of any kind on the Sabbath.
	   On the Palestinian side, reaction to the agreement was cautious
but generally upbeat.
	   The three Palestinian dailies splashed the signing of the
agreement on their front pages Saturday with the headlines in big
bold type. Editorials said that although many Palestinian goals
remained unfulfilled, the agreement was a step toward peace.
	   The leading daily Al-Quds, which generally reflects the thinking
of Arafat's government, said the accord indicated the Netanyahu
government was finally accepting the political reality of
Palestinian aspirations, but added that implementation of the pact
would be the big test.
	   Some ordinary Palestinians, though, were more pessimistic.
	   ``What is an agreement _ does it mean the settlement at the top
of the mountain will go away? Or that the checkpoint will go away?
I don't think so,'' said a 25-year-old worker named Mohammed as he
walked down a street in the West Bank town of Nablus carrying
loaves of bread.
	   Among settlers, there was fear and anger even before the accord
was inked.
	   ``After they sign the agreement, they will continue with these
bombs _ until they take all the land they will not leave us
alone,'' said Shiran Shrur, a 14-year-old girl living at Maale
Adumin, the West Bank's largest settlement.
	   Hard-line settlers believe they can block the accord's
implementation for months through a combination of political
maneuvering and disruptive mass protests.
	   Earlier this week, as an agreement drew near, the settlers
staged road-blocking demonstrations, cutting off Palestinian
traffic near areas that might come under Palestinian control.
	   Under the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, a move that will isolate up to 15 settlements. The
settlers are likely to respond by trying to expand and reinforce
those communities.
	   That sets the stage for likely clashes with Palestinians, who
are already furious over what they see as continuous land grabs by
the settlers.
	   The key settler action is likely to come on the political front,
as settlers try go bring down Netanyahu's government and force
early elections.
	   The withdrawal is supposed to occur over a span of 12 weeks, but
Hanan Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition, said last week it would be
untenable for Netanyahu to implement a pullback during an election
campaign.
	   The first hurdle Netanyahu faces on his return will be to win
Cabinet approval of the Wye River pact. Israeli media have said
Netanyahu can expect support only from five of his 16 Cabinet
ministers, with four opposed and seven undecided.
	   Parliament approval will be easier to secure, with opposition
parties saying they will back the agreement, thus canceling out the
no votes from hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition.
	   However, this does not remove the threat to Netanyahu. The
opposition says that while it will support a peace agreement, it
will not back Netanyahu on domestic issues, like the budget. Defeat
of the national budget is the same as a vote of no confidence here.
	   Israeli media have quoted Netanyahu aides as saying the prime
minister might call early elections if he believes he cannot get a
withdrawal agreement passed in the Cabinet or in parliament.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired water cannons
filled with stinging pepper spray Saturday at several thousand
people gathered for an anti-government protest in the capital.
	   After warning women and children to get off the streets, the
huge water trucks lumbered into a busy downtown shopping district
and began spraying people who had lined the streets.
	   Thousands of people fled, crying and coughing from the spray
that covered the streets in a blue foam.
	   Plainclothes police, some wearing ski masks, chased people
through department stores and down side streets, nabbing them and
tossing them into waiting vans.
	   Some were slapped and kicked and muscled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store,
her husband demanding, ``Are you trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   The anti-government demonstration, which never truly got under
way, is one in a series of protests since ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct.
	   So far, authorities have detained about 275 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   This week, however, the police warned that those who join
anti-government protests could face arrest under the country's
dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite
detainment without trial.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance with a black
eye and a neck brace, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.
	   He has condemned the charges as trumped up by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad because of his growing challenge to the leader's
17-year rule.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new kids on the block Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit
devoted to brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, gives the
line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and
only in Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   In a last-minute change to the agenda, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was to brief the Europeans on a West Bank land-for-peace
accord during a stopover here on his way back from talks in the
United States.
	   Arafat arrived in Vienna to meet with EU Middle East envoy,
Miguel Martinos, and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
He was to fly to this alpine resort in southern Austria to meet
with the EU leaders at around 1300GMT.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Craig Parry owed his caddie after a
third-round 67 took him to the lead of the Australian dlrs 500,000
(U.S. dlrs 316,000) Ford South Australian Open golf tournament at
the Kooyonga Golf Club course Saturday.
	   Australian Parry, who will feature in the International team in
December's Presidents Cup against the United States, missed some
short putts early on before handing over responsibility to his
caddie for the final 12 holes.
	   ``I had a 15-foot putt on the 7th and that's when I asked my
caddie to read the greens, I was looking at them from one side and
they looked right to left, the other side they looked left to
right, I just got so confused out there,'' Parry said.
	   Parry's round included six birdies and a bogey and followed
consecutive rounds of 71 on the first two days to take him to
7-under 209.
	   Three players, all Australians, were two shots back on
five-under _ Rodney Pampling, Stephen Leaney and Robert Stephens.
	   There were only two players left in the draw from outside
Australia and New Zealand. Robin Byrd of the United States was five
off the pace after a 73 while Jean-Louis Guepy of France was three
further back after a 73.

Report: Salaries for Singapore ministers to be cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's highly paid leaders will have their
salaries cut when an influential council makes recommendations next
month, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The National Wages Council, a tripartite body representing
government, unions and employers, is expected to urge
across-the-board pay cuts when its guidelines are released in
November, said The Straits Times.
	   Dominated by the government, the council's recommendations are
widely adopted in tightly controlled Singapore.
	   But government ministers, whose salaries are equivalent to those
of corporate leaders, will also feel the pinch.
	   ``Ministers will naturally take a salary cut if the (council)
recommends a salary cut for everybody,'' Manpower Minister Lee Boon
Yang was quoted as saying.
	   He noted that Singapore leaders have in effect already
experienced a pay cut this year, when a planned mid-year raise of
8.1 percent was suspended by the government.
	   Singapore has been searching for ways to reduce the cost of
doing business here as a solution to its slowing economy, and a
package including lower taxes, utilities, rentals and wages is
expected soon.
	   Workers and unions in Singapore have expressed concerns over
bearing the burden of these measures. A likely cut in the country's
mandatory, state-run pension fund _ from which many Singaporeans
pay their mortgages _ has worried some here.
	   ``The measures that the government will take has got to be
equitable,'' Lee was quoted as saying in the report. ``We're not
just asking workers to bear the burden of cost reduction. The
government will also make adjustments.''
	   On rising unemployment, he estimated the rate will grow to
between 4 and 5 percent by year's end, roughly double the 2.3
percent figure in June.
	   ``There's a likelihood that we will go into a recession, yes,
but the unemployment rate would depend on how deep the recession is
and how willing Singaporeans are ... to take on alternative jobs or
jobs that were done by foreign workers,'' Lee added.

Far-right National Front office bombed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE (AP) _ A bomb exploded at an office of the far-right
National Front overnight, shattering windows and damaging furniture
but causing no injuries, police said Saturday.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing, but it was
the third to target a National Front office in France's biggest
port since a young Comorian was killed here by Front members in
1995.
	   The office staff includes Jean-Pierre Bauman, the Front's
finance director and a former training instructor for members in
the working-class district of northern Marseille.
	   Bauman had that training position when Comorian Ibrahim Ali was
killed in February 1995 by three Front members who were putting up
the party's posters in the neighborhood.
	   Bauman and party No. 2 Bruno Megret testified in the case, in
which the three men were convicted in the murder the young man.
	   The two previous bombings were claimed by a group calling itself
``Partisan Sharpshooters,'' an organization unknown by police.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders welcome two
new faces on Saturday _ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit devoted to
brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, gives the
line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and
only in Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   In a last-minute change to the agenda, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was to brief the Europeans on a West Bank land-for-peace
accord during a stopover here on his way back from talks in the
United States.
	   Arafat arrived in Vienna to meet with EU Middle East envoy,
Miguel Martinos, and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
He was to fly to this alpine resort in southern Austria to meet
with the EU leaders at around 1300 GMT.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and blames
continued, scattered clashes on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against government forces which are leaving the province
under terms of the agreement.
	   ``But any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages or our
positions will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels
said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander,
and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were expected in Belgrade on Saturday
afternoon to seek more pullbacks of police units and equipment from
the separatist province.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to remove the special
police and military units he sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on
ethnic Albanian militants, who demand independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen great
progress but we are far from adequate compliance.''
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.''
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have been killed
and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   The KLA issued a statement Friday reiterating that it is keeping
to a general cease-fire but saying it would respond and defend
villages if Serb and Yugoslav forces move on them.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was in neighboring Albania to brief
government officials and urge them to support the U.S.-led peace
effort. Albania had permitted rebels to set up sanctuaries in the
north.
	   ``We are looking for full compliance,'' Hill told reporters.
``We'd like to see full compliance. I don't want to predict when
exactly we'll see it but we are working very hard to ensure it.''
	   At the United Nations, the Security Council was planning to vote
Saturday on a resolution endorsing the Kosovo peace accord, despite
potential opposition from China and Russia over language that would
allow NATO to ``take appropriate steps.'' to enforce the agreement.
	   The council is under pressure to adopt a resolution enshrining
the accord so the verifiers can begin Kosovo.
	   The American head of the Kosovo ground verification mission,
William Walker, arrived Friday in Kosovo after meeting Milosevic,
vowing to improve conditions for refugees and help guarantee
success of the peace agreement.

Hard-liners take lead in national elections for key assembly

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates. Two
are believed to be independents.
	   The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats
in 16 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative
council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had
rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
	   The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want
to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing
an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
	   They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than
allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   These theologians, who control most crucial state institutions
such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the
1979 Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51
percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where
counting has been completed.
	   Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the
independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior
Ministry. The official media on Friday claimed an ``unprecedented''
participation by voters.
	   The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout
was noted in Golestan province. Golestan residents, contacted by
telephone, disputed that.
	   ``The stations were empty. How those ballots got there, I have
no idea,'' said Parvin, who would only give her first name. She was
reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
	   She said she visited several polling stations and found very few
people voting. Associated Press reporters who toured polling
stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
	   An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the
electorate voted.
	   ``So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were
speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging,'' the NCRI said in a
statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo, Egypt. It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the
regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual
figure.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in
Iran did not openly complain of rigging.

Hard-liners take lead in national elections for key assembly

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates. Two
are believed to be independents.
	   The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats
in 16 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative
council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had
rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
	   The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want
to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing
an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
	   They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than
allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   These theologians, who control state institutions such as the
judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979
Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51
percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where
counting has been completed.
	   Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the
independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior
Ministry. The official media on Friday claimed an ``unprecedented''
participation by voters.
	   The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout
was noted in Golestan province. Golestan residents, contacted by
telephone, disputed that.
	   ``The stations were empty. How those ballots got there, I have
no idea,'' said Parvin, who would only give her first name. She was
reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
	   She said she visited several polling stations and found very few
people voting. Associated Press reporters who toured polling
stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
	   An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the
electorate voted.
	   ``So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were
speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging,'' the NCRI said in a
statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo, Egypt. It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the
regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual
figure.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in
Iran did not openly complain of rigging.

	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ Customs agents at the Franco-Spanish
border seized 57,000 Ecstasy pills from a car bound for Holland,
France's largest haul of the hallucinogenic drug to date,
authorities said Saturday.
	   Agents arrested the driver, a Dutch man who was not identified,
after finding the pills hidden in his car on Thursday, the
authorities said on customary anonymity.
	   The man was placed under formal investigation Friday, one step
short of being charged, and ordered held in a jail in Bayonne.

Pinochet's wife appeals for his release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be
extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.
	   ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia
Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from
back surgery.
	   'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very,
very, very, ill.''
	   Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful
spinal disorder which had hindered his movement.
	   He was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator
he enjoys diplomatic immunity _ and because he is in poor health.
	   Unconfirmed media reports in Chile this week indicated that
Pinochet, who has worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, also
has a urinary tract infection. There have also been reports that he
is suffering from depression.
	   In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers for the
former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British police
acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case resumes
Monday.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for life,
as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.

Central Banker predicts collapse of hundreds of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's economic sickness has infected Russia's
far-flung regions, more than half of which have defaulted on
domestic loans, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Russia's securities market had boomed in recent years, but the
country began suffering from Asia's economic troubles and admitted
Aug. 17 that it couldn't pay off its treasury bill obligations.
Investors fled and markets collapsed.
	   Seventy-one of Russia's 89 regions had joined in the securities
excitement, issuing 20 billion rubles (dlrs ....) in domestic
bonds. Fifty regions have already missed payments on some or all of
them, the English-language Moscow Times reported Saturday.
	   Most of the bonds are held by Russian banks and brokerages.
	   Many of the federal government's treasury bills, however, are
held by foreign banks, which have been holding talks with Russian
officials in London on restructuring the debt. Negotiations broke
down this week but may resume next week.
	   Russia's third-largest city, Nizhny Novgorod, may become the
first entity to default on Eurobonds, according to rating agencies.
While the city has met its obligations so far, it may not be able
to meet its next payment of dlrs 4.4 million due in April, the
Moscow Times said.
	   Also Saturday, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said his team
would finalize its plan next week for tackling the country's
two-month-old economic crisis, its worst since the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
	   The program includes establishment of a State Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to oversee the beleaguered banking
sector, and calls for Russia's first complete inventory of its
foreign debt, including that leftover from the Soviet Union, the
daily Kommersant reported Saturday.
	   The government has sent mixed signals about such a program for
weeks, first setting a date for its release then saying it would
not come up with an overall plan but concentrate instead on
short-term measures.
	   The International Monetary Fund is demanding to see the plan and
proof it's being put to use before releasing the next tranche of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout promised this summer.
	   Among the IMF's demands are better tax collection. With that in
mind, Moscow is preparing to introduce a sales tax by the start of
the year, the daily Segodnya reported. The tax would likely be 5
percent, and would exclude items such as bread, milk and sugar.
	   The government lowered import duties on meat, milk and other
staples in an effort to prevent shortages this winter. Russia
relies heavily on imports, which have fallen since the crisis and
become more expensive as the ruble loses value.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired water cannons
filled with stinging pepper spray Saturday at several thousand
people gathered for an anti-government protest in the capital.
	   After warning women and children to get off the streets, the
huge water trucks lumbered into a busy downtown shopping district
and began spraying people who had lined the streets.
	   Thousands of people fled, crying and coughing from the spray
that covered the streets in a blue foam.
	   Plainclothes police, some wearing ski masks, chased people
through department stores and down side streets, nabbing them and
tossing them into waiting vans.
	   Some were slapped and kicked and muscled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store
after she shouted at them that they were cruel.
	   A policewoman carried the woman's eggs and vegetables as police
pulled her into the street and her husband demanded, ``Are you
trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect curtain fabric,'' said
one woman who was afraid to give her name, her young daughter
clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes. ``If they continue
to send these chemicals into the air, everybody's going to be dead
soon.''
	   The anti-government demonstration, which never truly got under
way, is one in a series of protests since ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct. So far, authorities have detained about 275 people who
have attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail
pending trial.
	   This week, however, police warned that those who join
anti-government protests could face arrest under the country's
dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite
detainment without trial.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance with a black
eye and neck brace, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.
	   He has condemned the charges as trumped up by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad because of his growing challenge to the leader's
17-year rule.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Saturday called on Israel and the
Palestinians to implement faithfully the agreement they reached
with U.S. help so as to push forward the Mideast peace process.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang welcomed Israel's
decision to withdraw from more of the West Bank and praised the
U.S. role in securing the agreement.
	   ``We appreciate efforts made to this end by the United States
and other parties concerned,'' Tang said in a statement carried by
the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   Tang urged Israel to sit down with Syria and Lebanon as soon as
possible to achieve a comprehensive, regionwide peace.
	   A champion of the Palestinian cause for since its more radical
policies of the 1950s, China has also developed strong business
ties and warming diplomatic ones with Israel over the past decade.

Russia, China criticize NATO expansion, plan closer military ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new penultimate graf with parliament speaker leaving for
China. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and China are fiercely opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion and proposed airstrikes on Yugoslavia, and plan
to increase military cooperation with each other, Russia's defense
minister said Saturday.
	   Igor Sergeyev also reiterated Russian and Chinese warnings
against a U.S.-Japanese plan to develop an anti-missile defense
system, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``This is a factor which can impair the balance of forces, and
slow down the process of reduction of strategic arms,'' he said in
Beijing.
	   Sergeyev called his talks this week with Chinese officials on
NATO and the Balkans ``very important,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   The U.N. Security Council is considering a resolution that would
allow NATO to enforce a peace accord for the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, but Russia and China remain staunchly opposed. Russia has
religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and China traditionally
objects to military intervention into what it considers an internal
matter.
	   Sergeyev said the two countries planned to expand military
cooperation, ITAR-Tass said. The report did not elaborate.
	   Sergeyev cited his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian as saying
that President Jiang Zemin would visit Russia in late November.
Chinese officials have not announced a date for the trip, but have
said it would be before year's end.
	   Sergeyev also said during his visit that Russia is continuing to
reduce its troops along the Chinese border.
	   Also Saturday, a delegation led by the speaker of Russia's lower
house of parliament left Moscow for China for talks with Jiang and
Hong Kong officials.
	   After decades of friction, relations between Moscow and Beijing
have improved dramatically in recent years as China has become a
major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's
struggling defense industry. Russia views the new relationship with
China as a counterbalance to what it sees as U.S. pre-eminence in
world affairs.

Storms bring severe floods to Wales, at least one killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with man still missing, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Heavy rains and gale-force winds brought
severe flooding to south Wales, where at least one person was swept
away by a swollen stream and killed. Police on Saturday were still
searching for a second man missing and feared drowned.
	   Flooding has also affected Scotland and central, north and
southwest England _ with more torrential rain and high winds from
the Atlantic forecast for later in the day.
	   Thousands of acres of farmland were under water in a wide belt
stretching across south Wales from Cardiganshire to Monmouthshire,
and 400 people were moved from their homes.
	   A man was seen swept away in a fast-flowing stream in the
Treorchy area of the Rhondda Valley, 20 miles (30 km) west of
Cardiff, on Thursday night. After a police search, his body was
discovered Friday, but he was not immediately identified.
	   Farmer William Mason, 62, was missing after he went out in the
storm to save his livestock from the flood-swollen River Wye near
his home at Clifford, 50 miles (80 km) north of Cardiff.
	   Police and fire crews in parts of south Wales moved scores of
people from their homes to the shelter of local schools and
emergency centers after rivers burst their banks.
	   Emergency services in Abergavenny, 25 miles (40 km) northeast of
Cardiff, plucked drivers to safety after they were trapped in their
vehicles by seven feet (2 meters) of floodwater when the River Usk
overflowed.
	   In Cornwall county in southwest England, localized flooding on
Saturday forced the closure of one lane of a bridge taking traffic
over the Tamar River into Devon.
	   Coastguards at the Devon port of Brixham said vessels were
putting in to port to escape the worsening winds.

Cars destroyed, damaged in anarchist arson spree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Athens, Greece (AP) - Five cars were burnt and five others were
seriously damaged in a spate of attacks by anarchists early
Saturday, police said.
	   No one was hurt in the attacks which occurred in three different
Athens suburbs.
	   An organization calling itself the Cooperation of Anarchist
Groups telephoned a private Athens radio station to claim
responsibility for burning three cars using propane gas canisters.
Two of them were owned by police officers and the third by a
lawyer.
	   Elsewhere in Athens, a group of some 30 youths who had attended
a student gathering went on the rampage, torching one car with a
molotov bomb and smashing up five others. All the cars belonged to
a computer firm.
	   In a third incident, another private car was destroyed by fire.
The fire department believes it was arson.
	   No one was arrested in the attacks, police said.
	   Shadowy groups little known to authorities have claimed dozens
of attacks this year on cars and offices belonging to policemen,
officials, politicians, diplomats, journalists and foreigners.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In Western gowns and tuxedos, 137 elderly
couples held a mass ``wedding'' ceremony Saturday to celebrate
their marriages of 50 years or more.
	   The mass wedding, presided over by Mayor Wu Dun-yih of southern
Kaohsiung City, was held to celebrate the Ancestor Homage Festival
that falls on Wednesday.
	   Some of the women were excited about getting dressed up because
many had been too poor when they married to afford a wedding gown.
	   With the well wishes of their children and grandchildren, the
couples held hands as they walked the aisle at a convention hall
filled with balloons.
	   The longest married couple were Kung Chen-wang, 89, and Huang
Pan, 84, who have been married for 70 years, officials said.

Hard-line Jewish settlers set to mount bitter oppositon to accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with fresh reaction, settler protests
possible after Sabbath ends.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They're calling it betrayal. Treason. A black
day.
	   Militant Jewish settlers are infuriated by the signing of a
breakthrough land-for-peace Middle East accord in Washington,
considering it a threat to their very existence.
	   In response, they have vowed to fight its implementation and
bring down the ruling colition of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Initial settler reaction was muted by the Jewish Sabbath, which
began at sundown Friday, but a show of anger, possibly including
street protests, was expected after sundown Saturday.
	   In Israel, the biblically mandated day of rest had already
started by the time Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
President Clinton signed the agreement reached during a marathon
nine-day summit at a Maryland retreat.
	   But before the signing, lawmaker Michael Kleiner, a settler
leader, said there was great anger over the accord.
	   ``This small country is giving a lot of territory,'' he told
Israel's Channel Two. ``We see this as a black day.''
	   Most settlers who are observant Jews, did not watch the White
House ceremony on television Friday night, because they don't use
machinery on the Sabbath.
	   On the Palestinian side, reaction to the agreement was cautious
but generally upbeat.
	   The three Palestinian dailies splashed the signing of the
agreement on their front pages Saturday with the headlines in big
bold type. Editorials said that although many Palestinian goals
remained unfulfilled, the agreement was a step toward peace.
	   The leading daily Al-Quds, which generally reflects the thinking
of Arafat's government, said the accord indicated the Netanyahu
government was finally accepting the political reality of
Palestinian aspirations, but added that implementation of the pact
would be the big test.
	   Some ordinary Palestinians, though, were more pessimistic.
	   ``What is an agreement _ does it mean the settlement at the top
of the mountain will go away? Or that the checkpoint will go away?
I don't think so,'' said a 25-year-old worker named Mohammed as he
walked down a street in the West Bank town of Nablus carrying
loaves of bread.
	   Among settlers, there was fear and anger even before the accord
was inked.
	   ``After they sign the agreement, they will continue with these
bombs _ until they take all the land they will not leave us
alone,'' said Shiran Shrur, a 14-year-old girl living at Maale
Adumin, the West Bank's largest settlement.
	   Hard-line settlers believe they can block the accord's
implementation for months through a combination of political
maneuvering and disruptive mass protests.
	   Earlier this week, as an agreement drew near, the settlers
staged road-blocking demonstrations, cutting off Palestinian
traffic near areas that might come under Palestinian control.
	   Under the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, a move that will isolate up to 15 settlements. The
settlers are likely to respond by trying to expand and reinforce
those communities.
	   That sets the stage for likely clashes with Palestinians, who
are already furious over what they see as continuous land grabs by
the settlers.
	   The key settler action is likely to come on the political front,
as settlers try go bring down Netanyahu's government and force
early elections.
	   The withdrawal is supposed to occur over a span of 12 weeks, but
Hanan Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition, said last week it would be
untenable for Netanyahu to implement a pullback during an election
campaign.
	   The first hurdle Netanyahu faces on his return will be to win
Cabinet approval of the Wye River pact. Israeli media have said
Netanyahu can expect support only from five of his 16 Cabinet
ministers, with four opposed and seven undecided.
	   Parliament approval will be easier to secure, with opposition
parties saying they will back the agreement, thus canceling out the
no votes from hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition.
	   However, this does not remove the threat to Netanyahu. The
opposition says that while it will support a peace agreement, it
will not back Netanyahu on domestic issues, like the budget. Defeat
of the national budget is the same as a vote of no confidence here.
	   Israeli media have quoted Netanyahu aides as saying the prime
minister might call early elections if he believes he cannot get a
withdrawal agreement passed in the Cabinet or in parliament.

Hostage taking ends in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Political prisoners, holding prison
officials hostage in five prisons throughout Turkey in a bid to
improve jail conditions, put an end to their nationwide protest,
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Saturday.
	   Prisoners had held some 50 officials total hostage Friday in
what appeared to be a concerted protest.
	   ``All events in the prisons are over,'' the Anatolia news agency
quoted Denizkurdu as saying. Human rights activists who took part
in negotiating the release of prison officers confirmed that all
had been released.
	   Five security officers were injured during the hostage- takings,
reports said. None was reported in life-threatening conditions.
	   The most important action came in Istanbul's Umraniye prison
Throughout the night, lawyers, human rights activists and
paramilitary police negotiated with the hostage takers, Anatolia
said.
	   Lawyers told Anatolia that the prisoners demanded a general
improvement of jail conditions, an end to prison transfers, and
that convicts held in isolated cells be allowed to return to their
wards.
	   It was not immediately known which, if any demands, were being
met.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.
	   In a separate incident Saturday, an inmate in a southeast prison
set himself afire and was hospitalized in severe condition,
Anatolia reported. Five prisoners have died by burning themselves
in a protest against the government's crackdown on Kurdish rebels
this week.
	   Some 37,000 people have died since the Kurdish insurgency for
autonomy began iun 1984.
	   In April, leftist prisoners in seven jails around the country
took more than 50 guards hostage for two days also to protest
prison transfers.

Japanese artist proposes making disputed Kurils into art colony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Japanese artist has a solution to a
half-century-old dispute between Russia and Japan over the Kuril
Islands: Turn them into an artists' colony.
	   ``We should start with minor things, gradually doing away with
psychological barriers between the Russians and Japanese,'' Tadashi
Goino, who is also a businessman, scientist and composer, told the
ITAR-Tass news agency on Friday.
	   He suggested establishing theaters and museums on the islands
and opening them up to Japanese visitors. The Japanese would
gradually ``lose their bitterness, and some of them could settle
there, and in 20-30 years a referendum could be held,'' he said.
	   The islands, located off Russia's Pacific Coast, were captured
by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, but are still
claimed by Japan. The territorial dispute has prevented the two
countries from concluding a peace treaty, though their overall
relations have improved in recent years.
	   Goino, who was speaking during a visit to Russia, is a member of
the Russian Academy of Sciences, ITAR-Tass said.

Eight more bodies found from capsized boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai marine police have found eight
more bodies from a ferry boat that capsized in the Gulf of
Thailand, bringing the number of bodies recovered to 11, police
said Saturday.
	   Five bodies were retrieved Saturday and three on Friday, said
Capt. Korjaroo Sangkha-munthorn, commander of the marine police in
Koh Samui, an island where some of the 18 survivors were being
hospitalized.
	   Recovery operations have been hampered by heavy rain and winds
since the boat sank early Wednesday. But two planes were dispatched
Saturday morning to search for more bodies as the weather cleared
up.
	   Two Australian women were among the three victims whose bodies
were recovered Wednesday.
	   The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs identified them as
Gabrielle Sandercock, 33, of Melbourne, and Naomi Lesley, 24, of
Perth.
	   There were thought to have been about 30 passengers aboard the
ferry which left Don Sak town in Surat Thani province, 530
kilometers (330 miles) south of Bangkok, at 11 p.m. Tuesday.
	   It capsized in rough seas at 4 a.m. Wednesday, on its way to Koh
Tao, an island popular among foreign tourists.
	   It is uncertain how many passengers are still missing although
they are presumed dead.
	   Authorities believe some of the passengers may have been trapped
inside the boat when it turned over.
	   Survivors told police that they had to kick out glass windows in
the section where they were sleeping to escape.
	   A reward of 2,000 baht (dlrs 54) has been offered to fishermen
who recover any bodies.
	   Naval authorities believe the boat may have capsized because it
was carrying a heavy load of construction materials in choppy
waters.

Hotel occupancy rate up in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - The Hong Kong tourist industry showed signs of
rebounding, with the hotel occupancy rate rising to 75 percent in
September from 70 percent a year earlier, the Hong Kong Tourist
Association said Saturday.
	   All categories of hotels and guest houses showed higher
occupancies than last year, it said.
	   But the average hotel occupancy rate for the first nine months
of this year was 74 percent, compared to 77 percent for the same
period in 1997.
	   The association said earlier that tourist arrivals in September
rose by 0.2 percent from a month earlier to 733,813.
	   It said 6.95 million tourists visited Hong Kong during the first
nine months of this year, down 12.2 percent from the same period
last year.
	   Hong Kong's tourist industry has been hit hard by Asia's
economic downturn.
	   The strong local currency, which is linked to the U.S. dollar,
has made the territory too expensive for many tourists from
Southeast Asian countries.

Lawmakers play soccer to promote 2002 World Cup

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's pot-belled legislators
beat their Japanese counterparts 4-3 in a goodwill soccer match
Saturday to promote the 2002 World Cup.
	   South Korea will be co-host with Japan for the next World Cup.
Politicians hope coming together for the soccer tournament will
help heal old wounds from the deep animosities many Koreans still
harbor against Japan's 1910-45 brutal colonization of Korea.
	   Running with effort across the pitch at Seoul's Chamsil Olympic
Stadium, the South Korean lawmakers dominated the abbreviated
25-minute first half, scoring all of their four goals.
	   The slimmer Japanese Diet members rallied in the second half,
encouraged by ruling Liberal Democrat Kunishige Kamamoto, a former
member of the national team.
	   Kamamoto scored the first two of Japan's three goals, all in the
second half.
	   After kicking in a penalty kick, Kamamoto dribbled and fired a
30-meter shot into the net halfway through the second half, leaving
the tired South Korean legislators in disarray for the rest of the
match.
	   The star of the South Korean side was independent legislator
Chung Mong-joon, who heads the South Korean Football Association.
Chung scored the last two of South Korea's four goals.
	   ``A successful hosting of 2002 World Cup will bring the two
countries closer together and help create a better understanding
between the two peoples,'' said Seishiro Eto, a Liberal Democratic
legislator who headed the 31-member Japanese soccer delegation.
	   Both teams, all wearing their national soccer team uniforms,
said they had trained for weeks to tune up for the match.
	   ``The two nations should put the past behind them and work
together to overcome the regional economic crisis,'' said Rep. Park
Tae-joon, head of the South Korean parliamentary group.
	   Before the parliamentarian' bout, the women's soccer national
teams of both countries played a friendly match to a 1-1 draw. They
were to have a second match Monday.

Spanish wants to freeze Pinochet accounts in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
Luxembourg &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge who ordered the arrest of
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet has issued a petition
aimed at freezing any accounts the aging military chief might have
in Luxembourg and Switzerland, news reports said Saturday.
	   Under the legal request drawn up Friday, Judge Baltasar Garzon
is to send investigative teams to both countries to find out if
Pinochet has financial accounts in either and if so, to block them,
the leading daily El Pais reported.
	   Garzon's said the measure was being sought to cover any possible
compensation payments that might be ordered should Pinochet be
tried in Spain.
	   Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 on
Garzon's request as a first step toward his extradition to stand
trial for alleged crimes of genocide and terrorism committed during
his 1973-90 rule.
	   The National Court where Garzon works, is next Thursday to begin
discussing whether the Spanish justice system has any jurisdiction
over such crimes committed in Argentina and Chile.
	   A negative ruling would scrap Garzon's probe against Pinochet
while one in favor would spur the judge on to making a formal
extradition request to Britain, a request which would first have to
approved by the Spanish government.

Georgia fires officers for poor reaction to rebellion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's Defense Ministry fired several
top officers Saturday for inadequately responding to a one-day
revolt and ignoring warnings that a mutiny was brewing.
	   At least two government soldiers and three rebels were killed in
the fighting Monday, President Eduard Shevardnadze has said. The
leader of the rebellion and some of his supporters remain at large,
though police have detained at least 10 mutineers.
	   The commander of the defense ministry's western force, Maj. Gen.
Zaura Uchadze, was among those fired Saturday, the ministry said in
a statement.
	   The western force had apparently received information in late
September about a possible revolt, but ``did nothing to prevent
such a threat,'' Defense Minister David Tevzadze said.
	   He also said that poor coordination among units meant it took
government troops several hours longer than it should have to crush
the revolt.
	   The leader of the rebellion, military commander Akakiy Eliava,
and some of his men have been charged with treason. Eliava
supported the late Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991, was ousted in early 1992. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed to
Shevardnadze.

 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUERTO BETANIA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels control about
40 percent of the countryside, and in most places allow people to
elect their mayors and town councils.
	   But the elected officials have no illusions. They ultimately
answer to ``the boys'' or ``the country police'' or ``the tough
guys,'' as the guerrillas are known.
	   In this southern region, which is being vacated by the army
before Nov. 7 as a prelude to peace talks, the country's largest
rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has held
sway for years.
	   A rebel-imposed nighttime curfew on road travel and a drinking
limit of four beers a person is widely heeded. Violators of the
insurgents' civil code either accept their punishments, leave or
die.
	   For three months until September, the FARC banned fishing in the
Caguan River and its tributaries because stocks were depleted. A
man caught disobeying was bound in his net and left for hours on
the riverbank, praying the water wouldn't rise and drown him, said
Javier Salcedo, a mechanic in Puerto Betania.
	   ``Here someone gets killed in the street and everyone knows it
was done by the guerrillas. But nobody can say that,'' said a
councilman in San Vicente, the region's largest town 12 miles
upriver from Puerto Betania.
	   He and two fellow council members, who spoke only on condition
they not be quoted by name, offered a primer on guerrilla justice:
Get rowdy drunk in public and you carry 50 sacks of construction
material to public works sites. Curse someone's mother and it's 150
sacks. Punch someone and it's 500.
	   The last time a Colombian soldier set foot in Puerto Betania was
four years ago during presidential elections, said Salcedo, the
mechanic. The rebels have prohibited voting in the three-square
block village in the last three national and regional elections, he
said.
	   In areas where they are mostly in control, the guerrillas
sometimes kidnap elected officials, either for punishment or
persuasion.
	   In May, a congressman kidnapped by the FARC nearly two years
earlier died with three rebels when their boat capsized in the
Caguan. The rebels had vowed not to release him before authorities
finished a highway project from which the rebels alleged he had
been embezzling.

Muslim militants kill four Indian soldiers in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Muslim separatists fired a rocket at an
Indian military camp in the troubled Himalayan region of Kashmir,
killing at least four soldiers, an army officer said Saturday.
	   The attack on Friday night partially damaged the concrete
building in Bafiaz in Poonch district, 240 kilometers (150 miles)
north of Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, the
officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   Kashmir has been wracked by insurgency since 1989. Jammu-Kashmir
is the only majority-Muslim state in a predominantly Hindu India.
	   The rebel groups demand an independent Kashmir or a choice to
join neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state. More than 15,000
people have been killed in violence in the past nine years.

Reports: Police chief steps up security amid reported gang threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cheung's lawyers calling for his transfer to Hong
Kong in graf 8-9th grafs

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A police chief of a southern Chinese city where
a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security
following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Gang members loyal to ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung have put
a 4 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 512,000 million) price tag
for the death of Guangzhou police chief Zheng Guoqiang, the Hong
Kong Standard said.
	   The assassination threat was said to have been made in a letter
sent to Zheng, the Standard said, without identifying its source.
	   Cheung has been charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and
murder. The trial, which also includes 35 other defendants, in
Guangzhou 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the border, is closed
to journalists.
	   Zheng has been personally leading a fleet of vehicles escorting
the defendants from jail to the central Guangzhou city courthouse
and back.
	   Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese
businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling
explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong
businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of kidnapping a
merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom
(U.S. dlrs 48,300).
	   Hong Kong media reported Saturday that Cheung's lawyers have
written to the Hong Kong Department of Justice, calling for the
transfer of the gang boss to stand trial in the territory.
	   The lawyers said Cheung faced the death penalty in China, while
there was no captial punishment in Hong Kong.
	   Earlier in the day, Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for
security, said the government was unable to seek the extradition of
Cheung _ a Hong Kong citizen _ for trial in the absence of any hard
evidence.
	   Speaking after an anti-crime symposium, she told Hong Kong Radio
that there had been no hard proof of crimes committed in the
territory despite reports that two of Hong Kong's wealthiest
businessmen had been kidnapped.
	   Security has been tight since Cheung's trial began Monday. The
courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of
concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to
assassinate the defendants to silence them.
	   News broadcasts Saturday showed the defendants being led out
from several vehicles _ including armored personnel carriers _
their legs chained, escorted by soldiers in bulletproof vests
carrying machine guns and pistols.
	   The news blackout has fueled various reports in Hong Kong's
flamboyant media, riveted by one of the most dramatic gang trials
in Hong Kong history.
	   On Friday, The South China Morning Post quoted an unidentified
prison source as saying that Cheung and other defendants were
afraid Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them. They were
only eating food brought in for security officials, the newspaper
said.
	   Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily reported that two bomb threats
have been delivered since the trial began.
	   Cheung reportedly has said that he masterminded the kidnapping
of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   Ming Pao quoted Cheung as saying. ``There would have been no way
that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the
gang's kidnapping spree, had he not been arrested.

Talks continue on procedural detail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heads of delegations from North and South Korea,
the United States and China huddled in talks Saturday in a bid to
agree a strategy for bringing a permanent peace to the tense and
divided Korean peninsula.
	   The aim was to set up two subcommittees to negotiate replacing
the current armistice with a full treaty and measures to build
confidence between the longtime foes.
	   The protracted haggling over even procedural details highlighted
just how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   South Korea and its U.S. ally insisted that while troop
withdrawals can be discussed, they should not be a formal agenda
item.
	   Negotiators had originally hoped to wrap up the conference by
midday (1000 GMT) Saturday, with the full plenary conference
convened to approve details thrashed out by the delegation chiefs.
No reason was given for the delay.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after reclusive North Korea launched a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people
because of a combination of economic mismanagement, flooding and
drought.

Korean-American college president expelled from North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with North Korea saying it expelled the American
citizen

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea expelled a Korean-American
college president Saturday after accusing him of spying on the
communist country, the North's official news report said.
	   James Jin-kyong Kim, 63, president of Yanbian Engineering
College in China's northern Yanbian province, was a spy of Seoul's
main intelligence Agency for National Security Planning and
admitted his espionage activity, the Korean Central News Agency
said.
	   Seoul officials were not immediately available for comment late
Saturday.
	   Kim returned to Beijing on Saturday after being held for more
than a month in North Korea. He avoided journalists at the Beijing
airport, South Korean news media reported.
	   KCNA said Kim has worked for the South Korean spy agency since
February and visited the North several times to spy on internal
affairs and ``tried to undermine the socialist system in the
northern half of Korea and lead the people to harbor illusions
about South Korea.''
	   ``His crime deserves a legal punishment. Our organ concerned
decided, however, to leniently pardon him and expel him, both in
the light of the North Korea-U.S. relations and in view of his
being a U.S. citizen of Korean origin,'' KCNA said.
	   Kim entered North Korea in early September, along with a
Christian pastor from Seoul, for a 10-day stay. The pastor was
allowed to leave at the end of the trip but Kim was not.
	   South Korean intelligence officials had earlier said Kim was
held for political reasons.
	   South Korean news reports said Kim was held in North Korea for
questioning about whether he and his business partners had given
bribes to North Korean officials who were purged on corruption or
spy charges.
	   Kim, a South Korean-born U.S. citizen, has been active in recent
years in promoting humanitarian and educational exchanges with
North Korea. He set up Yanbian Engineering College in the late
1980s with South Korean donations.
	   Kim traveled to North Korea to discuss building a dental
hospital in Pyongyang, the capital, and an engineering college in
North Korea's free trade zone in Rajin-Sonbong, when he was
abruptly detained by North Korean authorities, South Korean
officials said.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Seeking European support for a revived
peace process, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed hope
Saturday the West Bank land-for-peace deal will lead to new talks
between Syria and Israel, which broke down two years ago.
	   Arafat arrived Saturday in the Austrian capital from Washington
after signing the West Bank agreement, negotiated after nine
grueling days of negotiations with the Israelis at Wye Plantation
in Maryland.
	   After talks here, the Palestinian leader and Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel headed for the Alpine resort of
Poertschach, where Arafat will brief European Union leaders
gathered for a summit and appeal for more financial help to
reinforce the results of the Wye accord.
	   ``It was very difficult until we were able to achieve the final
agreement,'' Arafat said of the negotiations. ``I hope the
agreement will open the door for Lebanon and Syria to achieve real
progress, real advancement, with Israel as well.''
	   Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal
agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in 1967.
	   But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government rejected that
agreement, saying it was never completed. Lebanon's peace talks
with Israel also have been suspended for more than two years
pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
	   Before departing for Poertschach, Arafat thanked European
governments for their support during the two-year freeze in the
Arab-Isreali peace process, which Wye is designed to overcome.
	   ``We are in need of Europe to help push for the peace process,''
Arafat said. He expressed confidence that the Israelis would live
up to their part of the bargain, noting that the agreement on the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron had been honored.
	   The agreement will give the Palestinians 13 percent more of
Israeli-held territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River. In
return, the Palestinians pledged steps to fight terrorism by
Islamic militants and agreed to abolish provisions in their charter
that call for abolishing the Jewish state.
	   Asked whether Palestinian radicals such as Hamas would accept
the Wye accord, Arafat replied, ``I don't know.''
	   Schuessel, whose government currently holds the rotating EU
presidency, said he was confident the Europeans would do their part
to ensure success of the agreement.
	   ``The European Union and Austria strongly support this
agreement, especially because it overcame two years of
standstill,'' Schuessel said. ``The EU will stand by and assist in
the political process and the economic process of implementing the
agreement.''
	   Schuessel said the Europeans supported the American role in
Middle East negotiations but added ``it is time the European Union
comes up with our own invitative to support peace and stability in
the region.''
	   The Europeans have long resented being frozen out by the
Americans from playing a leading role in negotiations between the
Arabs and the Israelis. The Clinton Administration vetoed two
European-backed resolutions in the U.N. Security Council last year
critical of Israel for its housing policies on the West Bank.

	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ With government troops
packing up to make way for talks with rebels, this bustling
commercial center on the muddy Caguan River has declared itself a
``laboratory of peace.''
	   Yet uncertainty surrounds the white flags of neutrality that
hang across town alongside Colombia's red-blue-and-yellow tricolor.
Business is hurting and some of the more prosperous inhabitants,
mostly ranchers, are fleeing.
	   If all goes as planned, the more than 2,000 soldiers at the 36th
Infantry Battalion's garrison will be gone soon. Then, guerrillas
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia will come to San
Vicente, the largest town in a huge expanse of steamy savannah and
rugged mountains.
	   President Andres Pastrana has ordered the army to withdraw by
Nov. 7 from an area the size of Switzerland to assure rebel
negotiators of their safety. He says the pullout will last at least
90 days.
	   It is yet unclear whether the peace talks will be held in San
Vicente, which apparently is the guerrillas' wish.
	   But no one doubts the Western Hemisphere's oldest and largest
rebel band, known by its Spanish initials FARC, will openly assert
the control it has long invisibly exercised over this southern
municipality of 45,000 people at the foot of Colombia's eastern
cordillera.
	   As Pastrana's 2-month-old government and the 34-year-old FARC
prepare for talks, the scales are tipped far in favor of the
guerrillas. At their strongest ever, the insurgents haven't lost a
battle in nearly a decade and hold at least 248 bargaining chips _
soldiers and police officers captured over the past year.
	   Pastrana held a secret jungle rendezvous with the FARC's
commander, Manuel Marulanda, in July to show his commitment to
ending a civil conflict rooted in socialist demands but now pursued
by guerrillas who act more like capitalists.
	   In a speech Thursday, Pastrana said the rendezvous created
conditions for ``a powerful alliance (with the rebels) against the
crime of drug trafficking, terrorism, privilege, corruption, human
rights abuses and disrespect for the environment.''
	   Many Colombians are skeptical about the motives of the FARC,
which has about 15,000 guerrillas.
	   In none of its internal documents does the movement talk of
peace, said Eduardo Pizarro, a political scientist in Bogota, the
capital. ``But the FARC loves to negotiate because it gives them
political visibility, a national presence, television.''
	   The talks will be an international spectacle, and a bitter pill
for Colombia's demoralized military.
	   Critics say the government is making a big, and risky,
concession by withdrawing troops. They worry the rebels will take
advantage to expand their military stronghold in the country's
south and increase their take from drug traffickers, who pay the
rebels for protection.
	   The municipality of San Vicente has 20 square miles (51 square
kilometers) of coca crops, the government says, and it borders
regions that are home to most of Colombia's cocaine production.
	   Doing legitimate business in San Vicente is already becoming
difficult. The local farmers' credit union has gone bankrupt and
it's not yet clear whether banks will shut their doors.
	   Commerce has fallen 60 percent since the army pullout was
announced and worried ranchers have trucked out 70,000 of the
district's 500,000 head of cattle, said Lt. Col. Fernando Cabrera,
the 36th Battalion commander,
	   He said 40 families had left town in defiance of a rebel order
to remain.
	   There is no evidence of an exodus, however. For many people, the
fear is not of the FARC but of right-wing paramilitary death squads
they think could come calling after the peace talks end, looking
for alleged guerrilla sympathizers.
	   For most people, the army pullout won't change life much.
	   In the San Vicente district's more than 200 settlements along
the winding Caguan and tucked into surrounding hills, there is only
one real government _ the FARC. To the east, in the four other
municipalities being left by the army, it's pretty much the same.
	   Many in the region think the FARC wants a semiautonomous state.
	   Marulanda, the 68-year-old rebel leader who has been fighting
for four decades, has so far not specified any demands other than
the release of 452 jailed rebels in return for his captives. In a
Sept. 30 letter to Pastrana, he also insisted ``that no (state)
authority but the mayors'' be allowed in the withdrawal zone.
	   In the small town of Pinalito on the eastern limit of the zone,
the boss is a diminutive FARC commander who goes by the name
Alberto.
	   Alberto is sure the pending peace talks will not end with a
guerrilla demobilization.
	   ``Our goal is to take power,'' he told a reporter. ``We will
never hand over our arms and we will form an army, the army of the
people.''

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria slams it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Saturday hailed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a cornerstone for lasting peace
but in neighboring Syria the official media ridiculed it as a
Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap.
	   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval.
	   The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be called a
``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, said.
``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said.
	   ``All Palestinian rights have been swallowed and canceled from
the political dictionary,'' the paper said, adding that the
agreement favored the Israelis heavily.
	   The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap
for the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli
threats.''
	   Syria is technically at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made
no progress during the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
been in office.
	   But Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were
reflected in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
Jordan is only the Arab nation besides Egypt to have signed a peace
treaty with Israel.
	   Tarawneh said Friday's agreement ``puts the peace process back
on track and opens the door for negotiations on a permanent
settlement.''
	   Under the peace deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from
additional West Bank land in exchange for security guarantees.
	   Tarawneh said Jordan ``looks forward to implementing this
agreement in good will and the interest of all.''
	   King Hussein of Jordan is Israel's closest Arab ally and had
made an emotional appeal for peace during the negotiations, which
he joined on two occasions, taking a break from his cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic.
	   Despite the government optimism, Jordan's independent newspapers
reacted cautiously, saying Israeli deeds and not words were needed
will provide a lasting peace.
	   ``The bet is on its implementation and not allowing any of the
two sides to invent obstacles and problems to dodge away from'' the
deal, said the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper.
	   The caution was shared by Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction so long that it will lead
to an Israeli withdrawal from Arab Palestinian territories,''
Moussa told reporters in Jordan where he arrived Saturday for a
three-day visit.
	   ``But what is crucial is for the peace process to move forward
through the true implementation of the deal,'' he said.
	   A successful implementation of the deal could resolve the Syrian
deadlock as well as the problem with Lebanon where Israel occupies
part of the southern land, Moussa said.
	   Asked whether Israel can be trusted, he said: ``Let's wait and
see. Everything depends on the implementation. It's not a question
of a document signed, but the true implementation of the
agreement.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 37 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 21 of the victors are hard-liners and at least five are
moderates. It was not clear to which camps the rest belonged to.
	   The committee said the 37 victors represent 18 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 49 remaining seats
in 10 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   Incomplete counting in Tehran showed that former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, a moderate, was leading with 574,492 votes.
Behind him is hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the
Assembly of Experts, with 444,959 votes.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired water cannons
filled with stinging pepper spray Saturday at several thousand
people gathered for an anti-government protest in the capital.
	   After warning women and children to get off the streets, the
huge water trucks lumbered into a busy downtown shopping district
and began spraying people who had lined the streets.
	   Thousands of people fled, crying and coughing from the spray
that covered the streets in a blue foam.
	   Plainclothes police, some wearing ski masks, chased people
through department stores and down side streets, nabbing them and
tossing them into waiting vans.
	   Some were slapped and kicked and muscled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store
after she shouted at them that they were cruel.
	   A policewoman carried the woman's eggs and vegetables as police
pulled her into the street and her husband demanded, ``Are you
trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect curtain fabric,'' said
one woman who was afraid to give her name, her young daughter
clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes. ``If they continue
to send these chemicals into the air, everybody's going to be dead
soon.''
	   Dozens of stores and Sogo, a Japanese department store, shut
their doors and rolled down their metal shutters.
	   By nightfall, the water cannons had surrounded a nearby mosque
as many prayed inside. Police apparently were waiting to see if
demonstrators had fled to the Muslim house of worship and intended
to gather when prayers ended.
	   The anti-government demonstration, which never truly got under
way, is one in a series of protests since ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct.
	   So far, authorities have detained about 275 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   This week, police warned that those who join anti-government
protests could face arrest under the country's dreaded Internal
Security Act, which allows for indefinite detainment without trial.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance with a black
eye and a neck brace, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.
	   He has condemned the charges as trumped up by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad because of his growing challenge to the leader's
17-year rule.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A breakthrough Middle East agreement, mediated
by President Bill Clinton over nine tortuous days in the seclusion
of a Chesapeake Bay retreat, opens the way for Israel and the
Palestinians to enter the home stretch of even tougher negotiations
for a permanent peace. ``This agreement is designed to rebuild
trust and a new hope for peace between the parties,'' Clinton said
Friday at a White House ceremony to sign the accord. ``Now both
sides must build on that hope, carry out their commitments, begin
the difficult but urgent journey toward a permanent settlement.''
The land-for-peace agreement is known as the ``Wye River
Memorandum,'' for the Wye River Conference Center on Maryland's
Eastern Shore where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat encamped for nine days with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. They were joined on all but
two days by Clinton and, on two occasions, by the ailing King
Hussein of Jordan. (US-MIDEAST)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president. The Serbian-led Yugoslav
government insists that it is abiding by terms of the Oct. 12
agreement to defuse the crisis and blames continued, scattered
clashes on ethnic Albanian rebels. In a statement published
Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore, the
rebels said they would take no ``offensive action'' against
government forces which are leaving the province under terms of the
agreement. ``But any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages
or our positions will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the
rebels said. Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military
commander, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were expected in Belgrade
on Saturday afternoon to seek more pullbacks of police units and
equipment from the separatist province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's economic sickness has infected Russia's
far-flung regions, more than half of which have defaulted on
domestic bonds, a newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, meanwhile, said the government doesn't expect a drop in
tax revenues this month, despite chronic tax collection problems
and the worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
Russia's securities market boomed in recent years, but the country
began suffering from Asia's economic troubles this year and
admitted Aug. 17 that it couldn't pay off its treasury bill
obligations. Investors fled and markets collapsed. Seventy-one of
Russia's 89 regions had joined in the securities excitement,
issuing 20 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion) in domestic bonds.
Fifty regions have already missed payments on some or all of them,
the English-language Moscow Times reported Saturday. Most of the
bonds are held by Russian banks and brokerages. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward
southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction
on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes. Philippines
President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes and three other other
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. He was expected to add more
provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage was
determined. Officials in calamity zones will be able to use
emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities with little red
tape. Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China,
packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160
kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said. (PACIFIC TYPHOON)

EU leaders welcome 2 newcomers at summit on EU future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder arrival comment; TRIMS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union leaders opened a
summit Saturday welcoming two newcomers _ German Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ to
two days of brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week succeeding Helmut Kohl, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in
this week, gives the line-up of the West European leaders a
stronger leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two are coalitions with socialists and only in
Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   On arrival, Schroeder said ``his participation at the summit
would be low key'' for he is not yet German chancellor. He was to
return home later Saturday.
	   In a last-minute change to the agenda, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was to brief the Europeans on a West Bank land-for-peace
accord during a stopover on his way back from talks in the United
States.
	   He met Saturday morning in Vienna with EU Middle East envoy,
Miguel Martinos, and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
and would see the EU leaders at 1300GMT at a hotel in this southern
Austrian alpine resort.
	   The EU is the biggest single aid donor to the Palestinians,
having spent some half a billion dollars on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since 1993.
	   The line-up at the top of the EU governments may have changed
with the emergence of Schroeder and D'Alema, some old problems must
still be resolved.
	   The leaders must debate ways of maintaining Europe's economic
recovery, tackle high unemployment and say how they plan to
implement painful agricultural, budget and decision-making reforms
needed if the EU is to take in half-a-dozen newcomers in the years
ahead.
	   The EU will launch a single currency in January _ after years of
debate and the leaders will be urged not to let the euro be the end
of the line.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the EU journey,'' Austrian
Chancellor and summit chairman Viktor Klima said ahead of the
summit.
	   Forecasts issued this week showed the financial turmoil sweeping
Asia, Russia and Latin America will drag EU growth down to 2.4
percent in 1999, from a previously predicted 3 percent.
	   That outlook and the emergence of more leftist leaders is
creating pressure for a more hands-on approach to boost growth
through more public investment or cutting interest rates.
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said here he favored
lower interest rates and other ``polices to relaunch the economy
and employment at a global level.''
	   Schroeder and other euro-Socialists have also indicated rates
should be lower, but central bank governors have resisted that
arguing rates in key EU economies such as France and Germany are
already among the world's lowest.
	   The EU leaders will also hear British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's views on a common European defense policy. Blair said this
week he may be prepared to drop the long-standing opposition of his
Conservative predecessors to giving the EU a military capability
within the NATO alliance.
	   His spokesman Alistair Campbell explained Blair wanted European
countries to be able to mount peacekeeping or combat operations to
deal with crises like Bosnia or Kosovo.
	   ``Poertschach provides an excellent opportunity to relaunch the
debate on the future of the Union,'' said EU Commission President
Jacques Santer, in a letter to the leaders. ``Europe must rid
itself of its cliched image of an economic giant but political
dwarf.''

	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Norway's Andrine Flemmen edged Olympic
champion Deborah Compagnoni for the lead Saturday in the first leg
of a women's World Cup giant slalom.
	   Flemmen twisted her way down the 368 meter (1,207 foot)
Rettenback course to take the lead with a time of 1:06.72.
	   Defending World Cup giant slalom champion Compagnoni, the first
skier out of the start hut, finished .25 adrift, crossing in
1:06.97.
	   Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer clocked the third fastest time
of 1:07.01, followed by France's Leila Piccard, fourth in 1:07.38.
	   Sweden's Anna Ottosson sat fifth, .95 back, while Germany's
Martina Ertl crossed sixth in 1:07.92.
	   Pernilla Wiberg, winner of the overall title in 1997, did not
start.
	   Another notable absentee in the start of the season's races was
last year's overall World Cup champion Katja Seizinger.
	   The German skier, a three-time Olympic gold medallist, injured
both knees in summer training and will likely be out for the best
part of the season.

Illegal immigrants stranded after Balkans pilot refuses to fly

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Nine Nigerians whom Cyprus wants to
deport as illegal immigrants were stranded at Larnaca airport
Saturday after a Balkans Airline pilot refused to fly them to
Bulgaria.
	   Hours earlier, the decision to deport the nine set off rioting
among other Nigerians held as illegal immigrants in this southern
resort. Two Nigerians and a policeman were hospitalized with
breathing problems after police used tear gas to break up the riot.
	   The Nigerians were rescued by Cyprus last June when a Syrian
trawler they were aboard broke down and drifted for nine days in
the Mediterranean. The passengers had paid thousands of dollars for
the Syrian ship to smuggle them into Greece or Italy.
	   The nine Nigerians being deported had been scheduled to leave
for the Bulgarian capital Sofia at 7 a.m. (0500gmt) and then fly on
to their homeland. But the plane took off without them.
	   The captain of the Balkans airliner, the Bulgarian carrier, said
he would not fly the Nigerians unless they were accompanied by
guards, a Larnaca police official said.
	   The official, speaking under customary rules of anonymity, added
it was a police duty to accompany deportees. Authorities are now
looking for another way to transport the Nigerians to their
homeland.
	   The government already has deported some of the passengers
rescued from the Syrian trawler. The immigrants held in Larnaca are
thought to number 30 to 50.
	   More than 110 Africans and Middle Easterners had been aboard the
trawler. Two passengers died from thirst during the journey, and
their bodies were thrown overboard.

Rwandan genocide convict goes on hunger strike in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The former Rwandan mayor convicted of
genocide has gone on a hunger strike at the United Nations
detention facility while another suspect has been transferred from
Namibia to Tanzania.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, who is waiting appeal, went on strike
Thursday reportedly to protest the denial of an attorney of his
choice by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the
Hirondelle independent press agency said Saturday.
	   ``He is taking no solid foods and no liquids, but he is smoking
a lot,'' said the agency, quoting a source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Akayesu, a former mayor of Taba, was sentenced earlier this
month to life in prison for his role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide
orchestrated by the Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994 when Tutsi-dominated
rebels defeated government forces.
	   Akayesu fired his defense attorneys prior to his sentencing
hearing and spoke in his own defense. Since then, Akayesu has
indicated his desire to be represented by a Canadian, John Philpot,
but tribunal officials say the lawyer lacks the required
credentials.
	   Meanwhile, the tribunal announced late Friday that Andre
Rwamakuba, who was arrested in Namibia Oct. 21, has been
transferred to the detention facility in Arusha, the court's seat.
	   Rwamukaba's transfer brings to 32 the number of genocide
suspects held in Arusha.
	   A delegation of Rwandan legislators visited the tribunal Monday
to Friday and attended the closing arguments in the joint trial of
Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana.
	   Tribunal President Laity Kama assured the Rwandans the court
will pursue genocide perpetrators and ensure justice is done.
	   ``We are determined to continue pursuing vigorously our mandate
of rendering justice for the Rwandan genocide,'' Kama said,
according to a tribunal statement.

Chirac salutes Clinton for new accord, pledges support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday saluted
U.S. President Bill Clinton for spearheading the effort that
brought about a new Middle East peace agreement, and he offered his
support.
	   ``I wish to pay strong tribute to your personal commitment and
tenacity of the American government'' that brought about the
accord, Chirac wrote in a letter Clinton, a day after the agreement
was signed in Washington.
	   ``Your determination to make hope prevail over resignation
renewed the dialogue in favor of a just and durable peace,'' he
said, noting the nine days of marathon talks between Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   France ``wishes that it be the foundation of a restored climate
of confidence and a new elan,'' he said. With its European
partners, France ``will lend all her support to the necessary
dynamic of the peace process.''

Illegal immigrants stranded after Balkans pilot refuses to fly them

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Nine Nigerians whom Cyprus wants to
deport as illegal immigrants were stranded at Larnaca airport
Saturday after a Balkans Airline pilot refused to fly them to
Bulgaria.
	   Hours earlier, the decision to deport the nine set off rioting
among other Nigerians held as illegal immigrants in this southern
resort. Two Nigerians and a policeman were hospitalized with
breathing problems after police used tear gas to break up the riot.
	   The Nigerians were rescued by Cyprus last June when a Syrian
trawler they were aboard broke down and drifted for nine days in
the Mediterranean. The passengers had paid thousands of dollars for
the Syrian ship to smuggle them into Greece or Italy.
	   The nine Nigerians being deported had been scheduled to leave
for the Bulgarian capital Sofia at 7 a.m. (0500gmt) and then fly on
to their homeland. But the plane took off without them.
	   The captain of the Balkans airliner, the Bulgarian carrier, said
he would not fly the Nigerians unless they were accompanied by
guards, a Larnaca police official said.
	   The official, speaking under customary rules of anonymity, added
it was a not police duty to accompany deportees. Authorities are
now looking for another way to transport the Nigerians to their
homeland.
	   The government already has deported some of the passengers
rescued from the Syrian trawler. The immigrants held in Larnaca are
thought to number 30 to 50.
	   More than 110 Africans and Middle Easterners had been aboard the
trawler. Two passengers died from thirst during the journey, and
their bodies were thrown overboard.

Women entrepreneurs say governments should foster competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Women entrepreneurs from across the
continent have called on African governments to foster competition
by encouraging free markets and avoiding subsidies.
	   At the end of a four-day conference Friday, the African
Federation of Women Entrepreneurs delivered what it called the ``12
commandments'' African governments should follow to foster private
sector growth.
	   But some participants said they were not happy with the final
recommendations which they said did not reflect the specific and
practical proposals made at the forum.
	   The dissatisfied participants said federation officials simply
listed five pages of general principles and recommendations.
	   The critics complained that the recommendations did not define
issues such as the role of businesswomen, their national
associations or African governments in such critical areas as
poverty reduction through job creation, the provision of credit
facilities and acquisition of technology, all of which were
discussed at length.
	   The next forum will be held in Washington, D.C. in 2000, hosted
by the National Association of Negro Business and Professional
Women's Clubs.
	   The first forum was held in 1996 in Accra, Ghana.

Singapore and South African airlines to form wide-ranging alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The flagship airlines of Singapore and South
Africa will form a strategic alliance in passengers services,
shared marketing and coordination of routes and schedules, the two
carriers said Saturday.
	   The partnership between Singapore Airlines and South African
Airways, confirmed in a memorandum of understanding signed
Wednesday, will take effect April 1, 1999, a joint statement said.
	   The alliance will ``provide passengers of both carriers with a
wide range of improved benefits and seamless travel.'' It will also
offer more efficient connections for travel, it said.
	   The two airlines will work together on joint marketing
activities and coordinated routes, scheduling and frequent flyer
programs. They will also consider combining personnel training and
development.
	   Although hurt by the economic crisis, and reeling from a 24
percent drop in interim net profit, Singapore Airlines has remained
Asia's most successful airline and has sought to invest in and form
partnerships with other carriers.
	   It has recently secured alliances and other deals with
Lufthansa, Taiwan's China Airlines, and Scandinavian Airline
System, and said last month it was considering buying stakes in
Thai Airways International and South African Airways.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Norway's Andrine Flemmen kicked off the
season with a career first victory Saturday in the giant slalom,
marking the first time in World Cup history that a Norwegian woman
has won the event.
	   The Norwegian, first after the initial run, preserved her lead
to finish with a two-run aggregate time of 2 minutes, 15.05
seconds, edging Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer and Olympic
champion Deborah Compagnoni.
	   Delighting the home fans lining the glittery 368 meter (1,207
foot) course, Meissnitzer recorded the fastest second run to finish
runnerup with a combined time of 2:15.31, ahead of the Italian
star.
	   Compagnoni, second after the opening leg, slipped to third with
a time of 2:15.62.
	   Leila Piccard of France was fourth in 1:07.38, followed by
Switzerland's Sonja Nef, who recorded identical times in both runs
to finish fifth, 1.35 adrift.
	   Last year's World Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl
finished back in 10th, trailing Flemmen by more than 2.5 seconds.
	   Flemmen began last season with just as much promise, finishing
third in Park City, her only other podium finish.
	   But despite consistent results which led to a fifth place in
last year's World Cup standings, the Norwegian skier seemed unable
to repeat her Park City performance, the podium eluding her for the
remainder of the season.
	   Corinne Rey Bellet of Switzerland finished sixth in 2:17.06,
while Sweden's Anna Ottosson finished seventh, 2.23 back.

Lawyer explains Spanish case for trying Pinochet on genocide
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ If Augusto Pinochet stands trial someday in
Spain, the prosecution will try to prove the former dictator sought
to destroy a segment of the Chilean population, a lawyer close to
the case said.
	   ``This is known in legal terms as self-genocide,'' said Joan
Garces, comparing the Chilean case to the Pol Pot bloodbath of
Cambodians.
	   Garces, who spoke to reporters earlier this week, has worked
closely with Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who sought Pinochet's
detention in London on Oct. 16 as a preliminary step toward his
extradition to face trial in Spain for genocide and terrorism.
	   He said that although citizens from Spain, Britain, the United
States, Austria, France, Switzerland and Argentina were among the
victims, most were Chileans.
	   Garces, once a close advisor to socialist President Salvador
Allende, who died when Pinochet and other military officers staged
a violent coup in 1973, now represents the relatives of victims of
the 17-year Pinochet dictatorship.
	   Judge Garzon will be able to draw on evidence showing that
around 4,000 people were abducted, tortured, murdered or
disappeared during the general's authoritarian rule, Garces said.
	   Garzon's detention warrant cites 94 cases of people being killed
or disappearing in Argentina in seizures carried out by the
Pinochet regime aided by Argentine cohorts between 1976-83.
	   They were victims of Operation Condor, a campaign by South
American military juntas to wipe out political opponents.
	   Garces said the judge may broaden his case soon to include
reference to Pinochet's victims in Chile, strengthening the
genocide allegation that the dictator sought to crush the leaders
of more than half the Chilean population.
	   The lawyer said he was confident that the Spanish attempt to
extradite Pinochet would survive appeals filed by the head
prosecutor of the National Court, Eduardo Fungarino.
	   The court deals with national security issues such as terrorism
and genocide, but Fungarino has argued that Spanish courts have no
business delving into Chilean crimes.
	   ``Fungarino has been acting like a kind of personal lawyer for
Pinochet,'' Garces said, insisting that Spanish law gives a
``crystal clear'' mandate to Spanish magistrates to pursue the
perpetrators of genocide no matter where it happens.
	   The National Court is expected to rule Thursday on the
jurisdiction issue.
	   Garces said he hopes the United States will bolster the Spanish
case by making available classified information from the Pinochet
period.
	   Although the United States helped Pinochet seize power and
consolidate his regime in order to crush Allende's socialist
government, Garces refuses to discuss the political backdrop to the
killing in Chile.
	   ``Chilean politics and United States foreign policy at the time
are irrelevant to this case, which is strictly about criminal
responsibility,'' Garces said, adding that the case referred to
crimes against humanity rather than ideological struggles.
	   ``Murder is murder is murder and we are not interested in what
the motive behind the murder was,'' he added.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Seeking European support for a revived
peace process, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed hope
Saturday the West Bank land-for-peace deal will lead to new talks
between Syria and Israel, which broke down two years ago.
	   Arafat arrived Saturday in the Austrian capital from Washington
after signing the West Bank agreement, negotiated after nine
grueling days of negotiations with the Israelis at Wye Plantation
in Maryland.
	   After talks here, the Palestinian leader and Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel headed for the Alpine resort of
Poertschach, where Arafat will brief European Union leaders
gathered for a summit and appeal for more financial help to
reinforce the results of the Wye accord.
	   ``It was very difficult until we were able to achieve the final
agreement,'' Arafat said of the negotiations. ``I hope the
agreement will open the door for Lebanon and Syria to achieve real
progress, real advancement, with Israel as well.''
	   Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal
agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in 1967.
	   But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government rejected that
agreement, saying it was never completed. Lebanon's peace talks
with Israel also have been suspended for more than two years
pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
	   Before departing for Poertschach, Arafat thanked European
governments for their support during the two-year freeze in the
Arab-Israeli peace process, which Wye was designed to overcome.
	   He expressed confidence that the Israelis would live up to their
part of the bargain, noting that the agreement on the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from Hebron had been honored.
	   The agreement will give the Palestinians 13 percent more of
Israeli-held territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River. In
return, the Palestinians pledged steps to fight terrorism by
Islamic militants and agreed to abolish provisions in their charter
that call for abolishing the Jewish state.
	   Asked whether Palestinian radicals such as Hamas would accept
the Wye accord, Arafat replied, ``I don't know.''

Hostage taking ends in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with details of prisoners demands, agreement with
officials, second prisoner attempting suicide &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Political prisoners, holding prison
officials hostage in five prisons throughout Turkey in a bid to
improve jail conditions, put an end to their nationwide protest,
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Saturday.
	   Prisoners had held some 50 officials total hostage Friday in
what appeared to be a concerted protest.
	   Human rights activists who took part in negotiating the release
of prison officers confirmed that all had been released.
	   Five security officers were injured during the hostage- takings,
reports said. None was reported in life-threatening conditions.
	   The most important action came in Istanbul's Umraniye prison
Throughout the night, lawyers, human rights activists and
paramilitary police negotiated with the hostage takers, Anatolia
said.
	   Lawyers told Anatolia that the prisoners demanded a general
improvement of jail conditions, an end to prison transfers, and
that convicts held in isolated cells be allowed to return to their
wards.
	   Prisoners also demanded an end to attacks by prison officials on
inmates, and that all prisoners allegedly injured in recent prison
riots be given medical treatment, Ibis Varol of the Human Rights
Association said.
	   The justice ministry accepted all the demands, Varol said.
Confirmation from the ministry was not immediately available.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.
	   Also Saturday, two inmates in two separate prisons set
themselves afire and were hospitalized in severe condition,
Anatolia reported. Five prisoners have died by burning themselves
in a protest against the government's crackdown on Kurdish rebels
this week.
	   Some 37,000 people have died since the Kurdish insurgency for
autonomy began in 1984.
	   In April, leftist prisoners in seven jails around the country
took more than 50 guards hostage for two days also to protest
prison transfers.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore denied Saturday that its air force
had intruded into Malaysian airspace after its northern neighbor
accused it of six such recent violations.
	   ``Investigations found the claims to be without basis,'' said a
statement issued by Singapore's defense ministry.
	   But the Malaysian government stood firm by its charges that the
Singapore aircraft intruded into Malaysian airspace on several
occasions since Sept. 18, the official Bernama news agency
reported.
	   ``As far as the Defense Ministry is concerned, we have made our
statement and we stay by what we said,'' Malaysian Minister Syed
Hamid Albar was quoted as saying Saturday in the capital of Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Ties between the two Southeast Asian countries have deteriorated
in recent months.
	   Malaysia revoked a longstanding agreement last month that had
allowed Singapore military planes to enter its airspace without
specific prior approval for transit or search and rescue
operations.
	   Singapore had pledged to abide by the decision. But almost
immediately, Malaysia began accusing Singapore of violations.
	   After repeatedly denying these allegations and requesting
details of the intrusions, Singapore received a note from Malaysia
a week ago outlining the six suspected incidents.
	   According to Singapore's defense ministry, three of the alleged
intrusions took place when no Singapore air force planes were
airborne, and two involved other aircraft altogether.
	   In the last case, Singapore said its air force planes ``did not
overfly or circle over the Malaysian Navy Recruit Training Center
as alleged.''
	   The ministry statement also questioned Malaysia's refusal to
take up an offer from Singapore to engage in talks to resolve the
matter.

Zimbabwe workers riot for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ For the second day, city employees
demonstrated over nonpayment of their wages on Saturday as
paramilitary riot squads watched.
	   Two thousand workers overturned cars, trashed downtown streets
and burnt garbage outside the offices of Mayor Solomon Tawengwa.
	   After a bypassing car was overturned in the city's main
intersection, police cordoned off streets, causing major traffic
disruption. Police protected city offices from attack by the
workers.
	   There were no injuries.
	   In a rare act of defiance on Friday, demonstrators tore down and
burned a Zimbabwean flag.
	   The rioting followed an announcement on Thursday by the mayor
that the city had run out of money to pay wages.
	   The unrest emphasized the deterioration of services over past
months in the capital of this southern African nation.
	   The city had run relatively efficiently after the transition
from the white minority-dominated state of Rhodesia to Zimbabwe in
1980. But in recent weeks, the city government has been forced to
shut down water supplies after failing to pay for pump maintenance
services.
	   Earlier this year, strikes and riots were widespread in Zimbabwe
where financial instability has sent the currency plummeting.
Critics link worsening local services to corruption in the national
government, which appoints all local officials.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 37 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 21 of the victors are hard-liners and at least five are
moderates.
	   The committee said the 37 victors represent 18 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 49 remaining seats
in 10 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   Incomplete counting in Tehran showed that former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, a moderate, was leading with 574,492 votes.
Behind him is hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the
Assembly of Experts, with 444,959 votes.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Norway's Andrine Flemmen kicked off the
season with a career first victory Saturday in the giant slalom,
marking the first time in World Cup history a Norwegian woman has
won the event.
	   Flemmen, first after the initial run, preserved her lead to
finish with a two-run aggregate time of 2 minutes, 15.05 seconds,
edging Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer and Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni.
	   Delighting the home fans lining the glittery 368 meter (1,207
foot) course, Meissnitzer recorded the fastest second run to finish
runner-up with a combined time of 2:15.31, ahead of the Italian
star.
	   Compagnoni, second after the opening leg, slipped to third with
a time of 2:15.62.
	   Leila Piccard of France was fourth in 2:16.32, followed by
Switzerland's Sonja Nef, who recorded identical times in both runs
to finish fifth in 2:16.40.
	   Last year's World Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl
finished in 10th, trailing Flemmen by more than 2.5 seconds.
	   Flemmen began last season with just as much promise, finishing
third in Park City, her only other podium finish.
	   But despite consistent results which led to a fifth place in
last year's World Cup standings, the Norwegian skier seemed unable
to repeat her Park City performance and did not mount the podium
for the remainder of the season.
	   Corinne Rey Bellet of Switzerland finished sixth in 2:17.06,
while Sweden's Anna Ottosson finished seventh, 2.23 back.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired water cannons
filled with stinging pepper spray Saturday at several thousand
people gathered for an anti-government protest in the capital.
	   After warning women and children to get off the streets, the
huge water trucks lumbered into a busy downtown shopping district
and began spraying people who had lined the streets.
	   Thousands of people fled, crying and coughing from the spray
that covered the streets in a blue foam.
	   Plainclothes police, some wearing ski masks, chased people
through department stores and down side streets, nabbing them and
tossing them into waiting vans.
	   Some were slapped and kicked and muscled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store
after she shouted at them that they were cruel.
	   A policewoman carried the woman's eggs and vegetables as police
pulled her into the street and her husband demanded, ``Are you
trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect curtain fabric,'' said
one woman who was afraid to give her name, her young daughter
clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes. ``If they continue
to send these chemicals into the air, everybody's going to be dead
soon.''
	   Dozens of stores and Sogo, a Japanese department store, shut
their doors and rolled down their metal shutters.
	   After nightfall, riot police lobbed tear gas and water cannons
at about 200 men as they came out of a nearby mosque unfurling
anti-government banners and placards.
	   Some 400 riot and plain-clothed police guarded the capital's
Freedom Square to ward off any gathering there.
	   The anti-government demonstration is the latest in a series of
protests since ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was
jailed last month.
	   Police have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of
Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual
misconduct.
	   So far, authorities have detained about 275 people who have
attended anti-government rallies, releasing them on bail pending
trial.
	   This week, police warned that those who join anti-government
protests could face arrest under the country's dreaded Internal
Security Act, which allows for indefinite detainment without trial.
	   Anwar, who showed up at his first court appearance with a black
eye and a neck brace, faces trial Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.
	   He has condemned the charges as trumped up by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad because of his growing challenge to the leader's
17-year rule.

Rwandan genocide convict goes on hunger strike in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to indicate source and day &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The former Rwandan mayor convicted of
genocide has gone on a hunger strike at the United Nations
detention facility in Tanzania, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, who is waiting appeal, went on strike
Thursday reportedly to protest the denial of an attorney of his
choice by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the
Hirondelle independent press agency said.
	   ``He is taking no solid foods and no liquids, but he is smoking
a lot,'' said the agency, quoting a source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Akayesu, a former mayor of Taba, was sentenced earlier this
month to life in prison for his role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide
orchestrated by the Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994 when Tutsi-dominated
rebels defeated government forces.
	   Akayesu fired his defense attorneys prior to his sentencing
hearing and spoke in his own defense. Since then, Akayesu has
indicated his desire to be represented by a Canadian, John Philpot,
but tribunal officials say the lawyer lacks the required
credentials.
	   Meanwhile, the tribunal announced late Friday that Andre
Rwamakuba, who was arrested in Namibia Oct. 21, has been
transferred to the detention facility in Arusha, the court's seat.
	   Rwamukaba's transfer brings to 32 the number of genocide
suspects held in Arusha.
	   A delegation of Rwandan legislators visited the tribunal Monday
to Friday and attended the closing arguments in the joint trial of
Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana.
	   Tribunal President Laity Kama assured the Rwandans the court
will pursue genocide perpetrators and ensure justice is done.
	   ``We are determined to continue pursuing vigorously our mandate
of rendering justice for the Rwandan genocide,'' Kama said,
according to a tribunal statement.

Unknown assailants threaten Ukraine's deputy coal minister in his
</HEADLINE>
office &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Several people threatened a Ukrainian
deputy coal minister in his office, trying to force him to revoke
an order to fire a coal mine director, a top government official
said Saturday.
	   The unidentified men entered the deputy minister's office in the
Coal Ministry building in downtown Kiev on Friday and threatened
him and his family, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy
Holubchenko told the Interfax news agency.
	   ``They entered his room, pushed out the receptionist, and while
two of them stayed at the reception desk, the rest warned the
deputy minister that he would have to take care of his family if
the mine director is fired,'' Holubchenko said.
	   He declined to give the name of the official or the mine
director the Coal Ministry wanted to fire. There are six deputy
coal ministers.
	   Holubchenko said he had told Coal Minister Serhiy Tulub earlier
in the day to fire the mine director despite Friday's incident,
according to Interfax.
	   The alleged attempt to intimidate the Coal Ministry official
followed several months of tense fighting between the government
and dozens of coal mine directors in eastern Ukraine over payment
of overdue wages to coal miners.
	   The Cabinet has threatened to fire many of the mine directors,
accusing them of misappropriating the funds the Coal Ministry said
were channeled for payment of back wages.
	   The mine directors, however, insisted they still had no money to
pay the salaries.
	   Miners' strikes over delayed salaries paralyzed many coal
enterprises in the country's east this spring and summer.
	   The cash-strapped government has recently paid some of more than
2 billion hryvna (dlrs 584 million) in overdue wages to miners, but
tensions still remain high in Ukraine's coal-mining Donbas region.

Strong earthquake jolts remote area in eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with another quake in Irian Jaya &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake was reported
Saturday on Iriyan Jaya in Indonesia, following an earlier quake
that shook a remote eastern island.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from
either quake.
	   The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the earlier
earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1, struck the island
of Ternate in northern Maluku at 6:18 p.m. (1118 GMT) Friday.
	   The quake's epicenter was in the Maluku Sea, 98 kilometers (61
miles) northwest of Ternate, about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, the agency said.
	   Another quake of 4.5 magnitude jolted Irian Jaya capital of
Jayapura and its surrounding areas Saturday about 4:50 p.m. (0750
GMT), about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas near the epicenter.
	   Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the
Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcano and earthquake zones
that stretches from Mexico to New Zealand.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union leaders opened a
summit Saturday welcoming two newcomers _ German Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema _ to
two days of brainstorming about where the EU is going.
	   The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes office next
week succeeding Helmut Kohl, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in
this week, gives the lineup of the West European leaders a stronger
leftist tint.
	   Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or
center-left leaders, two are coalitions with socialists and only in
Ireland and Spain are conservatives in power.
	   On arrival, Schroeder said ``his participation at the summit
would be low key'' for he is not yet German chancellor. He was to
return home later Saturday.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrillas in southeast Lebanon

time difference in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired at least two
air-to-surface missiles at suspected guerrilla infiltration trails
in occupied southeastern Lebanon Saturday, security officials said.
	   Two fighter jets targeted an area in a valley near the village
of Qillaya, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 10:20 a.m.
(0720GMT) attack on the area, about 20 kilometers (13 miles)
southwest of Rashaya in the southern Bekaa Valley and about the
same distance from the Israeli border.
	   Rashaya is about seven kilometers (four miles) north of the
border enclave Israel has occupied in the south since 1985.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the air raid. An army
statement said Israeli warplanes returned safely to their bases
after hitting their targets.

Strong earthquake jolts remote area in eastern Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake was reported
Saturday on Irian Jaya in Indonesia, following an earlier quake
that shook a remote eastern island.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from
either quake.
	   The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the earlier
earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1, struck the island
of Ternate in northern Maluku at 6:18 p.m. (1118 GMT) Friday.
	   The quake's epicenter was in the Maluku Sea, 98 kilometers (61
miles) northwest of Ternate, about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, the agency said.
	   Another quake of 4.5 magnitude jolted the Irian Jaya capital of
Jayapura and its surrounding areas, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300
miles) east of Jakarta, about 4:50 p.m. (0750 GMT) Saturday, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas near the epicenter.
	   Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the
Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcano and earthquake zones
that stretches from Mexico to New Zealand.

Rwandan genocide convict goes on hunger strike in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The former Rwandan mayor convicted of
genocide has gone on a hunger strike at the United Nations
detention facility in Tanzania, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, who is waiting appeal, went on strike
Thursday reportedly to protest the denial of an attorney of his
choice by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the
Hirondelle independent press agency said.
	   ``He is taking no solid foods and no liquids, but he is smoking
a lot,'' said the agency, quoting a source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Akayesu, a former mayor of Taba, was sentenced earlier this
month to life in prison for his role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide
orchestrated by the Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when Tutsi-dominated rebels defeated government forces.
	   Akayesu fired his defense attorneys prior to his sentencing
hearing and spoke in his own defense. Since then, Akayesu has
indicated his desire to be represented by a Canadian, John Philpot,
but tribunal officials say the lawyer lacks the required
credentials.

Qatar takes first step for holding historic elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JABER AL-HARMI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar's Interior Ministry on Saturday started
finalizing a list of eligible voters for the country's first
elections, scheduled to be held in February.
	   The list will be drawn from the 17,417 people who registered
with the government during the past three weeks. They include 6,723
women and 10,694 men above 18 years of age, Interior Ministry
spokesman Lt. Col. Rashed al-Ateeq said.
	   A final list will be released Tuesday and election candidates
will be asked to file nominations in December, al-Ateeq said. Women
will be allowed to participate. No election date has been decided.
	   Compiling a voter list is the first step for holding the
elections to the 29-member municipal council, the outcome of the
emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's promise to liberalize the
country.
	   Al Thani, who seized power from his conservative father in a
bloodless palace coup in 1995, has said the municipal polls are
only the first step. The next will be an elected legislature by the
beginning of the next century, he says.
	   In the last three years, he has introduced a temporary
constitution and lifted press censorship, allowing newspapers to
criticize ministers and government policies.
	   In the conservative oil-rich Gulf, only Kuwait has an elected
parliament, though women there are not eligible to vote or run for
office.
	   Qatar, a small Gulf emirate on the eastern side of the Arabian
Peninsula, has never allowed popular participation in
decision-making since its independence from Britain in 1971. Before
coming under British occupation, the country was a largely tribal
and nomadic society.
	   Qatar now has an advisory council which is appointed by the
emir, but the council lacks legislative powers.
	   Even the new municipal council will have an advisory role and
its resolutions will be non-binding.
	   The electorate is estimated to be about only 20,000 in a
population of 150,000 Qataris. The reason for the low figure is
that many Qatari men are members of the army and police, which
makes them ineligible to vote by law. Also ineligible are those who
have been citizens for less than 15 years.
	   Some 600,000 people live in Qatar _ about 450,000 of them
foreigners, mostly laborers from the Indian subcontinent.

Five Kosovo Albanians wounded at Albanian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanians were found
seriously wounded Saturday, after crossing into Albanian from
Kosovo, Albanian officials said.
	   Two old men, two children and a woman _ all believed to be
refugees from the Prizren region in Kosovo _ were found near the
border village of Pogaj inside Albanian territory, said Aratan
Bizhga, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
	   Albanian authorities sent two helicopters to rescue the five and
bring them to a hospital in the capital Tirana, Bizhga said. It was
unclear what had caused their injuries.
	   On Friday, four other Kosovo refugees were found wounded in the
same region.

	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired at least two
air-to-surface missiles at suspected guerrilla infiltration trails
in occupied southeastern Lebanon on Saturday, security officials
said.
	   Two fighter jets targeted an area in a valley near the village
of Qillaya, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 10:20 a.m.
(0720 GMT) attack on the area, about 20 kilometers (13 miles)
southwest of Rashaya in the southern Bekaa Valley and about the
same distance from the Israeli border.
	   Rashaya is seven kilometers (four miles) north of the border
enclave Israel has occupied in the south since 1985.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the air raid. An army
statement said Israeli warplanes returned safely to their bases
after hitting their targets.
	   Israeli jets often strike at guerrilla bases and infiltration
trails in south and southeast Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to
oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese

German says first nuclear plants to close by 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's designated environment minister
expects the new government to start closing the nation's 19 nuclear
power plants during its four-year term, a magazine said Saturday.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats have
agreed with their junior coalition partner, the environmentalist
Greens, to move the country toward scrapping nuclear power but has
set no timetable.
	   As a first step, the government plans shutdown negotiations with
the power industry, which has threatened to sue for billions of
marks (dollars) in damages if the administration closes nuclear
plants without its consent.
	   Juergen Trittin, a Green in line to be environment minister,
appeared to predict quick progress in an interview with Focus
magazine.
	   ``I expect that a series of nuclear power plants will be shut
down during this legislative term,'' which runs for four years, he
was quoted as saying.
	   Werner Mueller, a Schroeder adviser on energy policy who will
become economics minister, said he backs the government's plans
because most Germans oppose nuclear power.
	   ``I don't see the necessity for atomic power nowadays,'' he told
Focus.
	   Still, he stressed that the plan could succeed only in consensus
with utility companies. Mueller told Focus that he discussed the
government's plans with utility executives over the past week.
	   Schroeder's new government is to be sworn in Tuesday, a month
after the Social Democrats' victory in Sept. 27 elections.

Suspected mobster arrested in southern Italy for four slayings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy (AP) _ Paramilitary police arrested a
suspected Italian mobster Saturday in his mountain hideout for the
1993 slaying in Belgium of his former wife, her companion and
parents.
	   Belgium police had been seeking Rocco Chindamo, 39, for
allegedly killing the four in Arlon because he was jealous of his
ex-wife's new companion, the Italian news agency ANSA quoted
investigators in the southern region of Calabria as saying.
	   The four victims were identified as Martine Heitz, 30; her
parents Achille, 61, and Germaine Heitz, 53, and companion
Christian Mauguit, 39, the AGI news agency reported.
	   When carabinieri officers closed in on Chindamo and another
alleged mobster of the 'ndrangheta crime syndicate, Luciano
Ferrentino, Chindamo's 23-year-old nephew, Chindamo tried to fly,
but stopped when police pointed a gun at him, ANSA reported.
	   Confiscated in the hidout in the remote Aspromonte mountains in
the ``toe'' of the Italian boot-shaped peninsula were a rifle, two
pistols and a hand grenade, news reports said.
	   The 'ndrangheta, Calabria's approximate cousin to the Sicilian
Mafia, makes it money in drug and arms trafficking, extortion and
kidnapping victims who are sometimes held for ransom in the
mountain hideouts.

Despite militant rhetoric, Kosovo rebels demoralized, disheartened
</HEADLINE>
after Serb victories &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) - Imer Habibi kept fighting when his
relatives fled their Kosovo homes, when comrades fell in battle and
when Serbs razed his village. When fellow rebels sold their weapons
and left for jobs abroad, he started having doubts.
	   ``I can't blame anybody for leaving,'' said Habibi, 20, who fled
here two weeks ago after a bullet pierced his right hand. ``We
don't really have any weapons to fight the Serbs anyway. If we
don't have some major success in the next month, I don't think I
can ever go back.''
	   Three months ago, about 3,000 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
were massed in northern Albania, from where they launched attacks
against Serbian forces in their fight for independence for Kosovo,
a majority ethnic Albanian province of Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   A series of crushing defeats over the past few months changed
all that. Now, the rebel force has dwindled to a few bands
scattered over northern Albania, according to guerrillas and
Western officials based here.
	   Many rebels have grown discouraged and returned to jobs in
Western Europe, which they left when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched his brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo on Feb. 28.
	   So many rebels sold their rifles to finance trips abroad that
the price of Kalashnikov assault rifles here has dropped from dlrs
180 in August to dlrs 120 today.
	   Gone is the bravado of a few months ago, after a wave of early
guerrilla victories in Kosovo attracted thousands of recruits from
ethnic Albanian communities in Western Europe.
	   ``I don't know if our men will be back,'' said a guerrilla
commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're not fighting
here anymore. Our job now is to try to protect any refugees that
cross the border.''
	   Those who remain say it is too dangerous to mount operations
across the border now because Serb forces have bolstered their
defenses. Soon, snowfalls in the mountains that tower along the
border will seal off the few remaining infiltration routes until
spring.
	   Maj. Bajram Gostureji, commander of an Albanian government
border patrol unit, estimated the number of Serb troops across the
frontier had increased from a few hundred to more than 1,500.
	   ``The border is tenser than ever,'' Gostureji said. ``Only last
year, I used to chat with the Serb border guards and lend them
cigarettes. Now, they shoot at us whenever they see us.''
	   In their concrete barracks, the KLA ommander and a handful of
his men squat on milk crates, eating macaroni, drinking an orange
soft drink and complaining of crushing boredom.
	   Unlike their comrades still fighting in Kosovo, they sport
neatly pressed and washed green fatigue uniforms and polished boots
-- a sign of lots of spare time.
	   Western officials here say it is premature to declare an end to
the Kosovo rebellion. One official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that if the U.S.-led peace process fails to improve
the lot of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, rebel ranks could swell
again after winter ends.
	   ``If the situation in Kosovo remains the same over the winter,
we'll probably have a lot of the guerrillas coming back in the
spring,'' the official said. ``A lot of them went back to their
homes in western Europe to make money or to study.''
	   He also said NATO airstrikes against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
could also reverse guerrilla fortunes and encourage young Albanians
to resume the fight. The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose
the KLA's goal of independence.
	   They want the rebels to endorse negotiations between Milosevic
and ethnic Albanian moderates for self-rule within the Yugoslav
federation.
	   Meanwhile, the Albanians say the gradual disappearance of the
Kosovo rebels has not led to a reduction of tensions along the
border.
	   ``When the KLA was here, the Serbs were more afraid to shoot
into Albanian territory,'' Gostureji said. ``Now, it seems they
want us to empty the area along our border to make sure the KLA
never comes back.''

Radio: Congolese rebels find wreckage of downed jetliner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels have found the wreckage
of a Congolese airliner they shot down two weeks ago, Radio Rwanda
said Saturday.
	   A journalist from the Rwandan state radio, who went to the crash
site about 15 kilometers (9 miles) southwest of the eastern town of
Kindu with soldiers, said he saw bodies wearing military uniforms
scattered around the wreckage.
	   The plane caught on fire when it was downed by a rebel missle
Oct. 10, the radio said.
	   Rebels who were attacking Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
southwest of the Rwandan border, said they shot the plane down
because it was a military target.
	   The rebels said the plane was carrying government troops, and
they knew of its flight details in advance by monitoring
communications of government troops defending Kindu.
	   The rebels and their Rwandan allies captured Kindu and its
strategic air base Oct. 13.
	   No indepedent confirmation of the find was possible.
	   Last week in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, the private Congo
Airlines, which owned the aircraft, claimed searchers had located
the wreckage and bodies of the 40 civilian passengers who had been
fleeing Kindu.
	   President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and neighboring Uganda
of supporting the rebels with troops, arms and money. The rebels
launched rebellion on Aug. 2, accusing Kabila of mismanagement,
corruption and tribalism.
	   They now face the threat of an offensive against their eastern
strongholds, including Kindu, by Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia.
	   Chad has also sent troops to Congo to back Kabila. Sudan denies
claims its troops are in Congo fighting on the government side.

Lawyer explains Spanish case for trying Pinochet on genocide
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ If Augusto Pinochet stands trial someday in
Spain, the prosecution will try to prove the former dictator sought
to destroy a segment of the Chilean population, a lawyer close to
the case said.
	   ``This is known in legal terms as self-genocide,'' said Joan
Garces, comparing the Chilean case to the Pol Pot bloodbath of
Cambodians.
	   Garces, who spoke earlier this week, has worked closely with
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who sought Pinochet's detention in
London on Oct. 16 as a preliminary step toward his extradition to
face trial in Spain for genocide and terrorism.
	   Most of the victims of the Pinochet era were Chileans, but
Garces said others included people from Spain, Britain, the United
States, Austria, France, Switzerland and Argentina.
	   Garces was once a close advisor to socialist President Salvador
Allende, who died when Pinochet and other military officers staged
a violent coup in 1973. Garces now represents the relatives of
victims of the 17-year Pinochet dictatorship.
	   Judge Garzon will be able to draw on evidence showing that
around 4,000 people were abducted, tortured, murdered or
disappeared during the general's authoritarian rule, Garces said.
	   Garzon's detention warrant cites 94 cases of people being killed
or disappearing in Argentina in seizures carried out by the
Pinochet regime aided by Argentine cohorts between 1976-83.
	   They were victims of Operation Condor, a campaign by South
American military juntas to wipe out political opponents.
	   Garces said the judge may broaden his case soon to include
reference to Pinochet's victims in Chile, strengthening the
genocide allegation that the dictator sought to crush the leaders
of more than half the Chilean population.
	   The lawyer said he was confident that the Spanish attempt to
extradite Pinochet would survive appeals filed by the head
prosecutor of the National Court, Eduardo Fungarino.
	   The court deals with national security issues such as terrorism
and genocide, but Fungarino has argued that Spanish courts have no
business delving into Chilean crimes.
	   ``Fungarino has been acting like a kind of personal lawyer for
Pinochet,'' Garces said, insisting that Spanish law gives a
``crystal clear'' mandate to Spanish magistrates to pursue the
perpetrators of genocide no matter where it happens.
	   The National Court is expected to rule Thursday on the
jurisdiction issue.
	   Garces said he hopes the United States will bolster the Spanish
case by making available classified information from the Pinochet
period.
	   Although the United States helped Pinochet seize power and
consolidate his regime in order to crush Allende's socialist
government, Garces refuses to discuss the political backdrop to the
killing in Chile.
	   ``Chilean politics and United States foreign policy at the time
are irrelevant to this case, which is strictly about criminal
responsibility,'' Garces said, adding that the case referred to
crimes against humanity rather than ideological struggles.
	   ``Murder is murder is murder and we are not interested in what
the motive behind the murder was,'' he added.

Mandela kicks off local voter registration for 1999 elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Joh101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday kicked off a voter registration drive aimed at winning
two-thirds majority for his party in the 1999 elections.
	   ``If we get another 62 percent, we will have failed,'' said
Mandela.
	   The ANC needs two thirds _ or 66.66 percent _ in Parliament to
change the country's first democratic constitution, a prospect that
has provoked the country's half dozen minority parties to seek
coalitions with one other.
	   Mandela's party won 1994's first all-race elections after
decades of struggle to unseat apartheid rule.
	   Speaking to about 2,000 party faithful, Mandela said the 1999
vote would represent an effort to deepen democracy.
	   The president has not yet set the election date. Briefing notes
handed to reporters on Saturday said the ANC is ``working on a
likely election date of early May 1999.''
	   The ANC provincial secretary for Gauteng, the home province of
Johannesburg, said local officials are lobbying for early May
because seasonal rains would have stopped and the weather would
still be warm.
	   ``If you open up early and are still standing at 9 at night in
June and July, it's too cold,'' the official, Obed Bapela, told The
Associated Press.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission hopes to register most
voters between Nov. 27 to 29 as it tackles another milestone for
the new democracy _ that of creating a national voters' roll.
	   In 1994, anyone with an identification document could vote
anywhere without registering beforehand. The lack of red tape
helped ease tensions that preceded the country's first democratic
vote.
	   Under the new system, voters must apply for a bar-coded ID
document from government, take a temporary receipt to an assigned
voting station, and return for the permanent ID document in time
for election day.
	   Gauteng, the home province for Johannesburg, has 5 million
eligible voters.
	   Mandela echoed his party's increasingly strident reaction to
criticism over continuing high employment of 34 percent and soaring
crime.
	   ``Not a single government in 346 years has done a tenth of what
the ANC has done'' in delivering housing, water and electricity to
millions of poor blacks, Mandela said.
	   But he chastised officials in the post-1994 government who stole
public funds.
	   ``When we took over in 1994, little did we know that some of our
own people would be as corrupt as the apartheid government,'' he
said.

REPEATING TO ADD ``BC'' DESIGNATOR

 &UR; Despite militant rhetoric, Kosovo rebels demoralized, disheartened
after Serb victories &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) - Imer Habibi kept fighting when his
relatives fled their Kosovo homes, when comrades fell in battle and
when Serbs razed his village. When fellow rebels sold their weapons
and left for jobs abroad, he started having doubts.
	   ``I can't blame anybody for leaving,'' said Habibi, 20, who fled
here two weeks ago after a bullet pierced his right hand. ``We
don't really have any weapons to fight the Serbs anyway. If we
don't have some major success in the next month, I don't think I
can ever go back.''
	   Three months ago, about 3,000 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
were massed in northern Albania, from where they launched attacks
against Serbian forces in their fight for independence for Kosovo,
a majority ethnic Albanian province of Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   A series of crushing defeats over the past few months changed
all that. Now, the rebel force has dwindled to a few bands
scattered over northern Albania, according to guerrillas and
Western officials based here.
	   Many rebels have grown discouraged and returned to jobs in
Western Europe, which they left when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched his brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo on Feb. 28.
	   So many rebels sold their rifles to finance trips abroad that
the price of Kalashnikov assault rifles here has dropped from dlrs
180 in August to dlrs 120 today.
	   Gone is the bravado of a few months ago, after a wave of early
guerrilla victories in Kosovo attracted thousands of recruits from
ethnic Albanian communities in Western Europe.
	   ``I don't know if our men will be back,'' said a guerrilla
commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're not fighting
here anymore. Our job now is to try to protect any refugees that
cross the border.''
	   Those who remain say it is too dangerous to mount operations
across the border now because Serb forces have bolstered their
defenses. Soon, snowfalls in the mountains that tower along the
border will seal off the few remaining infiltration routes until
spring.
	   Maj. Bajram Gostureji, commander of an Albanian government
border patrol unit, estimated the number of Serb troops across the
frontier had increased from a few hundred to more than 1,500.
	   ``The border is tenser than ever,'' Gostureji said. ``Only last
year, I used to chat with the Serb border guards and lend them
cigarettes. Now, they shoot at us whenever they see us.''
	   In their concrete barracks, the KLA ommander and a handful of
his men squat on milk crates, eating macaroni, drinking an orange
soft drink and complaining of crushing boredom.
	   Unlike their comrades still fighting in Kosovo, they sport
neatly pressed and washed green fatigue uniforms and polished boots
-- a sign of lots of spare time.
	   Western officials here say it is premature to declare an end to

	   ``When the KLA was here, the Serbs were more afraid to shoot

never comes back.''

Taylor and Langer defy Pakistan bowlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australian skipper Mark Taylor carved
out a chancy half century in the second innings after the visitors
got a slender 28-run first innings lead against Pakistan on the
third day of their third and final cricket Test Saturday.
	   At stumps, Australia had steadily progressed to 130 for one, an
overall lead of 158 runs.
	   Taylor, who is now looking forward to Australia's first series
victory on Pakistan soil after 39 years, was unbeaten at 64 off 178
balls and 209 minutes while Langer was not out at 45.
	   Both the Australian left-handers have so far put on 103 runs for
the second wicket in 173 minutes. Langer brought up the century
partnership with his captain in the last over when he swept Shahid
Afridi to the long leg boundary.
	   Taylor survived a confident bat and pad appeal when on 25 on a
Shakeel Ahmed delivery, and got a life on 56 when Aamir Sohail
failed to hold on to a strong sweep at short square leg off Arshad
Khan with Australia at 112 for one.
	   Khan took the only wicket in the Australian second innings as
Michael Slater (11) offered an easy catch to Yousaf Youhanna in the
eighth over of the innings. He bowled a marathon spell of 24 overs
and ended with 1-41.
	   Earlier, Pakistan was dismissed for 252 in reply to Australia's
280 with captain Aamir Sohail scoring 133 _ his second Test hundred
against Australia and fifth overall in 44 Test matches.
	   The pitch at the National Stadium, which was expected to give
assistance to spin bowlers, played a lot straighter and gave little
trouble to batsmen.
	   Earlier, Sohail brought Pakistan back into the match with a
gritty century with Pakistan losing just one wicket in the first
session.
	   Resuming at the overnight score of 170 for six, Sohail and Wasim
Akram extended their seventh wicket partnership to 98 in 125
minutes. Akram was dropped by Collin Miller at mid-off off Gavin
Robertson when on 20, with the total at 183 for six.
	   The visitors' lone success in the first session came when Akram
offered no stroke to leg-spinner Stuart MacGill's flipper and was
out plumb leg before after scoring 35 with the help of six
boundaries.
	   Sohail brought up his fifth Test hundred and the second against
Australia off 194 balls in 263 minutes. His innings was studded
with 14 fours and a six.
	   The 32-year-old Pakistan captain pulled, drove and cut with
immaculate ease as the visitors struggled to wrap up Pakistan's
innings quickly.
	   Sohail departed in the first over after lunch when Langer took a
spectacular diving catch to his right at deep midwicket on a
delivery by Miller, which ended the Pakistani captain's 346 minutes
of resistance at the wicket. Sohail hit 18 fours and a six in his
272-ball innings.
	   McGrath claimed his 10th five-wicket haul in 40 Test matches as
he had Ahmed (1) caught by Langer at forward short leg. McGrath,
who polished off Pakistan's top order on Friday evening and had
reduced the home team to 69 five, ended up with 5-65.

Vienna ex-mayor suspected as communist-era spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Zilk, a former mayor of Vienna,
was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor because of
suspicions that he was a communist spy, a German newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Zilk, 71, allegedly spied for the communist government of the
former Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and `70s. He denied the
accusation, which the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted him as
calling ``complete nonsense.''
	   The suspicion surfaced after Zilk, 71, was nominated for the
order of the White Lion because of serious injuries he received
from a letter bomb. Zilk lost part of his hand in the December 1993
explosion, which happened during one of his terms as mayor of the
Austrian capital.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel withdrew the honor after a source
claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech communist secret service and
provided information that led to several convictions. Zilk also
signed a declaration of loyalty to the Czech communist government,
the source claimed.
	   Ivan Medek, a Czech government official, did not identify the
source but told the newspaper that the information on Zilk was
``absolutely reliable.''
	   Zilk would have received the Czech medal next Wednesday.

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria ridicules it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Saturday hailed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a cornerstone for lasting peace
but in neighboring Syria the official media ridiculed it as a
Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap.
	   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval.
	   The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be called a
``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, said.
``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said.
	   ``All Palestinian rights have been swallowed and canceled from
the political dictionary,'' the paper said, adding that the
agreement favored the Israelis heavily.
	   The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap
for the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli
threats.''
	   Syria technically is at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made
no progress during the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
been in office.
	   But Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were
reflected in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
Jordan is only the Arab nation other than Egypt to have signed a
peace treaty with Israel.
	   Tarawneh said Friday's agreement ``puts the peace process back
on track and opens the door for negotiations on a permanent
settlement.''
	   Under the peace deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from
additional West Bank land in exchange for security guarantees.
	   Tarawneh said Jordan ``looks forward to implementing this
agreement in good will and the interest of all.''
	   Jordan's King Hussein is Israel's closest Arab ally and had made
an emotional appeal for peace during the negotiations, which he
joined on two occasions, taking a break from his cancer treatment
at the Mayo Clinic.
	   Despite the government optimism, Jordan's independent newspapers
reacted cautiously, saying Israeli deeds and not words were needed
will provide a lasting peace.
	   ``The bet is on its implementation and not allowing any of the
two sides to invent obstacles and problems to dodge away from'' the
deal, said the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper.
	   The caution was shared by Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction so long that it will lead
to an Israeli withdrawal from Arab Palestinian territories,''
Moussa said in Jordan, where he arrived Saturday for a three-day
visit.
	   ``But what is crucial is for the peace process to move forward
through the true implementation of the deal,'' he said.

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ From a distance, the smashed
coconut and abaca trees scattered on the hills look like broken
matchsticks _ a painful reminder of the destruction left by Typhoon
Babs in Catanduanes.
	   The island province was the first hit by the typhoon, which
stalled directly above it for nearly 12 hours.
	   The storm drenched the hillsides, turning them into a deadly
mush that cascaded down on helpless residents seeking higher ground
from the rising floodwaters.
	   At least 69 people from the province died, most of them buried
in landslides. Throughout the Philippines, at least 129 died.
	   At the height of the storm, water in the Bato River, which
snakes through the hills of Catanduanes to the sea, rose more than
nine meters (30 feet), reaching the ceilings of some houses.
	   Most of the buildings are now roofless and many are without
walls.
	   But residents were busy Saturday repairing roofs or making
makeshift shelters where their homes once stood. Some used wire
from toppled electrical lines for hanging clothes.
	   Everyone was drying something _ furniture, mats, clothes, rice,
abaca fiber. Others scraped mud off the floors of their homes.
	   Long areas of the shoreline were choked with large and small
trees uprooted by the typhoon. The bark had been scraped clean as
they rolled down the mountains to the river and onto the sea.
	   The entire island was without electricity. A power barge that
supplied electricity to outlying towns was swept down the river and
washed out to sea by the punishing wind and waves.
	   Eddie Tapel, a provincial council member, said entire families
were killed in the landslides in San Miguel, including many of his
relatives.
	   ``Many children will have to quit school because their families
have no more income,'' he said.
	   Many people in the area rely mostly on abaca _ a type of hemp _
coconuts and fishing for their livelihood.
	   The abaca trees are now destroyed, and all that is left of most
of the coconut trees is the spindly fronds which Filipinos use to
make garden brooms.
	   ``In all my 61 years, I haven't experienced a more destructive
typhoon,'' said San Miguel Vice Mayor Alfredo Santillan.
	   The last major one, he said, struck in October 1970 but passed
through Catanduanes in a few hours.
	   That typhoon packed 275-kph (170-mph) winds and left 2,361 dead
in the northern Philippines.
	   ``We'll just have to bear it,'' Santillan said. ``We will
recover, but it will take a long while.''

Hostage-taking ends in Turkish prisons

 &UR; EDs: SUBS 8th graf The justice, with justice minister comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Political prisoners, holding prison
officials hostage in five prisons throughout Turkey in a bid to
improve jail conditions, put an end to their nationwide protest,
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Saturday.
	   Prisoners had held some 50 officials hostage Friday in what
appeared to be a concerted protest.
	   Human rights activists who took part in negotiating the release
of prison officers confirmed that all had been released.
	   Five security officers were injured during the hostage- takings,
reports said. None was reported in life-threatening conditions.
	   The most important action came in Istanbul's Umraniye prison.
	   Throughout the night, lawyers, human rights activists and
paramilitary police negotiated with the hostage takers, Anatolia
said.
	   Lawyers told Anatolia that the prisoners demanded a general
improvement of jail conditions, an end to prison transfers, and
that convicts held in isolated cells be allowed to return to their
wards.
	   Prisoners also demanded an end to attacks by prison officials on
inmates, and that all prisoners allegedly injured in recent prison
riots be given medical treatment, Ibis Varol of the Human Rights
Association said.
	   The justice ministry accepted all the demands, Varol said.
	   But a justice ministry official differed with Varol's
assessment. Catay Kayiran, the general director of penitentiaries,
contended that officials do not attack inmates, that prisoners were
always given medical treatment and that isolated cells were only
used in disciplinary cases.
	   Kayiran said that soldiers, currently dealing with the hostage
taking, would leave the prisons.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 150 protesters gathered Saturday at the
London hospital where former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is
under arrest to demand that he be tried for genocide.
	   A visiting Chilean senator said Pinochet's health is
deteriorating.
	   In driving wind and rain, protesters beat drums and tamborines
and chanted, ''We want justice'' outside the private London Clinic,
where Pinochet, 82, is recovering from back surgery while his
lawyers fight a Spanish extradition warrant.
	   Protesters included 35 Chilean exiles who traveled from France.
Others came from Switzerland, Sweden and Spain.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet, whose rule was marked by human rights abuses and a
climate of fear, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful
spinal disorder which had hindered his movement and the Chilean
government has urged Britain to release him on humanitarian
grounds.
	   Chilean senator Ignacio Perez-Walker told reporters outside the
clinic after visiting Pinochet Saturday that the former leader ''is
a very strong man.''
	   ''However, his health appears very, very detiorated,'' said
Perez-Walker. ''We spoke very briefly and he was very calm,'' he
said, adding that Pinochet was only informed 48 hours ago that he
was under arrest.
	   Chile has also argued that Pinochet, as a senator, is entitled
to diplomatic immunity.
	   On Friday night, Pinochet's wife appealed for his release,
saying he is too sick to be stand trial.
	   ``This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia
Pinochet told reporters outside the private London Clinic.
	   ''I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very,
very, very, ill.''
	   Unconfirmed media reports in Chile this week indicated that
Pinochet, who has worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, also
has a urinary tract infection. There have also been reports that he
is suffering from depression.
	   Lawyers for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue
that British police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish
warrant. The case resumes Monday.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for life,
as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.

Oil and water tankers collide in Istanbul's Bosporus strait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish oil tanker collided with a
water tanker in Istanbul's narrow Bosporus strait, a port official
said Saturday. No oil spill occurred.
	   The Osman Bahri, carrying 23 tons (25 short tons) of oil,
reported a problem in its steering mechanism and collided late
Friday into an anchored water tanker.
	   Activists regularly stage protests pointing out the dangers of
heavy tanker traffic in strait, which cuts through this city of
about 10 million people, while the Turkish government is lobbying
to limit oil tanker traffic.
	   Next week, oil companies are to decide which route will see the
transfer of Caspian oil to Europe. They are said to prefer a route,
linking the Azeri capital of Baku to a Georgian Black Sea port that
would increase traffic in the straits.
	   On Saturday, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Turkey would not
allow the strait ``to become an (oil) pipeline.''
	   Turkey backs a route, from Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean
port of Ceyhan, that would bypass the Bosporus.

 &UR; Nobel winner tells Protestants: No IRA guns, no Sinn Fein in
government
 &UR; Eds: Changes dateline, UPDATES throughout with speeches from
Trimble and other Ulster Unionists
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize winner
David Trimble, under pressure from hard-line Protestants opposed to
Northern Ireland's peace agreement, assured his Ulster Unionist
Party Saturday he won't share power with Sinn Fein until the IRA
starts disarming.
	   Trimble emphasized that April's multi-party agreement required
Sinn Fein and its Irish Republican Army allies to support ``only
democratic, nonviolent means'' or be ``excluded or removed from
office.''
	   Referring to the IRA's favorite plastic explosive, he told the
Ulster Unionists' annual conference: ``There is only one thing you
can do with Semtex. There is only one reason for holding onto it.
And that's to destroy people or places.
	   ''Retention of guns and explosives is a clear threat of force.''
	   Trimble drew standing ovations at the start and finish of his
speech from all but a handful of the 500 Ulster Unionist activists
packed into a hotel ballroom outside Londonderry, the British-ruled
province's second-largest city.
	   John Hume, who leads Northern Ireland's major Catholic party and
shared Nobel honors last week with Trimble, agrees with Sinn Fein
that all major parties should be entitled now to seats in a new
multi-party government, the intended centerpiece of April's
agreement.
	   But more than a dozen Ulster Unionist speakers _ strikingly,
from both the pragmatic and stubborn wings of Northern Ireland's
largest party _ emphasized how little room for maneuver Trimble has
on the matter.
	   They voiced near-unanimous opposition to forming a government
that includes Sinn Fein figures without IRA disarmament, which the
agreement states should happen by mid-2000.
	   ``We have done our bit. We're doing no more,'' declared Reg
Empey, one of most strongly pro-agreement voices in the party.
	   If British Prime Minister Tony Blair and others try to pressure
Trimble into moving forward without IRA disarmament, Empey said,
``they'll be wasting their time.''
	   William Ross _ who like most of his nine Ulster Unionist
colleagues in Britain's Parliament has defied Trimble by opposing
the agreement _ drew some applause when he chided party
``liberals'' for having ``trampled over common sense'' by even
negotiating when the IRA refused to disarm.
	   ``Ladies and gentlemen, we're one-quarter into this agreement _
and still not one gun, not one bomb!'' said David Brewster, a
former Trimble ally who defected to Ross' camp on the eve of the
agreement.
	   Rejecting the idea that Sinn Fein's 17 percent share of Northern
Ireland votes made the party ``normal,'' Brewster retorted to
cheers: ``Well you are not. You are the tapeworm in the body
politic, and you must be flushed out!''
	   David Burnside, a public-relations consultant, warned that the
Ulster Unionists cannot rest on the Nobel honor accorded to
Trimble. The party, he argued, must fight a more effective
propaganda war internationally.
	   Sinn Fein, he argued, ``would love to be seen'' to be barred
from any new government. ``The republicans want us to make a
mistake. Don't play their game.''

Hindus threaten to strike over minister's offensive remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hindus in the tourist island of Bali
have threatened to stage a strike unless President B.J. Habibie
fires a cabinet minister accused of insulting the minority
religion.
	   Indonesian media reports have quoted Food Minister A.M.
Saefuddin as saying that opposition faction leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri does not deserve Indonesian presidency because she is
a Hindu.
	   ``We give a longest deadline of one-month,'' protest coordinator
I Nyoman Japa was quoted as saying Saturday by the official Antara
news agency.
	   ``If our demands are not fulfilled, then Hindus all over
Indonesia are ready to joint in the mass strike,'' said Japa, who
leads the People's Complaint Action, a movement set up to protest
the remark.
	   The group demanded Saefuddin, a Muslim party leader, to withdraw
his remarks, apologize to Hindus and to resign. It also demanded
that he be questioned and put on trial.
	   Also Saturday, a group representing hotel employees, staged a
protest at the offices of the Bali governor and the local council
in Denpasar, denouncing Saefuddin.
	   Saefuddin was reported to have asked: ``Are the Indonesian
people willing to have a Hindu president?''
	   He has apologized, saying he had no intention of insulting any
religion.
	   Megawati's paternal grandmother came from the predominantly
Hindu island of Bali. Her father, the late President Sukarno, and
her mother were Islam.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world most populous Islamic nation. Religious
tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy and constitution.
	   Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections next May under
promised democratic reforms.
	   Legislators will then select a new president. Saefuddin has
expressed his intention to challenge the enormously popular
Megawati, a candidate from the Indonesian Democratic Party.

Basque voters take breather before election day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QC;  Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Putting the clamor of campaigning behind
them, voters in Spain's Basque region spent an official ``day of
reflection'' Saturday ahead of a regional election seen as crucial
for starting a peace process to end 30 years of separatist strife.
	   The armed separatist group ETA, which set the tone for the
campaign five weeks ago by declaring a cease-fire in its drive for
an independent homeland, was set to grab the limelight again on the
eve of the voting. Several of its members were expected to appear
in a taped program broadcast by Britain's British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) to discuss the ceasefire.
	   Spanish newspapers said one of the members was also to discuss a
``political scenario'' in which the group might consider laying
down its arms for good. The papers said the interview was taped a
month ago, shortly after the cease-fire took effect on Sept. 18.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they were all of limited
duration. This is the first open-ended one and many Spaniards see
it as the best opportunity in years to end one of Western Europe's
last regional conflicts.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar traveled to the Basque country
Friday night with a delegation of six Cabinet ministers in a
last-minute push for candidates of his center-right Popular Party
seeking seats in the 75-member Basque parliament here in Vitoria.
	   Speaking at a rally in Vitoria, Aznar warned against what he
called the ``adventures'' of some Basque nationalists seeking
independence from Spain.
	   ``No adventures in the Basque country,'' he said. ``There will
be none. This land will not see adventures that take it nowhere.''
	   Aznar also repeated his call for ETA to publicly accept the
results of the elections and lay down its arms. The premier has
said ETA must meet these conditions for a peace process to begin in
earnest.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   So far the government has shied from reacting generously to the
cease-fire. It has moved four of the some 500 ETA prisoners to
jails in the Basque country in a token gesture to a long-standing
demand of the separatist group.
	   Aznar hopes a strong showing by the Popular Party and other
non-nationalist groups, like the opposition Socialists, will give
him greater leverage against nationalists in the Basque region as
he seeks a lasting settlement to the separatist problem.
	   The region's biggest party is the mainstream Basque Nationalist
Party, which is expected to again finish first in the voting but
fall short of a majority and thus have to seek coalition allies.
	   The big question mark is whether the ETA ceasefire will
translate into greater support for the Basque Nationalist Party and
ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna. The two held months of talks
this year that led to the truce, and they are hoping to reap
dividends at the polls.
	   ``We will be the big surprise on election day,'' said one of
Herri Batasuna's candidates, Jone Goirizelaia.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party says it shares ETA's goal of
independence but opposes violence as the way to achieve it.
Instead, it wants to work through Spain's existing institutions to
secede gently.

Oct. 24, 1948, several months after winning his first Olympic gold
at the London Olympics.
	   He added three more golds in Helsinki four years later, where he
dominated the 5,000, 10,000 and marathon races, while Dana won the

Reporters protest curb on covering Hamas, threaten strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian journalists on Saturday sharply
protested restrictions on coverage of the radical Islamic group
Hamas and theatened to strike in response.
	   A day earlier, Palestinian police detained a dozen journalists
who were waiting to interview Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas' spiritual
leader, about the signing of a new Mideast peace deal.
	   The journalists were told that effective immediately, they
needed permission from the Palestinian Authority to cover any
events dealing with politics or security, in effect restricting
access to both Palestinian officials and opposition figures like
Yassin.
	   The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said Saturday that if its
members were not allowed to cover Hamas, they would also stop
covering the activities of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza
Strip. The group planned to issue a formal statement of protest
later.
	   Among those held for more than an hour by the Palestinian
security forces on Friday were reporter Ibrahim Barzak and
photographer Adel Hanna, both on assignment for The Associated
Press. All the detained journalists were forced to hand over their
equipment, including mobile phones, tape recorders and cameras.
	   They were also asked to appear at police headquarters on
Saturday, but a representative of the Gaza-based journalists'
syndicate went instead.
	   Yassin himself denounced the restrictions, saying the
Palestinian Authority ``will have prevented the media from
transmitting the voice of opposition.''
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, Yassin called that a
violation of free speech and of what he called ``the banner of
democracy'' brandished by Yasser Arafat's government.
	   The head of the syndicate, Zakaria Talmas, sought a meeting with
Ghazi Jebali, who heads the security apparatus in the
Palestinian-run areas. However, he was told Jebali was busy in
meetings and did not have time to see him.

Japan's Daiwa Bank to withdraw from overseas banking business
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout with Daiwa news conference

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Daiwa Bank will close most of its
international operations and focus on its domestic business as part
of a restructuring plan, the bank president said Saturday.
	   Daiwa Bank President Takashi Kaiho told a hastily called evening
news conference that it will close all of its six remaining
overseas branches by next March, leaving only nine small offices.
	   The move by Daiwa is the latest example of a retreat from
foreign markets by Japanese financial institutions.
	   Daiwa was barred from operating in the United States two years
ago after it pleaded guilty to hiding dlrs 1.1 billion in bond
trading losses.
	   Kaiho told reporters that the bank has decided to give up
licenses allowing it to engage in overseas banking and cut the
number of branch offices to nine by early 2000.
	   Three years ago, Daiwa had 58 overseas offices, including 25
banking outlets.
	   Daiwa will now concentrate on strengthening its domestic retail
and asset management businesses to cope with increased competition
as Japan deregulates the financial industry, it said.
	   ``In order to survive in the increased competition, we must
improve our cost efficiency,'' the bank said in a news release.
	   To cut its personnel costs, Daiwa employees will face a 10
percent cut in their annual salary, it said.
	   Earlier this week, Japan's Nikko Securities Co. announced plans
to close offices in Malaysia and Thailand.
	   Sumitomo Bank Ltd. withdrew from retail banking in the United
States in March by selling its American subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank
of California.

Kosovo rebels demoralized, disheartened after Serb victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ Imer Habibi kept fighting when his
relatives fled their Kosovo homes, when comrades fell in battle and
when Serbs razed his village. When fellow rebels sold their weapons
and left for jobs abroad, he started having doubts.
	   ``I can't blame anybody for leaving,'' said Habibi, 20, who fled
here two weeks ago after a bullet pierced his right hand. ``We
don't really have any weapons to fight the Serbs anyway. If we
don't have some major success in the next month, I don't think I
can ever go back.''
	   Three months ago, about 3,000 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
were massed in northern Albania, from where they launched attacks
against Serbian forces in their fight for independence for Kosovo,
a majority ethnic Albanian province of Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   A series of crushing defeats over the past few months changed
all that. Now, the rebel force has dwindled to a few bands
scattered over northern Albania, according to guerrillas and
Western officials based here.
	   Early guerrilla victories had attracted thousands of recruits
from ethnic Albanian communities in Western Europe after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his brutal crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo on Feb. 28. But now many
rebels have grown discouraged and returned to their jobs in Western
Europe.
	   So many rebels sold their rifles to finance trips abroad that
the price of Kalashnikov assault rifles here has dropped from dlrs
180 in August to dlrs 120 today.
	   ``I don't know if our men will be back,'' said a guerrilla
commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're not fighting
here anymore. Our job now is to try to protect any refugees that
cross the border.''
	   Those who remain say it is too dangerous to mount operations
across the border now because Serb forces have bolstered their
defenses. Soon, snowfalls in the mountains that tower along the
border will seal off the few remaining infiltration routes until
spring.
	   Maj. Bajram Gostureji, commander of an Albanian government
border patrol unit, estimated the number of Serb troops across the
frontier had increased from a few hundred to more than 1,500.
	   ``The border is tenser than ever,'' Gostureji said. ``Only last
year, I used to chat with the Serb border guards and lend them
cigarettes. Now, they shoot at us whenever they see us.''
	   In their concrete barracks, the KLA commander and a handful of
his men squat on milk crates, eating macaroni, drinking an orange
soft drink and complaining of boredom.
	   Unlike their comrades still fighting in Kosovo, they sport
neatly pressed and washed green fatigue uniforms and polished boots
_ a sign of lots of spare time.
	   Western officials here say it is premature to declare an end to
the Kosovo rebellion. One official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that if the U.S.-led peace process fails to improve
the lot of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, rebel ranks could swell
again after winter ends.
	   He also said NATO airstrikes against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
could also reverse guerrilla fortunes and encourage young Albanians
to resume the fight. The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose
the KLA's goal of independence.
	   They want the rebels to endorse negotiations between Milosevic
and ethnic Albanian moderates for self-rule within the Yugoslav
federation.
	   Meanwhile, the Albanians say the gradual disappearance of the
Kosovo rebels has not led to a reduction of tensions along the
border.
	   ``When the KLA was here, the Serbs were more afraid to shoot
into Albanian territory,'' Gostureji said. ``Now, it seems they
want us to empty the area along our border to make sure the KLA
never comes back.''

Former radicals vote on joining German government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Vote expected by 1700 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Once a loose band of peace protesters,
anti-nuclear activists and feminists, the Greens Party was voting
Saturday on whether to join Germany's government for the first
time.
	   Party leaders appealed to some 800 convention delegates to back
the coalition pact sealed this week with the Social Democrats, who
won Sept. 27 elections but need a junior partner to secure a
majority in parliament.
	   Approval by the Greens, many of whom cherish the party's
outsider roots, was the last major hurdle to the new center-left
government's swearing-in scheduled Tuesday. The Social Democrats'
vote on the coalition deal Sunday was expected to go smoothly.
	   A Green, Joschka Fischer, is in line to become foreign minister,
one of three designated Cabinet members from the small
environmental party.
	   Seeking to convince many members who still expressed misgivings,
Greens co-chair Juergen Trittin acknowledged that the coalition
talks had fallen short of party goals. But he ended his speech by
saying, ``Let us take this task upon ourselves.''
	   Trittin said he was happy with several landmark projects the new
center-left administration has pledged to undertake during its
four-year term: higher energy taxes, a commitment to closing
nuclear power plants, and allowing more foreigners to become German
citizens.
	   More radical Greens positions such as tripling gasoline prices
over 10 years and disbanding NATO were ruled out from the start by
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   ``Some sentences in this coalition treaty make a pacifist want
to scream,'' the party's defense spokeswoman, Angelika Beer, told
the meeting.
	   But even she urged delegates to approve the deal rather than
ruin their chance to chart the course of Europe's pivotal nation.
	   Founded in 1980, the Greens have moved steadily toward the
mainstream in recent years, with Fischer as the most prominent
example.
	   Once a street protester and self-described ``professional
revolutionary'' in the 1970s, he renounced pacifism in horror at
the war in Bosnia.
	   Notorious for wearing sneakers when taking the oath of office as
Hesse state environment minister in 1985, he now prefers
fashionable charcoal-color suits.
	   But the road to government seemed bumpy even six months ago,
when support for the Greens plummeted after they shocked this
car-loving country by voting for the gasoline price hike.
	   On election day, the Greens won 6.7 percent of the national
vote, down from 7.3 percent in the last election in 1994.
	   For his part, Schroeder expressed his confidence in the Greens
by attending a summit of European Union leaders in Austria on
Saturday _ though officially as a guest of outgoing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Politicians and union leaders joined some
2,000 people for a rally in central Madrid on Saturday to demand
the extradition and trial of former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet.
	   ``He's a criminal and he must face trial,'' United Left party
leader Julio Anguita told reporters at the rally in the central
Puerta del Sol square.
	   The rally was organized by several human rights organizations.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for alleged crimes of genocide and
terrorism committed during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Several thousand people of various nationalities died under
Pinochet's regime.
	   The National Court, where Garzon works, is next Thursday to
begin discussing whether the Spanish justice system has any
jurisdiction over such crimes following an objection lodged by the
court's chief prosecutor Eduardo Fungarino.
	   A negative ruling would scrap Garzon's probe against Pinochet
while one in favor would spur the judge on to making a formal
extradition request to Britain, which would first have to approved
by the Spanish government.
	   ``Spaniards were killed. Why shouldn't he (Pinochet) face trial
in Spain,'' Anguita said. ``Especially given that in Chile he was
compensated with being made a senator for life.''
	   Antonio Gutierrez, leader of Spain's Workers Commissions labor
union called on Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to back the
extradition.
	   Aznar has said his government will respond only when, and if, an
extradition request is formally made.
	   On Friday, Garzon issued a petition aimed at freezing any
accounts Pinochet might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.
	   The magistrate is to send investigative teams to both countries
to find out if the Pinochet has financial accounts in either and if
so, to block them. The measure was sought to cover any possible
compensation payments that might be ordered should Pinochet be
tried in Spain.

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria ridicules it

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Saturday hailed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a cornerstone for lasting peace
but in neighboring Syria the official media ridiculed it as a
Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap.
	   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval.
	   The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be called a
``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, said.
``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said.
	   ``All Palestinian rights have been swallowed and canceled from
the political dictionary,'' the paper said, adding that the
agreement favored the Israelis heavily.
	   The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap
for the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli
threats.''
	   Syria technically is at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made
no progress during the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
been in office.
	   But Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were
reflected in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
Jordan is the only Arab nation other than Egypt to have signed a
peace treaty with Israel.
	   Tarawneh said, graf 8 pvs

Guinea-Bissau's annouce cease-fire, demand withdrawal of foreign

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebels have announced a
48-hour cease-fire in the tiny west African country, demanding the
withdrawal of foreign troops supporting President Joao Bernardo
Vieira, officials said Saturday.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister traveled Saturday to Guinea-Bissau
aiming to halt a slide back to civil war, one week after the former
Portuguese colony's conflict restarted.
	   Jaime Gama was to fly into the capital Bissau's airport, which
rebels have held for almost five months.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau's authorities expressed interest in the
Portuguese minister's presence,'' Horacio Cesar, spokesman for the
Portuguese Foreign Ministry, said by phone in Lisbon.
	   He declined to give any details of Gama's agenda.
	   There were no reports of fighting in the capital Saturday,
following the rebels' call for a 48-hour cease-fire late Friday,
Cesar said.
	   The rebels gave Vieira until Sunday afternoon to agree to the
withdrawal of more than 3,000 heavily-armed troops deployed by
neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea to support his
government.
	   Vieira had announced a unilateral government cease-fire
Wednesday, but the rebels wanted guarantees before entering into
peace talks.
	   Fighting restarted Sunday when the rebels, mostly army veterans
angered by poor pay and conditions, advanced on the center of
Bissau, towards the presidential palace.
	   Troops loyal to Vieira held them back in the capital's downtown,
while the army dissidents gained ground throughout the impoverished
country's interior.
	   The foes entered a July 26 cease-fire brokered by negotiators
from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries. The mediators
discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and military
observers, but no deal was reached.
	   The military rebellion in early June followed Brig. Ansumane
Mane's dismissal as army chief, for allegedly running guns to
separatist fighters in Senegal's southern Casamance province.
	   Aid workers estimate that about half the country's population of
1 million has been displaced since the conflict began.

Reporters protest curb on covering Hamas, threaten strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian journalists on Saturday sharply
protested restrictions on coverage of the radical Islamic group
Hamas and threatened to strike in response.
	   A day earlier, Palestinian police detained a dozen journalists
who were waiting to interview Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas' spiritual
leader, about the signing of a new Mideast peace deal.
	   The journalists were told they needed permission from the
Palestinian Authority to cover any events dealing with politics or
security, in effect restricting access to both Palestinian
officials and opposition figures like Yassin.
	   The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said Saturday that if its
members were not allowed to cover Hamas, they would also stop
covering the activities of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza
Strip. The group planned to issue a formal statement of protest
later.
	   Among those held for more than an hour by the Palestinian
security forces on Friday were reporter Ibrahim Barzak and
photographer Adel Hanna, both on assignment for The Associated
Press. All the detained journalists were forced to hand over their
equipment, including mobile phones, tape recorders and cameras.
	   Yassin himself denounced the restrictions, saying the
Palestinian Authority ``will have prevented the media from
transmitting the voice of opposition.''
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, Yassin called that a
violation of free speech and of what he called ``the banner of
democracy'' brandished by Yasser Arafat's government.

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria slams it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by columnist; EDITS to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Saturday hailed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a cornerstone for lasting peace
but in neighboring Syria the official media ridiculed it as a
Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap.
	   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval.
	   Reflecting widespread skepticism in the Arab world, columnist
Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan called the Israeli-Palestinian-U.S. summit
the ``epitome of Israeli blackmailing.''
	   He was referring to the concessions extracted by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
during the negotiations in Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Under the peace deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from
additional West Bank land in exchange for guarantees that Arafat
will clamp down on Palestinian extremists.
	   ``The Wyers will be forced to confess one day to their people
that this deal ended `Oslo the bad deal' and adopted `Wye, a worse
one,''' Badrakhan, an Egyptian journalist, wrote in the respected
al-Hayat newspaper.
	   Syrian newspapers were equally harsh.
	   The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be called a
``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, said.
``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said.
	   The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap
for the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli
threats.''
	   Syria is technically at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made
no progress during the time Netanyahu has been in office.
	   But Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were
reflected in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
	   The agreement ``puts the peace process back on track and opens
the door for negotiations on a permanent settlement,'' Tarawneh
said.
	   King Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
Israel's closest Arab ally and has long been a vocal advocate of
Israeli-Arab peace. He had made an emotional appeal during the
Maryland negotiations, which he joined on two occasions, taking a
break from his cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic.
	   Despite the government optimism, Jordan's independent newspapers
reacted cautiously, saying Israeli deeds and not words were needed
will provide a lasting peace.
	   ``The bet is on its implementation and not allowing any of the
two sides to invent obstacles and problems to dodge away from'' the
deal, said the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper.
	   The caution was shared by Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction so long that it will lead
to an Israeli withdrawal from Arab Palestinian territories,''
Moussa told reporters in Jordan where he arrived Saturday for a
three-day visit.
	   A successful implementation of the deal could resolve the Syrian
deadlock as well as the problem with Lebanon where Israel occupies
part of the southern land, Moussa said.
	   Asked whether Israel can be trusted, he said: ``Let's wait and
see ... It's not a question of a document signed, but the true
implementation of the agreement.''
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace deal with
Israel in 1979.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday kicked off a voter registration drive aimed at winning
two-thirds majority for his party in the 1999 elections.
	   ``If we get another 62 percent, we will have failed,'' said
Mandela.
	   The African National Congress that unseated apartheid rule in
1994 is expected to win the next election easily.
	   But the party says it needs the two-thirds majority in
Parliament to overcome resistance to overhauling social structures.
	   Minority parties nervous about the prospect of one-party rule
have been exploring coalitions with one another, pointing out the
ANC could also change the new democratic constitution with that
amount of power.
	   It is not clear what the ANC would specifically change in the
constitution.
	   Speaking to about 2,000 party faithful, Mandela said the next
vote would represent an effort to deepen democracy.
	   The president has not yet set the election date. Briefing notes
handed to reporters on Saturday said the ANC is ``working on a
likely election date of early May 1999.''
	   The ANC provincial secretary for Gauteng, the home province of
Johannesburg, said local officials are lobbying for early May
because seasonal rains would have stopped and the weather would
still be warm.
	   ``If you open up early and are still standing at 9 at night in
June and July, it's too cold,'' the official, Obed Bapela, told The
Associated Press.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission hopes to register most
voters between Nov. 27 to 29 as it tackles another milestone for
the new democracy _ that of creating a national voters' roll.
	   In 1994, anyone with an identification document could vote
anywhere without registering beforehand. The lack of red tape
helped ease tensions that preceded the country's first democratic
vote.
	   Under the new system, voters must apply for a bar-coded ID
document from government, take a temporary receipt to an assigned
voting station, and return for the permanent ID document in time
for election day.
	   Gauteng, the home province for Johannesburg, has 5 million
eligible voters.
	   Mandela echoed his party's increasingly strident reaction to
criticism over continuing high employment of 34 percent and soaring
crime.
	   ``Not a single government in 346 years has done a tenth of what
the ANC has done'' in delivering housing, water and electricity to
millions of poor blacks, Mandela said.
	   But he chastised officials in the post-1994 government who stole
public funds.
	   ``When we took over in 1994, little did we know that some of our
own people would be as corrupt as the apartheid government,'' he
said.
	   Mandela will retire at age 80 after the vote. His almost certain
successor is Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Mandela as
head of the governing African National Congress in December.
	   Both leaders have sounded warnings that South Africa's formal
reconciliation era will end with Mandela's term. A second ANC-led
government will take stronger steps to improve the lives of
millions of blacks neglected under apartheid, they have said.

Turkey protests Greek-Greek Cypriot military maneuvers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Saturday protested Greek-Greek
Cypriot war games in Cyprus, accusing the Greek side of increasing
tension on the divided island.
	   The six-day maneuvers ``destabilize the security and stability
of Cyprus and of the southern Mediterranean,'' the foreign ministry
said in a statement.
	   Held under the provisions of the 1993 defense pact between
Greece and Cyprus, the war games have raised tensions on the island
with Cyprus accusing Turkish planes of violating its airspace on
Thursday.
	   Turkey denied the accusation.
	   ``The irresponsible attitude of the Greek and Greek Cypriots
shows their insincerity towards U.N. efforts aimed that providing a
secure environment on the island,'' the ministry added.
	   Ann Hercus, the United Nations' resident envoy in Cyprus, has
been holding separate meetings with Turkish and Greek Cypriot
leaders in a bid to restart reunification talks that stalled last
year.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded the island
in 1974 following a short-lived coup of supporters of union with
Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north
is only recognized by Ankara.
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Saturday renewed his
call to the Greek side for an agreement based on recognition of two
separate states.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United
States and China reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for
bringing a permanent peace to the tense and divided Korean
peninsula.
	   The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees to
``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.''
	   Negotiators said they would hold the next round of talks in
Geneva Jan. 18-22 next year.
	   The protracted haggling over even procedural details highlighted
just how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   South Korea and its U.S. ally insisted that while troop
withdrawals can be discussed, they should not be a formal agenda
item.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after reclusive North Korea launched a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people
because of a combination of economic mismanagement, flooding and
drought.

Some 2,000 rally in Madrid against Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Politicians and union leaders joined some
2,000 people for a rally in Madrid on Saturday to demand the
extradition and trial of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``He's a criminal and he must face trial,'' United Left party
leader Julio Anguita said at the rally in the central Puerta del
Sol square. The rally was organized by several human rights
organizations.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for alleged crimes of genocide and
terrorism committed during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Several thousand people of various nationalities, including
Spaniards, died under Pinochet's regime.
	   On Thursday, the National Court, where Garzon works, will begin
discussing whether the Spanish justice system has any jurisdiction
over such crimes following an objection lodged by the court's chief
prosecutor Eduardo Fungarino.
	   A negative ruling would scrap Garzon's probe against Pinochet
while one in favor would spur the judge to make a formal
extradition request to Britain, which would first have to be
approved by the Spanish government.
	   ``Spaniards were killed. Why shouldn't he (Pinochet) face trial
in Spain,'' Anguita said. ``Especially given that in Chile he was
compensated with being made a senator for life.''
	   Antonio Gutierrez, leader of Spain's Workers Commissions labor
union called on Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to back the
extradition.
	   Aznar has said his government will respond only when, and if, an
extradition request is formally made.
	   On Friday, Garzon issued a petition aimed at freezing any
accounts Pinochet might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.
	   The magistrate is to send investigative teams to both countries
to find out if the Pinochet has financial accounts in either and if
so, to try to block them. The measure was sought to cover any
possible compensation payments that might be ordered should
Pinochet be tried in Spain.

British businessman claims new cross-Atlantic record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A British businessman and French skipper sailed
across the Atlantic in record time of just under nine days,
organizers said Saturday, shaving nearly 2 1/2 days off the
previous record.
	   The 146-foot Mari-Cha III, owned by Bob Miller and co-captained
by Jef d'Estiveaud, arrived Saturday off the southwest British
coast eight days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 43 seconds after leaving
New Jersey, organizers said.
	   The time was measured from Ambrose Lighthouse, New Jersey, to
Cape Lizard, England, said Michel Horeau, a spokesman in the French
port of La Trinite-sur-Mer.
	   The French-built Mari-Cha II was to arrive in Falmouth, England
on Saturday afternoon and later sail to La Rochelle, France,
weather permitting, Horeau said.
	   Miller and Estiveau and their dual-masted craft broke the
previous record set in March last year by Swedish skipper Ludde
Ingvall and his boat the Nicorette, of 11 days, 13 hours and 22
minutes.
	   D'Estiveaud and Miller, a millionaire businessman who resides in
Hong Kong, were backed by a crew of more than a dozen members.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A British businessman and French skipper sailed
across the Atlantic in record time of just under nine days,
organizers said Saturday, shaving nearly 2 1/2 days off the
previous record.
	   The 44.7-meter (146-foot) yacht Mari-Cha III, owned by Bob
Miller and co-captained by Jef d'Estiveaud, arrived Saturday off
the southwest British coast eight days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 43
seconds after leaving New Jersey, organizers said.
	   The time _ 17 seconds short of nine days _ was measured from
Ambrose Lighthouse, New Jersey, to Cape Lizard, England, said
Michel Horeau, a spokesman in the French port of La
Trinite-sur-Mer.
	   ``It's really the greatest adventure of my life,'' organizers
quoted Miller as saying by radio. ``Today I am a happy man.''
	   The French-built Mari-Cha II was to arrive in Falmouth, England
on Saturday afternoon and later sail to La Rochelle, France,
weather permitting, Horeau said.
	   The 115-ton yacht suffered some damage from the rough seas, but
Horeau did not elaborate. The yacht is the largest built with
lightweight carbon.
	   Miller and Estiveau and their dual-mast craft broke the previous
record set in March last year by Swedish skipper Ludde Ingvall and
his boat the Nicorette, of 11 days, 13 hours and 22 minutes.
	   D'Estiveaud and Miller, a millionaire businessman who resides in
Hong Kong, were backed by a crew of about 20 members.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Politicians and union leaders joined some
2,000 people for a rally in central Madrid on Saturday to demand
the extradition and trial of former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet.
	   ``He's a criminal and he must face trial,'' United Left party
leader Julio Anguita told reporters at the rally in the central
Puerta del Sol square.
	   The rally was organized by several human rights organizations.
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon as a first step toward his
extradition to stand trial for alleged crimes of genocide and
terrorism committed during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Several thousand people of various nationalities died under
Pinochet's regime.
	   On Thursday, the National Court, where Garzon works, will begin
discussing whether the Spanish justice system has any jurisdiction
over such crimes following an objection lodged by the court's chief
prosecutor Eduardo Fungarino.
	   A negative ruling would scrap Garzon's probe against Pinochet
while one in favor would spur the judge on to making a formal
extradition request to Britain, which would first have to be
approved by the Spanish government.
	   ``Spaniards were killed. Why shouldn't he (Pinochet) face trial
in Spain,'' Anguita said. ``Especially given that in Chile he was
compensated with being made a senator for life.''
	   Antonio Gutierrez, leader of Spain's Workers Commissions labor
union called on Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to back the
extradition.
	   Aznar has said his government will respond only when, and if, an
extradition request is formally made.
	   On Friday, Garzon issued a petition aimed at freezing any
accounts Pinochet might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.
	   The magistrate is to send investigative teams to both countries
to find out if the Pinochet has financial accounts in either and,
if so, to try to block them. The measure was sought to cover any
possible compensation payments that might be ordered should
Pinochet be tried in Spain.

Report: New Russian ICBM blows up in test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Russia's new intercontinental ballistic
missiles exploded shortly after takeoff in a test last week,
casting a shadow on plans to modernize the country's strategic
forces, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Topol-M missile blew up in the first stage of its launch
from the Plesetsk launchpad in Russia's far northwest, falling
harmlessly nearby, Izvestia reported, citing unspecified military
reports.
	   The newspaper said the cause of the failure had not been
determined. It warned that the explosion could have ``a crucial
impact on Russia's defense capability.''
	   Russia plans to replace its existing nuclear missile force with
the single-warhead Topol-M. Under the yet-to-be-ratified START-II
treaty with the United States, the ``heavy'' RS-18 and RS-20
missiles, which have multiple warheads, are to be deactivated by
2007.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said that Russia
must build 35 to 45 Topol-Ms a year starting in 2000 to update its
force. Given the country's woeful economic state, he said, Russia
will have to delay modernizing its conventional forces and give
priority to nuclear weapons.
	   Just to build the Topol-Ms, which cost about dlrs 30 million
apiece, ``will require the concentration of all our resources,'' he
said.
	   Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, head of the strategic rocket forces,
described Thursday's Topol-M launch as the fifth launch of the new
missile, and said it was ``very difficult.'' However, speaking on
national television, he did not mention its failure.
	   Izvestia said helicopter pilots were searching the Arctic tundra
for the remains of the missile.

Negotiators reach deal on the way forward in Korean talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United
States and China reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for
negotiating a permanent peace to the tense and divided Korean
peninsula.
	   The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees to
``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.''
	   Negotiators said they would hold the next round of talks in
Geneva on Jan. 18-22.
	   The protracted haggling over procedural details highlighted just
how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   South Korea and the United States insisted that while troop
withdrawals can be discussed, they should not be a formal agenda
item.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after reclusive North Korea launched a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people
because of a combination of economic mismanagement, flooding and
drought.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United

bringing a permanent peace to one of the world's potential flash
points _ the divided Korean peninsula.
	   The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees to
``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.''
	   Negotiators said they would hold the next round of talks in
Geneva Jan. 18-22 next year. A U.S. official said it was hoped then
to begin the ``substantive work.''
	   The protracted haggling over even procedural details highlighted
just how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   The United States stood by its refusal to put troop withdrawals
on the agenda, the U.S. official told reporters. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   The U.S. official said there was no sign of any change in
tactics or policy of North Korea since the last round of talks.
	   He termed the outcome of the session as a success _ although
added that it was the minimum that had been expected.
	   It took seven hours just to agree the wording on the draft
establishing the subcommittees, according to the U.S. official.
	   The committees will be responsible for drawing up nuts and bolts
proposals which will then be submitted to heads of delegation. They
will not have any negotiating power.
	   The exact membership of the subcommittees has still to be
agreed.
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.

BayStars beat Lions 17-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKOROZAWA, Japan (AP) _ Yokohama BayStars pounded out a Japan
Series-record 20 hits to overwhelm the Seibu Lions 17-5 Saturday,
moving closer to clinch the baseball champion series for the first
time in 38 years.
	   Norihiro Komada, who went 4-for-6, batted in three runs on a
base-clearing triple in the top of the fourth inning, lifting the
BayStars to an early 7-2 lead. He batted in two more runs later in
the game, the fifth of the series.
	   After two defeats in a row, the BayStars took control throughout
the game before 31,760 spectators at Seibu Dome.
	   With Saturday's victory, BayStars now lead the best-of-seven
series 3-2.
	   Komada, a .281 hitter with nine runs in the regular season, now
has six hits in the series.
	   In the eighth inning, the Lions had two home runs _ from Rudy
Pemberton, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, who slammed a two-run
homer and Ken Suzuki who had a solo shot. But they came too late.
	   BayStars starter Takashi Saito gave up eight hits, while
striking out four and walking one in seven innings. He picked up
his second win in the series.
	   The BayStars trounced Seibu in the opening games of the series
and many expected the Central League champs to walk away with the
championship.
	   But a sloppy pitching effort in Game 3 _ in which Yokohama
allowed 11 walks that led to six runs _ put the Lions back into the
game.
	   The BayStars have only gone to the Japan Series once before, in
1960, when they won the series.
	   The Pacific League champion Lions have won the Japan Series
eight times, but lost last year to the Yakult Swallows, four games
to one.
	   Game 6 is scheduled for Monday at Yokohama Marine Stadium.

	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates will likely set up a
stock market in three months, the Central Bank Governor Sultan
al-Suwaidi said Saturday.
	   ``The draft law is ready, everything is ready to set up the
market and I expect it to be finally approved in three months,''
said al-Suwaidi, speaking on the sidelines of a banking conference
in Qatar.
	   Al-Suwaidi said a commission was set up in 1994 to prepare
trading regulations and other procedures for formal stock trading.
	   Stock trading in the Emirates is currently done by informal
brokers via telephone and only Emirates nationals are allowed to
buy and sell stocks.
	   Al-Suwaidi said the commission will decide at a later date
whether or not to allow foreigners to invest in Emirates' stocks.
	   Of the six states that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council only
the Emirates does not have a formal stock market. Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, and Qatar have all opened formal exchanges, and Bahrain and
Oman allow foreign investment in certains stocks.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has decided to jump on the bandwagon of
organizing a shopping festival in order to boost private businesses
and attract more visitors, Al-Watan daily reported Saturday.
	   Jawad Bu Khamseen, an official of the Kuwait Hotel Owners
Association, told the newspaper that the festival, the first of its
kind in this oil-rich state, was being planned for February.
	   Similar functions of shop-till-you-drop extravaganzas have been
successful in Dubai in neighboring United Arab Emirates and also
held in Lebanon and Egypt.
	   Special visiting visas will be issued for those coming to the
festival, Bu Khamseen said.
	   Kuwait's economy, which is dominated by the public sector, has
been hit hard by low oil prices. The Gulf state foresees a net
deficit of 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion) in the fiscal
year 1998-99 that started July 1.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Export and Financing Bank has posted a
net profit of 1.1 million (dlrs 1.5 million) during July-September
this year, officials said Saturday.
	   The bank's reserves were 746,400 dinars (dlrs 1.05 million),
from January through September and clients deposits amounted to
29.1 million dinars (dlrs 40.9 million), 28.7 percent more than
during the same period last year, said a bank official.
	   The bank has a paid up capital of 20 million dinars (dlrs 28
million), and is the first to announce its budget for the third
quarter of 1998, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said bank assets grew by 46.5 percent during the first nine
months of 1998 to 77.1 million dinars (dlrs 108.6 million), and
share holders rights nudged up by 7 million dinars (dlrs 9.8
million) to 17.3 million dinars (dlrs 24.4 million).

Agassi to face Kroslak in Sunday's finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) - Andre Agassi beat Wayne Black of
Zimbabwe 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 in the semifinals of the dlrs 1 million
Czech Indoor ATP tennis tournament Saturday.
	   In Sunday's finals, Agassi will face Jan Kroslak of Slovakia,
who defeated Sweden's Thomas Enqvist when the Swede pulled out of
the match after seven games due to ankle injury.
	   Both Agassi and Black started with patient, powerful baseline
tennis, but Agassi gradually got the upper hand thanks to his
precise returns and broke Black's serve in the sixth game.
	   Black got back into the set two games later when he rebroke and
leveled to 4-4 after several precise volleys.
	   The set was decided in a tie-break, clearly dominated by Agassi,
who allowed the nervous Black just two points.
	   Agassi kept up the pressure in the opening games of the second
set, breaking Black's serve in the third game and gaining a rapid
5-1 lead.
	   Black didn't give up and played several miraculous balls in a
row, breaking Agassi to 2-5 and subsequently winning his own serve,
but Agassi didn't allow any more upsets, winning the match in
straight sets.
	   ``Black didn't surprise me, he is a very competitive player and
I knew it would be difficult,'' Agassi said after the match.
	   By beating Black, Agassi secured a berth in the eight-member ATP
Tour World Championship to be played next month in the German city
of Hanover.
	   In the other semifinal, Jan Kroslak, ranked 153rd on the ATP
Tour, started better. He broke Enqvist's serve in the first game
and seemed on the road to another surprising victory.
	   The Swede looked unfit and called the physician twice in the
opening games to have his right ankle bandage fixed. He finally
pulled out, citing ankle injury.
	   ``I was very surprised,'' said Kroslak, who has made his first
finals of the year.'' I played very well but I can't really count
this as a victory. It's a shame.''

Cash-strapped Pakistan seeks IMF package to avoid default
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is seeking a dlrs 5 billion
bailout package from international donors or it may default on
outstanding debt payments of dlrs 1.4 billion, a senior official
said Saturday.
	   Ahsan Iqbal, the deputy chairman of national planning
commission, told The Associated Press that Pakistan is ``looking
forward'' to negotiating a bailout package with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in coming weeks.
	   ``We are still hopeful that the stalled talks will resume and a
package will be finalized,'' he said.
	   Pakistan's external debt is a massive dlrs 32 billion.
	   Iqbal said Pakistan will need emergency funding of about dlrs 5
billion to meet its financial obligations for the 1998-99 fiscal
year. Of the dlrs 5 billion, Iqbal says dlrs 2 billion would cover
debt rescheduling and the remaining dlrs 3 billion would cover
current accounts.
	   Analysts say Pakistan's economy _ reeling by international
sanctions for its series of nuclear tests in May _ inched closer to
a default after the IMF postponed its loan talks with the
government this week.
	   The IMF delayed its talks after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
announced a 30 percent cut in power rates. The IMF supports
increases in Pakistan's utility rates as a means of generating
revenue.
	   Iqbal says the government is paying its interest on multilateral
debts to avoid a default, but is in a so-called grace period on the
repayments of bilateral loans.
	   ``The situation is no doubt difficult, but we are trying to
manage it,'' Iqbal said.
	   Pakistan foreign exchange reserves slumped to dlrs 542 million
on Oct. 17 from dlrs 602 million on Oct. 10, according to the State
Bank of Pakistan figures.

Pierce upsets Williams, will face Seles in final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mary Pierce upset top-seed Venus Williams in a
slamfest semifinal of the Kremlin Cup on Saturday, and Monica Seles
eventually overpowered a stubborn Sabine Testud to continue a
three-month hot streak.
	   Williams came out strong against Pierce, the fifth-seed from
France, breaking her serve in the fourth and seventh games to
finish the first set at 6-2.
	   But the 23-year-old Pierce pushed up her play a notch in the
second set and Williams's knee began to bother her. Pierce, clearly
the crowd favorite, took the last five games of the second set to
finish 6-2.
	   She ended the set with three aces, and charged ahead again in
the third, after Williams, of the United States, double-faulted
twice to go down 0-2.
	   Williams called for a trainer immediately after the game,
complaining of knee trouble. She appeared weak for the rest of the
match, and Pierce, ranked No. 11, cleaned up the set 6-0 without
giving Williams a point in the last three games.
	   After the match, Williams said her knee had been a problem
throughout the match. ``I wasn't doing the movement I normally
do,'' she said. ``I've been playing so many weeks now ... I think
it just wore on my knee.''
	   The victory was the first time Pierce had beaten Williams in a
full match. Williams, No. 5 in the world, has beaten Pierce twice
in straight sets, the second time last week at the European
championships in Zurich, but dropped out of a match earlier this
year.
	   In the other semifinals match, second-seeded Monica Seles of the
United States overpowered Sandrine Testud, capitalizing on the
26-year-old Frenchwoman's frequent errors.
	   The first set saw Seles break serve in the second game and then
hold on to win the set 6-3 despite committing three double faults
to Testud's two aces.
	   But in the second set, the 26-year-old Testud gave Seles more
trouble, breaking her in the fourth game with an ace, one of five
over the match.
	   In the tiebreaker, however, Testud double faulted twice after
going up 4-2, and drove a backhand into the net to lose the match
at 9-7.
	   Seles was relieved with Testud's unforced errors, after having
been pushed around by her fierce serves in the rest of the match.
	   ``I was unhappy that I had to go to the third set because if you
give Sandrine a window, she takes it,'' Seles said. ``In the second
set she gave me those two double faults, which I was very surprised
at.''
	   Pierce faces an uphill battle against Seles in the final of the
dlrs 1 million tournament. She has one win and five losses against
the 24-year-old American, who has won 16 of her last 17 matches and
two of the last three tournaments.
	   In semifinals doubles action, Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs
upset top-seeded partners Cara Black and Irina Selyutina, 6-3, 7-5.

Protesters call for Pinochet to be tried; senator says he is ill

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 150 protesters gathered Saturday at the
London hospital where former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is
under arrest to demand that he be tried for genocide.
	   A visiting Chilean senator said Pinochet's health is
deteriorating.
	   In driving wind and rain, protesters beat drums and tamborines
and chanted, ``We want justice'' outside the private London Clinic,
where Pinochet, 82, is recovering from back surgery while his
lawyers fight a Spanish extradition warrant.
	   Protesters included 35 Chilean exiles who traveled from France.
Others came from Switzerland, Sweden and Spain.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet, whose rule was marked by human rights abuses and a
climate of fear, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful
spinal disorder which had hindered his movement and the Chilean
government has urged Britain to release him on humanitarian
grounds.
	   Chilean senator Ignacio Perez-Walker told reporters outside the
clinic after visiting Pinochet Saturday that the former leader ``is
a very strong man.''
	   ``However, his health appears very, very detiorated,'' said
Perez-Walker. ``We spoke very briefly and he was very calm,'' he
said, adding that Pinochet was only informed 48 hours ago that he
was under arrest.
	   Chile has also argued that Pinochet, as a senator, is entitled
to diplomatic immunity.
	   On Friday night, Pinochet's wife appealed for his release,
saying he is too sick to be stand trial.
	   ``This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia
Pinochet told a Chilean TV crew outside a Roman Catholic church in
London, where she had been to pray.
	   ``I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very,
very, very, ill.''
	   She said many Chileans support her husband, who is recovering
slowly. ''Everybody has expressed a lot of loyalty and warmth, if
there have been any wrong things they have just been emotional
reactions,'' she said.
	   ''I would say despite the fact that he can't defend himself
because he's in bed and very sick, he still has the strength that
all Chileans know him for and he is now thanking them through me
and later he will do it personally,'' she said.

Philippines' Cardinal Sin discharged from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's politically active Roman
Catholic archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, was discharged Saturday
from a hospital where he had been treated for nearly four weeks for
an infection complicated by pneumonia.
	   ``He's OK now,'' said a nurse who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Many patients greeted the 70-year-old prelate as he left the
hospital.
	   Sin, who undergoes kidney dialysis several times a week, was
hospitalized Sept. 28 with fever and stomach pains after a tube
inserted in his peritoneum, the membrane lining the abdominal
cavity, apparently introduced bacteria into his system.
	   His hospitalization was later extended after he developed
pneumonia, and his condition was reported as worrisome.
	   While he was confined, visitors including former President
Corazon Aquino were not allowed to speak to him directly, and had
to use a telephone from a nearby room because he was prone to
infection, the nurse said.
	   Doctors had to wear gowns and gloves when they went to check on
him, she said.
	   Sin helped catapult Mrs. Aquino to power in 1986 by calling on
citizens to support a military revolt against strongman Ferdinand
Marcos. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in the streets,
forcing Marcos from power.
	   He continues to be heavily involved in political and social
issues in the Philippines, Asia's only predominantly Catholic
country.

Yeltsin says Russia will keep nukes safe despite money troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin insisted Russia will find the cash
to keep its nuclear facilities safe despite the current economic
crisis, and vowed that the country would not abandon market
reforms, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``We understand full well that there must be no saving on''
nuclear power plant safety or nuclear weapons safety, Yeltsin told
the prominent Austrian daily Neue Kronen Zeitung.
	   Concerns about nuclear safety have mounted since Russia's
economic crisis hit in August. Workers at nuclear plants and
research centers have held protests demanding months of unpaid
wages and Yeltsin's resignation.
	   Calls for the president to step down have grown louder in recent
weeks, especially after he had to cut short his first foreign trip
in months because he fell ill.
	   Yet despite a respiratory infection, Yeltsin has shown up in
recent days at the Kremlin. He spent Saturday resting at his
country house, his press service said.
	   In the interview, Yeltsin promised Russia would overcome the
crisis through democratic means.
	   ``We will not step back from ... reforms ... or further
democratization of society. This is our main strategic goal,'' he
said.
	   Russia's government has yet to come up with a comprehensive plan
for battling the two-month-old crisis. Yeltsin has played an
increasingly marginal role in leading the country in recent weeks,
leaving the key economic decisions up to his prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a marked departure from the Kremlin's earlier assurances that
Yeltsin was in fine health, his spokesman said Friday that Yeltsin
is battling to serve out his presidential term despite health
problems.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has suffered health problems for years, including
heart bypass surgery in 1996. Yeltsin insists that he will serve
out the final two years of his term and denies speculation that he
has serious health problems.

Official: Russia's Gazprom ready to lower price of gas for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Russia's gas giant Gazprom is ready to
supply its gas to Ukraine next year at a cheaper price, a top
industry official said Saturday.
	   The new price of gas is to be finally agreed during negotiations
between Gazprom and Ukrainian government officials in Moscow next
week, said Ihor Bakai, head of Ukraine's state oil and gas
monopoly, Naftogaz Ukrainy.
	   Under the 1998 Ukrainian-Russian gas deal, Gazprom set the price
of its gas reaching Ukraine's borders at dlrs 50 per 1,000 cubic
meters.
	   That price was lowered from previous years' level in exchange
for Ukraine's introduction of lower tariffs for transporting
Russian gas through its territory to Western Europe.
	   However, Ukraine was actively negotiating with Gazprom in the
past two months to further reduce the price.
	   The expected agreement on the new, lower price of Russian gas is
the result of ``complete understanding, complete clarity'' between
Naftogaz Ukrainy and Gazprom, Bakai told the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, and it
imports about 70 percent of its supply from Russia.
	   The country owes Russia hundreds of millions of dollars for gas
supplied in previous years, and the two sides regularly conduct
tense negotiations over payment of the debt.
	   Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko
recently put his country's gas debt to Russia at dlrs 740 million,
down from dlrs 1.2 billion at the beginning of 1998.

	   RESNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Living in utter despair, Ramadan
Bajraktari and his wife and five young children huddle against a
thickly forested hillside, hiding from the Serb police who drove
them from their nondescript hamlet in central Kosovo three months
ago.
	   ``We slaughtered our cows, now we are living on a little milk
and some flour given to us by our neighbors down the hill,'' said
Bajraktari, so poorly off he doesn't even have the ubiquitous sheet
plastic that tens of thousands of refugees around the country use
to build rudimentary shelters.
	   On Saturday, the ``lost villagers'' of Resnik _ the Bajraktaris
and seven other ethnic Albanian families _ were ``found.'' For the
first time they got a truckload of food, blankets and, of course,
plastic.
	   If these people were ``lost,'' said Laura Boldrini of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees who ``found'' them on Friday, it's
because they wanted to be lost. Their fear of the Serb police drove
them into hiding.
	   ``These people will never survive the winter,'' Ms. Boldrini
said quietly, as roughly two weeks' worth of aid, provided by the
World Food Program and Mercy Corps International, was unloaded from
the single white truck.
	   ``It's one of the worst cases I have ever seen. None of us could
survive here one week. They have been here three months.''
	   The forest people of Resnik are just a few of the nearly 300,000
displaced in Kosovo _ including tens of thousands living in the
open _ who face a grim winter. They are victims of the seven-month
conflict between the Serb army and special police forces and the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   It's eerily quiet here in the forest, 60 kilometers (40 miles)
west of Kosovo's capital Pristina and not far from Resnik. People
speak in low voices. A few cows stand soundlessly, obscured by
brush and trees and barely visible though just 10 meters away.
Brown-eyed children blink and stare as bundles of blankets and
clothes, sacks of flour, packages of pasta, sugar, containers of
jam and cooking oil are divided into piles.
	   Serb police are thick on the surrounding roads. Sandbag bunkers
dot the region. None of the refugees will budge until they are
gone.
	   Some have tried to return to Resnik, but each time they do,
police open fire, the refugees say.
	   ``They shelled my house,'' said Bajraktar. ``It is destroyed. A
few days ago we tried to go back and they shot at us. I'm not
talking politics. I just can't go home.''
	   Asked if he is prepared to spend the winter under the trees with
his family, he responds with a wan smile and a shrug.
	   ``Where can we go? It doesn't depend on us.''
	   Hysen Havoli farmed two hectares (five acres) outside Resnik, a
hard life even without war and vengeance. He holds back the flap of
oilcloth, perhaps taken from the kitchen table of a more prosperous
time, and shows a visitor the straw bed inside his hut made of
branches. The oilcloth doesn't keep out the rain. Nor do the
branches.
	   The women and children have to walk more than a kilometer (about
half a mile) to get water.
	   Havoli said the Serbs didn't burn his house as they did those of
many of his neighbors, but they took everything inside it and some
of his cattle.
	   ``We have here only what we were able to carry,'' he said as two
of his unwashed children looked on. ``Everything else was stolen.''
	   The Resnik villagers watch carefully for police patrols.
	   ``If they catch us, they will kill us all,'' he said.
	   The sky Saturday is iron gray. Temperatures are dropping.
	   ``I hope we don't have to stay the winter,'' Havoli said,
casting his eyes upward. ``I hope somebody gets us out of here. But
where would we go?''
	   The people in the forest have vaguely heard about the 2,000
``verifiers'' who are supposed to arrive soon to monitor the
agreement struck between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The prospect doesn't move
them.
	   ``We listen to a bit of news on our neighbor's radio. We have a
little hope. But not much.''

Guinea-Bissau's rebels announce cease-fire, demand withdrawal of
</HEADLINE>
troops &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebels have announced a
48-hour cease-fire in the tiny west African country, demanding the
withdrawal of foreign troops supporting President Joao Bernardo
Vieira, officials said Saturday.
	   Portugal's foreign minister traveled Saturday to Guinea-Bissau
aiming to halt a slide back to civil war, one week after the former
Portuguese colony's conflict restarted.
	   Jaime Gama was to fly into the capital Bissau's airport, which
rebels have held for almost five months.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau's authorities expressed interest in the
Portuguese minister's presence,'' Horacio Cesar, spokesman for the
Portuguese Foreign Ministry, said by phone in Lisbon.
	   He declined to give any details of Gama's agenda.
	   There were no reports of fighting in the capital Saturday,
following the rebels' call for a 48-hour cease-fire late Friday,
Cesar said.
	   The rebels gave Vieira until Sunday afternoon to agree to the
withdrawal of more than 3,000 heavily-armed troops deployed by
neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea to support his
government.
	   Vieira had announced a unilateral government cease-fire
Wednesday, but the rebels wanted guarantees before entering into
peace talks.
	   Fighting restarted last Sunday when the rebels, mostly army
veterans angered by poor pay and conditions, advanced on the center
of Bissau, towards the presidential palace.
	   Troops loyal to Vieira held them back in the capital's downtown,
while the army dissidents gained ground throughout the impoverished
country's interior.
	   The foes entered a July 26 cease-fire brokered by negotiators
from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries. The mediators
discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and military
observers, but no deal was reached.
	   The military rebellion in early June followed Brig. Ansumane
Mane's dismissal as army chief, for allegedly running guns to
separatist fighters in Senegal's southern Casamance province.

Saturday launched the election campaign of his Hindu nationalist
party that governs Delhi province, trying to fight its sagging
image ahead of local elections.
	   From a massive onion shortage to a series of power outages and a
crippling strike by commuter buses, the Bharatiya Janata Party
government in the state has been slammed as a failure by rivals as
the campaign picks up for the November 25 election for the Delhi
state assembly.
	   The opposition has now accused the government of trying to taint
secular India's education system with the Hindu nationalist party's
ideology _ a controversy that has figured among the largely local
issues in the campaign.
	   But Vajpayee slammed the main opposition Congress Party at a
public rally in New Delhi attended by thousands, saying it was
trying to paint his group as a villain before Hindu-majority
India's religious minorities.
	   He said his party's opponents were ``scared and shaken,'' Press
Trust of India reported.
	   ``The Congress has tried to create a false impression in the
minds of the minority communities regarding the BJP,'' Vajpayee was
quoted as saying by the United News of India.
	   But more than any issue, the election is haunted by the steep
rise in the prices of onion _ India's staple vegetable _ which shot
up 700 percent in some places.
	   The BJP sacked its chief minister Saheb Singh Verma earlier this
month amid widespread protests over the price rise, and replaced
him with Sushma Swaraj, one of India's most popular women
politicians.
	   Verma had been the target of several popular protests as
residents of New Delhi, India's capital, suffered a severe power
crisis in the summer, a stretched-out strike by thousands of
private commuter buses, a spurt in incidents of mugging, theft and
murders, and the onion price spurt.
	   A bad crop and massive hoarding by traders has cranked up prices
from the normal eight rupees (20 cents) a kilogram to about 60
rupees (dlrs 1.4). Emergency onion imports had to be ordered from
the Persian Gulf countries, but the shortage has not been fully
met.

Polish government passes 1999 budget

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After an 11-hour overnight debate, the
Solidarity-led government passed a 1999 budget plan Saturday that
targets economic growth and reforms in line with Poland's goal of
joining the European Union.
	   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of harsh but
effective 1989 reforms that gave post-communist Poland its market
economy, called the new budget ``responsible'' and praised it for
encouraging Poland's development.
	   The plan pegs growth at 5.1 percent of gross domestic product
GDP and the deficit at 2.4 percent. It awaits approval from
parliament and from President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   Responding to public concerns about rising crime, the government
plans a 18.9 percent increase in spending for the justice system
and a 7.7 percent increase for public security.
	   Education, scientific research, transportation and road
construction will see funding increase by between 5.1 and 11.5
percent. Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said funds also are guaranteed
for reforms of health care and the pension system.
	   About 325 million zlotys (dlrs 95.5 million) was earmarked for
Poland's integration with NATO, expected next April.
	   The total budget is estimated at 129.28 billion zlotys (dlrs 38
billion). That figure is 15 billion zloty (dlrs 4.4 billion) lower
than this year, because of the transfer of some funds to local
governments under a reform effective Jan. 1 designed to trim
centralized bureaucracy.

Nobel laureate Trimble takes tough line on IRA arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout for AMs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize laureate
David Trimble promised his pivotal Protestant party Saturday that
he won't share power with Sinn Fein politicians unless their IRA
allies start disarming.
	   Northern Ireland's peace process is facing a crisis of
confidence over whether the Irish Republican Army or Trimble's
feuding Ulster Unionist Party will make the next critical
concession on the road to enacting April's compromise accord.
	   Inside a packed, sweltering hotel ballroom in Northern Ireland's
second-largest city, Trimble presented a blunt bottom line that
managed largely to unite the Ulster Unionist grassroots at the
party's annual conference. He received two standing ovations and no
heckling, even though most of his nine colleagues in British
Parliament oppose the accord, a sign of the party's profound
divisions.
	   Rejecting the arguments of moderate Catholic leader John Hume,
who shared this year's Nobel honors, Trimble emphasized that Sinn
Fein had no automatic right to take part in a new multi-party
administration, the intended centerpiece of the accord that
Catholics want to be formed by next weekend.
	   Trimble cited key clauses in the agreement requiring all
would-be government ministers to demonstrate their commitment to
``exclusively peaceful means'' or ``be excluded or removed from
office.''
	   ``If they want to be included,'' Trimble said of Sinn Fein and
the IRA, ``they must show that they mean to use only peaceful
methods. And that's easy. They need only to fulfill their
obligations, to decommission weapons in a verifible and credible
manner.''
	   While April's accord set a mid-2000 deadline for the IRA to
disarm, Trimble noted that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had
promised _ in a letter provided as Trimble's price for supporting
the accord _ to seek IRA disarmament far sooner.
	   ``Throughout this process, (the British) government has
postponed this issue to the next stage and government has made
promises. But this now is the last stage,'' Trimble warned.
	   A motion committing the Ulster Unionists not to admit Sinn Fein
into government unless the IRA conducted ``meaningful and
verifiable'' disarmament passed with only two dissenting votes.
	   Several activists critical of Trimble's leadership argued that
the IRA must cease to exist, an even more unlikely prospect, before
they would accept Sinn Fein.
	   ``For an unrepentant IRA to be invited into government would be
akin to Hitler being invited into synagogue,'' said Peter Weir, a
former Trimble supporter who this month launched a pressure group
within the party committed to stiffening Ulster Unionist resolve
against compromise.
	   Weir, like Trimble a lawyer, argued that Sinn Fein shouldn't be
``let off the hook'' if the IRA offered a ``token'' amount of arms.
	   Referring to August's car bombing by IRA dissidents that killed
29 people and wounded 370 in Omagh _ the worst terrorist strike in
Northern Ireland history _ Weir said the IRA could easily commit
``100 more Omaghs.''
	   ``We're not interested in a scaled-down IRA. We want to see a
defunct IRA,'' Weir said.
	   Weir symbolizes the fragility of Trimble's hold over party
policy within Northern Ireland's new 108-member legislative
Assembly, which voters elected in June and which must endorse any
new administration.
	   Such key votes require majority support from both the Assembly's
Protestant and Catholic blocs, a rule designed to ensure that
neither side can impose its will on the other. But Trimble commands
at most 30 Protestant votes, while 28 hard-liners from other
Protestant parties are already committed to thwarting him.

Rios withdrawal puts Haas in final; Corretja downs Ferreira

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ The Lyon Grand Prix saw its second major
injury victim on Saturday when world No. 2 Marcelo Rios picked up a
left hamstring strain during his semifinal match against Tommy
Haas.
	   Rios pulled out of the match after 31 minutes, while trailing
2-6, 0-1.
	   In Sunday's final, Haas will meet No. 4 seed Alex Corretja of
Spain, who eased past South African Wayne Ferreira 6-3, 6-2 in the
other semifinal.
	   Rios' withdrawal means that Haas has benefited from two
walkovers at the dlrs 750,000 event: world No. 1 Pete Sampras
pulled out of the competition hours before he was due to face Haas
in Friday's quarterfinal.
	   ``I felt a strain in my thigh early in the match,'' the Chilean
told reporters. ``Now, I need to rest for a couple of days and see
what happens.''
	   Rios, who has had injury problems with his left thigh since his
days as a junior player, said that the conditions at Lyon might
have aggravated an old injury.
	   ``When I come to play on a hard surface like this it is really
tough,'' he said.
	   Tournament physio Per Bastholt said that Rios is doubtful to be
fit next week, but should be back for the Paris Open, which begins
Nov. 2.
	   ``It's a light strain. But he was wise to stop and not injure
himself more,'' Bastholt said.
	   Haas took the initiative in the fifth game of the first set,
when Rios, trailing 2-3, double-faulted at 30-40 to hand his
opponent the first break of the match.
	   Growing in confidence, the German went on to win the next seven
points and take the first set in just 23 minutes.
	   ``I have been very lucky this week,'' Haas said. ``But don't
forget that I had to win matches to reach the quarterfinal,'' Haas
said.
	   Earlier in the tournament Haas, 20, beat No. 8 seed Fabrice
Santoro - the player that beat him in last year's Lyon final.
	   Corretja looked in top form against Ferreira, who beat No. 2
seed Patrick Rafter here in the quarterfinals.
	   The Spaniard, who had never won two straight indoor matches
before the Lyon event, said he has much more confidence on carpet.
	   ``I came here to play one match at a time and I am a little
surprised to get to the final,'' he said. ``Everyone used to say I
was only a clay court player. I have been working very hard to
improve my indoor game and now that effort is paying off.''

Constable accused of raping woman in a police station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A police constable accused of raping a
woman at a police station will appear in court for a hearing
Tuesday.
	   Investigators said that constable David Henry stopped a female
motorist and issued her a traffic ticket on Oct. 10 at about 3 a.m.
while he was off duty. He allegedly went to her house later and
told her she had to come to the police station for further
questioning.
	   Henry is accused of raping the woman at the police station.
While he was being questioned about the incident two days later, he
slipped out of the station and disappeared for six days before he
surrendered himself, investigators said.
	   Resident magistrate Norma McIntosh ordered Henry held without
bail until his hearing Tuesday because of the charge of escaping
police custody.

Dictator's cars and wines not to go on sale _ yet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The wine collection of former
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and a wardrobe of mink furs
belonging to his wife won't go on sale until next year, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Ever since the government decided last summer that cars, boats,
wines and other luxury odds and ends belonging to the Ceausescus
would be auctioned off, inquiries have flooded in from Japan,
Australia and Europe.
	   But Prime Minister Radu Vasile said the auction has not yet been
authorized by government decree, Libertatea daily reported.
	   ``The auction process is temporarily interrupted,'' government
spokesman Nicolae Nica told the newspaper, adding he hoped the
approval needed for the auction to proceed would come next spring.
	   A luxury package offering tourists the opportunity to stay in
one of Ceausescu's dozens of palaces for a few thousand dollars per
night _ which prompted interest from European travel agencies _ has
also been shelved, pending government approval, said Nica.
	   Among the items to be auctioned off when the giant estate sale
does come about are an Buick Electra given to Ceausescu by former
U.S. President Richard Nixon.
	   Although not ready to open up the bidding, the government also
opened an internet site for browsers (http://ceausecu.ines.ro).
Money from the sales is to go to the state budget.
	   Ceausescu and his wife Elena were shot dead after a summary
trial on Dec. 25, 1989. They ruled Romania for 25 years, living in
utmost luxury while most of Romania's 23 million people endured
food rations, unheated, badly lit and cramped apartments.

Palestinian journalists call strike to protest curbs on coverage

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip
decided Saturday to go on strike to protest restrictions by the
Palestinian Authority on their news coverage.
	   The move came a day after Palestinian police detained a dozen
journalists in Gaza City who were waiting to interview Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas,
about the signing of a new Mideast peace deal.
	   The journalists were told that effective immediately, they
needed permission from the Palestinian Authority to cover events
dealing with politics or security, in effect restricting access to
both Palestinian officials and opposition figures like Yassin.
	   The Gaza City-based Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said in a
statement Saturday its members would not accept the restrictions
and had decided to halt news coverage of the Palestinian Authority
in Gaza in retaliation.
	   The statement also called on the Palestinian security apparatus
to stop any mistreatment of reporters and asked that all
international press groups pressure the Palestinian leadership to
respect press freedom.
	   Journalists also planned to hold a sit-in in the syndicate until
the curbs were rescinded.
	   There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.
	   Among those held for more than an hour by the Palestinian
security forces on Friday were reporter Ibrahim Barzak and
photographer Adel Hanna, both on assignment for The Associated
Press.
	   All the detained journalists were forced to hand over their
equipment, including mobile phones, tape recorders and cameras.
	   They were also told to appear at police headquarters on
Saturday, but a representative of syndicate went instead.
	   Yassin himself denounced the restrictions, saying the
Palestinian Authority ``will have prevented the media from
transmitting the voice of opposition.''
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, Yassin called that a
violation of free speech and of what he called ``the banner of
democracy'' brandished by Yasser Arafat's government.
	   The head of the syndicate, Zakaria Talmas, sought a meeting with
Ghazi Jebali, who heads the security apparatus in the
Palestinian-run areas. However, he was told Jebali was busy in
meetings and did not have time to see him.

Basque voters take breather before election day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Voters in Spain's Basque region spent an
official ``day of reflection'' Saturday ahead of a regional
election seen as crucial for starting a peace process to end 30
years of separatist strife.
	   The armed separatist group ETA, which set the tone for the
campaign five weeks ago by declaring a cease-fire in its drive for
an independent homeland, was set to grab the limelight again on the
eve of Sunday's voting. Several of its members were expected to
appear in a taped program broadcast by the BBC to discuss the
cease-fire.
	   Spanish newspapers said that one of the members on the program
discussed a ``political scenario'' in which the group might
consider laying down its arms for good. The papers said the
interview was taped a month ago, shortly after the cease-fire took
effect on Sept. 18.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they were all of limited
duration. This is the first open-ended one and many Spaniards see
it as the best opportunity in years to end one of Western Europe's
last regional conflicts.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar traveled to the Basque country
Friday night with a delegation of six Cabinet ministers in a
last-minute push for candidates of his center-right Popular Party
seeking seats in the 75-member Basque parliament here in Vitoria.
	   Speaking at a rally in Vitoria, Aznar warned against what he
called the ``adventures'' of some Basque nationalists seeking
independence from Spain.
	   ``No adventures in the Basque country,'' he said. ``There will
be none. This land will not see adventures that take it nowhere.''
	   Aznar also repeated his call for ETA to publicly accept the
results of the elections and lay down its arms. He has said ETA
must meet these conditions for a peace process to begin in earnest.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   The government has shied from reacting generously to the rebels'
cease-fire. It has moved four of the some 500 ETA prisoners to
jails in the Basque country in a token gesture to a longstanding
demand of the separatist group.
	   Aznar hopes a strong showing by the Popular Party and other
non-nationalist groups, like the opposition Socialists, will give
him greater leverage against nationalists in the Basque region as
he seeks a lasting settlement to the separatist problem.
	   The region's biggest party is the mainstream Basque Nationalist
Party, which is expected to again finish first in the voting but
fall short of a majority. It would then be forced to seek coalition
allies.
	   One question is whether the ETA cease-fire will translate into
greater support for the Basque Nationalist Party and ETA's
political wing, Herri Batasuna. The two held months of talks this
year that led to the truce, and they are hoping to reap dividends
at the polls.
	   ``We will be the big surprise on election day,'' said one of
Herri Batasuna's candidates, Jone Goirizelaia.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party says it shares ETA's goal of
independence but opposes violence as the way to achieve it.
Instead, it wants to work through Spain's existing institutions to
secede.

	   The Gaza City-based Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said in a
statement Saturday its members would not accept the restrictions
and had decided to halt news coverage of the Palestinian Authority
in Gaza in retaliation.
	   The statement also called on the Palestinian security apparatus
to stop mistreatment of reporters and called on international
journalism groups to pressure the Palestinian leadership to respect
press freedom.
	   Journalists also planned to hold a sit-in at the syndicate until
the curbs were rescinded.
	   There was no comment from Palestinian officials.
	   Among those held for more than an hour by the Palestinian
security forces on Friday were reporter Ibrahim Barzak and
photographer Adel Hanna, both on assignment for The Associated
Press.
	   All the detained journalists were forced to hand over their
equipment, including mobile phones, tape recorders and cameras.
	   They were also told to appear at police headquarters on
Saturday, but a representative of syndicate went instead.
	   Yassin himself denounced the restrictions, saying the
Palestinian Authority ``will have prevented the media from
transmitting the voice of opposition.''
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, Yassin called that a
violation of free speech and of what he called ``the banner of
democracy'' brandished by Yasser Arafat's government.

Helicopter with three people missing near Mount Everest

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A Russian-built M17 helicopter on a
rescue mission is missing near Mount Everest with three people
aboard, the state-run Radio Nepal said Saturday.
	   The pilot of the Asian Airlines helicopter made the last radio
contact at 11:26 a.m. local time (0540 GMT) Saturday, just three
minutes after takeoff from the Lukla Airport situated at 2,800
meters (9,240 feet), the radio said.
	   The helicopter was on its way to pick up a dead body at Jiri, a
10-minute flight from the airport, and fly it to the capital
Katmandu, mountain guide Rinji Karma Sherpa said by telephone from
Lukla.
	   Five other rescue helicopters are combing the area for the
missing aircraft but have not been able to find it, he said.
	   The pilot has been identified as S. Rana. The two others on the
craft were identified as A.P. Sherpa and J.N. Sunwar.

Mozambique starts first AIDS self help, lobbying group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ A group of 41 people who are HIV
positive launched this southern African country's first self help
and lobbying group for victims of the immuno-deficiency disease.
	   ``The Mozambican people must believe that AIDS is a reality and
they should know that it is not a foreign disease,'' said Salvador
Mazive last week.
	   The group's name, Kindlimuca, means ``awake'' in an unspecified
local dialect. It will push for elimination of discrimination
against HIV victims in work, school and medical care, and for
public education.
	   Mozambique's Health Minister Aurelio Zilhao attended Thursday's
kickoff meeting, signalling a top official awareness of the HIV
problem that is rare in African countries.
	   Africa south of the Sahara has two-thirds of the world's people
infected with the AIDS virus, or 21 million. But overwhelmed with
poverty and basic health issues like clean water, officials have
been slow to respond.
	   Zilhao said that 2,191 new cases of AIDS were diagnosed in
Mozambique during the first six months of the year. An estimated
1.4 million of the 15.7 million population are HIV positive, he
said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United
States and China reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for
bringing a permanent peace to one of the world's potential flash
points _ the divided Korean peninsula.
	   The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees to
``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.''
	   Negotiators said they would hold the next round of talks in
Geneva Jan. 18-22 next year. A U.S. official said it was hoped then
to begin the ``substantive work.''
	   The protracted haggling over even procedural details highlighted
just how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   After the meeting, North Korean officials insisted they hadn't
changed their position, saying troop withdrawal and a peace
agreement with the United States are still among their fundamental
demands.
	   The United States stood by its refusal to put troop withdrawals
on the agenda, the U.S. official told reporters. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   The U.S. official said there was no sign of any change in
tactics or policy of North Korea since the last round of talks.
	   He termed the outcome of the session as a success _ although
added that it was the minimum expected.
	   It took seven hours just to agree the wording on the draft
establishing the subcommittees, according to the U.S. official.
	   The committees will be responsible for drawing up nuts and bolts
proposals which will then be submitted to heads of delegation. They
will not have any negotiating power.
	   The exact membership of the subcommittees and the details of
what they will discuss has still to be agreed.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said South Korea believed ``big progress''
had been made in setting up the two sub-committees. They will
discuss ``concrete and substantive issues'' relating to
establishment of peace and reduction of tension, he said.
	   ``With the launch and operation of the sub-committees, we hope
to initiate a long-awaited and eagerly sought in-depth
discussion,'' he said.
	   Park said the South Korean government was prepared to play a
more proactive role in future talks, but declined to be specific.
Any items could be brought into the process for discussion, he
said.
	   China is also ``open to any ideas'' for inclusion in January's
discussions, Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian told reporters.
	   ``Now we have passed the stage of discussing procedural
matters,'' he said. ``It has been a tangible result.''
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after reclusive North Korea launched a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people
because of a combination of economic mismanagement, flooding and
drought.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting eased in Guinea-Bissau after
rebels announced a 48-hour cease-fire in the tiny west African
country, demanding that President Joao Bernardo Vieira present a
negotiating agenda and ``clarify his position on the presence of
foreign troops,'' news reports said Saturday.
	   The rebels gave Vieira until Sunday afternoon to present an
agenda for talks and explain the presence of ``aggressor''
Senegalese and Guinean troops in Guinea-Bissau and their ``imminent
reinforcement,'' the Portuguese daily newspaper Publico reported.
	   The rebels have previously demanded the foreign troops'
withdrawal while the government demands the rebels lay their
weapons down.
	   Vieira announced a unilateral government cease-fire Wednesday,
but the rebels want guarantees before entering into peace talks.
	   Neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent hundreds of
heavily-armed troops to back Vieira shortly after the conflict
began June 7 following Brig. Ansumane Mane's dismissal as army
chief for allegedly running guns to separatist fighters in
Senegal's southern Casamance province.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister traveled Saturday to Guinea-Bissau
aiming to halt a slide back to civil war, a week after the former
Portuguese colony's conflict restarted, officials said.
	   Jaime Gama was to fly into the capital Bissau's airport, which
rebels have held for almost five months, a spokesman for the
Portuguese Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau's authorities expressed interest in the
Portuguese minister's presence,'' Horacio Cesar said by phone in
Lisbon.
	   He declined to give any details of Gama's agenda.
	   Cesar said there were no reports of fighting in the capital
following the rebel cease-fire announcement late Friday.
	   Fighting restarted last Sunday when the rebels, mostly army
veterans angered by poor pay and conditions, advanced on the center
of Bissau, toward the presidential palace.
	   Troops loyal to Vieira held them back in the capital's downtown,
while the army dissidents gained ground throughout the impoverished
country's interior.
	   The foes had entered a July 26 cease-fire brokered by
negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries.
The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers, but no deal was reached.
	   Aid workers estimate that about half the country's population of
1 million has been displaced since the conflict began.

Basque voters take breather before election day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Putting the clamor of campaigning behind
them, voters in Spain's Basque region spent an official ``day of
reflection'' Saturday ahead of a regional election seen as crucial
for starting a peace process to end 30 years of separatist strife.
	   The armed separatist group ETA, which set the tone for the
campaign five weeks ago by declaring a cease-fire in its drive for
an independent homeland, was set to grab the limelight again on the
eve of the voting. Several of its members were expected to appear
in a taped program broadcast by Britain's British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) to discuss the ceasefire.
	   Spanish newspapers said one of the members was also to discuss a
``political scenario'' in which the group might consider laying
down its arms for good. The papers said the interview was taped a
month ago, shortly after the cease-fire took effect on Sept. 18.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they were all of limited
duration. This is the first open-ended one and many Spaniards see
it as the best opportunity in years to end one of Western Europe's
last regional conflicts.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar traveled to the Basque country
Friday night with a delegation of six Cabinet ministers in a
last-minute push for candidates of his center-right Popular Party
seeking seats in the 75-member Basque parliament here in Vitoria.
	   Speaking at a rally in Vitoria, Aznar warned against what he
called the ``adventures'' of some Basque nationalists seeking
independence from Spain.
	   ``No adventures in the Basque country,'' he said. ``There will
be none. This land will not see adventures that take it nowhere.''
	   Aznar also repeated his call for ETA to publicly accept the
results of the elections and lay down its arms. The premier has
said ETA must meet these conditions for a peace process to begin in
earnest.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   So far the government has shied from reacting generously to the
cease-fire. It has moved four of the some 500 ETA prisoners to
jails in the Basque country in a token gesture to a long-standing
demand of the separatist group.
	   Aznar hopes a strong showing by the Popular Party and other
non-nationalist groups, like the opposition Socialists, will give
him greater leverage against nationalists in the Basque region as
he seeks a lasting settlement to the separatist problem.
	   The region's biggest party is the mainstream Basque Nationalist
Party, which is expected to again finish first in the voting but
fall short of a majority and thus have to seek coalition allies.
	   The big question mark is whether the ETA ceasefire will
translate into greater support for the Basque Nationalist Party and
ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna. The two held months of talks
this year that led to the truce, and they are hoping to reap
dividends at the polls.
	   ``We will be the big surprise on election day,'' said one of
Herri Batasuna's candidates, Jone Goirizelaia.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party says it shares ETA's goal of
independence but opposes violence as the way to achieve it.
Instead, it wants to work through Spain's existing institutions to
secede gently.

Hundreds of thousands loyal to Berlusconi's group mass in Rome

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Italians supporting media
mogul Silvio Berlusconi's center-right political alliance marched
in Rome Saturday to protest the formation of Massimo D'Alema's new
government.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist, cemented his majority earlier in
the week by including centrists who were elected to Parliament in
1996 under Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance ticket.
	   Several lines of marchers were converging on a Rome square for
an evening rally by Berlusconi and other opposition leaders.
	   Rome's police headquarters said that before all the marchers
reached the square, it was impossible to estimate the turnout. But
appeared a few hundred thousand people were participating, police
added.
	   After winning the required vote of confidence Friday night in
the lower Chamber of Deputies, D'Alema was out of town, in Austria
for a EU summit.
	   Besides the defecting centrists, D'Alema's coalition includes
other ex-Christian Democrats, who were in the previous center-left
coalition of Romano Prodi. The main force are are former Communists
like himself. Then there are the first Communist ministers in
government since 1947, some Greens, independents and minor
center-left parties.
	   Although, D'Alema doesn't need Berlusconi's bloc to pass
legislation, he wants to work with the ex-premier to revive so-far
frustrated efforts to reform an electoral system that rewards small
parties and feeds the country's chronic government instability.
	   Good relations with the conservatives could also prove
invaluable when dealing with issues like NATO operations.
	   During Prodi's tenure, Berlusconi's forces came to the rescue
when the Communists refused to back the government's pro-NATO line,
including during the parliamentary vote to confirm NATO's eastward
expansion.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year coalition, Italy's second longest-lasting
since the war, collapsed Oct. 9 after some Communists, then outside
the government but usually supportive of Prodi, refused to vote yes
in a confidence vote.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Meeting for the first time in 16
years without the towering presence of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the European Union's now mostly left-leaning leaders started
Saturday to map out a new path ahead for the 15-nation bloc.
	   The EU's 11 Socialist prime ministers were quick to emphasis the
change of direction when they met ahead of the full summit. Some
urged the launch of ``New Deal'' type public works projects to
create jobs and called on central bankers to boost business by
cutting interest rates.
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair overturned the
longstanding policy of his Conservative predecessors by calling for
the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle wildfire
conflicts on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without having to
rely on U.S. support.
	   ``We are starting a new era within the European Union,'' said
Rudolf Scharping, Germany's defense minister-designate, who chaired
the Socialist gathering.
	   ``Social Democrats and Socialists all over Europe are taking a
new responsibility.''
	   The Socialist leaders said the time had come for the EU to look
beyond the launch of the euro as EU's common currency by 11 nations
on Jan. 1, which Kohl had made the EU's top priority in recent
years.
	   New emphasis, they insisted, should be placed on sustaining
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis and
getting the EU's 18 million unemployed back to work.
	   To deal with the immediate threat posed by the global financial
turmoil, Blair said he may call a meeting of leaders of the G-7
group of world economic powers. Others agreed on the need for
coordinated action with other economic players to contain the
crisis.
	   ``We want to call attention to the fact that we have a financial
crisis in the world and we need a concerted response by Europe and
by the rest of the world,'' said Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, another socialist.
	   On defense, Blair outlined plans for the EU to develop a more
hands-on role for dealing with international crises while working
within NATO for a European military capability for peacekeeping or
combat missions.
	   Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister Tuesday,
said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   ``My sense is ... it's something the Americans will welcome
because they've been concerned about greater burden-sharing,'' he
told a news conference.
	   To boost the economy, Scharping said EU governments should enter
into ``a dialogue'' with central bank governors to convince them to
decrease rates.
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted government calls to cut rates, claiming they
are already among the world's lowest. Wim Duisenberg, the president
of the European Central Bank which will take over monetary policy
after the launch of the euro, takes a similar line.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as trans-continental road and rail
links.
	   When French officials put that idea forward a few years ago,
Kohl shot it down. The incoming German administration of Gerhard
Schroeder appears less resistant, but British officials warned
about a return to free-spending ways.
	   Leaders agreed the EU should be strengthened so the bloc
representing nearly 400 million people and one-third of the world's
economy has a greater voice in international affairs.
	   ``The EU needs ... greater determination in the development of
joint strategies, more consistency in the implementation of our
policies,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel in an
address to the summit.

Serbian court fines Milosevic's critics as law-breakers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR;  &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court imposed heavy fines
on the editors and publishers of an independent newspaper, ruling
criticism of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in their weekly
constituted anti-state activity.
	   Under a harsh media law passed by Serbia's parliament last week,
a Belgrade district court judge ruled the four were guilty of
``trying to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia by
criticizing Milosevic and his rule.
	   The editors, Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic, and publisher
Ivan Tadic, along with the publishing house of the independent
weekly, Evropljanin, are to pay a total of 2.4 million dinars (dlrs
260,000) within 24 hours, Curuvija told the Associated Press
Saturday.
	   ``The court made the draconic decision in a staged, Stalinist
process,'' Curuvija said. He vowed to fight back.
	   The new, harsh media law was passed last Thursday, amid growing
anti-Western sentiments about possible NATO intervention in
Serbia's Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting
for independence. It bans broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language
programs by foreign media, further restricts working permits for
news organizations and empowers authorities to determine which
reports break the law and are against the constitution.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   The trial against Evropljanin was initiated by Patriotic Union,
believed to be run by supporters of Milosevic's neo-communist wife
Mirjana Markovic. The Union said pictures of an ethnic Albanian
soldier that appeared in the weekly showed him in a ``hero
position.''
	   The heated proceedings on Friday started with about 100
independent journalists following the three to the downtown court
building in a show of support.
	   At a news conference Saturday, lawyers representing the accused
appealed to major opposition leaders and urged them to take action
because ``they also have the responsibility for freedom of press.''
	   Representatives of the main opposition parties attended the
press conference, in an outward display of support.
	   Milosevic controls all state-run media, and the new law is seen
as an attempt to silence any critics who speak publicly.
	   ``With this law you cannot publish papers. Nobody in Serbia will
be able to speak out and that's the essence of the media law,''
Bujosevic told reporters at the news conference.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   ``They want to strangle the independent media, the last
remaining point of resistance, with draconian punishments,
spreading fear among the Serbs,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former
Serbian information minister and a Evropljanin commentator.

New Zealand beat Zimbabwe in razor-edge match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHANDRA BANERJEE &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ New Zealand transformed a near-certain
defeat into a last-ball victory against Zimbabwe in the razor-edge
opening match of the nine-nation International Cup cricket
tournament Saturday.
	   Chasing a target of 259 runs for victory, New Zealand scored 260
runs for five wickets in 50 overs, breaking free of a tight
mid-inning spell cast by Zimbabwe's aggressive bowlers and
fielders.
	   New Zealand's hero was batsman Chris Harris, who pumped away the
last ball of the match on the off-side boundary. Harris scored 27
runs, backed by allrounder Alex Tait who scored 11.
	   New Zealand seemed headed for a shock defeat earlier in the
inning, chasing a required run rate of 12 at one point in the
match.
	   Earlier in the Zimbabwe innings, a blistering start and a chancy
century by skipper Alistair Campbell helped the team score 258 for
seven wickets at the packed Bangabandhu Stadium.
	   Despite losing opener Grant Flower in the second over of the
day, Campbell took advantage of the fielding restrictions in the
first 15 overs to lift the ball frequently over fielders and force
the scoring pace. Campbell's century was his third in one-day
international matches.
	   Zimbabwe raced to 69 in the first 10 overs, Campbell scoring 41
of those as he punished New Zealand bowlers, mainly Simon Doull and
Geoff Allott. Though the Zimbabwean captain got two lives at 41 and
65, the bowlers did little to check the batsmen with a loose line.
	   Tait pegged back the Zimbabweans somewhat with a couple of
wickets in his first three overs, but Campbell scored freely from
the other end. Campbell's innings contained seven fours and a six.
	   The highlight of the Zimbabwe innings was an 118-run partnership
between Campbell and Andy Flower, who scored 77 off 80 balls.
	   Campbell and Flower scored freely off the six bowlers, except
left-arm spinners Daniel Vettori, whose 10 overs on the trot saw
the rampaging Zimbabweans scoring only 34 runs.
	   When the bowling got tight, the skipper and Flower brought their
experience to the fore. For 90 balls, the duo scored only ones and
twos.
	   New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in a quarterfinal match on
Monday.
	   On Sunday, Commonwealth Games champions South Africa will play
England in their first quarterfinal match.

Turkey to limit oil tanker traffic through Bosporus strait
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; NEW with Turkey planning to decrease oil traffic thru
strait &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey will limit tanker traffic through
the Bosporus for environmental reasons, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said Saturday, just a few days before oil companies will decide
whether Caspian oil will be brought through the waterway.
	   ``In order to slow down the very dangerous crude passage in the
strait, Turkey will limit crude import being transported from the
Black Sea,'' Cem said without elaborating.
	   ``Turkey will increase the control mechanism for environmental
concerns, and that will decrease even the current passage of the
tankers,'' he added.
	   Next week, oil companies are to decide on the route to transport
Caspian crude to Europe. They are said to prefer a route linking
the Azeri capital of Baku to a Georgian Black Sea port that would
increase traffic in the straits.
	   But Cem told those considering this route to reconsider their
position, stating that Turkey would do all in its power ``within
international and national law to prevent the Turkish strait to
become a crude oil pipeline for Caspian oil.''
	   ``Everybody should know that and make their plans accordingly,''
he said.
	   Turkey backs a route, from Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean
port of Ceyhan, that would bypass the Bosporus, and this week
intensified its lobbying in favor of the route. It recently
proposed fiancing the Turkish part of the pipeline, which is
expected to cost a total of dlrs 2.5 billion.
	   Azerbaijan's oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are considered to
be the world's richest after the Middle East.
	   Collisions and spills in the narrow waterway are not infrequent.
On Friday, a Turkish oil tanker collided with a water tanker. No
oil spill occurred.
	   Approximately 60 million tons (66 million short tons) of petrol
transit through the Bosporus each year on some 4,500 tankers, Cem
said.

Starr report published in Russia, to yawns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new book hit the market in Moscow last week: the
Starr report, translated into Russian. So far, it's a flop.
	   Russians are showing little willingness to shell out hard-earned
cash for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, the
English-language Moscow Times reported Saturday.
	   ``Why do I need other people's dirty laundry,'' said one
non-buyer, Dr. Tatyana Yermakova, browsing at a book stall. ``Only
a sick, sexually frustrated person would be interested in it.''
	   A Russian publishing house printed 20,000 copies of the report
in a paperback called ``Clinton Levinski.'' But the publisher
conceded that the books, which retail for 17 rubles (dlrs 1),
haven't exactly been jumping off the shelves.
	   ``I am somewhat disappointed,'' said Alexander Zhitinsky, who
runs the Gelikon Plyus publishing house. ``There is no interest
among wholesalers.'' He speculated that Russians are too
preoccupied with the country's economic crisis to care about the
scandal.
	   The Clinton-Lewinsky affair has received considerable attention
in the Russian news media, but people have been mostly perplexed by
it. Russians tend to have a more relaxed, European attitude about
extramarital affairs, and don't expect to learn intimate details
about their leaders.
	   In the Soviet era, the official media didn't always disclose the
names of leaders' wives, much less mistresses.
	   In a recent poll, 27 percent of Russians said they would vote
for Clinton for president of Russia if he ran, and a solid majority
said the scandal either hadn't changed their image of him or had
improved it.

Pierce upsets Williams, will face Seles in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to UPDATE with second doubles result and
CORRECT that Raymond and Stubbs were top seeds. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mary Pierce upset top-seed Venus Williams in a
slamfest semifinal of the Kremlin Cup on Saturday, and Monica Seles
eventually overpowered a stubborn Sabine Testud to continue a
three-month hot streak.
	   Williams came out strong against Pierce, the fifth-seed from
France, breaking her serve in the fourth and seventh games to
finish the first set at 6-2.
	   But the 23-year-old Pierce pushed up her play a notch in the
second set and Williams's knee began to bother her. Pierce, clearly
the crowd favorite, took the last five games of the second set to
finish 6-2.
	   She ended the set with three aces, and charged ahead again in
the third, after Williams, of the United States, double-faulted
twice to go down 0-2.
	   Williams called for a trainer immediately after the game,
complaining of knee trouble. She appeared weak for the rest of the
match, and Pierce, ranked No. 11, cleaned up the set 6-0 without
giving Williams a point in the last three games.
	   After the match, Williams said her knee had been a problem
throughout the match. ``I wasn't doing the movement I normally
do,'' she said. ``I've been playing so many weeks now ... I think
it just wore on my knee.''
	   The victory was the first time Pierce had beaten Williams in a
full match. Williams, No. 5 in the world, has beaten Pierce twice
in straight sets, the second time last week at the European
championships in Zurich, but dropped out of a match earlier this
year.
	   In the other semifinals match, second-seeded Monica Seles of the
United States overpowered Sandrine Testud, capitalizing on the
26-year-old Frenchwoman's frequent errors.
	   The first set saw Seles break serve in the second game and then
hold on to win the set 6-3 despite committing three double faults
to Testud's two aces.
	   But in the second set, the 26-year-old Testud gave Seles more
trouble, breaking her in the fourth game with an ace, one of five
over the match.
	   In the tiebreaker, however, Testud double faulted twice after
going up 4-2, and drove a backhand into the net to lose the match
at 9-7.
	   Seles was relieved with Testud's unforced errors, after having
been pushed around by her fierce serves in the rest of the match.
	   ``I was unhappy that I had to go to the third set because if you
give Sandrine a window, she takes it,'' Seles said. ``In the second
set she gave me those two double faults, which I was very surprised
at.''
	   Pierce faces an uphill battle against Seles in the final of the
dlrs 1 million tournament. She has one win and five losses against
the 24-year-old American, who has won 16 of her last 17 matches and
two of the last three tournaments.
	   In semifinals doubles action, top-seeded partners Lisa Raymond
and Rennae Stubbs defeated Cara Black and Irina Selyutina, 6-3,
7-5. In the other match, Natasha Zvereva and Pierce defeated Anna
Kournikova and Seles, 6-4, 6-1.

Swissair strikes partnership with South African Airways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's national air carrier
Swissair said Saturday it has struck an accord for closer
cooperation with South African Airways.
	   Under the agreement, Swissair will code-share with SAA on
flights between Zurich and Johannesburg, a Swissair press release
said. Code sharing allows the two airlines to book seats on each
other's flights and to honor each other's frequent flier programs.
	   The two airlines will introduce a daily flight southbound from
Zurich within the next few months, the release said.
	   The companies say the agreement will result in better and faster
connections on the African and European continents and improved
check-in arrangements.
	   Swissair is developing a wide network of alliances with other
airlines across the globe. Earlier this year, the firm announced
partnerships with Japan Airlines and Hong Kong based carrier Cathay
Pacific.
	   They complement alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

``Jaded'' Owen hits four for Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Teen-age World Cup star Michael Owen hit four
goals on his return to the Liverpool starting lineup Saturday in a
5-1 crushing of Nottingham Forest at Anfield.
	   The 18-year-old striker's omission from the starting eleven in
Tuesday's UEFA Cup game against Valencia sparked speculation that
the youngster was jaded. He responded with a four-goal spectacular,
including two individual runs like the memorable World Cup goal he
scored against Argentina.
	   Owen's four sent Liverpool up four places to third at a time
when the Merseyside team had begun to drop out of title contention.
	   Premier League leader Aston Villa hit back from a goal down for
a 1-1 tie with Leicester to preserve its unbeaten record. Defender
Ugo Ehiogu netted Villa's leveller after veteran striker Tony
Cottee had fired Leicester ahead at Villa Park.
	   Second place Manchester United also rallied from a goal down to
salvage a 1-1 tie at Derby. Jamaican World Cup player Deon Burton
fired the Rams ahead but substitute Jordi Cruyff replied five
minutes from the end for the Reds, who remain four points behind
Villa but with a game in hand.
	   Middlesbrough, which surrendered third place to Liverpool, twice
took the lead at Wimbledon but was held to a 2-2 tie by Marcus
Gayle's two equalizers. Robbie Mustoe and Colombian striker
Hamilton Ricard netted Boro's two goals.
	   Tottenham downed Newcastle 2-0 with two goals from Norwegian
striker Steffen Iversen and moved up to eighth under new manager
George Graham.
	   At the bottom, Southampton gained its first win the season,
downing next to last Coventry 2-1, but staying in 20th place.
Matthew Le Tissier scored the first and set up the second for Egil
Ostenstad and at least Dave Jones' team has cut the deficit from
six to three points.
	   Despite the loss, Coventry goes up one place because Forest's
heavy defeat at Liverpool meant it slipped to 19th on goal
difference.
	   Chelsea, which slipped to fifth, goes to Leeds on Sunday when
defending titlist Arsenal hopes to improve on its sixth place by
winning at Blackburn.
	   Sheffield Wednesday and Everton ground out a 0-0 tie while
Charlton scored a 4-2 victory over London neighbor West Ham after
trailing 2-1 at half time. Second half goals by Danny Mills, Andy
Hunt and Neil Redfearn turned the match around after Ian Wright and
Eyal Berkovic had given the Hammers an interval lead.
	   Sunderland charged to the top of division one after a 1-0
victory over Bury and leader Huddersfield 4-1 loss at Norwich.
Sunderland now leads by a point.
	   Kilmarnock squandered a chance to move top of the Scottish
Premier League with Rangers in League Cup action on Sunday against
division one Airdrie.
	   Although Killie hit back from two goals down to gain a 2-2 tie,
it remains a point behind Rangers who have a game in hand.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's rebels have announced a
48-hour cease-fire in the tiny west African country, demanding that
President Joao Bernardo Vieira present a negotiating agenda, news
reports said Saturday.
	   The rebels gave Vieira until Sunday afternoon to present an
agenda for talks and explain the presence of ``aggressor''
Senegalese and Guinean troops in Guinea-Bissau and their ``imminent
reinforcement,'' the Portuguese daily newspaper Publico reported.
	   The rebels have previously demanded the foreign troops'
withdrawal while the government has demanded the rebels lay their
weapons down.
	   Vieira announced a unilateral government cease-fire Wednesday,
but the rebels want guarantees before entering into peace talks.
	   Neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent hundreds of
heavily-armed troops to back Vieira shortly after the conflict
began June 7 following Brig. Ansumane Mane's dismissal as army
chief for allegedly running guns to separatist fighters in
Senegal's southern Casamance province.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister traveled Saturday to Guinea-Bissau
aiming to halt a slide back to civil war, a week after the former
Portuguese colony's conflict restarted, officials said.
	   Jaime Gama was to fly into the capital Bissau's airport, which
rebels have held for almost five months, a spokesman for the
Portuguese Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau's authorities expressed interest in the
Portuguese minister's presence,'' Horacio Cesar said by phone in
Lisbon.
	   He declined to give any details of Gama's agenda.
	   Cesar said there were no reports of fighting in the capital
following the rebel cease-fire announcement late Friday.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's recently re-elected
President Geidar Aliev has chosen the same prime minister to lead
his new government, a longtime ally from the Soviet era.
	   Parliament approved Artur Rasizade's appointment on Friday.
Aliev, who won re-election Oct. 11 in this oil-rich nation on the
Caspian Sea, first named Rasizade prime minister in 1996.
	   Rasizade, 62, is an oil engineer by training. He held various
Communist Party and government jobs in Soviet times, including
deputy premier of Azerbaijan.
	   Aliev, Azerbaijan's former KGB chief and later Communist Party
boss, has ruled his country with an iron hand. The election was
boycotted by the opposition and called undemocratic by foreign
observers.
	   Opposition protesters held two demonstrations in Baku on
Saturday, demanding the cancellation of the results of the
election, the Interfax news agency reported. One protest drew about
1,000 demonstrators; the other, about 5,000.

Serbian court fines Milosevic's critics as law-breakers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from leading opposition party
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court imposed heavy fines
on the editors and publishers of an independent newspaper, ruling
criticism of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in their weekly
constituted anti-state activity.
	   Under a harsh media law passed by Serbia's parliament last week,
a Belgrade district court judge ruled the four were guilty of
``trying to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia by
criticizing Milosevic and his rule.
	   The editors, Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic, and publisher
Ivan Tadic, along with the publishing house of the independent
weekly, Evropljanin, are to pay a total of 2.4 million dinars (dlrs
260,000) within 24 hours, Curuvija told the Associated Press
Saturday.
	   ``The court made the draconic decision in a staged, Stalinist
process,'' Curuvija said. He vowed to fight back.
	   The new, harsh media law was passed last Thursday, amid growing
anti-Western sentiments about possible NATO intervention in
Serbia's Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting
for independence. It bans broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language
programs by foreign media, further restricts working permits for
news organizations and empowers authorities to determine which
reports break the law and are against the constitution.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   The trial against Evropljanin was initiated by Patriotic Union,
believed to be run by supporters of Milosevic's neo-communist wife
Mirjana Markovic. The Union said pictures of an ethnic Albanian
soldier that appeared in the weekly showed him in a ``hero
position.''
	   The heated proceedings on Friday started with about 100
independent journalists following the three to the downtown court
building in a show of support.
	   At a news conference Saturday, lawyers representing the accused
appealed to major opposition leaders and urged them to take action
because ``they also have the responsibility for freedom of press.''
	   Representatives of the main opposition parties attended the
press conference, in an outward display of support.
	   ``The astronomic fines ... open a clash between the regime and
common sense, which will soon result in huge changes we have all
been waiting for,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice-president the
leading opposition party, the Democrats.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
expressed his ``unending thanks'' Saturday to European leaders for
backing up the Mideast peace process with generous financial aid.
He asked them to keep their wallets open.
	   Arafat also said he hoped the West Bank land-for-peace deal,
concluded Friday, can revive talks Syria and Israel which broke
down two years ago.
	   Arafat made an unscheduled appearance at a meeting of European
Union leaders, flying to this alpine resort from the signing
ceremony in Washington of the deal concluded after nine days of
talks with the Israelis at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   ``They (the EU leaders) were my first port of call,' Arafat told
reporters after his meeting with the 15 leaders.
	   He assured them their aid for Palestinians _ half a billion
dollars from the EU budget alone since 1993, plus hundreds of
millions from individual EU governments _ ``is very much
appreciated. My thanks are unending.''
	   The EU is the biggest aid donor to the Palestinians and Arafat
suggested they keep up that position at donor conference December
in Vienna.
	   EU governments praised U.S. President Bill Clinton for forging
the interim peace deal. French President Jacques Chirac said of
Clinton: ``Your determination to make hope prevail over resignation
renewed the dialogue in favor of a just and durable peace.''
	   Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said ``The EU will stand by and
assist in the political process and the economic process of
implementing the agreement.'' He said the EU should intensify
financial support for Palestinians.
	   The Wye agreement will give Palestinians 13 percent more of
Israeli-held territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River. In
return, they pledged steps to fight terrorism by Islamic militants
and to end provisions in their charter calling for abolishing the
Jewish state.
	   Before coming here, Arafat met briefly in Vienna with Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country currently holds
the EU presidency. Asked at a press conference there if Palestinian
radicals such as Hamas would accept the Wye accord, he replied, ``I
don't know.''
	   But at the press conference here, Arafat sounded firmer, saying
the Palestinian Authority will crack down on Palestinian hardliners
_ an issue of primary concern to Israel.
	   ``We will never allow anyone, whoever that may be, to undermine
or endanger that peace process,'' he said.
	   Arafat's presence here did not hide the persistent inability of
the Europeans to play a decisive role in the Mideast peace process.
``It is time the European Union comes up with our own initiative to
support peace and stability in the region,'' said Schuessel.
	   The Europeans have long resented being frozen out by the
Americans from playing a leading role in negotiations between the
Arabs and the Israelis.

Europe's royalty marks 350th anniversary of Westphalia treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS REHNOLT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUENSTER, Germany (AP) _ Kings, queens and heads of state from
across Europe celebrated on Saturday the 350th anniversary of the
Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War and marked
the beginning of modern Europe.
	   Royalty including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Juan
Carlos of Spain walked up a red carpet to the Muenster city hall,
where the treaty was settled on Oct. 24, 1648. One by one,
representatives from 20 European nations signed a guest book before
eating lunch and hearing speeches.
	   Outside, the ``common folk'' paraded in the streets in
celebration.
	   Horse-drawn carriages rolled over cobblestone streets. Children
dressed as gnomes pulled a wagon carrying a garden gnome _ the kind
that decorate many German gardens. One parade group dressed as cows
in black-and-white spotted suits with pink rubber gloves as udders.
	   The Treaty of Westphalia ended an era of religious war between
Roman Catholics and Protestants, fought mostly in Germany. It also
recognized for the first time the sovereignty of the German states,
the Netherlands and the Swiss confederation.
	   Hailing the treaty as a milestone of modern diplomacy, German
President Roman Herzog called it ``the start of a new European
epoch'' and ``the first example of cooperation including nearly all
European states.''
	   But even now, he said, the celebrations were dampened by the war
in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province where Serb forces have been
fighting a secessionist ethnic Albanian majority.
	   ``Practically in front of our door, in former Yugoslavia,
brutality is happening that recalls the atrocities of the Thirty
Years War,'' Herzog said. ``We must not accept death and expulsions
in Kosovo as something normal for Europe.''
	   He urged Europeans to work toward a common understanding of
history, culture and foreign policy.
	   Also attending the ceremony were representatives from Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway,
Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Vatican.

Taylor and Langer defy Pakistan bowlers

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES at stumps; REPEATING to RESTORE writethru tag;
RESTORES Langer's, McGrath's first names on first reference. &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Mark Taylor carved out a risky
second-innings half century and Australia progressed steadily to
130 for one Saturday, taking an overall lead of 158 runs on the
third day of its third test against Pakistan.
	   After Australia finished the first innings with a 28 run-lead,
Taylor was unbeaten on 64 off 178 balls and 209 minutes while
Justin Langer was not out at 45.
	   Both the Australian left-handers had combined for a 103-run
second wicket in 173 minutes before stumps were drawn. Langer
pushed the pair over the century mark in the last over when he
swept Shahid Afridi to the long leg boundary.
	   Taylor survived a confident bat and pad appeal when on 25 on a
Shakeel Ahmed delivery, and got another life on 56 when Aamir
Sohail failed to hold on to a strong sweep at short square leg off
Arshad Khan with Australia at 112 for one.
	   Khan took the only wicket in the Australian second innings as
Michael Slater (11) offered an easy catch to Yousaf Youhanna in the
eighth over of the innings. He bowled a marathon spell of 24 overs
and ended with one wicket for 41.
	   Earlier, Pakistan was dismissed for 252 in reply to Australia's
280 with captain Aamir Sohail scoring 133 _ his second test hundred
against Australia and the fifth of his career in 44 test matches.
	   The pitch at the National Stadium, which was expected to give
assistance to spin bowlers, played a lot straighter and gave little
trouble to batsmen.
	   Earlier, Sohail brought Pakistan back into the match with a
century with Pakistan losing just one wicket in the first session.
	   Resuming at 170 for six, Sohail and Wasim Akram extended their
seventh-wicket partnership to 98 in 125 minutes. Akram was dropped
by Collin Miller at mid-off off Gavin Robertson when on 20, with
the total at 183 for six.
	   The visitors' lone success in the first session came when Akram
offered no stroke to leg-spinner Stuart MacGill's flipper and was
out leg before after scoring 35 with the help of six boundaries.
	   Sohail brought up his fifth test hundred and the second against
Australia off 194 balls in 263 minutes. His innings was studded
with 14 fours and a six.
	   The 32-year-old Pakistan captain pulled, drove and cut with
immaculate ease as the visitors struggled to wrap up Pakistan's
innings quickly.
	   Sohail departed in the first over after lunch when Langer took a
spectacular diving catch to his right at deep midwicket on a
delivery by Miller, which ended the Pakistani captain's 346 minutes
at the wicket. Sohail hit 18 fours and a six in his 272-ball
innings.
	   Glenn McGrath claimed his 10th five-wicket haul in 40 test
matches as he had Ahmed (1) caught by Langer at forward short leg.
McGrath, who polished off Pakistan's top order on Friday evening
and had reduced the home team to 69 five, ended up with five for
65.

France's Canal in touch with Italy's RAI over digital platform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A fresh proposal by France's Canal Plus SA has
reopened dialogue with RAI, Italian state TV, over how to share a
digital TV platform, the Italian news agency ANSA reported
Saturday.
	   Efforts have been going on for some time to reach an accord
among parties vying for a stake in Telecom Italia SpA's digital
platform Stream.
	   Earlier this month, the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported that agreement had come on the size of the stakes. It said
Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC would accept a
20 percent stake in Stream, considerably lower than his first
request for a 40 percent stake and that Canal Plus, which controls
existing Italian digital provider Telepiu, would get a 15 percent
stake which may later be turned over to Murdoch.
	   RAI was expected to get a 14 percent stake, with Telecom
retaining a 51 percent of pay-TV unit Stream. Telecom now owns 100
percent.
	   It was not clear if a power shuffle Friday at Telecom would
affect the digital platform proposals, and there was no immediate
reaction from RAI over the latest move by Canal Plus.
	   Details of the reported fresh proposal were not immediately
given.

South Africa-European trade deal expected by mid November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African and European
negotiators said on Saturday they hoped the two sides would reach
agreement by mid November in four-year-old discussions over trade.
	   South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and
European Union commissioner Joan Deus Pinheiro made their remarks
after meeting on Saturday.
	   The talks bogged down in September, when a deal seemed near. The
European Union demanded South African vintners stop using the names
sherry or port for any of their wines.
	   South Africa hopes Europe will open its markets to a number of
South African agricultural products, including dairy products, cut
flowers, fresh and canned fruits.
	   Any agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of EU-South Africa
trade, worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19
million).
	   Erwin called for governments to provide the push to seal the
agreements.
	   ``There comes a moment when politicians must take their
responsibility and identify a way forward to achieve the
objectives,'' he said.
	   Pinheiro said the talks were at a very difficult stage.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ New Zealand transformed a near-certain
defeat into a last-ball victory against Zimbabwe in the razor-edge
opening match of the nine-nation International Cup cricket
tournament Saturday.
	   Chasing a target of 259 runs for victory, New Zealand scored 260
runs for five wickets in 50 overs, breaking free of a tight
mid-inning spell cast by Zimbabwe's aggressive bowlers and fielders
and winning the match by five wickets.
	   New Zealand's hero was batsman Chris Harris, who pumped away the
last ball of the match over the widish long-off boundary. Harris
scored 37 runs off 22 balls, backed by allrounder Alex Tait who
scored 11.
	   New Zealand needed 40 runs for victory in the last three overs,
and made the target partly due to a dropped catch and some nervous
fielding.
	   New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who scored 96 runs off 130
balls, was declared Man of the Match. Flemings' innings included
four fours and a six.
	   Flemings' team seemed headed for a shock defeat earlier in the
inning, chasing a required run rate of 12 at one point in the
match.
	   Earlier in the Zimbabwe innings, a blistering start and a chancy
century by skipper Alistair Campbell helped the team score 258 for
seven wickets at the packed Bangabandhu Stadium.
	   Despite losing opener Grant Flower in the second over of the
day, Campbell took advantage of the fielding restrictions in the
first 15 overs to lift the ball frequently over fielders and force
the scoring pace. Campbell's century was his third in one-day
international matches.
	   Zimbabwe raced to 69 in the first 10 overs, Campbell scoring 41
of those as he punished New Zealand bowlers, mainly Simon Doull and
Geoff Allott. Though the Zimbabwean captain got two lives at 41 and
65, the bowlers did little to check the batsmen with a loose line.
	   Tait pegged back the Zimbabweans somewhat with a couple of
wickets in his first three overs, but Campbell scored freely from
the other end. Campbell's innings contained seven fours and a six.
	   The highlight of the Zimbabwe innings was an 118-run partnership
between Campbell and Andy Flower, who scored 77 off 80 balls.
	   Campbell and Flower scored freely off the six bowlers, except
left-arm spinners Daniel Vettori, whose 10 overs on the trot saw
the rampaging Zimbabweans scoring only 34 runs.
	   When the bowling got tight, the skipper and Flower brought their
experience to the fore. For 90 balls, the duo scored only ones and
twos.
	   New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in a quarterfinal match on
Monday.
	   On Sunday, Commonwealth Games champions South Africa will play
England in their first quarterfinal match.

Serbian court imposes fines on Milosevic's critics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court imposed heavy fines
on the editors and publisher of an independent newspaper, ruling
criticism of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in their weekly
constituted anti-state activity.
	   Under a harsh media law passed by Serbia's parliament last week,
a Belgrade district court judge ruled the four were guilty of
``trying to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia by
criticizing Milosevic and his rule.
	   The editors, Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic, and publisher
Ivan Tadic, along with the publishing house of the independent
weekly Evropljanin are to pay a total of 2.4 million dinars (dlrs
260,000) within 24 hours, Curuvija told The Associated Press
Saturday.
	   ``The court made the draconic decision in a staged, Stalinist
process,'' Curuvija said. He vowed to fight back.
	   The media law was passed last Thursday, amid growing
anti-Western sentiments about possible NATO intervention in
Serbia's Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting
for independence. It bans broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language
programs by foreign media and further restricts working permits for
news organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, which Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and
drags the country back toward single-party dictatorship. Milosevic
controls all state-run media.
	   The trial against Evropljanin was initiated by Patriotic Union,
believed to be run by supporters of Milosevic's neo-communist wife,
Mirjana Markovic. The Union said pictures of an ethnic Albanian
soldier that appeared in the weekly showed him in a ``hero
position.''
	   The heated proceedings on Friday started with about 100
independent journalists following the three to the downtown court
building in a show of support.
	   On Saturday, lawyers representing the accused appealed to major
opposition leaders and urged them to take action because ``they
also have the responsibility for freedom of press.''
	   Representatives of the main opposition parties attended the
press conference in an outward display of support.
	   ``The astronomic fines ... open a clash between the regime and
common sense, which will soon result in huge changes we have all
been waiting for,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice-president the
leading opposition party, the Democrats.

Brazilian pop singer Latino disappears hours before concert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian pop singer was
reported missing Saturday hours before a scheduled concert, police
said.
	   The jeep of Roberto Souza Rocha, 25, known as Latino, was found
abandoned with its engine running and his documents and cellular
telephone inside, said police investigator Jorge da Silva.
	   ``There is no clear indication as to what has happened to Latino
but the case will shortly be handed over to this city's anti-kidnap
police squad,'' Silva said.
	   The singer's vehicle was found close to Rio's airport. He had
been driving there to catch a flight to northeastern Brazil for a
nighttime concert, said Silva.
	   Rocha has made three records since 1994. His most popular
record, ``Me Leva'' (``Carry Me''), has sold 500,000 copies.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and blames
continued, scattered clashes on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against government forces which are leaving the province
under terms of the agreement.
	   ``But any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages or our
positions will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels
said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander,
and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were expected in Belgrade on Saturday
afternoon to seek more pullbacks of police units and equipment from
the separatist province.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to remove the special
police and military units he sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on
ethnic Albanian militants, who demand independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen great
progress but we are far from adequate compliance.''
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.''
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have been killed
and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Early Saturday, five refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo
were seriously wounded when Yugoslav border guards opened fire on
them while they were crossing into neighboring Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry reported.
	   The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were
airlifted from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana
Military Hospital, said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is seeking a dlrs 5 billion
bailout package from international donors or it may default on
outstanding debt payments of dlrs 1.4 billion, a senior official
said Saturday.
	   Ahsan Iqbal, the deputy chairman of national planning
commission, told The Associated Press that Pakistan is ``looking
forward'' to negotiating a bailout package with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in coming weeks.
	   ``We are still hopeful that the stalled talks will resume and a
package will be finalized,'' he said.
	   Pakistan's external debt is a massive dlrs 32 billion.
	   Western economists said Pakistan will need emergency funding of
about dlrs 5 billion to meet its financial obligations for the
1998-99 fiscal year. The economists say dlrs 2 billion would cover
debt rescheduling and the remaining dlrs 3 billion would cover
current accounts.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days ahead of its deadline for
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Western demands, NATO was sending
two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to demand more Kosovo
withdrawals by the Yugoslav president.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and blames
continued, scattered clashes on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against government forces which are leaving the province
under terms of the agreement.
	   ``But any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages or our
positions will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels
said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander,
and German Gen. Klaus Naumann were expected in Belgrade on Saturday
afternoon to seek more pullbacks of police units and equipment from
the separatist province.
	   NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to remove the special
police and military units he sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on
ethnic Albanian militants, who demand independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen great
progress but we are far from adequate compliance.''
	   Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West
realized that the crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of
Albanian separatists.''
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw special
police and army units sent to the province after he launched his
crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have been killed
and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Early Saturday, five refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo
were seriously wounded when Yugoslav border guards opened fire on
them while they were crossing into neighboring Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry reported.
	   The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were
airlifted from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana
Military Hospital, said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman.

Mubarak denies reports that Egypt will release Israeli spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak denied Saturday
reports that he had promised to pardon an Israeli-Arab serving a
15-year sentence for espionage.
	   ``This is empty talk and I have never given such a promise to
anyone,'' Mubarak told a public meeting in Suez, 134 kilometers (84
miles) east of Cairo.
	   Israeli television and radio reported Friday that as part of the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement forged at Wye River, Egypt was going
to release Azam Azam. Last year an Egyptian state security court
jailed Azam, a member of Israel's Arab minority, for 15 years with
hard labor for spying for Israel.
	   ``Israeli Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu had already raised
this issue and the answer was that the release of a prisoner means
the release of all other prisoners,'' Mubarak said.
	   ``The Israeli spy was convicted by a court and I respect the
court's judgment ... We cannot change a court's verdict just like
that, otherwise things would become chaotic'' Mubarak said.
	   Earlier Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa confirmed
that U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked Egypt to pardon Azam.
	   ``There have been contacts concerning this, but they were
rejected,'' Moussa replied when asked if Clinton had asked for the
spy's release.
	   Israel has always denied that Azam was a spy and has repeatedly
appealed for his release.
	   Azam was convicted after a bizarre trial in which prosecutors
said he supplied women's underwear soaked in invisible ink to an
Egyptian accomplice. The accomplice, who was jailed for life with
hard labor on the same charge, used the ink to write secret
messages to Israeli intelligence about Egyptian factories.

murdered
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with group claiming responsibility

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE (AP) _ A bomb exploded at an office of the far-right
National Front overnight, shattering windows and damaging furniture
but causing no injuries, police said Saturday.
	   A group calling itself ``Partisan Sharpshooters'' claimed
responsibility for the attack. It was the same group that bombed
two other National Front offices in France's biggest port since a
young Comorian was killed here by Front members in 1995.
	   The office staff includes Jean-Pierre Bauman, the Front's
finance director and a former training instructor for members in
the working-class district of northern Marseille.
	   Bauman had that training position when Comorian Ibrahim Ali was
killed in February 1995 by three Front members who were putting up
the party's posters in the neighborhood.
	   Bauman and party No. 2 Bruno Megret testified in the case, in
which the three men were convicted in the murder the young man.

Swissair strikes partnership with South African Airways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's national air carrier
Swissair said Saturday it has struck an accord for closer
cooperation with South African Airways.
	   Under the agreement, Swissair will code-share with SAA on
flights between Zurich and Johannesburg, a Swissair press release
said. Code sharing allows the two airlines to book seats on each
other's flights and to honor each other's frequent flier programs.
	   The two airlines will introduce a daily flight southbound from
Zurich within the next few months, the release said.
	   The companies say the agreement will result in better and faster
connections on the African and European continents and improved
check-in arrangements.
	   Swissair is developing a wide network of alliances with other
airlines across the globe. Earlier this year, the firm announced
partnerships with Japan Airlines and Hong Kong based carrier Cathay
Pacific.
	   They complement alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

German police detain leftist, extreme-right protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Police detained up to 200 leftist
demonstrators Saturday after clashing with them on the fringes of a
rally by rightist extremists.
	   Police detained three people at the rally, called by the
extreme-right National Democratic Party to protest a Bonn
exhibition on atrocities committed by German soldiers in eastern
Europe during World War II. The detained rightists were carrying
weapons, police said.
	   Between 150 and 200 leftists were detained after pelting police
with bottles. Police used batons against the demonstrators,
witnesses said.
	   The leftist and some 1,000 extreme-right protesters were kept
apart by a heavy police presence.

Berti Vogts attacks foes, plans to coach again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berti Vogts struck back at foes who forced his
resignation six weeks ago as Germany's national team coach in a
newspaper interview, parts of which were released Saturday.
	   In the weekly Welt am Sonntag to be published Sunday, Vogts
slammed the media and players like AC Milan striker Oliver Bierhoff
and Schalke's Olaf Thon, who had criticized some of his coaching
after the recent World Cup.
	   Vogts also accused the German Soccer Organization (DFB) of
talking to potential successors for his job while the world
championships in France were still underway. Germany, playing
dismally, was ousted in the quarterfinals.
	   ``I'd rather have real enemies than false friends,'' he said.
``Even during the world championships, I asked myself if they're
still completely behind Berti Vogts as head coach. I had a funny
feeling on some decisions.''
	   Vogts, in his first interview since public and media pressure
forced him to resign Sept. 7, said he plans to take a coaching job
sometime during the year, probably with a foreign team.
	   ``I'm sounding out several interesting offers,'' he said.
	   Vogts also levelled with Bierhoff and Olaf Thon. The Schalke
libero quit the national team after being benched at the World Cup
and vowed he wouldn't return with Vogts as coach.
	   ``Many players are making it very, very easy for themselves,''
Vogts said. ``When I hear Bierhoff was supposed to be blocked under
me, then I ask myself where was this block during Euro 96?''
	   Bierhoff came off the bench at the 1996 European Championships
in England to score the golden goal in the final against the Czech
Republic. It was Vogts's only major title in his eight-year stint
as national coach.
	   ``Thon should be more critical with himself and ask himself why
he never showed in France what he's capable of,'' Vogts added.
	   The 3-0 loss to Croatia in France by the three-time world
champions drew a storm of criticism levelled at both Vogts and his
players. An exodus of veterans followed, but some have returned
under new coach Erich Ribbeck.
	   Vogts also blasted the media, saying they beseiged his private
residence for days after news of his resignation broke.
	   ``Twelve to 15 cameras had their lens directed at our front
door. Day and night. We were trapped in there like animals,'' he
said.
	   Vogts, a defender on Germany's legendary 1974 World Cup
champions led by Franz Beckenbauer, said the first month after
leaving his post was tough.
	   ``I slept very poorly. You wake up nights and asks yourself what
mistakes did you make,'' said Vogts.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United
States and China reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for
negotiating a permanent peace to one of the world's potential flash
points _ the divided Korean peninsula.
	   The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees to
``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.''
	   Negotiators said they would hold the next round of talks in
Geneva Jan. 18-22. A U.S. official said it was hoped then to begin
the ``substantive work.''
	   The protracted haggling over procedural details highlighted just
how long and fraught the way ahead is likely to be.
	   Two previous rounds of talks last December and March broke down
over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an agenda _
including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops from
South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups.
	   After the meeting, North Korean officials insisted they hadn't
changed their position, saying troop withdrawal and a peace
agreement with the United States are still among their fundamental
demands.
	   The United States stood by its refusal to put troop withdrawals
on the agenda, the U.S. official said. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and China are attending the talks because they
are the main allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North
Korea.
	   The U.S. official said there was no sign of any change in
tactics or policy of North Korea since the last round of talks.
	   It took seven hours just to agree on the wording on the draft
establishing the subcommittees, according to the U.S. official.
	   The committees will be responsible for drawing up proposals to
be submitted to delegation heads. They will not have any
negotiating power.
	   The exact membership of the subcommittees and the details of
what they will discuss has yet to be determined.
	   Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman
of the current meeting, said South Korea believed ``big progress''
had been made in setting up the two sub-committees. They will
discuss ``concrete and substantive issues'' relating to
establishment of peace and reduction of tension, he said.
	   ``With the launch and operation of the sub-committees, we hope
to initiate a long-awaited and eagerly sought in-depth
discussion,'' he said.
	   Park said the South Korean government was prepared to play a
more proactive role in future talks, but declined to be specific.
Any items could be brought into the process for discussion, he
said.
	   China is also ``open to any ideas'' for inclusion in January's
discussions, Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian told reporters.
	   ``Now we have passed the stage of discussing procedural
matters,'' he said. ``It has been a tangible result.''
	   Agreement on procedures is vital because only after that can the
Geneva talks address the substance of a full peace treaty to
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
	   The border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed,
with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday.
	   Tensions flared this year after reclusive North Korea launched a
small satellite, which was originally thought to be a ballistic
missile.
	   However, Pyongyang is under pressure to make some compromises as
it desperately needs foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people
because of a combination of economic mismanagement, flooding and
drought.

	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Italians supporting media
mogul Silvio Berlusconi's center-right political alliance marched
in Rome Saturday to protest the formation of Massimo D'Alema's new
government with the help of turncoat lawmakers.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist, cemented his majority earlier in
the week by including centrists who were elected to Parliament in
1996 under Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance ticket.
	   Several lines of marchers converged on St. John in Lateran
square in Rome for an evening rally by Berlusconi and other
opposition figures, including his chief ally, Gianfranco Fini, who
leads the rightwing National Alliance party.
	   Fini called the mass turnout ``confirmation of a great
indignation in the country but also of a great will to change.
There's hope, not just anger.''
	   Rome's police headquarters said that a final estimate of crowd
hadn't been made yet since people were still streaming to the
square. But it appeared a few hundred thousand people were
participating, police added.
	   A National Alliance deputy suffered a mouth injury when security
personnel for Fini's and Berlusconi's parties scuffled over who
would control access to the podium, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.

Socialist-leaning groups join protest call for Nov. 5
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEAN-MARIE GODARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Student dissatisfaction with new government
measures widened Saturday when two Socialist-leaning groups joined
a call another nationwide day of protest Nov. 5 after the Toussaint
vacation.
	   Nearly 300,000 students protested this week and 500,000 the week
before, demanding the government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin do more to revamp aging and overcrowded classrooms.
	   The Independent and Democratic Student Federation (FIDL) and the
National Student Union (UNL), two groups considered close to the
Socialists, called the latest measures ``very insufficient.''
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre had announced he will hire
thousands more personnel, cut class sizes to 35 by next fall, boost
security and make 4 billion francs (dlrs 730 million) in
no-interest loans for regions to rebuild their schools.
	   The measures were not enough for the student groups, who
demanded another meeting with Allegre and vowed to join the Nov. 5
protest call made Thursday by the Interacademic High School
Coordination (CIL).
	   ``Allegre doesn't give any figures on how many teachers, nurses
or technical personnel'' he will hire, said Lea Filoche, a student
from Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb north of Paris.
	   Lucas Vaillant, from the Marseille area, said students were
``malcontent with what was given to us. We are ready to continue
(the protest) when we return from vacation if thing stay the
same.''
	   School officials face tough spending choices with the government
trying to keep the deficit within 3 percent of the gross domestic
product, as required by the euro single currency that takes effect
at the end of the year.

Former radicals vote on joining German government

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Once a loose band of peace protesters,
anti-nuclear activists and feminists, the Greens party was voting
Saturday on whether to join Germany's government for the first
time.
	   Party leaders appealed to some 800 convention delegates to back
the coalition pact sealed this week with the Social Democrats, who
won Sept. 27 elections but need a junior partner to secure a
majority in parliament.
	   Approval by the Greens, many of whom cherish the party's
outsider roots, was the last major hurdle to the new center-left
government's swearing-in scheduled Tuesday. The Social Democrats'
vote on the coalition deal Sunday was expected to go smoothly.
	   An unscheduled debate over the equal distribution of government
posts between men and women delayed the vote Saturday.
	   A Green, Joschka Fischer, is in line to become foreign minister,
one of three designated Cabinet members from the small
environmental party. Only one them, health minister Andrea Fischer,
is a woman.
	   With many members expressing misgivings, Fischer pleaded in an
impassioned speech for seizing the chance to help run Germany,
though he acknowledged that the coalition bargain had not met all
Green goals.
	   ``We must now assume a new responsibility,'' he said. ``We're
all adults here. We must prove that we can govern this country
responsibly.''
	   Fischer stressed that the Greens had a key role in launching
several landmark projects the new center-left administration has
pledged to undertake during its four-year term: higher energy
taxes, a commitment to closing nuclear power plants, and allowing
more foreigners to become German citizens.

Council continues Kosovo resolution talk, China, Russia opposed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China offering amendments to delete threat of
force, saying still have problems with draft, TRIMS outdated
information; no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Security Council members were convening
Saturday to negotiate a draft resolution that endorses the Kosovo
accord and allows NATO to take action to protect unarmed monitors
who will ensure Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians are complying with
it.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
language threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force if they
don't comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes
on Serb targets. They could veto the resolution or abstain from it.
	   In Saturday's consultations, China would suggest amendments that
would remove the threat of force, said Chen Ranfeng, a secretary in
the Chinese mission. The Yugoslav government has already pledged to
ensure the safety of the unarmed verification team, he noted before
consultations began.
	   ``It's a legitimate government. We have to believe,'' he said,
adding that the safety of the international personnel could be
ensured ``by peaceful means.''
	   Despite the stated opposition from Russia and China, a U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said council members
were close to fine-tuning the text. Ambassadors were waiting for
Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov to get final direction from
Moscow. A vote could come later Saturday.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of
their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first, with
provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   The latest draft resolution allows NATO to take ``appropriate
steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced. It notes that in the
event of an emergency, ``action may be needed'' to ensure the
safety of unarmed monitors.
	   It also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute cooperate
with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. Russian lawmakers warned NATO Friday that
airstrikes on Yugoslavia would prompt Moscow to offer weapons to
Serbs. China is traditionally opposed to any military intervention
into what it considers an internal matter, fearing a precedent
could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan and Tibet.
	   Russia has said that it would not go along with any resolution
that was tougher than a Sept. 23 resolution that helped form the
basis of the Holbrooke deal. That resolution said the council would
consider unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply but
didn't give any explicit threats of force.
	   The draft welcomes Yugoslavia's commitment to protect the OSCE
monitors and decides that an arms embargo imposed in a March
resolution won't apply for weapons and equipment destined for the
OSCE or NATO or their member states.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkey on Saturday protested Greek-Greek
Cypriot war games in Cyprus, accusing the Greek side of increasing
tension on the divided Mediterranean island.
	   The Greek Cypriot government, meanwhile, claimed Turkey violated
its airspace Saturday, the third such claim since the war games
began on Tuesday.
	   In Ankara, Turkish officials were not immediately for comment on
the claim. They had denied the two earlier claims.
	   The six-day maneuvers ``detabilize the security and stability of
Cyprus and of the southern Mediterranean,'' Turkey's foreign
ministry said in a statement.
	   ``The irresponsible attitude of the Greek and Greek Cypriots
shows their insincerity towards U.N. efforts aimed at providing a
secure environment on the island,'' the Turkish statement added.
	   Turkish troops have occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
1974, when Turkey invaded the island following a coup by supporters
of union with Greece. A breakaway state in the north is only
recognized by Ankara.
	   The war games are held under the provisions of the 1993 defense
pact between Greece and Cyprus.
	   Ann Hercus, the United Nations' resident envoy in Cyprus, has
been holding separate meetings with Turkish and Greek Cypriot
leaders in a bid to restart reunification talks that stalled last
year.
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Saturday renewed his
call to the Greek side for an agreement based on recognition of two
separate states.
	   The military drills involved 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops,
including 8,000 reservists, tanks and helicopters. Beside
warplanes, Greece sent a frigate, a destroyer, a submarine and two
torpedo boats to take part.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Meeting for the first time in 16
years without the towering presence of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the European Union's leaders started Saturday to map out a
more left-leaning path for the 15-nation bloc.
	   The EU's 11 Socialist prime ministers were quick to emphasis the
change of direction when they met before the full summit. Some
urged the launch of large public works projects to create jobs and
called on central bankers to boost business by cutting interest
rates.
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair overturned the
longstanding policy of his Conservative predecessors by calling for
the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle regional
conflicts like Kosovo or Bosnia without having to rely on U.S.
support.
	   ``We are starting a new era within the European Union,'' said
Rudolf Scharping, Germany's defense minister-designate, who chaired
the Socialist gathering.
	   ``Social Democrats and Socialists all over Europe are taking a
new responsibility.''
	   The Socialist leaders said the time had come for the EU to look
beyond the launch of the euro as EU's common currency by 11 nations
on Jan. 1, which Kohl had made the union's top priority in recent
years.
	   Emphasis, they insisted, should be placed instead on sustaining
Europe's growth despite the current world economic crisis and
getting the EU's 18 million unemployed back to work.
	   Blair said he may call a meeting of leaders of the G-7 group of
world economic powers to deal with the global financial turmoil.
Others agreed on the need for coordinated action with other
economic players to contain the crisis.
	   ``We want to call attention to the fact that we have a financial
crisis in the world and we need a concerted response by Europe and
by the rest of the world,'' said Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, another socialist.
	   On defense, Blair outlined plans for the EU to develop a more
hands-on role for dealing with international crises while working
within NATO for a European military capability for peacekeeping or
combat missions.
	   Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister Tuesday,
said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   ``My sense is ... it's something the Americans will welcome
because they've been concerned about greater burden-sharing,'' he
said.
	   To boost the economy, Scharping said EU governments should
convince central bank governors to decrease rates.
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted government calls to cut rates, claiming they
are already among the world's lowest. Wim Duisenberg, the president
of the European Central Bank which will take over monetary policy
after the launch of the euro, takes a similar line.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as transcontinental road and rail links.
	   When French officials put that idea forward a few years ago,
Kohl shot it down. The incoming German administration of Gerhard
Schroeder appears less resistant, but British officials warned
about a return to free-spending ways.

Pierce upsets Williams, will face Seles in final

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mary Pierce rallied from a first-set drubbing and
overpowered top-seeded Venus Williams 2-6, 6-2, 6-0 on Saturday,
advancing to a meeting with Monica Seles in the final of the
Kremlin Cup.
	   The fifth-seeded Frenchwoman overcame breaks in the fourth and
seventh games in the first set _ and a first-game loss in the
second, to win 12 of the next 13 games and the match.
	   She will face Seles, who continued a three-month hot streak with
a 6-3, 7-6 (9-7) victory over Pierce's compatriot, Sandrine Testud,
in the day's other semifinal.
	   Williams came out strong, but slowed after taking a 1-0 lead in
the second set as her knee became troublesome. Pierce, clearly the
crowd favorite, took the last five games of the second set to
finish 6-2.
	   She ended the set with three aces, and charged ahead again in
the third, after Williams, of the United States, double-faulted
twice to go down 0-2.
	   Williams called for a trainer after the game to treat her knee.
She appeared weak for the rest of the match, and Pierce coasted the
rest of the way, not allowing Williams to win a point in the last
three games.
	   Williams said her knee bothered her throughout the match.
	   ``I wasn't doing the movement I normally do,'' she said. ``I've
been playing so many weeks now ... I think it just wore on my
knee.''
	   The victory was the first time Pierce had beaten Williams in a
full match. Williams, No. 5 in the world, has beaten Pierce twice
in straight sets, the second time last week at the European
Championships in Zurich, but dropped out of a match earlier this
year.
	   In the other semifinal, Seles capitalizing on the 26-year-old
Testud's frequent errors.
	   Seles broke Testud in the second game and then won the first set
despite double-faulting three times.
	   But in the second set, the 26-year-old Testud gave Seles more
trouble, breaking her in the fourth game with an ace, one of five
in the match.
	   In the tiebreaker, however, Testud double-faulted twice after
leading 4-2, and drove a backhand into the net on match point.
	   Seles was relieved with Testud's unforced errors, after having
been pushed around by her fierce serves in the rest of the match.
	   ``In the second set she gave me those two double faults, which I
was very surprised at,'' she said.
	   Pierce faces an uphill battle against Seles in the final of the
dlrs 1 million tournament.
	   She has won only one of six career meetings against the
24-year-old American, who has won 16 of her last 17 matches and two
of the last three tournaments.

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria slams it

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan hailed the Palestinian-Israeli peace
deal Saturday, Egypt welcomed it cautiously, Syria's official media
ridiculed it, and Palestinian hard-line groups denounced it.
	   ``(Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat signed a new contract of
slavery and humiliation and surrendered to the Zionist
conditions,'' the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine - General Command said in a statement issued in Damascus,
Syria.
	   The equally hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine said from its Damascus offices that the Wye River
Memorandum was ``based on protecting Israel's strategic security
interests and turning the Palestinian cause into a security
issue.''
	   But in Amman, Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh said the
agreement ``puts the peace process back on track and opens the door
for negotiations on a permanent settlement.''
	   Jordan's King Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994, left his cancer treatment at a U.S. hospital on two occasions
to contribute to the Wye River negotiations.
	   Under the deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from
additional West Bank land in exchange for guarantees that Arafat
will clamp down stringently on Palestinian extremists.
	   In Egypt, which signed the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty in
1979, President Hosni Mubarak said his government welcomed whatever
accord was acceptable to Palestinians.
	   ``There may be some weak points in the agreement, but it is
nonetheless better than having the acts of violence continue,'' he
told a public meeting in Suez, 134 kilometers (84 miles) east of
Cairo.
	   Mubarak stressed the importance of implementing the agreement,
accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of failing to
honor earlier agreements with the Palestinians. Of the six points
in the 1997 Hebron accord, Mubarak said ``only two points were
implemented while the other four were ignored.''
	   Syrian newspapers, which are government-controlled, were
dismissive of Wye River.
	   The deal could never be called a ``peace agreement.'' the
government newspaper, Al-Thawra, said. ``It is rather a liquidation
and a total surrender of what has remained of the Palestinian
rights.''
	   The Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap for the
Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli threats.''
	   Syria is technically at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have not
taken place since Netanyahu took office in June 1996.
	   Reflecting widespread skepticism in the Arab world, columnist
Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan of the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said
the Wye negotiations were the ``epitome of Israeli blackmailing.''
	   He was referring to the security concessions extracted by
Netanyahu from Arafat.
	   ``The Wyers will be forced to confess one day to their people
that this deal ended `Oslo the bad deal' and adopted `Wye, a worse
one,''' Badrakhan wrote, referring to the 1993 Oslo accord between
the Palestinians and Israelis.
	   In contrast to the Jordanian government's optimism, Amman
newspapers reacted cautiously, saying peace would depend on
Israel's deeds and not its words.
	   ``The bet is on its implementation and not allowing any of the
two sides to invent obstacles and problems to dodge away from'' the
deal, said the mass circulation Al-Ra'i newspaper.

Brazilians go to the polls to vote for governor in 13 states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The elections of governors in 13
Brazilian states Sunday, represent more than simply local votes,
they may also decide the fate of urgently needed national budget
cuts.
	   Many voters are indifferent, suspecting that whatever choice
they make, it only spells hard times ahead.
	   ``Whoever wins its going to be difficult, because it doesn't
look like there's going to be much money to spend,'' said Paulo
Benevides, a 22-year-old college student.
	   Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year
ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil needs to slash government spending
and raise taxes quickly if it is to shore up it's flagging economy
and restore investor confidence.
	   The difficulty of pushing through such unpopular measures at
election time has become increasingly evident as President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso has repeatedly delayed announcing his
belt-tightening package.
	   The measures were expected after the Oct. 4 first-round
elections, in which Cardoso was re-elected and 14 state governors
were chosen.
	   Immediately following the election, Cardoso said the package
could be announced by Oct. 20. But with 13 government-allied
candidates facing tough run-offs, he apparently thought better and
postponed it until after Sunday's second-round elections.
	   David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the
University of Brasilia thinks this was a smart decision.
	   ``Governors have far more power and a direct hold on their
states than the president has over the whole country,'' said
Fleischer. ``Their influence and political weight should not be
underestimated.''
	   Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is that
it is their overspending that accounts for a big chunk of the
government's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the
situation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso's allies in Brazil's
four most developed states _ Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, with
more than 34 million inhabitants, incumbent governor and Cardoso
ally Mario Covas is running neck and neck with Paulo Maluf, a
populist candidate with a taste for extravagant public works
projects.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, opposition candidate Anthony Garotinho has a
double-digit lead over Cesar Maia.
	   In Minas Gerais state, former President Itamar Franco, who has
openly broken with Cardoso, leads government ally Eduardo Azeredo
by a wide margin.
	   And in Rio Grande do Sul, leftist Worker's Party candidate
Olivio Dutra leads incumbent Antonio Britto.
	   Perhaps the strangest race of all is for governor in the Federal
District of Brasilia.
	   There, government-allied parties and ministers have jumped ship
to support incumbent Worker's Party governor Cristovam Buarque over
Cardoso-endorsed Joaquim Roriz, who showed himself to be out of
tune with the government's cost cutting efforts when he promised
civil servants a 28 percent raise if elected.

Hundreds of thousands loyal to Berlusconi's group mass in Rome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berlusconi quotes; organizers saying more than 1
million people &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Italians supporting media
mogul Silvio Berlusconi's center-right political alliance marched
in Rome Saturday to protest the formation of Massimo D'Alema's new
government with the help of turncoat lawmakers.
	   D'Alema, a former Communist, cemented his majority earlier in
the week by including centrists who were elected to Parliament in
1996 under Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance ticket.
	   Several lines of marchers converged on St. John in Lateran
square in Rome for an evening rally by former conservative Premier
Berlusconi and other opposition figures, including his chief ally,
Gianfranco Fini, who leads the rightwing National Alliance party.
	   Fini called the mass turnout ``confirmation of a great
indignation in the country but also of a great will to change.
There's hope, not just anger.''
	   The arrival of the supporters, many of them coming from the
central south and other parts of Italy in chartered bus, snarled
traffic in Rome.
	   To a whistling and cheering crowd estimated by organizers to
number 1 million at least, Berlusconi said: ``We must defend
freedom and democracy which are under attack.'' He kept up his
criticism of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for giving his blessing
to D'Alema's coalition.
	   Rome's police headquarters said that a final estimate of crowd
hadn't been made yet since people were still streaming to the
square. But it appeared a few hundred thousand people were
participating, police added.

Bayern Munich, off to fastest start in Bundesliga history, blasts
</HEADLINE>
Kaiserslautern &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ FC Kaiserslautern may have shocked Munich with its
improbable Bundesliga title run last season, but the defending
champions Saturday proved no match for the streaking Bavarian club.
	   Munich, behind season goals seven and eight by Brazilian striker
Giovane Elber, blasted Kaiserslautern 4-0 to add to the fastest
start in Bundesliga history.
	   Munich now has won eight matches and drawn one to start the
season.
	   Visiting Kaiserslautern, the Germans' other Champions Cup entry,
could only play Munich even during the first half in front of
63,000 at Olympiastadion.
	   Crippled by key injuries, Kaiserslautern held Munich to a 1-0
lead until shortly before the break. Mario Basler, in the 10th
minute, lofted a shot over keeper Andreas Reincke's head.
	   But afterwards, Munich ran over fading Kaiserslautern, winless
in five league outings and searching for the magic which carried it
to the Bundesliga title last season.
	   ``We've got nothing to do with the title at the moment _ we have
too many injury problems,'' said coach Otto Rehhagel. ``Bayern was
superior to us and deserved to win 4-0.''
	   Iranian striker Ali Daei cleaned up Elber's shot in the 45th
minute, Elber knocked back a post ricochet by Torsten Fink in the
52nd then struck again seven minutes later.
	   Newly-promoted Kaiserslautern twice beat Munich last season and
delighted German fans when the club forced the country's richest
side to chase it all season before finishing second.
	   Several other teams expected to offer Munich a battle this
season struggled again. Stuttgart was held to a 2-2 draw by FC
Nuremberg, while Rostock did the same to Schalke.
	   Wolfsburg also beat Frankfurt 2-0 and Bochum edged
Moenchengladbach 2-1. On Friday, Werder drew 1-1 with Hamburg and
Dortmund played 2-2 at Freiburg.
	   Striker Fredi Bobic shot Stuttgart to a 2-0 lead, but Nuremberg
recovered in the second half and evened behind goals by Pavel Kuka
and Stephan Taeuber.
	   Schalke's Dutch coach, Huub Stevens, proved to have luck with
his subsitutions in the 2-2 draw against Rostock. Martin Max scored
in the 81st and Sascha Wolf equalized four minutes later.
	   Rostock seemed to have a sure victory against Schalke, now
winless in four matches and plagued by the league's worst goal
production, when it led 2-0 after Igor Pramic and Jens Dowe's goals
in the 64th and 66th minutes.
	   ``My boys sitting in the locker room are pretty down. We did
everything right to win for 80 minutes,'' said Rostock coach Ewald
Leinen.
	   Wolfsburg won for the first time since April, beating Frankfurt
when libero Holger Ballwanz headed in a corner and Poland's Andrzei
Juskoviak connected in the final minute.
	   Thomas Reis, powering in a long distance shot, and Sebastian
Schindzielorz led Bochum past Moenchengladbach, which tumbled to
the bottle of the table.

Jordan hails Palestinian-Israeli peace deal; Syria ridicules it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new comments in grafs 3, 8-9. DROPS earlier
Egyptian comments; EDITS to conform.
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Saturday hailed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a cornerstone for lasting peace
but in neighboring Syria the official media ridiculed it as a
Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap.
	   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser ``Arafat signed a new contract of
slavery and humiliation and surrendered to the Zionist
conditions,'' the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine - General Command said in a statement issued in Damascus,
Syria.
	   The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be called a
``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, said.
``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said.
	   ``All Palestinian rights have been swallowed and canceled from
the political dictionary,'' the paper said, adding that the
agreement favored the Israelis heavily.
	   The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap
for the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli
threats.''
	   Syria technically is at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's
Golan Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made
no progress during the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
been in office.
	   In Egypt, which signed the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty in
1979, President Hosni Mubarak said his government welcomed whatever
accord was acceptable to Palestinians.
	   ``There may be some weak points in the agreement, but it is
nonetheless better than having the acts of violence continue,'' he
told a public meeting in Suez.
	   Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were
reflected in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
Jordan is the only Arab nation other than Egypt to have signed a
peace treaty with Israel.
	   Tarawneh said Friday's agreement ``puts the peace process back
on track and opens the door for negotiations on a permanent
settlement.''
	   Under the peace deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from
additional West Bank land in exchange for security guarantees.
	   Tarawneh said Jordan ``looks forward to implementing this
agreement in good will and the interest of all.''
	   Jordan's King Hussein is Israel's closest Arab ally and had made
an emotional appeal for peace during the negotiations, which he
joined on two occasions, taking a break from his cancer treatment
at the Mayo Clinic.
	   Despite the government optimism, Jordan's independent newspapers
reacted cautiously, saying Israeli deeds and not words were needed
will provide a lasting peace.
	   ``The bet is on its implementation and not allowing any of the
two sides to invent obstacles and problems to dodge away from'' the
deal, said the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Yasunori Watanabe and Tsutomu Matsuda each
scored a pair of tries and Japan overpowered South Korea in the
second half Saturday enroute to a 40-12 victory in the opening
matches of the final round of Asian qualifying for the Rugby World
Cup.
	   Taiwan created the shock of the day, upsetting Hong Kong 30-12
in the first match of the day.
	   Only the group winner from the four after a schedule of league
play advances to the 20-nation World Cup finals in Wales next year.
The runner-up will have a second chance in a repechage tournament.
	   Tries by Park Jin-bae and Kim Jae-sung got South Korea to a 12-7
first-half advantage, but Terunori Masuho touched down for a
converted try just before halftime to give Japan its first lead
14-12.
	   Watanabe and Matsuda then took over, putting Japan on course for
a fourth straight appearance in the finals.
	   In the other match, Tseng Chi-Ming scored two of his teams four
tries and Taiwan avenged a 114-12 defeat to Hong Kong in qualifying
for the 1995 World Cup.
	   Ho Shang-lien and Chang Chung-wei both added tries and Kuo
Shan-pen kicked a pair of penalties as the outsized Taiwanese
dominated their heavily favored opponents, who finished ahead of
both Japan and the United States in the Pacific Rim championship
earlier this year.
	   The tournament is part of a two-rung series for the Asian
regional crown, with with Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan
vying for the Asian title, while China, India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Singapore and Thailand are contesting the second-tier.
	   Thailand created some headlines when it forfeited its
much-anticipated Group B clash with host Singapore.
	   Thailand withdrew in protest against Singapore fielding four
non-nationals and were subsequently expelled by tournament
organizers.
	   According to officials, a pre-tournament ballot by the nine
participating nations had decided to allow teams to field
non-citizens who have resided at least six months in the country.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia had voted against the move, but
then agreed to abide by the majority decision.
	   In other play Saturday, Malaysia beat China 32-25 in its opening
Group B match.
	   In the next session of round-robin play on Tuesday, Taiwan faces
Japan while Hong Kong will meet South Korea.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top NATO generals pressured
Yugoslav political and military leaders for further withdrawals
from Kosovo Saturday, three days short of its deadline for Slobodan
Milosevic to meet Western demands.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander in
Europe, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military committee, met briefly with the Yugoslav president, before
going into talks with Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the Yugoslav Army Chief
of Staff.
	   Both the Alliance and the Yugoslav army remained tight-lipped
about the meetings, but a diplomatic source speaking on condition
of anonymity said that NATO wanted to let the Yugoslavs know they
must do more in withdrawing military and special police units in
Kosovo back to their barracks.
	   The Alliance has given the Yugoslav president until Tuesday to
do so.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and recall
the units sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants, who demand independence for the majority Albanian
province. It blames the Albnaians for the continued, scattered
clashes.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against government forces which are leaving the province
under terms of the agreement.
	   ``But any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages or our
positions will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels
said.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   With Western nations only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
the deadline is widely expected to be pushed back for a second
time. But no official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September,
there is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations _ evidence the conflict has not ended.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw
special police and army units sent to the province after he
launched his crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Early Saturday, five refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo
were seriously wounded when Yugoslav border guards opened fire on
them while they were crossing into neighboring Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry reported.
	   The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were
airlifted from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana
Military Hospital, where they were in critical condition late
Saturday, said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council members were convening
Saturday to negotiate a draft resolution to endorse the Oct. 12
agreement and allow NATO to take action to protect the unarmed
monitors.
	   Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety
of their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first,
with provisions for enforcement. But Russia and China are opposed
to any language threatening force and could veto the resolution or
abstain from it.

Russian economic plan to `see the light soon.'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Primakov interview, plans to discuss
economic plan Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A long-awaited plan to fix Russia's collapsed
economy ``will see the light soon,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov pledged Saturday, adding that the country would recover
whether or not it receives help from the West.
	   In a nationally televised interview, Primakov said his Cabinet
would discuss a draft economic plan on Monday. Although he did not
get into details of the program, he reiterated that it would
include some printing of new money and would not restrict the
circulation of dollars, as some had speculated.
	   ``On Monday, we will exchange opinions and obviously it will see
the light soon,'' the premier said in the interview on the
state-run ORT channel.
	   The International Monetary Fund has said it will not release the
next installment of a multi-billion-dollar loan package until
Moscow releases an economic plan that is acceptable to the lenders.
	   Primakov alluded to the Western aid in response to a question
about Russia's position on the crisis in Kosovo. Russia has opposed
the use of force by NATO there.
	   ``Our position on Kosovo annoys (the West) most of all. Let them
get irritated. This is their problem. Russia is a great power,
Russia will rise to its feet anyway, whether they give us credits
or not,'' he said.
	   The newspaper Kommersant reported Saturday that the government's
draft economic plan includes establishment of a State Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to oversee the beleaguered banking
sector, and calls for Russia's first complete inventory of its
foreign debt, including that leftover from the Soviet Union, the
daily Kommersant reported Saturday.
	   The government has sent mixed signals about its economic plan
for weeks, first setting a date for its release then saying it
would not come up with an overall plan but concentrate instead on
short-term measures.
	   Among the IMF's demands are better tax collection. With that in
mind, Moscow is preparing to introduce a sales tax by January, the
daily Segodnya reported. The tax would likely be 5 percent, and
would exclude items such as bread, milk and sugar.
	   Another newspaper reported that Moscow's economic ills have
infected Russia's far-flung regions, more than half of which have
defaulted on domestic bonds.
	   Before the national economy collapsed in August, 71 of Russia's
89 regions had issued domestic bonds. Fifty regions have already
missed payments on some or all of them, the English-language Moscow
Times reported Saturday.
	   Most of the bonds are held by Russian banks and brokerages.
	   Many of the federal government's treasury bills, however, are
held by foreign banks, which have been holding talks with Russian
officials in London on restructuring the debt. Negotiations broke
down this week but may resume next week.
	   Russia's third-largest city, Nizhny Novgorod, may become the
first entity to default on Eurobonds if it cannot meet its next
payment of dlrs 4.4 million due in April, the Moscow Times quoted
ratings agencies as saying.

Vienna ex-mayor suspected as communist-era spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Zilk in graf 3. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Zilk, a former mayor of Vienna,
was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor because of
suspicions that he was a communist spy, a German newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Zilk, 71, allegedly spied for the communist government of the
former Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and `70s. He denied the
accusation.
	   ``I consider the accusations absolute nonsense,'' he told
state-run Czech TV Saturday. ``I had nothing to do with the secret
police in Czechoslovakia.
	   The suspicion surfaced after Zilk, 71, was nominated for the
order of the White Lion because of serious injuries he received
from a letter bomb. Zilk lost part of his hand in the December 1993
explosion, which happened during one of his terms as mayor of the
Austrian capital.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel withdrew the honor after a source
claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech communist secret service and
provided information that led to several convictions. Zilk also
signed a declaration of loyalty to the Czech communist government,
the source claimed.
	   Ivan Medek, a Czech government official, did not identify the
source but told the newspaper that the information on Zilk was
``absolutely reliable.''
	   Zilk would have received the Czech medal next Wednesday.

Hard-liners take lead in national elections for key assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with fresh results; no pickup.
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives were headed toward a
clear victory Saturday in elections for a clergy-based assembly
that oversees the the country's supreme leader.
	   The expected outcome will be a blow to moderates who had hoped
to use the Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the
supreme leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the
average Iranian.
	   The partial results came as no surprise since most moderates had
been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by
hard-liners.
	   With 70 of the 86 seats on the Assembly of Experts decided, the
hard-liners won 43 and the moderates only eight.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents.
	   By late Saturday, 27 of Iran's 28 provinces had filed their
returns. The only results outstanding were from the 16 seats in the
capital Tehran, and they were not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the dropping of most progressive
theologians by the Council of Guardians. The council reviewed a
list of 396 applicants and allowed only 167 to run.
	   While the official media spoke of crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, official results so far show that only about 18
million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to vote.
	   Some 30 million cast ballots in last year's presidential
elections, 20 million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami,
who has presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   On Saturday, a leading moderate, former Parliament Speaker
Ayatollah Mehdi Karoubi, joined average Iranians in complaining
about the hard-liners' dropping of progressive candidates from the
ballot.
	   ``As long as the Council of Guardians continues functioning in
this manner, there is no hope for serious competition among
political forces and groups who are loyal to the country's
constitution,'' he wrote in an open letter to newspapers.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the elections but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.
	   The only good news for moderates were partial results in Tehran
showing that former President Hashemi Rafsanjani was leading with
874,643 votes. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current
head of the Assembly of Experts, with 672,992 votes.
	   In Tehran, hard-liners seemed to be assured 10 seats and
moderates only four. Among the hard-liners expected to win seats in
the capital are Mohammad Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and
Ali Jannati, who leads the council that vetted the candidates.
	   All five seats in the central province of Isfahan went to
hard-liners. In eastern Khorasan province, seven of the eight seats
went to conservatives and one to an independent. In the Caspian Sea
province of Mazandaran, all four seats went to hard-liners.

Britain tells Chile it cannot intervene in Pinochet case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Cook, Fernandez meeting, details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain told Chile on Saturday that it was neither
``proper nor possible'' for Prime Minister Tony Blair's government
to intervene in the extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Chilean Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez arrived in
London Friday night to try to secure the release of 82-year-old
Pinochet, who is under arrest at a London hospital following spinal
surgery. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his regime.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told Fernandez on Saturday that he
did not want the case to interfere in relations between the
countries, but that due legal process would have to take its
course, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said.
	   Fernandez was given a full hearing and Cook explained it was a
matter of ``due legal process and it was not proper, not possible
to intervene,'' she said.
	   Pinochet's lawyers go to the High Court on Monday to try to get
his arrest ruled invalid.
	   The Chilean Foreign Ministry said a formal note was handed to
British ambassador Glynne Evans on Friday afternoon with new legal
information to support Chile's claim that Pinochet has diplomatic
immunity.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, but also argues that as a senator, he is
entitled to diplomatic immunity. Britain insists he does not have
immunity.
	   The Spanish warrant for Pinochet cited 94 victims, but could be
broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared during his 17-year-rule.
	   Outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is hospitalized, more
than 150 protesters gathered Saturday to demand he be tried for
genocide. Among them were 35 Chilean exiles who traveled from
France.
	   Visiting Chilean senator Ignacio Perez-Walker told reporters
after visiting Pinochet on Saturday that the former leader ``is a
very strong man.''
	   ``However, his health appears very, very detiorated,'' said
Perez-Walker. ``We spoke very briefly and he was very calm,'' he
said, adding that Pinochet was only informed 48 hours ago that he
was under arrest.
	   Pinochet's wife appealed Friday night for his release, saying he
is too sick to stand trial. He underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a
herniated spinal disc.
	   ``This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia
Pinochet told a Chilean TV crew outside a Roman Catholic church in
London, where she had been to pray.
	   ``I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very,
very, very, ill.''
	   She said many Chileans support her husband, who is recovering
slowly. ``Everybody has expressed a lot of loyalty and warmth, if
there have been any wrong things they have just been emotional
reactions,'' she said.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for life,
as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.

Former radicals vote on joining German government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greens approve coalition deal, color, edits to

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The environmentalist Greens party voted
Saturday to join Germany's government for the first time, paving
the way for a new center-left administration to take power next
week.
	   Founded 18 years ago as a loose band of peace protesters,
anti-nuclear activists and feminists, the Greens battled over the
party's soul for 16 hours at a party convention before deciding on
the historic step.
	   In a show of hands, delegates voted near unanimously to back the
coalition pact sealed this week with the Social Democrats, who won
Sept. 27 elections but need a junior partner to secure a majority
in parliament.
	   Approval by the Greens, many of whom cherish the party's
outsider roots, was the last major hurdle to the new center-left
government's swearing-in scheduled Tuesday. The Social Democrats'
vote on the coalition deal Sunday was expected to go smoothly.
	   The vote was delayed by an unscheduled debate over the equal
distribution of government posts between men and women, punctuated
by a noisy protest from about 50 female members who blew whistles
and carried signs reading ``We will not be fobbed off.''
	   A Green, Joschka Fischer, is in line to become foreign minister,
one of three designated Cabinet members from the small
environmental party. Only one them, health minister Andrea Fischer,
is a woman.
	   With many members expressing misgivings, Joschka Fischer had
pleaded in an impassioned speech for seizing the chance to help run
Germany, though he acknowledged that the coalition bargain had not
met all Green goals.
	   ``We must now assume a new responsibility,'' he said. ``We're
all adults here. We must prove that we can govern this country
responsibly.''
	   After the vote, the meeting hall erupted in applause and cheers.
Party leaders held hands and pumped their fists in the air in
triumph.
	   Fischer stressed that the Greens had a key role in launching
several landmark projects the new center-left administration has
pledged to undertake during its four-year term: higher energy
taxes, a commitment to closing nuclear power plants, and allowing
more foreigners to become German citizens.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top NATO generals pressured
Yugoslav leaders for further withdrawals from Kosovo Saturday,
three days short of its deadline for President Slobodan Milosevic
to meet Western demands.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander in
Europe, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military committee, met briefly with the Yugoslav president, before
going into talks with Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the Yugoslav Army Chief
of Staff.
	   Both the alliance and the Yugoslav army remained tightlipped
about the meetings, but a diplomatic source speaking on condition
of anonymity said that NATO wanted to let the Yugoslavs know they
must do more in withdrawing military and special police units from
Kosovo.
	   The alliance has set a Tuesday deadline for the withdrawals.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis caused by
its crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants, who demand independence
for the majority Albanian province. It blames the Albanians for the
continued clashes.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against withdrawing government forces.
	   ``But any movement towards villages or our positions will force
us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels said.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   Western nations are just beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
so Tuesday's deadline is widely expected to be extended for a
second time. No official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   While most fighting in Kosovo halted in late September, there is
sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw
special police and army units sent to the province after he
launched his crackdown on the KLA on Feb. 28. Hundreds of people
have been killed and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Early Saturday, five refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo
were seriously wounded when Yugoslav border guards opened fire on
them while they were crossing into neighboring Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry reported.
	   The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were
airlifted from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana
Military Hospital, where they were in critical condition late
Saturday, said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council members were convening
Saturday to negotiate a draft resolution to endorse the Oct. 12
agreement and allow NATO to take action to protect the unarmed
monitors.

Pizza Hut pulling out of Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a sure sign of the times, Pizza Hut has decided
to close its two restaurants in Moscow, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The American chain was among the first fast-food businesses to
set up shop in the Soviet Union 10 years ago, and recent
commercials even used former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as
a pitchman.
	   But Pizza Hut recently moved out of its location on Moscow's
Kutuzovsky Prospekt, and hopes to sell its other outlet on trendy
Tverskaya Street by the end of the year, the Moscow Tribune
reported.
	   ``The expiration of our leases on the Kutuzovsky and Tverskaya
properties has coincided with deepening economic problems in
Russia,'' said Jadek Sas-Uhrnowski, Pizza Hut's franchise manager
for Eastern Europe. ``Business has been affected by the crisis and
this has determined our decision to close the Moscow outlets.''
	   He said Pizza Hut had no plans to close its restaurants in St.
Petersburg.

Council continues Kosovo resolution talk, China, Russia opposed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China saying improvements made to draft that in
their view doesn't authorize force. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council fine-tuned a draft
resolution Saturday endorsing an accord to end the crisis in Kosovo
and affirming that NATO may need to take action to enforce it.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
language threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force if they
don't comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes
on Serb targets. They could veto the resolution or abstain from it.
	   After several hours of rare Saturday consultations and informal
discussions, China expressed satisfaction that many of its concerns
had been taken into consideration, said Chen Ranfeng, a secretary
in the Chinese mission.
	   ``As it stands now, I think it could not be considered in
whatever sense as an authorization of use of force,'' he said.
``It's really a good improvement.''
	   A vote could come later Saturday, or Sunday.
	   The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of
their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first, with
provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced about 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   A draft resolution tabled Friday night allows NATO to take
``appropriate steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced. It notes
that in the event of an emergency, ``action may be needed'' to
ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
	   Chen wouldn't say how those key passages had been altered to
suit China's concerns.
	   The draft also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute
cooperate with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.
	   Russia has said that it would not go along with any resolution
that was tougher than a Sept. 23 resolution that helped form the
basis of the Holbrooke deal. That resolution said the council would
consider unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply but
didn't give any explicit threats of force.
	   The draft welcomes Yugoslavia's commitment to protect the OSCE
monitors and decides that an arms embargo imposed in a March
resolution won't apply to weapons and equipment destined for the
OSCE or NATO or their member states.

Agassi to face Kroslak in final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Andre Agassi wore down Wayne
Black of Zimbabwe 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 Saturday and advanced to the final
of the dlrs 1 million Czech Indoor.
	   In Sunday's finals, Agassi will face Jan Kroslak of Slovakia,
who defeated Sweden's Thomas Enqvist when the Swede pulled out due
to ankle injury while trailing 3-4.
	   Both Agassi and Black started with patient, powerful baseline
tennis, but Agassi gradually got the upper hand thanks to his
precise returns and broke Black's serve in the sixth game.
	   Black broke back and evened at 4-4 after several precise
volleys, sending the set to a tiebreak where Agassi dominated.
	   Agassi broke early in the third for a 2-1 lead and extended the
lead to 5-1.
	   Black rallied with several miraculous shots to break Agassi, but
the American needed only to win his next serve to take the match.
	   ``Black didn't surprise me, he is a very competitive player and
I knew it would be difficult,'' Agassi said after the match.
	   By beating Black, Agassi secured a berth in the eight-man ATP
Tour World Championship next month in Hannover, Germany
	   In the other semifinal, Kroslak started by breaking Enqvist's
serve in the first game and seemed enroute to another upset.
	   The Swede looked unfit and called the physician twice in the
opening games to have his right ankle bandage fixed. He finally
pulled out, citing ankle injury.
	   ``I was very surprised,'' said Kroslak, who will be appearing in
his first final of the year. ``I played very well but I can't
really count this as a victory. It's a shame.''

Hard-liners take lead in national elections for key assembly

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives were headed toward a
clear victory Saturday in elections for a clergy-based assembly
that oversees the the country's supreme leader.
	   The expected outcome will be a blow to moderates who had hoped
to use the Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the
supreme leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the
average Iranian.
	   The partial results came as no surprise since most moderates had
been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by
hard-liners.
	   With 70 of the 86 seats on the Assembly of Experts decided, the
hard-liners won 43 and the moderates only eight.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents.
	   By late Saturday, 27 of Iran's 28 provinces had filed their
returns. The only results outstanding were from the 16 seats in the
capital Tehran, and they were not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the dropping of most progressive
theologians by the Council of Guardians. The council reviewed a
list of 396 applicants and allowed only 167 to run.
	   While the official media spoke of crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, official results so far show that only about 15
million of the 31 million eligible voters in the 27 provinces had
bothered to vote.
	   Some 30 million cast ballots in last year's presidential
elections, 20 million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami,
who has presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   On Saturday, a leading moderate, former Parliament Speaker
Ayatollah Mehdi Karoubi, joined average Iranians in complaining
about the hard-liners' dropping of progressive candidates from the
ballot.
	   ``As long as the Council of Guardians continues functioning in
this manner, there is no hope for serious competition among
political forces and groups who are loyal to the country's
constitution,'' he wrote in a letter to the head of the council
that was published in the newspapers.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the elections but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.
	   The only good news for moderates were partial results in Tehran
showing that former President Hashemi Rafsanjani was leading with
874,643 votes. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current
head of the Assembly of Experts, with 672,992 votes.
	   In Tehran, hard-liners seemed to be assured 10 seats and
moderates only four. Among the hard-liners expected to win seats in
the capital are Mohammad Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and
Ahmad Jannati, who leads the council that vetted the candidates.
	   All five seats in the central province of Isfahan went to
hard-liners. In eastern Khorasan province, seven of the eight seats
went to conservatives and one to an independent. In the Caspian Sea
province of Mazandaran, all four seats went to hard-liners.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Meeting for the first time in 16
years without the towering presence of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the European Union's now mostly socialist leaders started
Saturday to map out a new leftward path ahead for the 15-nation
bloc.
	   The EU leaders paid tribute to Kohl's work to promote European
unity, but the Union's 11 Socialist prime ministers at the meeting
in this lakeside resort were quick to emphasis the EU's change of
direction from the policies pursued by the conservative leader.
	   Some urged the launch of ``New Deal'' type public works projects
to create jobs and called on central bankers to boost business by
cutting interest rates.
	   ``The time is right to cut interest rates,'' said Massimo
D'Alema, Italy's new, former-Communist prime minister. ``The hope
is for a general reduction in rates, starting in Germany.''
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair overturned the
longstanding policy of his Conservative predecessors by calling for
the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle wildfire
conflicts on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without having to
rely on U.S. support.
	   ``We are starting a new era within the European Union,'' said
Rudolf Scharping, Germany's defense minister-designate.
	   ``Social Democrats and Socialists all over Europe are taking a
new responsibility,'' added Scharping, who chaired a meeting of
socialist leaders before the full two-day EU summit got underway.
	   Leaders said the time had come to look beyond the launch of the
euro as the EU's common currency by 11 nations on Jan. 1, which
Kohl had made the Union's top priority in recent years.
	   New emphasis, they insisted, should be placed on sustaining
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis and
getting the EU's 18 million unemployed back to work.
	   ``Reducing unemoployment is the most important single question
for the for the people of Europe,'' said Germany's Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schoeder, on his EU summit debut.
	   To deal with the immediate threat posed by the global financial
turmoil, Blair said he may call a meeting of leaders of the G-7
group of world economic powers. Others agreed on the need for
coordinated action with other economic players to contain the
crisis.
	   ``We want to call attention to the fact that we have a financial
crisis in the world and we need a concerted response by Europe and
by the rest of the world,'' said Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, another socialist.
	   On defense, Blair outlined plans for the EU to develop a more
hands-on role for dealing with international crises while working
within NATO for a European military capability for peacekeeping or
combat missions.
	   Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister Tuesday,
said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   ``My sense is ... it's something the Americans will welcome
because they've been concerned about greater burden-sharing,'' he
told a news conference.
	   To defend Europe's economy from the chill winds blowing from
Asia and Russia, Italy's D'Alema, another summit debutant, said the
leaders agreed there should be a ``strong push for a rate cut.''
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted government calls to cut rates, pointing out
they are already among the world's lowest. Wim Duisenberg, the
president of the European Central Bank which will take over
monetary policy after the launch of the euro, takes a similar line.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as trans-continental road and rail
links.
	   When French officials put that idea forward a few years ago,
Kohl shot it down. Schroeder appears less resistant, but British
officials warned about a return to free-spending ways.
	   Leaders agreed the EU should be strengthened so the bloc
representing nearly 400 million people and one-third of the world's
economy has a greater voice in international affairs.
	   ``The EU needs ... greater determination in the development of
joint strategies, more consistency in the implementation of our
policies,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel in an
address to the summit.

	   RESNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ramadan Bajraktari and his wife and
five children huddle against a thickly forested hillside, hiding
from the Serb police who drove them from their nondescript hamlet
in central Kosovo three months ago.
	   ``We slaughtered our cows. Now we are living on a little milk
and some flour given to us by our neighbors down the hill,''
Bajraktari said. His family has had to survive without even the
ubiquitous sheet plastic that tens of thousands of refugees around
the country use to build rudimentary shelters.
	   On Friday, the ``lost villagers'' of Resnik _ the Bajraktaris
and seven other ethnic Albanian families _ were found. Saturday,
for the first time, they got a truckload of food, blankets and, of
course, plastic.
	   The families weren't really lost, said Laura Boldrini of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. They went into hiding because
of their fear of the Serb police.
	   ``These people will never survive the winter,'' Ms. Boldrini
said as about two weeks of aid, provided by the World Food Program
and Mercy Corps International, was unloaded from a single truck.
``It's one of the worst cases I have ever seen. None of us could
survive here one week. They have been here three months.''
	   The people of Resnik are just a few of the nearly 300,000
displaced in Kosovo, victims of the seven-month conflict between
Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Tens of thousands of refugees are living in the open, and all
face a grim winter.
	   It is eerily quiet in the forest, 40 miles west of Kosovo's
capital Pristina and not far from Resnik. People speak in low
voices. Children blink and stare as blankets, clothes, sacks of
flour, packages of pasta, sugar, containers of jam and cooking oil
are divided into piles.
	   Serb police are thick on the surrounding roads, and none of the
refugees will budge until they are gone.
	   Some have tried to return to Resnik, but the refugees say that
each time they do, police open fire.
	   ``They shelled my house,'' said Bajraktar. ``It is destroyed. A
few days ago we tried to go back and they shot at us. I'm not
talking politics. I just can't go home.''
	   Asked if his family is prepared to spend the winter under the
trees, he responds with a wan smile and a shrug.
	   ``Where can we go? It doesn't depend on us.''
	   Hysen Havoli farmed five acres (two hectares) outside Resnik, a
hard life even without war and vengeance. He holds back a flap of
oilcloth, perhaps taken from the kitchen table of a more prosperous
time, and shows a visitor the straw bed inside his hut made of
branches. The oilcloth doesn't keep out the rain. Nor do the
branches.
	   Havoli said the Serbs didn't burn his house. But they took
everything inside it and some of his cattle, he said.
	   ``We have here only what we were able to carry,'' he said.
``Everything else was stolen.''
	   The sky Saturday is iron gray. Temperatures are dropping.
	   ``I hope we don't have to stay the winter,'' Havoli said,
casting his eyes upward. ``I hope somebody gets us out of here. But
where would we go?''
	   The people in the forest have vaguely heard about the 2,000
``verifiers'' who are supposed to arrive soon to monitor the
agreement struck between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The prospect doesn't move
them.
	   ``We listen to a bit of news on our neighbor's radio,'' Halvoli
said. ``We have a little hope. But not much.''

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Wigan Warriors made it 15 titles in
15 seasons Saturday by overpowering Leeds Rhinos 10-4 in the
inaugural British Super League Grand Final.
	   Watched by 43,500 fans at a rainsoaked Old Trafford, the two
rugby league powers scored one try each in a low-scoring game in
difficult conditions. But Wigan proved the stronger team and Andrew
Farrell kicked two penalties and a conversion to land the trophy
for John Monie's Warriors.
	   Since the 1984-85 season, Wigan has dominated rugby league in
England, winning nine first division championships of the former
league, two Super League Premiership titles and nine Challenge
Cups.
	   The first score didn't come until the 22nd minute when a spell
of Leeds pressure brought a try by New Zealander Richie Blackmore
after a powerful run through the Wigan defense by team captain
Iestyn Harris.
	   The Rhinos looked like holding on until the interval until some
weak defending allowed Jason Robinson, restarting play from close
to the right touchline, to breeze through three tackles for a solo
try. Farrell converted to give Wigan a 6-4 halftime lead.
	   That became 8-4 when Farrell kicked a 30-meter penalty and Wigan
even had a try over-ruled in the 48th minute when Aussie winger
Mark Bell collected a high kick forward dropped over the line under
pressure from Harris.
	   After watching a video recording the officials ruled Bell had
knocked on by not catching it cleanly.
	   It would have given Wigan a 12-4 lead but the Warriors kept a
strangehold on the game anyway, enjoying lots of possession and
pinning the Rhinos back in their own half for long periods.
	   Leeds had one final chance with two minutes to go when they had
the ball with an overlap, but substitute Graham Holroyd dropped the
ball before he could make the vital pass.
	   The referee awarded Wigan a penalty and Farrell kicked it from
35 meters to clinch the title.
	   Lineups:
	   Wigan _ Kris Radlinski; Jason Robinson, Danny Moore, Gary
Connolly, Mark Bell; Henry Paul, Tony Smith; Andrew Farrell,
Stephen Holgate, Lee Gilmour, Tony Mestrov, Robbie McCormack, Terry
O'Connor.
	   Leeds _ Iestyn Harris; Leroy Rivett, Richie Blackmore, Brad
Godden, Francis Cummins; Daryl Powell, Ryan Sheridan; Marc
Glanville, Adrian Morley, Anthony Farrell, Martin Masella, Terry
Newton, Farren Fleary.

Council softens language on force, China sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede, overline and UPDATES with late draft resolution
softening threat of force, deleting suggestion that NATO take steps
to enforce agreement to make it more vague; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council fine-tuned a draft
resolution Saturday endorsing an accord to end the crisis in Kosovo
and affirming that action may be needed to enforce it.
	   After several hours of rare Saturday consultations and tough
informal discussions, a revised draft had substantially softened
language about the threat of force to implement the agreement
between ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav and Serb forces.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
language threatening the two sides with force if they don't comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb
targets.
	   They could veto the resolution or abstain from it.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav
federation.
	   China expressed satisfaction that many of its concerns had been
taken into consideration in the latest draft, said Chen Ranfeng, a
secretary in the Chinese mission.
	   ``As it stands now, I think it could not be considered in
whatever sense as an authorization of use of force,'' he said.
``It's really a good improvement.''
	   A vote could come later Saturday, or Sunday.
	   The Security Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about the safety
of their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first,
with provisions for enforcement.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   A draft resolution tabled Friday night would have allowed NATO
to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced.
It noted that in the event of an emergency, ``action may be
needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
	   Saturday's revised draft deleted reference to international
organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and promptly. The draft still
said that action may be needed to protect the monitors, but
referred to Yugoslavia's duty to ensure their safety under the
accord.
	   The draft also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute
cooperate with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

Former radicals vote on joining German government

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The environmentalist Greens party voted
Saturday to join Germany's government for the first time, paving
the way for a new center-left administration to take power next
week.
	   Founded 18 years ago as a loose band of peace protesters,
anti-nuclear activists and feminists, the Greens debated for 16
hours at a party convention before taking the plunge.
	   Despite voicing many misgivings, delegates voted near
unanimously to back the coalition pact sealed this week with the
Social Democrats, who won Sept. 27 elections but need a junior
partner to secure a majority in parliament.
	   Approval by the Greens, many of whom cherish the party's
outsider roots, was the last major hurdle to Gerhard Schroeder's
swearing-in as chancellor Tuesday. The Social Democrats' vote on
the coalition deal Sunday was expected to go smoothly.
	   Joschka Fischer, the designated foreign minister, had pleaded
with delegates to seize the chance to help run Germany, though he
acknowledged that the coalition bargain had not met all Green
goals.
	   ``We're all adults here,'' he said. ``We must prove that we can
govern this country responsibly.''
	   A last-minute threat to the coalition pact was averted when
delegates voted to defer a conflict over whether the three Green
Cabinet members should keep their seats in parliament.
	   Left-wingers called for banning the dual role, arguing it
undercut parliament's role as a watchdog over the government.
Fischer called it a mistake that would weaken the Greens in
government.
	   And some 50 activists temporarily occupied the stage to protest
the fact that only one Cabinet member _ designated health minister
Andrea Fischer _ will be a woman, breaking party rules on the equal
distribution of posts between men and women.
	   But party leaders also got a pat on the back from homosexuals
for anchoring a government pledge for stronger minority rights. A
gay and a lesbian couple handed over a wedding cake showing two
women dressed as brides and two men embracing.
	   Fischer stressed that the Greens had a key role in launching
several landmark projects the future government has pledged to
undertake during its four-year term: higher energy taxes, a
commitment to closing nuclear power plants, and allowing more
foreigners to become German citizens.
	   More radical Greens positions such as tripling gasoline prices
over 10 years and disbanding NATO were ruled out from the start by
Schroeder.
	   ``Some sentences in this coalition treaty make a pacifist want
to scream,'' declared the party's defense spokeswoman, Angelika
Beer.
	   Fischer, 50, symbolizes the Greens' transformation. Once a
street protester and self-described ``professional revolutionary''
in the 1970s, he renounced pacifism in horror at the war in Bosnia.
	   But the road to government seemed bumpy even six months ago,
when support for the Greens plummeted after they shocked this
car-loving country by voting for the gasoline price hike.
	   On election day, the Greens won 6.7 percent of the national
vote, down from 7.3 percent in the last election in 1994.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Meeting for the first time in 16
years without the towering presence of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the European Union's now mostly socialist leaders started
Saturday to map out a new leftward path for the 15-nation bloc.
	   The EU leaders paid tribute to Kohl's work to promote European
unity, but the Union's 11 Socialist prime ministers at the meeting
in this lakeside resort were quick to emphasize the EU's change of
direction from the policies pursued by the conservative leader.
	   Some urged the launch of ``New Deal'' type public works projects
to create jobs and called on central bankers to boost business by
cutting interest rates.
	   ``The time is right to cut interest rates,'' said Massimo
D'Alema, Italy's new, former-Communist prime minister. ``The hope
is for a general reduction in rates, starting in Germany.''
	   Britain's Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair overturned the
long-standing policy of his Conservative predecessors by calling
for the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle
conflicts occurring on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without
having to rely on U.S. support.
	   ``We are starting a new era within the European Union,'' said
Rudolf Scharping, Germany's defense minister-designate.
	   ``Social Democrats and Socialists all over Europe are taking a
new responsibility,'' added Scharping, who chaired a meeting of
socialist leaders before the full two-day EU summit got under way.
	   Leaders said the time had come to look beyond the launch of the
euro as the EU's common currency by 11 nations on Jan. 1, which
Kohl had made the Union's top priority in recent years.
	   New emphasis, they insisted, should be placed on sustaining
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis and
getting the EU's 18 million unemployed people back to work.
	   ``Reducing unemployment is the most important single question
for the for the people of Europe,'' said Germany's Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schoeder, at his EU summit debut.
	   To deal with the immediate threat posed by the global financial
turmoil, Blair said he may call a meeting of leaders of the G-7
group of world economic powers. Others agreed on the need for
coordinated action to contain the crisis.
	   ``We want to call attention to the fact that we have a financial
crisis in the world and we need a concerted response by Europe and
by the rest of the world,'' said Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, another socialist.
	   On defense, Blair outlined plans for the EU to develop a more
hands-on role for dealing with international crises while working
within NATO for a European military capability for peacekeeping or
combat missions.
	   Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister Tuesday,
said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   ``My sense is ... it's something the Americans will welcome
because they've been concerned about greater burden-sharing,'' he
told a news conference.
	   To defend Europe's economy from the crises in Asia and Russia,
D'Alema, also making his EU debut, said the leaders agreed there
should be a ``strong push for a rate cut.''
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted government calls to cut rates, pointing out
they are already among the world's lowest. Wim Duisenberg, the
president of the European Central Bank which will take over
monetary policy after the launch of the euro, takes a similar line.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as transcontinental road and rail links.
	   When French officials put that idea forward a few years ago,
Kohl shot it down. Schroeder appears less resistant, but British
officials warned about a return to free-spending ways.
	   Leaders agreed the EU should be strengthened so the bloc
representing nearly 400 million people and one-third of the world's
economy has a greater voice in international affairs.
	   ``The EU needs ... greater determination in the development of
joint strategies, more consistency in the implementation of our
policies,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel in an
address to the summit.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Putting the clamor of campaigning behind
them, voters in Spain's Basque region spent an official ``day of
reflection'' Saturday ahead of a regional election seen as crucial
for starting a peace process to end 30 years of separatist strife.
	   The armed separatist group ETA set the tone for the campaign by
declaring a cease-fire in its drive for an independent homeland on
Sept. 18, making it the first of the region's six elections so far
to be free of violence.
	   In a taped program broadcast Saturday by Britain's British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to discuss the ceasefire, the group
insisted that its truce offer ``was solid and serious'' but added
that it had no regrets for any of its actions.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they have all been of
limited duration. This is the first open-ended one and many
Spaniards see it as the best opportunity in years to end one of
Western Europe's last regional conflicts.
	   The group, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since
1968.
	   Attention in the election will be focussed on whether the truce
will lead to an increase in seats for pro-independence nationalist
parties at the expense of those parties who insist on allegiance to
the Madrid central government.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar traveled to the Basque
country Friday night with six Cabinet ministers in a last-minute
push for candidates of his center-right Popular Party seeking seats
in the 75-member Basque parliament headquartered here in Vitoria.
	   Speaking at a rally, Aznar warned nationalists seeking
independence from Spain that there would be ``no adventures in the
Basque country.''
	   ``There will be none. This land will not see adventures that
take it nowhere,'' he said.
	   Aznar also repeated his call for ETA to publicly accept the
results of the elections and lay down its arms. The premier has
said ETA must meet these conditions for a peace process to begin in
earnest.
	   So far the government has shied from reacting generously to the
cease-fire. In a token gesture to a long-standing demand of the
separatist group, it moved four of the some 500 ETA prisoners to
jails in the Basque country.
	   Aznar hopes a strong showing by the Popular Party and other
non-nationalist groups, like the opposition Socialists, will give
him greater leverage against nationalists.
	   The region's biggest party is the mainstream Basque Nationalist
Party, which has finished first in each of the five elections so
far but has never garnered a majority and has thus had to seek
coalition allies.
	   The big question mark is whether the ceasefire will translate
into greater support for the Basque Nationalist Party and ETA's
political wing, Herri Batasuna whose months of talks this year led
to the truce.
	   ``We will be the big surprise on election day,'' said one of
Herri Batasuna's candidates, Jone Goirizelaia.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party says it shares ETA's goal of
independence but opposes violence.
	   With turnout among the 1.8 million voters expected to be high,
polling booths open at 9 a.m. (0800 gmt) and close at 8 p.m. (1900
gmt). Final results are expected before midnight.

Flemmen becomes first Norwegian woman to win giant slalom

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ In four World Cup seasons, Andrine
Flemmen had only reached the podium once _ and only the first step.
	   On Saturday, in the Alpine season opener, she took two more
steps to the top for her first World Cup victory and only Norway's
second by a woman.
	   After leading following the first run, Flemmen won Saturday's
giant slalom with an aggregate time of 2 minutes, 15.05 seconds,
edging Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer and Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni.
	   ``I never thought I'd win, not so early in the season '' said
Flemmen, whose only other top-three finish was a third place in
Park City, Utah, last season. ``My goal was to be third.
	   ``I was a bit nervous between runs so I tried even harder to
stay focused, relax and ski like I do in training.''
	   Flemmen joined Ingeborg Helen Marken as the only other Norwegian
woman to have won a World Cup event. Marken won a super-g on home
snow in Kvitfjell in 1996.
	   ``We are a small nation but we are going to be very strong,''
Flemmen said.
	   The 23-year-old began last season with just as much promise in
Park City, but despite consistent results which ended her fifth in
the year-end World Cup giant slalom standings, the Norwegian was
unable to repeat her podium performance.
	   ``I hope it will be different this year,'' Flemmen said.
	   Delighting the home fans lining the glittery 368-meter
(1,207-foot) course, Meissnitzer recorded the fastest second run to
finish runner-up with a combined time of 2:15.31, ahead of Italian
Compagnoni.
	   ``I put a lot of pressure on myself and was quite nervous in the
first leg,'' said Meissnitzer, who won the final giant slalom race
last season in Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   ``Because of my win in Crans I also felt a little pressure from
the media who were like `OK Meissi, you should win the season
opener now,' and I thought `Uh, Oh, that's a tall order.'''
	   Compagnoni, second after the opening leg, slipped to third with
a time of 2:15.62.
	   The Italian skier, plagued with a sore back which repeatedly
interrupted her summer program, had not trained since mid-August
and only resuming skiing three days ago.
	   ``I'm pretty happy with third place because wasn't at 100
percent,'' said the two-time reigning world champion. ``I attacked
at the top so I was tired at the bottom and had to slow down.
	   ``My back is getting better but it was impossible to be
completely ready for today's race with just two days to prepare.''
	   Leila Piccard of France was fourth in 2:16.32, followed by
Switzerland's Sonja Nef, who recorded identical times in both runs
to finish fifth, 1.35 seconds adrift.
	   Last year's World Cup giant slalom champion, Martina Ertl,
finished 10th, trailing Flemmen by more than 2.5 seconds.
	   Corinne Rey Bellet of Switzerland finished sixth in 2:17.06,
while Sweden's Anna Ottosson finished seventh, 2.23 seconds back.
	   Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, the overall champion in 1997, opted
not to start, after a training crash Friday left her with an aching
head.
	   Another notable absentee was Germany's Katja Seizinger, the
reigning overall champion and a three-time Olympic gold medallist,
who injured both knees this summer in training and will unlikely be
back until late in the season.

Two policeman killed in drive-by shooting in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A gunman on a motorcycle shot dead two
policemen in this southern Lebanese port on Saturday night,
security officials said.
	   The gunman and the motorbike driver escaped and there was no
obvious motive for the shooting, the latest in a spate of drive-by
killings in Sidon, the capital of south Lebanon, the officials
said.
	   The two policemen were performing traffic duty at Martyr's
Square when the motorbike approached at about 8:30 p.m. (1730 GMT),
the officials said.
	   The man on the back of the motorbike opened fire with a pistol,
killing one policeman instantly and wounding the other fatally,
said the officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at Hammoud Hospital confirmed the death of the second
policeman late Saturday night.
	   Earlier this month, an off-duty Lebanese soldier waiting for a
bus was shot and wounded by a man on a motorbike.
	   In August, gunmen on motorcycles shot and killed the owner of a
liquor store and wounded another in separate attacks in two coastal
towns north of Sidon. A liquor shop owner was shot dead in Sidon in
July.
	   There have been no claims of responsibility for the shootings.
But security officials and residents believe Muslim fundamentalist
groups, seeking a ban on alcohol, could be behind the shootings.

Council softens language on force, China sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with three grafs to focus on demand for Yugoslavia to
implement accord, vote scheduled for 2015 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council fine-tuned a draft
resolution Saturday to demand that Yugoslavia implement an accord
to end the crisis in Kosovo and affirm that action may be needed to
enforce it.
	   After several hours of rare Saturday consultations and tough
informal discussions, a revised draft took into account Russian and
Chinese concerns and substantially softened language about the
threat of force to enforce the agreement between ethnic Albanians
and Yugoslav forces.
	   A vote was scheduled for 4:15 p.m. (2015 GMT) Saturday but it
was unclear if it would be unanimous.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
language threatening the two sides with force if they don't comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb
targets.
	   They could veto the resolution or abstain from it.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav
federation.
	   China expressed satisfaction that many of its concerns had been
taken into consideration in the latest draft, said Chen Ranfeng, a
secretary in the Chinese mission.
	   ``As it stands now, I think it could not be considered in
whatever sense as an authorization of use of force,'' he said.
``It's really a good improvement.''

State election reveals weaknesses in Mexico's electoral reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Polls in Tamaulipas open 1400 GMT Sunday and close 0000
GMT.Preliminary results are expected at 0200 GMT Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party says it is leading the
governor's race in the border state of Tamaulipas because of its
recent reforms.
	   However, critics charge that old-fashioned handouts have played
a role as well.
	   Sunday's elections were supposed to be a showcase for reforms in
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which is picking candidates
in open primaries and implementing stricter electoral rules.
	   But the party known as the PRI admits that its has also handed
out sacks of food to desperately poor voters in the border state.
	   ``Food packages are given to the poorest people'' by some PRI
candidates, said Roberto Ibarra, spokesman for PRI candidate Tomas
Yarrington. ``All the candidates do it, it's no big deal.''
	   Opposition parties deny the claim, and they have tried to
capitalize on it in the campaign against Yarrington, a 41-year-old
former mayor of the border city of Matamoros and a self-styled
reformer.
	   Yarrington holds a substantial lead in recent polls in the
state, whose border cities are marked with poverty and foreign
assembly plants.
	   Yarrington's campaign centers on a pledge to spur the economy,
but he concedes that the explosive growth brought by the assembly
plants and poor planning have exacted a cost.
	   The PRI has held Mexico's presidency and most statehouses for
the last 69 years. The party has acknowledged that fraud,
vote-buying and the power of political machines were once common,
but says they are now things of the past.
	   Complaints about the race began when Yarrington won the party
primary, a recent reform that replaced the back-room dealings that
had selected candidates previously.
	   Opponents in the primary claimed that the state's current
governor handpicked Yarrington and gave him enough money to win.
	   ``Until the governors are prevented from interfering ... the
quality of the (primary) races won't improve,'' Marco Antonio
Bernal, who lost the primary, told local media.
	   Beside the governorship, Sunday's elections will also decide the
makeup of the state congress and 43 mayorships for Tamaulipas' 2.6
million inhabitants.
	   Yarrington's rivals, Gustavo Cardenas from the conservative
National Action Party and Joaquin Hernandez of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party, say the ruling party is responsible
for corruption and poor planning.
	   Opposition activists photographed a federal government truck
last week delivering campaign hand-outs. They say it shows that
old-style PRI politics survives in Mexico's provinces, despite
assurances that party is changing.
	   Ibarra said the truck's shipment was paid for by a private
businessman, and that the food was handed out by a mayoral
candidate in the Gulf coast city of Altamira, not by Yarrington's
campaign. But Yarrington campaign material was found at the
delivery site.
	   Tamaulipas state law allows candidates to hand out such goodies,
but using government resources to influence voters _ other than
campaign funds earmarked for parties _ is a federal crime.
	   Other parties denied giving voters hand-outs and said that the
races in Tamaulipas have been anything but fair.
	   ``The conditions for normal democracy do not exist in
Tamaulipas,'' said Antonio Martinez Torres, campaign spokesman for
Hernandez.

	   The armed separatist group ETA, which set the tone for the
campaign five weeks ago by declaring a cease-fire in its drive for
an independent homeland, grabbed the limelight again on the eve of
Sunday's voting.
	   In a taped program broadcast Saturday by the BBC, the group
insisted that its truce offer ``was solid and serious'' but added
that it had no regrets for any of its actions.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives were headed for a clear
victory Saturday in elections for a clergy-based assembly that
oversees the country's supreme leader.
	   The expected outcome would be a blow to moderates who had hoped
to use the Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the
supreme leader and to broaden social and political freedoms for the
average Iranian.
	   The partial results came as no surprise since most moderates had
been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews the eligibility of candidates and is dominated
by hard-liners.
	   With 70 of the 86 seats on the Assembly of Experts decided, the
hard-liners won 43 and the moderates had eight.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear, although they probably lean toward the hard-line camp.
Three were won by declared independents.
	   By late Saturday, 27 of Iran's 28 provinces had filed their
returns. The only results outstanding were from the 16 seats in the
capital Tehran, and they were not expected until Sunday.
	   Many Iranians said they didn't vote to protest the dropping of
most progressive theologians by the Council of Guardians. The
council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and allowed only 167 to
run.
	   While the official media spoke of crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, official results so far showed that only about 15
million of the 31 million eligible voters in the 27 provinces
bothered to vote.
	   About 30 million cast ballots in last year's presidential
elections, and 20 million voted for moderate President Mohammad
Khatami. He has presented the biggest challenge to the
conservatives since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   On Saturday, a leading moderate, former Parliament Speaker
Ayatollah Mehdi Karoubi, joined average Iranians in complaining
about the hard-liners' dropping of progressive candidates from the
ballot.
	   ``As long as the Council of Guardians continues functioning in
this manner, there is no hope for serious competition among
political forces and groups who are loyal to the country's
constitution,'' he wrote in a letter to the head of the council
that was published in newspapers.
	   Some moderate leaders said in advance they did not expect to win
the elections but hoped to use the assembly to focus on the growing
powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and to reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.
	   The only good news for moderates were partial results in Tehran
showing that former President Hashemi Rafsanjani was leading with
874,643 votes. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current
head of the Assembly of Experts, with 672,992 votes.
	   In Tehran, hard-liners seemed to be assured 10 seats while
moderates had four.

Marseille pounds Sochaux to go top; Monaco beaten by lowly Metz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille went top of the French first division for
the first time this season on Saturday, when it thrashed
last-placed Sochaux 4-0 in front of nearly 50,000 spectators at the
Stade Velodrome.
	   Strikers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Titi Camara both grabbed a pair
of goals as Marseille moved to 24 points after ten rounds of the
championship.
	   Marseille leapt above Bordeaux, which has 22 points and plays on
Sunday night at home to Nancy.
	   Marseille, which got a creditable 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in
the UEFA Cup on Tuesday, took the lead three minutes before half
time when Ravenelli headed in a fine free kick from Jocelyn
Gourvennec.
	   Burly striker Camara then grabbed goals in the 56th and 73rd
minutes, before Ravanelli completed the rout a minute from time.
	   Rolland Courbis' team is now unbeaten in 21 French first
division matches.
	   Modest Rennes kept up its challenge at the top, beating local
rival Lorient by a single goal.
	   Shabani Nonda's 11th minute penalty proved enough to put Rennes
into third place, on 20 points.
	   Metz, last years runnerup, won its first game of the season,
beating fancied Monaco 1-0 with a 30th minute penalty by Bruno
Rodriguez.
	   Monaco sweeper Franck Dumas was sent off in the final minute to
complete a miserable night for the 1997 champion.
	   Paris Saint-Germain also had a player sent off when Francis
Llacer was shown the red card, but clung on for a goalless draw at
Nantes.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Militant Jewish settlers threatened Saturday to
keep the new Middle East peace accord from taking effect, vowing to
try to topple the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for signing it.
	   Extremist right-wing settlers believe Israel's agreement to cede
13 percent of West Bank land to the Palestinians threatens their
very existence.
	   Initial settler response to Friday's accord was muted by the
Jewish Sabbath, which began at sundown. But settlers said street
protests were planned for Sunday.
	   Police said they beefed up security in preparation for angry
Israeli outbursts against the peace accord and for possible attacks
by anti-Israeli militants wishing to derail its implementation.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton joined
Netanyahu in signing the agreement reached during a marathon
nine-day summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Most settlers who are observant Jews did not watch the White
House ceremony on television Friday night because they refrain from
using appliances or machines on the Sabbath.
	   On the Palestinian side, reaction to the agreement was cautious
but upbeat.
	   The three Palestinian dailies splashed the signing on their
front pages Saturday with headlines in large, bold type. Editorials
said that although many Palestinian goals remain unfulfilled, the
agreement is a step toward peace.
	   The leading daily Al-Quds, which generally reflects the thinking
of Arafat's government, said the accord suggested that Netanyahu
and his right-wing allies are finally accepting the reality of
Palestinian aspirations.
	   Some ordinary Palestinians, though, were more pessimistic.
	   ``What is an agreement _ does it mean the settlement at the top
of the mountain will go away? Or that the checkpoint will go away?
I don't think so,'' said a 25-year-old worker named Mohammed as he
walked down a street in the West Bank town of Nablus carrying
loaves of bread.
	   Israel annexed the West Bank after capturing it from Jordan in
1967. The 2,300 square-mile area is home to an estimated 1.6
million Palestinians and about 155,000 Israelis.
	   In an apparent move to crack down on anti-Israeli radicals in
accordance with a key Palestinian step in the accord, Palestinian
intelligence forces arrested seven militants of the Islamic Jihad
organization in the West Bank, group members said.
	   Those arrested do not hold senior positions and were detained in
recent days in Nablus and Jenin, the members told The Associated
Press. Islamic Jihad has carried out deadly attacks against Israel
in protest of the peace process.
	   Jewish settlers expressed fear and anger even before the accord
was signed.
	   ``After they sign the agreement, they will continue with these
bombs. Until they take all the land, they will not leave us
alone,'' said Shiran Srur, a 14-year-old girl living at Maale
Adumin, the West Bank's largest Jewish settlement.
	   Lawmaker Michael Kleiner, a settler leader, said settlers
considered the deal extremely dangerous.
	   ``This small country is giving a lot of territory,'' he told
Israel's Channel Two prior to Friday's signing. ``We see this as a
black day.''
	   Hard-line settlers believe they can stop Netanyahu from carrying
out the Israeli withdrawal for months, through political
maneuvering and mass protests.
	   Earlier this week, settlers demonstrated and blocked roads near
areas that might come under Palestinian control and more were
planned for Sunday morning.
	   Maps for the troop withdrawal have not been made public, but it
is thought the move will isolate up to 15 Jewish settlements. The
settlers are likely to respond by trying to expand and reinforce
those communities.
	   Such actions would likely spark clashes with Palestinians, who
are already furious over what they see as continuous land grabs by
the settlers.
	   The settlers are likely to focus on the political front, trying
to bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections. The
settlers say their supporters in the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset, will withdraw their support from the prime minister and
force a vote of confidence.
	   Netanyahu's coalition holds 61 votes in the 120 member Knesset,
and the erosion of any support could be costly.
	   Opposition parties, however, say they will back the accord, thus
offsetting any no votes from hard-line members of Netanyahu's
coalition.
	   Netanyahu must also win Cabinet approval for the Wye agreement.
Israel radio said Saturday that the accord will most likely pass
the Cabinet since only four of the 16 ministers are sure to vote
against it.
	   The withdrawal is supposed to occur over 12 weeks, but Hanan
Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a legislator in
Netanyahu's coalition, said last week that Netanyahu would be
unable to pull back troops during any election campaign.

Council softens language on force, China sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with council meeting to vote and to UPDATE
with council president saying resolution gives troop contributors
the guarantees they need. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council fine-tuned a draft
resolution Saturday to demand that Yugoslavia implement an accord
to end the crisis in Kosovo and affirm that action may be needed to
enforce it.
	   After several hours of rare Saturday consultations and tough
informal discussions, a revised draft took into account Russian and
Chinese concerns and substantially softened language about the
threat of force to enforce the agreement between ethnic Albanians
and Yugoslav forces.
	   The council met later Saturday to vote on the resolution.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
language threatening the two sides with force if they don't comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb
targets.
	   They could veto the resolution or abstain from it.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav
federation.
	   China expressed satisfaction that many of its concerns had been
taken into consideration in the latest draft, said Chen Ranfeng, a
secretary in the Chinese mission.
	   ``As it stands now, I think it could not be considered in
whatever sense as an authorization of use of force,'' he said.
``It's really a good improvement.''
	   The Security Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about the safety
of their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first,
with provisions for enforcement.
	   Under the deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team to verify the agreement.
	   Council President Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said he was sure
the resolution provided OSCE member states with the security
guarantees they needed.
	   ``They know they have NATO in particular beind them on this in
folowing up this resolution,'' he said heading into the vote. ``I'm
sure this will mean the OSCE can go forward as soon as its
organized itself.''
	   A draft resolution tabled Friday night would have allowed NATO
to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced.
It noted that in the event of an emergency, ``action may be
needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
	   Saturday's revised draft deleted reference to international
organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and promptly. The draft still
said that action may be needed to protect the monitors, but
referred to Yugoslavia's duty to ensure their safety under the
accord.
	   The draft also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute
cooperate with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Militant Jewish settlers threatened Saturday to
keep the new Middle East peace accord from taking effect, vowing to
try to topple the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for signing it.
	   Extremist right-wing settlers believe Israel's agreement to cede
13 percent of West Bank land to the Palestinians threatens their
very existence.
	   Initial settler response to Friday's accord was muted by the
Jewish Sabbath, which began at sundown. But settlers said street
protests were planned for Sunday.
	   Police said they beefed up security in preparation for angry
Israeli outbursts against the peace accord and for possible attacks
by anti-Israeli militants wishing to derail its implementation.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton joined
Netanyahu in signing the agreement reached during a marathon
nine-day summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Most settlers who are observant Jews did not watch the White
House ceremony on television Friday night because they refrain from
using appliances or machines on the Sabbath.
	   On the Palestinian side, reaction to the agreement was cautious
but upbeat.
	   The three Palestinian dailies splashed the signing on their
front pages Saturday with headlines in large, bold type. Editorials
said that although many Palestinian goals remain unfulfilled, the
agreement is a step toward peace.
	   The leading daily Al-Quds, which generally reflects the thinking
of Arafat's government, said the accord suggested that Netanyahu
and his right-wing allies are finally accepting the reality of
Palestinian aspirations.
	   Some ordinary Palestinians, though, were more pessimistic.
	   ``What is an agreement _ does it mean the settlement at the top
of the mountain will go away? Or that the checkpoint will go away?
I don't think so,'' said a 25-year-old worker named Mohammed as he
walked down a street in the West Bank town of Nablus carrying
loaves of bread.
	   Israel annexed the West Bank after capturing it from Jordan in
1967. The 2,300 square-mile area is home to an estimated 1.6
million Palestinians and about 155,000 Israelis.
	   In an apparent move to crack down on anti-Israeli radicals in
accordance with a key Palestinian step in the accord, Palestinian
intelligence forces arrested seven militants of the Islamic Jihad
organization in the West Bank, group members said.
	   Those arrested do not hold senior positions and were detained in
recent days in Nablus and Jenin, the members told The Associated
Press. Islamic Jihad has carried out deadly attacks against Israel
in protest of the peace process.
	   Jewish settlers expressed fear and anger even before the accord
was signed.
	   ``After they sign the agreement, they will continue with these
bombs. Until they take all the land, they will not leave us
alone,'' said Shiran Srur, a 14-year-old girl living at Maale
Adumin, the West Bank's largest Jewish settlement.
	   Lawmaker Michael Kleiner, a settler leader, said settlers
considered the deal extremely dangerous.
	   ``This small country is giving a lot of territory,'' he told
Israel's Channel Two prior to Friday's signing. ``We see this as a
black day.''
	   Hard-line settlers believe they can stop Netanyahu from carrying
out the Israeli withdrawal for months, through political
maneuvering and mass protests.
	   Earlier this week, settlers demonstrated and blocked roads near
areas that might come under Palestinian control and more were
planned for Sunday morning.
	   Maps for the troop withdrawal have not been made public, but it
is thought the move will isolate up to 15 Jewish settlements. The
settlers are likely to respond by trying to expand and reinforce
those communities.
	   Such actions would likely spark clashes with Palestinians, who
are already furious over what they see as continuous land grabs by
the settlers.
	   The settlers are likely to focus on the political front, trying
to bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections. The
settlers say their supporters in the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset, will withdraw their support from the prime minister and
force a vote of confidence.
	   Netanyahu's coalition holds 61 votes in the 120 member Knesset,
and the erosion of any support could be costly.
	   Opposition parties, however, say they will back the accord, thus
offsetting any no votes from hard-line members of Netanyahu's
coalition.
	   Netanyahu must also win Cabinet approval for the Wye agreement.
Israel radio said Saturday that the accord will most likely pass
the Cabinet since only four of the 16 ministers are sure to vote
against it.
	   The withdrawal is supposed to occur over 12 weeks, but Hanan
Porat, a member of the National Religious Party and a legislator in
Netanyahu's coalition, said last week that Netanyahu would be
unable to pull back troops during any election campaign.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech Olympic athletics champions
Emil and Dana Zatopek celebrated their golden wedding Saturday,
media reported.
	   Emil Zatopek, five-time Olympic champion distance runner,
married Dana, a javelin thrower, in the town of Uherske Hradiste on
Oct. 24, 1948, several months after winning his first Olympic gold
at the London Olympics.
	   He added three more golds in Helsinki four years later, where he
dominated the 5,000, 10,000 and marathon races, while Dana won the
gold medal in Finland for women's javelin.
	   In addition to their Olympic medals, the two also share the same
birthday, Sept. 19, 1922.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of veiled women who support
a Pakistani orthodox religious party said Saturday that Western
concepts of women's liberation exploit and degrade women.
	   The women met during a three-day conference held by the right
wing Jamaat-e-Islami, which wants to impose Islamic law on this
country. The conference has attracted an estimated 100,000 people
to the federal capital.
	   Organizers say they are laying the groundwork for an Islamic
revolution. In recent months, economic troubles have worsened in
Pakistan, and Islamic hard-liners have gained popularity.
	   The women said they sought to dispel misconceptions that Islam
does not guarantee women equal political, social and economic
rights, and said standards in the West harm women.
	   ``Western civilization has caused mischief in all spheres of
human life,'' the women said in a statement. ``Women became the
main target of lust . . . and are exposed to the worst kind of
exploitation in the name of their rights.''
	   After the meeting, participants donated jewelry and cash to the
Jamaat's Jihad, or holy war, fund. Jamaat sends volunteers to fight
in Muslim conflicts around the world.
	   Later, 30 couples were married in a mass ceremony. The grooms
and brides signed wedding documents and celebrated in separate
tents, meeting only at the end of the day, as is tradition in
strict Muslim families.
	   ``This mass wedding is part of our efforts to promote simplicity
in the society and eradicate the menace of dowry,'' said Liaquat
Baluch, a Jamaat leader.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has begun pressing for a sweeping
bill that would impose Islamic law, but hard-liners say his actions
are just a ploy to consolidate power.

Lawyer says deal is near in Tyson civil case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROCKVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson's lawyer said an
out-of-court settlement was close to head off a civil suit against
the boxer stemming from an argument following an auto accident.
	   Paul Kemp said he and attorneys for Richard Dale Hardick and
Abimelec Saucedo were close to an agreement in which Tyson would
pay the men an undisclosed amount of money to prevent any lawsuits.
Kemp said the parties agreed to keep the terms confidential.
	   ``We've settled it in principle,'' Kemp said. ``We're just
waiting for some signatures, and some people are out of town.''
	   Glenn Culpepper, an attorney for Saucedo, said he could not
comment ``until it's in black and white and everything is signed.''
	   Any out-of-court financial agreement, however, would not affect
the two misdemeanor assault charges against the former heavyweight
boxing champion. Maryland law says that a judge may dismiss an
assault case if a prosecutor requests it and the victim agrees.
	   Tyson is scheduled to go to trial Dec. 1 in District Court.
	   Kemp said Friday that Montgomery County prosecutors rejected
Tyson's request to delay the trial date on charges brought by
Hardick and Saucedo, who accused Tyson of attacking them after a
traffic accident in Gaithersburg, in suburban Washington.

Skeptical Beckenbauer named vice-president of German soccer
</HEADLINE>
organization &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer, demanding more
independence for the professional Bundesliga clubs, Saturday was
elected vice-president of germany's governing soccer body.
	   Beckenbauer recently derided the DFB as ``a waste of time'' and
``run by amateurs'' but was nonetheless overwhelmingly voted into
office by the organization's delegates at their annual meeting.
	   Beckenbauer, Germany's most influential and popular soccer
figure, wanted and will get a separate league office for the
Bundesliga, the 36 professional teams that compose the first and
second division.
	   ``We have to administer and market ourselves,'' said
Beckenbauer, president of Bayern Munich, who had threatened
beforehand to resign quickly if his plans are rejected.
	   ``The (Bundesliga) has to grow up. We still don't have
solidarity, we are 36 teams fighting for ourselves,'' he added.
	   The DFB has 6.2 million members, making it the world's largest
organization dedicated to a single sport, and is responsible for
Germany's professional, youth, women and amateur soccer programs.
	   Delegates also voted for guidelines that will allow Bundesliga
clubs to offer shares in their enterprises on the stock market.
	   The delegates, as expected, voted Edigius Braun to a third term
as president until 2001.
	   Beckenbauer, despite his open ridicule of the DFB, is needed by
the organization because of his stature in Germany.
	   The DFB, whose showcase is the national team, is under fire for
Germany's poor quarterfinals showing at the recent World Cup and
for failing to develop young soccer talent.
	   Beckenbauer's plans for a more independent Bundesliga, however,
drew the opposition of another top league and DFB official.
	   ``With me, there will never be a separation from the DFB,'' said
VfB Stuttgart president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder.
	   The structure of the Bundesliga's new league office will be
decided by June 30 of next year.

French defense minister signs defense pact in Qatar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JABER AL-HARMI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ French Defense Minister Alain Richard signed
an expanded defense pact with Qatar here Saturday, French diplomats
said.
	   Richard flew into Qatar on Saturday and was expected to meet
with Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and other senior
officials during his two-day trip, the diplomats said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Richard is scheduled to present the Qatari army with a gift of
ten Leclerc battle tanks on Sunday, said the diplomats.
	   The agreement enlarged a military pact signed in 1994. The
details of the agreement were not available, but during previous
visits French officials had suggested the formation of a joint
military committee and reinforced technical cooperation to
modernize Qatar's military equipment.
	   France maintains close relations with Qatar, a tiny nation
sitting on the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas. Qatar
buys more than 70 percent of its weapons from France and Qatari
military personnel routinely train in France.
	   Some 600 French troops took part in two-day military exercises
in Qatar earlier this week. The French supply ship, La Somme, and
the frigate, La Fayette, participated in the exercises.

Celta downs Zaragoza 2-0 to overtake Madrid as league leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIGO, Spain (AP) _ Celta de Vigo ousted mighty Real Madrid from
the league leader's spot Saturday on downing Zaragoza 2-0.
	   After a colorless first half, striker Juan Sanchez headed in a
first from 10 yards (meters) for Celta two minutes after the break.
Then in the 69th minute, he made it 2-0 when he slammed the ball
past Zaragoza 'keeper Juanmi Garcia from 12 yards (meters) out to
the left.
	   The result left Celta with 13 points, the same as Real Madrid.
But Celta with a one-goal advantage in goal difference takes the
lead in the 20-team division.
	   Real gets a chance to regain the top post when it plays its
seventh-round game Sunday against No. 8 Racing de Santander.
	   Zaragoza which went into Saturday's match at No. 2, drops a rung
and stays with 12 points.
	   Other seventh-round games Sunday are: Mallorca vs. Atletico
Madrid; Tenerife vs. Deportivo La Coruna; Oviedo vs. Villareal;
Real Sociedad vs. Valladolid; Espanyol vs. Barcelona; Salamanca vs.
Athletic Bilbao; Valencia vs. Betis; Real Madrid vs. Racing de
Santander and Alaves vs. Extremadura.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council prepared to adopt a
draft resolution Saturday demanding that Yugoslavia implement an
accord to end the crisis in Kosovo and affirming that action may be
needed to enforce it.
	   After several hours of rare Saturday consultations and tough
informal discussions, a revised draft took into account Russian and
Chinese concerns and eased language about the threat of force to
enforce the agreement between ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces.
	   The council was meeting to vote. China planned to abstain, but
Russia's plans were unclear.
	   Russia and China, both permanent council members, are opposed to
any language threatening the two sides with force if they don't
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO strikes on
Serb targets.
	   Their options were to veto the resolution or abstain from it.

Baltic ferry damaged in heavy weather 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The bow door of a ferry crossing the
Baltic Sea toward Stockholm was damaged in heavy weather, reports
said Saturday, the second such incident in a week.
	   There were no reports of injuries aboard the Viking Line's
Gabriella, which left Helsinki, Finland, for the Swedish capital on
Friday evening. Nor were there injuries on Tuesday when Estline's
Baltic Kristina was damaged en route from Tallinn, Estonia.
	   But the incidents were reminders of the 1994 Estonia ferry
disaster that killed 852 people. The Estonia sank en route to
Stockholm when heavy seas tore off its visor-like bow door and
water surged into the vehicle deck.
	   The Gabriella's bow door took a blow during the crossing and was
unable to open when the boat arrived, the Swedish news agency TT
quoted Viking Lines head Jan Kaarstroem as saying.
	   The enormous boats that crisscross the Baltic Sea between
Sweden, Finland and Estonia are important freight-transit links and
popular excursion vessels.

Grigorian stops Campanella to retain WBO title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Uzbekhstan's Artur Grigorian stopped
Italy's Giorgo Campanella in the 10th round Saturday with a barrage
of punches to retain his WBO lightweight title.
	   Grigorian, making the sixth defense of his title, ran his record
to 25-0 with 16 knockouts against Campanella, who failed for the
third time to capture a title.
	   Grigorian battered him with right hooks and left uppercuts
before the referee stopped the bout with 1:36 remaining in the
round.
	   Campanella, now 26-5-1, had knocked down Oscar de la Hoya in his
first try at a belt in 1994, but was later knocked out in the WBO
junior lightweight title fight.
	   The corners of both Grigorian and Campanella had to stem cuts
above the left eyes of their fighters during the fight.
	   Grigorian, after a slow start, was cut in the second, but he
began to take control of the fight during the round by hammering
Campanella with combinations.
	   Campanella, a righthander, briefly switched to a southpaw style
in the seventh round to protect the wound above the eye.
	   The fight was held on the undercard of the European heavyweight
title fight between the Ukraine's Vitali Klitschko and Germany's
Mario Schiesser.
	   The unbeaten Klitschko won the the vacant title, stopping
Schiesser in the second round after flooring the German twice. It
was his 23rd knockout in as many fights. k
	   Grigorian weighed 61 kilos (134 pounds) and Campanella was at
60.8 (134 pounds).

German tourist killed by elephant on South African golf course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHALABORWA, South Africa (AP) _ An elephant trampled a German
tourist to death on a golf course on Saturday while her family
watched, police said.
	   The victim was Rita Hahn from Stuttgart, according to the South
African Press Association.
	   Citing the police report, SAPA said the elephant crossed through
a fence on the border of Kruger Park onto the Hans Merensky Country
Club and Lodge golf course, in eastern South Africa.
	   During the attack, Hahn received severe head injuries.
	   Her husband, daughter and daughter's boyfriend saw the attack,
then fled.
	   The animal was still at large at nightfall.
	   ``This is the first such incident of this nature in the history
of the club and management are deeply saddened by this tragic
event,'' said golf club manager J. Sampson.
	   Last month, a German television cameraman, Christian Hohmann,
was killed in an elephant attack on a nature reserve in KwaZulu
Natal.

Expansion Fire puts four on honorary squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Polish midfielder and league MVP candidate
Peter Nowak led a four-man contingent from the expansion Chicago
Fire that was named Saturday to Major League Soccer's ``Best 11''.
	   Nowak was joined by a somewhat surprising choice of fellow
midfielder Chris Armas, Goalkeeper of the Year award winner Zach
Thornton and Defender of the Year winner Lubos Kubik of the Czech
Republic.
	   The honorary team contained members from only four of MLS' 12
clubs, the four playoff semifinalists.
	   Forward Cobi Jones, midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos of El
Salvador and defender Robin Fraser were selected from the Los
Angeles Galaxy.
	   Most Valuable Player Award winner Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia
was named to the midfield and was joined by defender Eddie Pope
from two-time defending champion D.C. United.
	   League scoring leader Stern John was joined by U.S. national
team captain Thomas Dooley from the Columbus Crew.
	   Nowak finished just behind in the MVP voting to Etcheverry, who
was the only player to be named to the squad all three years of
MLS' existence.
	   It was a second-time selection for Pope, Dooley, Fraser and
Cienfuegos.
	   Seven of the players, selected by MLS coaches and general
managers, will be featured on Sunday when the Fire faces D.C.
United in MLS Cup '98 for the league title in the Rose Bowl.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to ease concerns about the security
of international monitors in Kosovo, the Security Council demanded
Saturday that Yugoslavia implement an accord to end fighting in the
Yugoslav province and said action may be needed to enforce it.
	   After nearly eight hours of rare Saturday consultations and
informal discussions, a divided council adopted a resolution 13-0
to endorse the agreement to allow unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo
and NATO to verify from the air that fighting has stopped.
	   China and Russia abstained from the vote. China argued the
resolution went beyond what was agreed to between Yugoslavia and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Russia said details of the resolution
_ particularly an expression of deep concern about recent closure
of independent media in Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution
endorsing the accord.

	   Russia and China, both permanent council members, were opposed
to any resolution threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force
if they don't comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO
strikes on Serb targets.
	   They could have vetoed the resolution or abstained from it. Much
of the negotiation Saturday was intended to prevent a possible veto
by easing language about the threat of force, diplomats said.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov stated before the vote that the
resolution ``excludes all enforcement elements,'' and guarantees
against ``arbitrary or unsanctioned actions.''

	   The Security Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of
their forces and wanted the council to endorse the plan first, with
provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
on Albanian separatists began in February.
	   Under the Oct. 12 deal brokered by Holbrooke, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to withdraw his special
police forces from the province and to allow a 2,000-strong team
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
verify the agreement. NATO would verify compliance from the air.
	   Council President Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said he was sure
the resolution provided the 54 OSCE member states with the security
guarantees they needed.
	   ``They know they have NATO in particular behind them on this in
following up this resolution,'' Greenstock said heading into the
vote. ``I'm sure this will mean the OSCE can go forward as soon as
its organized itself.''
	   Eugeniusz Wyzner, the ambassador for Poland, which holds the
OSCE presidency, said he trusted that the resolution would help
make the agreement effective ``and to assure safety and security of
international verifiers.''
	   It was believed to have been the first council resolution
endorsing a NATO operation, diplomats said.
	   A draft resolution tabled Friday night would have allowed NATO
to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced.
It noted that in the event of an emergency, ``action may be
needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
	   Saturday's revised draft deleted reference to international
organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and promptly. The draft still
allowed that action may be needed to protect the monitors but
referred back to Yugoslavia's duty to ensure their safety under the
accord.
	   The draft also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute
cooperate with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

Security Council demands that Yugoslavia implement Kosovo accord

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to ease concerns about the security
of international monitors in Kosovo, the Security Council demanded
Saturday that Yugoslavia implement an accord to end fighting in the
Yugoslav province and said action may be needed to enforce it.
	   After nearly eight hours of rare Saturday consultations and
discussions, a divided council adopted a resolution 13-0 to endorse
the agreement to allow unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo and NATO
to verify from the air that fighting has stopped.
	   China and Russia abstained from the vote. China argued the
resolution went beyond what was agreed to between Yugoslavia and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Russia said details of the resolution
_ particularly an expression of deep concern about recent closure
of independent media in Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution
endorsing the accord.
	   Russia and China, both permanent council members, were opposed
to any resolution threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force
if they don't comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO
strikes on Serb targets.
	   They could have vetoed the resolution or abstained from it. Much
of the negotiation Saturday was intended to prevent a possible veto
by easing language about the threat of force, diplomats said.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov stated before the vote that the
resolution ``excludes all enforcement elements,'' and guarantees
against ``arbitrary or unsanctioned actions.''
	   The Security Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of
their forces and wanted the council to endorse the plan first, with
provisions for enforcement.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
on Albanian separatists began in February.
	   Under the Oct. 12 deal brokered by Holbrooke, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to implement a cease-fire, to withdraw
his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to verify the agreement. NATO would verify
compliance from the air.
	   Council President Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said he was sure
the resolution provided the 54 OSCE member states with the security
guarantees they needed.
	   ``They know they have NATO in particular behind them on this in
following up this resolution,'' Greenstock said heading into the
vote. ``I'm sure this will mean the OSCE can go forward as soon as
its organized itself.''
	   Eugeniusz Wyzner, the ambassador for Poland, which holds the
OSCE presidency, said he trusted that the resolution would help
make the agreement effective ``and to assure safety and security of
international verifiers.''
	   It was believed to have been the first council resolution
endorsing a NATO operation, diplomats said.
	   A draft resolution tabled Friday night would have allowed NATO
to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure the agreement is enforced.
It noted that in the event of an emergency, ``action may be
needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
	   Saturday's resolution deleted reference to international
organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and promptly. The measure
still allowed that action may be needed to protect the monitors but
referred back to Yugoslavia's duty to ensure their safety under the
accord.
	   It also demanded that both sides in the Kosovo dispute cooperate
with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

Sudanese rebels claim to have downed MiG-23 warplane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese rebels claimed Saturday that they
have shot down a MiG-23 jet fighter and fended off a government
attack in the south.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said their forces shot down
the Russian-built fighter of the Sudanese Air Force at 8:30 a.m.
near al-Jabalain, 64 Kilometers (40 miles) east of Juba, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported from Asmara, the Eritrean capital.
	   Sudanese government forces and the SPLA rebels have been
fighting for more than a month in East Equatoria province. Juba,
which lies 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum, is the
capital of the province and the biggest town in southern Sudan.
	   The rebel statement said government forces suffered heavy losses
in men and equipment in an attack to recapture al-Jabalain.
	   ``Al-Jabalain garrison has become a graveyard for the forces of
the ruling regime in Sudan,'' the statement said.
	   A reporter at the official Sudanese News Agency in Khartoum told
The Associated Press that the government had not issued any
statement Saturday on military action in the country.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to win autonomy for the
south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the north's
Muslim and Arab population. More than 1.5 million people have died
in the fighting and accompanying famines.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top NATO generals pressured
Yugoslav leaders for further withdrawals from Kosovo Saturday,
three days short of its deadline for President Slobodan Milosevic
to meet Western demands.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander in
Europe, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military committee, met briefly with the Yugoslav president, before
going into talks with Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the Yugoslav Army Chief
of Staff.
	   Both the alliance and the Yugoslav army remained tightlipped
about the meetings, but a diplomatic source speaking on condition
of anonymity said that NATO wanted to let the Yugoslavs know they
must do more in withdrawing military and special police units from
Kosovo.
	   The alliance has set a Tuesday deadline for the withdrawals.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
Saturday demanding that Yugoslavia abide by the accord and said
action may be needed to ensure the safety of international monitors
there.
	   After nearly eight hours of rare Saturday consultations, a
divided council adopted a resolution 13-0 to endorse the agreement
to allow unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo and NATO to verify from
the air that fighting has stopped. China and Russia abstained from
the vote.
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis caused by
its crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants, who demand independence
for the majority Albanian province. It blames the Albanians for the
continued clashes.
	   In a statement published Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language
daily Koha Ditore, the rebels said they would take no ``offensive
action'' against withdrawing government forces.
	   ``But any movement towards villages or our positions will force
us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels said.
	   NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance mission
over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday.
	   Western nations are just beginning to organize a 2,000-strong
group of unarmed monitors to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo,
so Tuesday's deadline is widely expected to be extended for a
second time. No official action by NATO is expected until Monday.
	   While most fighting in Kosovo halted in late September, there is
sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different
locations.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to withdraw
special police and army units sent to the province after he
launched his crackdown on the KLA on Feb. 28. Hundreds of people
have been killed and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and
enable international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also
pledged to negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of
Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia.
	   Early Saturday, five refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo
were seriously wounded when Yugoslav border guards opened fire on
them while they were crossing into neighboring Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry reported.
	   The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were
airlifted from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana
Military Hospital, where they were in critical condition late
Saturday, said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the province's 2
million inhabitants, and most favor independence or self-rule.

U.S. women serving life sentence complains of prison isolation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CATHERINE ELTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ An American woman serving a life sentence for
terrorism complained Saturday of the isolation she suffers in her
new prison, her mother said.
	   Lori Berenson said she preferred the frigid conditions of her
old prison, where she spent the past three years, to ``being
isolated from the world and on a regime that is different from all
of the other prisoners who are not even permitted to look at me,''
she said, according to her mother, Rhoda.
	   Lori Berenson was transferred two weeks ago to Socabaya prison
near the city of Arequipa, 465 miles (750 kilometers) southeast of
Lima to undergo medical tests. She had been at Yanamayo prison,
12,700 feet (3,870 meters) high in the Andes.
	   Doctors say Berenson, 28, suffers from swollen arthritic hands
and respiratory problems caused by the cold and high altitude at
Yanamayo.
	   Her hands are still ``purple and distorted,'' her parents said.
	   Lori Berenson's medical exams have not been completed.
	   Lori Berenson was convicted by a hooded military judge in 1996
of helping leftist rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
plan a thwarted assault on Peru's Congress.
	   Her parents, who have appealed to human rights groups and the
Costa Rican-based International Human Rights Court, maintain their
daughter is innocent and that her secret trial by a military court
didn't allow her a fair defense. U.S. officials have asked Peru to
give hear an open, civilian trial.
	   But Peru's President Alberto Fujimori said she is a terrorist
and will receive no special treatment.
	   While she suffered from cold and altitude at Yanamayo, Lori
Berenson says she is now suffering from isolation. Her mother
quoted her as saying, ``They have thrown me in a cage and isolated
me from the world.''
	   Nonetheless, she added that her daughter will not request to be
returned to Yanamayo.
	   When Lori Berenson was taken by helicopter from the old prison,
she was blindfolded, which prevented her from seeing the outside
world for the first time in three years, her parents said.
	   She was hooded with a bed sheet when she was transferred from
her cell at Socabaya to the prison infirmary so that no other
prisoners could see her.

Turkish Police detain 30 in small left-wing party rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police detained 30 people during a
political rally organized by a small left-wing party in Istanbul,
the Anatolia news agency reported Saturday.
	   Supporters of the Liberties and Solidarity Party, which has no
deputies in parliament, were carrying a banner that read, ``The
country is seeking justice,'' the report said.
	   Police warned party leaders against making speeches to the crowd
gathered on a street. The authorities charged when the leaders
refused to comply, the report said.
	   Some supporters smashed shop windows during the clashes, it
added.
	   Turkey is frequently criticized for human rights abuses
including imprisonment for political offenses.

Friends meet again in MLS Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Kickoff Sunday scheduled for 2030 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN PETERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ They've argued, traded insults and
questioned each other's reasoning for years.
	   On Sunday, pals Bruce Arena and Bob Bradley can scowl at each
other across the field at the Rose Bowl while their opposing teams
try to win the Major League Soccer championship.
	   Arena, whose D.C. United will be going for a third MLS Cup
victory in three years, and Bradley, who guided the expansion
Chicago Fire into the title game, have a long and successful
history together.
	   Included are championships in both previous MLS Cup games played
by the 3-year-old league; Bradley was Arena's assistant before
leaving for Chicago.
	   United midfielder John Harkes smiled as he recalled practices
while Bradley was working under Arena.
	   ``I think they tried to keep it down to about three arguments a
day,'' he said.
	   Arena, considered the leading candidate to become the next coach
of the U.S. national team coach, described the relationship between
him and Bradley as ``like being married.''
	   ``We've always gone through that kind of thing,'' he said. ``We
disagree, and then I'm right.''
	   At least on that score, Bradley agreed.
	   ``I challenge him and he doesn't budge an inch,'' he said. ``He
thinks he's always right.''
	   Bradley was an assistant for two years at the University of
Virginia, where Arena's teams won five U.S. college titles, then
Bradley left to become head coach at Princeton University. When
Arena was chosen the U.S. coach for the 1996 Olympics, he again
turned to Bradley to be his assistant.
	   The MLS title match won't be the first high-stakes meeting
between them _ in 1993, when Bradley was voted college coach of the
year, his Princeton Tigers lost the college semifinals to Virginia
and his former and future boss.
	   ``Bruce is very gracious with his comments about me,'' Bradley
said, tongue-in-cheek, remembering 1993. ``He was very big in
saying I should be coach of the year.
	   ``If you know Bruce and read between the lines, what he's really
saying when he says that stuff is, `We're much better that their
team and we're going to kick their butts. Bob's a nice guy, so he
should at least have something to go home with.' Our friendship
survived that day.''
	   D.C. United also beat Chicago in both regular-season meetings
this year, leaving Bradley wondering how he might react if he ever
beats an Arena-coached team.
	   ``Somewhere along the line, I'm hoping to see if I can handle it
when our team wins,'' he said.
	   On a more serious note, Bradley said, ``D.C. United has set the
standard in our league over the first few years. I know anytime you
play against a team that he (Arena) is involved with, you know that
the team will be very good.''
	   Arena returned the compliment, saying, ``I think he's done an
absolutely tremendous job with Chicago.''
	   United, which had a 24-8 regular-season record and was extended
to three games by Columbus in the playoffs, indeed has been the
class of the fledgling league, particularly in the postseason. D.C.
beat the favored Los Angeles Galaxy in the first MLS Cup, then
defeated Colorado for the title a year ago.
	   Playmaker Marco Etcheverry, the league MVP, directs a potent
D.C. attack. He had 10 goals and a league-best 19 assists during
the regular season.
	   Early season addition Roy Lassiter (18 goals, 8 assists) and
Jaime Moreno (16, 11) provide striking power up front for a team
stronger on the attack than on defense.
	   The Fire, by contrast, has been led by goalkeeper Zach Thornton,
who had a 1.17 goals-against average this year, and a smothering
defense. Chris Armas is a talented stopper in the midfield and will

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Militant Jewish settlers threatened Saturday to

Love emerges from the pack to lead at Disney

<TEXT>
	   vantage of his second eagle in as many days for a 7-under-par 65
and a three-stroke lead in Disney's National Car Rental Classic.
	   Love, who was in danger of missing the cut after opening with a
73, was at 14-under 202 after holing a 7 1-2-meter (25-foot) birdie
putt on the last hole. Glen Day and Doug Martin each shot 68 and
were at 205.
	   ``We knew somebody would get out and shoot a low score and set
the pace,'' Love said. ``I got the birdie at No. 3 and the eagle at
No. 4, and that got me going. All in all, it was a good, solid
round _ and a good score when I needed it.''
	   John Huston was at 206 after a 3-under 69, while Tiger Woods,
Jesper Parnevik and Fred Funk were another stroke back.
	   Love, Martin and Day were among six players who started the
third round at 7-under, and 43 others were within five shots of the
lead, setting the table for a wild day of leaderboard-watching.
	   David Duval and Tiger Woods, the last two winners of the Disney
Classic, gave up on that idea quickly.
	   ``I was 9-under and one off the lead, then two holes later I was
7-under and tied for 30th,'' said Duval, who finished at 8-under
208, five strokes off the lead but still in the hunt for his fifth
victory of the year.
	   ``If you lost one shot, you moved down 10 spots,'' added Woods.
	   Twelve players were at 7-under when Love and Martin walked out
to the first tee. Love changed that in a hurry, hitting a 7-iron to
1 1-2 meters (5 feet) for birdie on the 160-yard (144-meter) third
hole, and following that with a 1-iron to 12 meters (40 feet) for
his eagle.
	   He led by as many as four strokes at one point before Day and
Martin put together a stretch of birdies on the back nine.
	   And Love knows it's not over yet. Twenty players are within six
strokes of the lead.
	   ``I still think I have to do the same thing,'' Love said. ``You
have to be aggressive on this course.''
	   That's good advice for those trying to finish in the top 125 on
the money list to keep their exempt-status, and those trying to get
into the top 30 to qualify for next week's lucrative Tour
Championship _ dlrs 720,000 for the winner, dlrs 64,000 for last
place.
	   Stewart Cink needs dlrs 61,868 to move past Andrew Magee at No.
30 on the money list. Magee missed the cut by one stroke after a
bogey on the 18th hole on Friday, and Cink will have to finish no
worse than eighth place alone to catch him.

Sorenstam sets course record, takes lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDDIE PELLS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE VILLAGES, Florida (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam shot a
course-record 6-under 66 Saturday and took a one-stroke lead after
three rounds of the Samsung World Championship of Women's Golf.
	   The Swede will head into Sunday's final round with an 8-under
208, one stroke ahead of defending champion Juli Inkster, who
matched Sorenstam's 66 at the 6,326-yard (5,693-meter) Tierra Del
Sol course.
	   Dottie Pepper carried a three-stroke lead into the third round
but shot a 71 and fell into third place, two strokes behind
Sorenstam.
	   Sorenstam is the U.S. women's tour's leading money winner, the
frontrunner in the points battle for Player of the Year and leading
the race for the Vare Trophy _ given to the player with the lowest
scoring average.
	   With two official events remaining after this, Sorenstam is in
good position to sweep the awards, just as she did in 1995, her
second year on the tour.
	   ``That's what I dream about, is having a chance to win a
tournament on Sunday,'' Sorenstam said. ``Especially with it coming
down to the end of the season, with the money list, Player of the
Year and Vare Trophy. That would mean so much to me. I just have to
go out and give it all tomorrow.''
	   She shot a 5-under 31 on the back nine, looking every bit like
the world's best player.
	   South Korean rookie Se Ri Pak, Sorenstam's closest competitor on
the money list and in the Player-of-the-Year chase, shot 73 for a
219 total.
	   Brandie Burton fired a 71 for 213. No one else in the 16-player
field finished below par after three rounds, although decreased
winds helped 10 players break par for the day.
	   Inkster, who won this tournament last year when it was played in
South Korea, hit 16 greens in regulation and converted eight for
birdies. She said she didn't feel much difference from Friday, when
she shot 73.
	   ``I was frustrated yesterday, I was mad,'' she said. ``I played
just as good yesterday as today, but today I made putts. That's
where the difference is.''
	   Despite falling behind, Pepper felt she played some of her best
golf of the year. She just couldn't catch a break, watching birdie
putts lip out at Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 7 and finishing her round with
only two birdies, one bogey and 15 pars.
	   ``I parred it to death,'' she said. ``I felt I played a good
round, but I haven't had my best one yet. I never got the momentum
going to take it deep. If one or two had gone in, I'd have been off
to the races.''
	   Pepper, the hero in the United States' victory over Europe in
the Solheim Cup, is seeking her first tour victory since September
1996.

Report new book accuses Princess Diana of death threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A new book accuses Princess Diana of making death
threats against Camilla Parker Bowles and suggests it was Diana,
not Prince Charles, who first committed adultery, a Sunday tabloid
reported.
	   Excerpts from ``Prince Charles, Villain or Victim,'' by
journalist Penny Junor, are being published in The Mail on Sunday
and described as a defense of Prince Charles by friends who spoke
to the author.
	   The newspaper's tabloid rivals on Sunday characterized the book
as a ``smearing'' of Diana and a ``vile attack'' that will backfire
on the prince.
	   The first installment did not appear in early editions of The
Mail on Sunday, but a front page article described the book as a
challenge to ``some of the inaccuracies and injustices'' of Diana's
version of events in Andrew Morton's now-famous 1992 book ``Diana,
Her True Story'' and in her television interview.
	   ``Junor suggests'' that James Hewitt, the lover Diana
acknowledged, was not her first during the marriage ``and that she
had already had a relationship with Barry Mannakee,'' her personal
detective, the newspaper said.
	   The newspaper alleges that was before Prince Charles resumed his
relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles in 1985.
	   Mannakee's transfer from his post as Diana's guard, and his
subsequent death in a motorcycle accident have already been widely
reported.
	   Diana is also reported to have telephoned Mrs. Parker Bowles
late at night and said, ``I've sent someone to kill you. They're
outside in the garden. Look out of the window; can you see them?''
	   On the night of Diana's death Aug. 31, 1997, the report says
Charles had to argue with Queen Elizabeth II about going to Paris
to bring the princess' body home. The queen reportedly allowed the
use of one of her aircraft after an aide said: ``Would you rather,
Ma'am, that she come back in a Harrods van?''
	   A separate article by Junor said that Charles had never spoken
ill of Diana ``in all their years together and apart, and despite
the provocation...
	   ``Now that she is dead Charles is even more determined that he
will not defend himself and that history alone shall be his
judge,'' Junor wrote.
	   But she said ``a number of his family and friends'' believed
some attempt should be made now to correct some misconceptions.
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Saturday night that ``the
book was neither official nor authorized.
	   ``We would like to remind people that Prince William and Prince
Harry expressed the hope in September that their mother and her
memory should finally be allowed to rest in peace,'' he said on
customary condition of anonymity.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with details of use of force, U.S., British
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council demanded Saturday
that Yugoslavia abide by an accord to end fighting in Kosovo and
said action may be needed to ensure the safety of international
monitors there.
	   Russia and China abstained from voting on the resolution, which
they said did not authorize force to implement the agreement. The
United States said NATO still retained that right and Britain
pledged to use whatever force was necessary to protect the unarmed
monitors.
	   The resolution, which diplomats said was believed to be the
first endorsing a NATO operation, was adopted 13-0 after eight
hours of rare Saturday consultations. It endorses the agreement to
allow unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo and to let NATO verify from
the air that fighting has stopped.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Under the Oct. 12 deal brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to
withdraw his special police forces from the province and to allow a
2,000-strong team from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to verify the agreement.
	   ``No one should be in any doubt that we will use to the full our
inherent right to protect our nationals if they are in danger, and
the right under this resolution to take action to ensure their
safety and freedom of movement,'' said British ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock, the council president.
	   The Security Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution
enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team.
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about the safety
of their forces and wanted the council to endorse the plan first,
with provisions for enforcement.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China were opposed to any
resolution threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force if
they don't comply with the agreement, which averted NATO strikes on
Serb targets.
	   They could have vetoed the resolution. Much of the negotiation
Saturday was intended to prevent a veto by easing language about
the threat of force, diplomats said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the threat of
force remained. ``We and our NATO allies have the authority, the
will and the means to take action if necessary to ensure full
implementation,'' of previous U.N. resolutions demanding a
cease-fire, she said.
	   China said it abstained from the vote because the resolution
went beyond what was agreed to between Yugoslavia and Holbrooke.
Russia said details of the resolution _ particularly an expression
of deep concern about the recent closure of independent media in
Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution endorsing the accord.
	   Deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh said he regretted deeply
that the vote wasn't unanimous and that Russia had cited the free
media part of the resolution as a reason why it abstained.
	   ``I thought we would all agree on the council that a free media
is essential to the solution to the political problems in Kosovo
and the evolution toward democracy,'' Burleigh said.
	   He called the resolution the ``strongest possible message,'' the
council could send to Milosevic.
	   Saturday's revised draft deleted reference to international
organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' to ensure compliance
with the agreement and instead demanded Yugoslavia implement the
accord fully and promptly. The draft affirmed that action may be
needed to protect the monitors.
	   The draft also demanded that both sides in the Kosovo dispute
cooperate with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

Ottke takes IBF title with split decision over Brewer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Sven Ottke gained a split
decision over Charles Brewer Saturday to lift the American of his
IBF super middleweight title.
	   Brewer landed the harder blows, cutting Ottke's face in several
places, but Ottke was in no danger of going down and claimed the
final round against the fatigued American.
	   The bout was close from the start, but Brewer called it a
hometown decision after the judges ruled it 115-113, 116-112 for
Ottke and 117-111 for himself.
	   ``I'm mad. That was the worst decision I've ever seen,'' said
Brewer, 29. ``I wasn't just fighting Ottke, I was fighting all of
Germany.''
	   Brewer, now 32-6 with 22 knockouts, boasted more power and a
seven centimeter (three inch) height advantage against the German,
a 31-year-old that was twice European amateur champion.
	   But Ottke, now 13-0 as a pro, stuck to his game plan of dancing
away from Brewer, then catching him by surprise by striding in and
trading punches.
	   Ottke may have decided the fight when he came out swinging in
the final round, backing up the tired Brewer and catching him on
the ropes several times.
	   Ottke's chances of beating Brewer had been ridiculed by the
German press, impressed by the way the American knocked out
countryman Antoine Byrd in the third round of a title defense held
in Germany earlier this year.
	   But by the eighth round, when it became clear Ottke could trade
punches with Brewer, the German's corner was openly yelling to
their fighter that he could win the bout.
	   Brewer responded by charging out for the ninth, swinging wildly
and shoving the German around the ring. But he soon tired and
turned stationary in the ring.
	   Nonetheless Brewer wasn't impressed by the veteran German boxer.
	   ``He doesn't have the qualifications to be a champion,'' Brewer
said.

Sigel keeps lead with a 72

 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's round. &QL; 
 &UR; By GORDON SAKAMOTO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAANAPALI, Hawaii (AP) _ It was an up-and-down round, far from
the great one the day before, that allowed Jay Sigel to cling to a
one-stroke lead Saturday in the Kaanapali Seniors Classic.
	   Sigel opened the 54-hole event on Maui with a 61 _ the second
lowest U.S. Senior PGA Tour score ever _ but could only muster a
1-over-par 72 Saturday and was at 9-under 133.
	   That was good enough to give him a one-stroke lead over Terry
Dill and Larry Laoretti.
	   Another two strokes behind were nine players, including
three-time Kaanapali winner Bob Charles and 1994 champion Bob
Murphy. The 137 group included Jim Colbert, who won in 1991.
	   Dill, who shot a 66 Saturday, had to overcome his second
straight slow start to move into contention. On Friday, he played
the front nine two over and on Saturday he was one over. His
closing nines were 31-30.
	   Laoretti picked up two strokes on the front nine, but still had
to birdie 15 and 17 to move into contention.
	   Local pro Dick McClean, granted a sponsor's exemption by winning
the state stroke play championship, trailed the leader by one
stroke until a double-bogey on 16 and bogey on 18 dropped him back
into the pack at five under.
	   Charles made a major move with his 67, but didn't help himself
on the 18th hole of the 6,590-yard (5,931-meter) Kaanapali North
Course when he missed a short putt for a bogey.
	   Murphy, who had five birdies, saw his tee shot at the par 3-17th
land on the edge of a lake and he two-putted for his only bogey.
	   Bob Eastwood, who had an opening 64 and started three strokes
off the lead, quickly fell off the leaderboard on the front nine
when he failed to come up with a birdie and double-bogeyed No. 4
and bogeyed 9. He finished at 141.
	   Defending champion Hale Irwin shot a 70 and was 10 strokes
behind Sigel.

Thousands protest provision in peace accord with Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Over 5,000 people in a northern jungle city
took to the streets to protest a controversial provision of the
recently announced peace accord with Ecuador, police said.
	   Protesters in the jungle city of Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000
kilometers) northeast of Lima, set two government trucks on fire
Friday and smashed the window's of the hotel where two government
ministers were staying, police said.
	   Three people were injured when they were hit by a police vehicle
heading to the protests, police said.
	   Police broke up the crowd of more than 5,000 protesters with
tear gas.
	   The demonstrators were protesting the provision of the treaty
that gives Ecuador the jungle-cloaked hill, Tiwintza, as private
property, while allowing it to remain under Peru's sovereignty.
	   This one square kilometer (0.4 sq. miles) is a highly emotional
symbol to Ecuador, because its troops managed to defend it
successfully against repeated assaults by Peruvian troops during
the two countries' border war in 1995.
	   The pact, scheduled to be signed in Brasilia on Monday, defines
the 78 kilometers (49 miles) of previously unmarked border between
the two nations. The border strip has been the source of three wars
between the countries over the past 56 years.
	   The pact defines the border, except for Tiwintza, along the
lines Peru had indicated.

Piazza, Mets agree on $91 million, seven-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout with more info. &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Mets made sure Mike Piazza will
stay behind the plate at Shea Stadium. Now, they must figure out
what to do with Todd Hundley.
	   The Mets quickly took care of business with Piazza, reaching
agreement with the U.S. Major League Baseball All-Star catcher on a
dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract, The Associated Press learned
Saturday.
	   The deal, the richest player contract in the American sport's
history, is expected to be announced by the Mets Monday, according
to people in MLB.
	   Piazza, 30, hit .329 with 32 home runs and 111 RBIs for New
York, Los Angeles and Florida this season.
	   Jeered by Mets fans for much of the summer because of his lack
of clutch hitting, he became a fan favorite down the stretch when
he carried New York's bid for the National League wild-card berth.
By the end of the season, Mets fans were imploring team management
to shell out the big bucks needed to keep him.
	   Piazza and the Mets talked Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was
eligible to file for free agency starting Thursday _ the day after
the New York Yankees won the World Series _ but he did not. As it
turned out, details of the deal already had been finalized.
	   The contract would be a record for total dollars and average per
season, topping the dlrs 75 million, six-year contract that Boston
pitcher Pedro Martinez started this season.
	   Piazza's contract appears to signal the Mets will attempt to
trade Hundley, Piazza's backup, due to be paid dlrs 5.2 million
next season and dlrs 6 million in 2000 as part of a dlrs 21
million, four-year contract he agreed to in January 1997.
	   Hundley also was an All-Star catcher before undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery in September 1997. He struggled when
he came back this July, hitting only .161 with three homers, 12
RBIs and 55 strikeouts in 124 at-bats.
	   Piazza's contract includes a limited no-trade clause. He and the
Mets will agree at the start of each season on four teams to which
Piazza could be dealt.
	   Piazza finished a dlrs 15 million, two-year contract this
season. He was traded from Los Angeles to Florida in May after the
Dodgers failed to reach agreement with him on a multiyear deal, and
the Marlins traded him to the Mets a week later.
	   Piazza's deal figures to raise the prices of other free agents,
most notably the Yankees' Bernie Williams, who had been seeking a
seven-year deal worth at least dlrs 70 million.

category codes:
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council demanded Saturday
that Yugoslavia abide by an accord to end fighting in Kosovo and
said action may be needed to ensure the safety of international
monitors there. Russia and China abstained from voting on the
resolution, which they said did not authorize force to implement
the agreement. The United States said NATO still retained that
right and Britain pledged to use whatever force was necessary to
protect the unarmed monitors. The resolution, which diplomats said
was believed to be the first endorsing a NATO operation, was
adopted 13-0 after eight hours of rare Saturday consultations.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Militant Jewish settlers threatened Saturday to
keep the new Middle East peace accord from taking effect, vowing to
try to topple the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for signing it. Extremist right-wing settlers believe Israel's
agreement to cede 13 percent of West Bank land to the Palestinians
threatens their very existence. Initial settler response to
Friday's accord was muted by the Jewish Sabbath, which began at
sundown. But settlers said street protests were planned for Sunday.
Police said they beefed up security in preparation for angry
Israeli outbursts against the peace accord and for possible attacks
by anti-Israeli militants wishing to derail its implementation.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegations from North and South Korea, the United
States and China reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for
negotiating a permanent peace to one of the world's potential flash
points _ the divided Korean peninsula. The four-party conference
agreed to set up two subcommittees to ``discuss respectively the
establishment of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula and tension
reduction there.'' Negotiators said they would hold the next round
of talks in Geneva Jan. 18-22. A U.S. official said it was hoped
then to begin the ``substantive work.'' The protracted haggling
over procedural details highlighted just how long and fraught the
way ahead is likely to be. (KOREAN TALKS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives were headed for a clear
victory Saturday in elections for a clergy-based assembly that
oversees the country's supreme leader. The expected outcome would
be a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the Assembly of Experts
to curb the absolute powers of the supreme leader and to broaden
social and political freedoms for the average Iranian. The partial
results came as no surprise since most moderates had been dropped
from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews the eligibility of candidates and is dominated by
hard-liners. With 70 of the 86 seats on the Assembly of Experts

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The elections of governors in 13
Brazilian states Sunday, represent more than simply local votes,
they may also decide the fate of urgently needed national budget
cuts. Many voters are indifferent, suspecting that whatever choice
they make, it only spells hard times ahead. ``Whoever wins its
going to be difficult, because it doesn't look like there's going
to be much money to spend,'' said Paulo Benevides, a 22-year-old
college student. Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more
than a year ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil needs to slash government
spending and raise taxes quickly if it is to shore up it's flagging
economy and restore investor confidence. The difficulty of pushing
through such unpopular measures at election time has become
increasingly evident as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has
repeatedly delayed announcing his belt-tightening package.

	   MUENSTER, Germany (AP) _ Kings, queens and heads of state from
across Europe celebrated the 350th anniversary of the Treaty of
Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War and marked the
beginning of modern Europe.
	   Royalty including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Juan
Carlos of Spain walked up a red carpet Saturday to the Muenster
city hall, where the treaty was settled on Oct. 24, 1648. One by
one, representatives from 20 European nations signed a guest book
before eating lunch and hearing speeches.
	   Outside, the ``common folk'' paraded in the streets in
celebration.
	   Horse-drawn carriages rolled over cobblestone streets. Children
dressed as gnomes pulled a wagon carrying a garden gnome _ the kind
that decorate many German gardens. One parade group dressed as cows
in black-and-white spotted suits with pink rubber gloves as udders.
	   The Treaty of Westphalia ended an era of religious war between
Roman Catholics and Protestants, fought mostly in Germany. It also
recognized for the first time the sovereignty of the German states,
the Netherlands and the Swiss confederation.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP ) _ Oprah Winfrey, the most powerful person in show
business?
	   That's the opinion of Entertainment Weekly, which lists its
picks for the 101 most powerful people in the business in its Oct.
30 issue. Winfrey topped Steven Spielberg, Rupert Murdoch, George
Lucas and the dual listing of Time Warner honchos Gerald Levin and
Ted Turner in the top 5.
	   The magazine concedes Winfrey, 44, wasn't an obvious choice, but
pointed to both her daily talk show and her recent movie deal with
Disney to support the pick. Winfrey stars in the new film
``Beloved.''
	   Rounding out the top 10 were Tom Hanks, Michael Eisner, Viacom
CEO Sumner E. Redstone, ``Titanic'' director James Cameron, and the
triple-listing of Peter Chernin, Bill Mechanic and Tom Rothman,
executives at News Corp., Fox Films and 20th Century Fox,
respectively.

	   PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (AP) _ Two-time Academy Award winner
Anthony Quinn moved to the quiet shores of Narragansett Bay to
focus on the art he has created for decades when he wasn't acting:
painting and sculpture.
	   Quinn, 83, bought a dlrs 1.5 million estate on a secluded
peninsula in Bristol three years ago to escape the fast pace of
Hollywood and New York.
	   ``I'm delighted to be anonymous here,'' Quinn told The
Providence Journal. ``I'm a stranger here in Rhode Island.''
	   Even so, Quinn can't escape the spotlight. He has been named Man
of the Year by the Italo American Club of Rhode Island for his
achievements in the arts. He also plans to open an art gallery in
Providence.
	   His many film credits include ``Zorba the Greek,'' ``Requiem for
a Heavyweight,'' ``La Strada'' and ``The Shoes of the Fisherman.''
He won best-supporting actor Oscars for ``Viva Zapata'' and ``Lust
for Life.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ A new book accuses Princess Diana of making death
threats against Camilla Parker Bowles and suggests it was Diana,
not Prince Charles, who first committed adultery, a Sunday tabloid
reported.
	   Excerpts from ``Prince Charles, Villain or Victim,'' by
journalist Penny Junor, are being published in The Mail on Sunday
and described as a defense of Prince Charles by friends who spoke
to the author.
	   The newspaper's tabloid rivals on Sunday characterized the book
as a ``smearing'' of Diana and a ``vile attack'' that will backfire
on the prince.
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Saturday night that ``the
book was neither official nor authorized.
	    &UR; ___
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a sure sign of the times, Pizza Hut has decided
to close its two restaurants in Moscow, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The American chain was among the first fast-food businesses to
set up shop in the Soviet Union 10 years ago, and recent
commercials even used former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as
a pitchman.
	   But Pizza Hut recently moved out of its location on Moscow's
Kutuzovsky Prospekt, and hopes to sell its other outlet on trendy
Tverskaya Street by the end of the year, the Moscow Tribune
reported.
	   ``The expiration of our leases on the Kutuzovsky and Tverskaya
properties has coincided with deepening economic problems in
Russia,'' said Jadek Sas-Uhrnowski, Pizza Hut's franchise manager
for Eastern Europe. ``Business has been affected by the crisis and
this has determined our decision to close the Moscow outlets.''
	   He said Pizza Hut had no plans to close its restaurants in St.
Petersburg.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Police in Brazil have made the first
arrest linked to child pornography on the Internet, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Officers arrested on Friday supermarket manager Luis Marcelo dos
Santos, 30, in Itatiba, 55 miles (90 kms) northwest of Sao Paulo,
said the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Santos confessed to swapping pornographic pictures of children,
the newspaper reported. He faces a prison sentence of up to four
years.
	   Police, who collaborated with Interpol, seized computer discs
with images of children as young as five at his home, said the
daily.
	   Brazil launched a project to combat child Internet pornography
last year. Six more police probes are underway, Justice Minister
Renan Calheiros told the newspaper.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil lost dlrs 21 billion in
currency reserves in September, its biggest loss in a month since
1995, the O Globo newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The loss drained nearly 33 percent of Brazil's reserves, leaving
it with dlrs 45 billion at the end of the month, O Globo reported.
	   The size of the loss was blamed on nervous investors abandoning
the country's financial markets, which are seen as vulnerable to
the global economic crisis.
	   Since September the loss of reserves has stabilized, with an
increase in currency levels of dlrs 300 million estimated so far
this month, said O Globo.
	   Brazil's continues to negotiate a bailout package, reportedly
worth dlrs 30 billion, with the International Monetary Fund, and is
due to shortly reveal austerity measures.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Strong winds and rain continued to batter
eastern Mexico on Saturday, damaging roads, forcing families from
their homes and keeping ports closed.
	   Six ports in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz were closed for
the third consecutive day, the government news agency Notimex
reported. Sustained winds reached 40 mph (65 kph) in the port of
Coatzacoalcos, with gusts up to 55 mph (90 kph).
	   On Friday, officials in Veracruz reported the storms killed at
least four people, Notimex said. An 8-year-old boy and a man, 65,
drowned in floods and two people were killed when a tree fell on a
truck.
	   Civil defense officials in Veracruz said Saturday that at least
140 people spent the night in shelters because of strong waves and
the rise in the Calzadas river. In the neighboring state of
Tabasco, about 220 families were forced from their homes because of
heavy rains, the officials said.

	   CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) _ Opposition groups have struggled
to overcome what they claimed was overspending and gift-giving by
the ruling party in the campaign leading up to Sunday's election
for the governorship of the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
	   Tomas Yarrington, candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, held a substantial lead in pre-election polls
over his two rivals, Gustavo Cardenas of the conservative National
Action Party, and Joaquin Hernandez of the left-center Democratic
Revolution Party.
	   The ruling party, known as the PRI, has won four of the six
gubernatorial elections held so far this year. It has held the
presidency and most state houses without interruption for 69 years
and many view this year's elections as an indication of its chances
in the 2000 presidential race.
	   Debate in the Tamaulipas race _ in which 1.61 million registered
voters will also elect the state Congress and 43 mayors _ has
shifted in recent weeks from unemployment, poverty and
infrastructure problems to accusations that the PRI spent more than
the 23 million pesos (dlrs 2.3 million) campaign limit and
distributed food to potential voters.
	   Handing out food is not illegal, but opposition officials and
local residents suspect that government money was used.
	   ``The state government has given Yarrington a lot of help,''
said Felie Hernandez Gamboa, a local barber.
	   Yarrington, who has campaigned on a platform of economic
development and job creation, has denied the accusations of
overspending.
	   Both of the opposition candidates focused their campaigns on
fighting the corruption they say is rampant in state government.
	   All three candidates agree the state needs more foreign
investment, but also must improve conditions in the border cities
already crowded with foreign assembly plants known as maquiladoras.
	   Cardenas pledged to provide basic services to the sprawling
slums of border cities like Matamoros, where many maquiladora
workers live.
	   Hernandez has focused on pledges to improve law enforcement to
stop rising crime.

Basque voters seek peace after years of separatist strife

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has called on Basques to shun the pipe dreams of the
independence-seeking nationalists as they vote Sunday in the first
regional elections free of separatist violence.
	   With the northern region enjoying a five-week respite from
violence thanks to a cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA,
attention is focused on whether the truce will propel
pro-independence parties to electoral gains.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since 1968. It
declared an unconditional truce Sept. 18.
	   Aznar told supporters at a final election rally for his
center-right Popular Party that the Basque province should shy away
from fruitless dreams.
	   Aznar is hoping a strong turnout will benefit his party and
other non-nationalist groups like the opposition Socialist party.
That would give him more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts.
	   The 1.8 million voters in the three Basque provinces will have
11 hours to vote in the region's sixth local parliament election.
	   The mainstream Basque Nationalist Party is expected to remain
the largest party in the legislatures but to fall short of an
outright majority. It would then need to govern in a coalition with
allies.
	   A key question is how much support the ETA cease-fire will
attract for the pro-ETA Herri Batasuna party, which is fielding
candidates under a new coalition called Euskal Herritarrok.
	   Aznar says a peace process can begin in earnest only if ETA
publicly accepts the results of the elections and renounces
violence for good.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before, but they were of limited
duration. This one is open-ended, and many Spaniards see it as the
best opportunity in years to end the conflict.

German Social Democrats to approve partnership with Greens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous. Meeting starts at 1000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With the small ecology-minded Greens party
on board, Germany's Social Democrats are about to give their
approval to the first center-left alliance to govern the nation in
16 years.
	   A special convention of the Social Democrats is scheduled to
vote Sunday on the coalition pact the two parties sealed last week.
With approval considered certain, the decision is expected to clear
the final hurdle for Gerhard Schroeder's swearing-in as chancellor
Tuesday.
	   The Social Democrats won the Sept. 27 election, ending
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long tenure, but they need a junior
partner to secure a parliamentary majority.
	   Schroeder will address the party faithful Sunday, a day after
attending a summit of European Union leaders in Austria.
	   The Greens voted to join the German government for the first
time Saturday, backing the coalition deal nearly unanimously at
their convention, while venting misgivings about how party leaders
were handling the transition to power.
	   Founded 18 years ago by peace protesters, anti-nuclear activists
and feminists, the Greens faced the choice of sticking to their
outsider roots or embracing pragmatism.
	   Joschka Fischer, the designated foreign minister and chief
Greens pragmatist, made an impassioned plea shortly before the vote
for delegates to grow up and grasp the chance for a share of power
after winning 6.7 percent of the vote, down from 7.3 percent in the
last election in 1994.
	   ``We're all adults here,'' he said. ``We must prove that we can
govern this country responsibly.''
	   A last-minute threat to the coalition pact was averted when
delegates deferred a conflict over whether the three Green Cabinet
members should keep their seats in parliament.
	   Left-wingers called for banning the dual role, arguing it
undercut parliament's role as a watchdog over the government.
Fischer called it a mistake that would weaken the Greens in
government.
	   Female members protested that only one Cabinet member _
designated health minister Andrea Fischer _ will be a woman,
breaking party rules on the equal distribution of posts between men
and women.
	   The Greens have strongly influenced key projects that the future
government has pledged to undertake during its four-year term.
Those include raising energy taxes, closing nuclear power plants
and allowing more foreigners to become German citizens.

Vitali Klitschko stops Mario Schiesser to gain European heavyweight
</HEADLINE>
title &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Unbeaten Vitali Klitschko knocked down
Germany's Mario Schiesser twice in the second round Saturday to
claim the vacant European heavyweight title.
	   The towering Ukrainian, 2.02 meters (6-ft-8), floored Schiesser
with a left uppercut, then a right hook before the referee stopped
the fight with a minute left in the round.
	   Klitschko, the son of a general, has knocked out all 22 of his
opponents.
	   Schiesser, 36-4-1, beat the count after both knockdowns, but was
wobbling and defenseless after the second.
	   ``I was sorry the fight was so short, but at least the
spectators saw a beautiful end,'' said Klitschko, 27, who claimed
the title vacated by Croatia's Zelko Mavrovic.
	   In Klitschko's corner was his younger brother Wladimir, who is
the same size and the Olympic super heavyweight champion. The
21-year-old is unbeaten in 23 fights with 21 knockouts.
	   Klitschko is now the No. 1 mandatory challenger to WBO
heavyweight champion Herbie Hide, whom must fight him by May of
next year.
	   Shiesser tried to muscle his way inside against Klitschko in the
first round, but the tactic backfired when the Ukrainian caught him
with a right uppercut in the next, setting up the first knockdown.
	   On the undercard, Uzbekistan's Artur Grigorian stopped Italy's
Giorgio Campanella with a barrage of punches in the 10th round
Saturday to retain his WBO lightweight title.
	   Klitschko weighed 108.2 kilos (238 pounds), while Schiesser was
at 100.8 (221).

Ottke takes IBF title with split decision over Brewer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Corrects dateline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Sven Ottke gained a split
decision over Charles Brewer Saturday to lift the American of his
IBF super middleweight title.
	   Brewer landed the harder blows, cutting Ottke's face in several
places, but Ottke was in no danger of going down and claimed the
final round against the fatigued American.
	   The bout was close from the start, but Brewer called it a
hometown decision after the judges ruled it 115-113, 116-112 for
Ottke and 117-111 for himself.
	   ``I'm mad. That was the worst decision I've ever seen,'' said
Brewer, 29. ``I wasn't just fighting Ottke, I was fighting all of
Germany.''
	   Brewer, now 32-6 with 22 knockouts, boasted more power and a
seven centimeter (three inch) height advantage against the German,
a 31-year-old that was twice European amateur champion.
	   But Ottke, now 13-0 as a pro, stuck to his game plan of dancing
away from Brewer, then catching him by surprise by striding in and
trading punches.
	   Ottke may have decided the fight when he came out swinging in
the final round, backing up the tired Brewer and catching him on
the ropes several times.
	   Ottke's chances of beating Brewer had been ridiculed by the
German press, impressed by the way the American knocked out
countryman Antoine Byrd in the third round of a title defense held
in Germany earlier this year.
	   But by the eighth round, when it became clear Ottke could trade
punches with Brewer, the German's corner was openly yelling to
their fighter that he could win the bout.
	   Brewer responded by charging out for the ninth, swinging wildly
and shoving the German around the ring. But he soon tired and
turned stationary in the ring.
	   Nonetheless Brewer wasn't impressed by the veteran German boxer.
	   ``He doesn't have the qualifications to be a champion,'' Brewer
said.

Harkes has chance to end year on positive note
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN PETERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ If it's time for Major League
Soccer's championship game, John Harkes must be strapping on his
shin guards and lacing up his boots.
	   Harkes, disappointed and angered when coach Steve Sampson
abruptly dumped him from the U.S. national team before the World
Cup this summer, still has a chance to end his year on a positive
note.
	   The 31-year-old midfielder for D.C. United will be shooting for
his third MLS championship ring in as many years Sunday against
Chicago in the MLS Cup.
	   ``Anytime I can keep playing, it makes me happy,'' said Harkes,
who is wrapping up his finest MLS season, with six goals and six
assists despite often serving as a holding midfielder.
	   Returning to Southern California stirred pleasant memories for
Harkes, who trained with the U.S. team in Mission Viejo then helped
the Americans advance to the second round of the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``That was tremendous, not only the support we had from the fans
at the Rose Bowl, but the success we had,'' he said.
	   The 1994 team had considerably more success than this year's
U.S. squad, which was humbled in the first round in France. Sampson
resigned.
	   ``That was a very hard thing I went through,'' said Harkes, the
U.S. captain before Sampson cut him. ``What happened this summer
was unfortunate because the process was terrible and there were no
winners throughout the whole saga.
	   ``We had a lot of great players and we worked very hard for
years to get ready for '98 and we should have done a lot better
than we did.''
	   Harkes hopes to have a shot at playing for the United States
again in the 2002 World Cup. It probably won't hurt his chances if
United coach Bruce Arena, who also was Harkes' coach at the
University of Virginia, becomes the next national team coach. U.S.
federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher has Arena likely
will be offered the U.S. job after the MLS season.
	   Arena said Harkes contributes to D.C. United in a lot of
different ways.
	   ``He is versatile and has played in a number of positions for
us. He's a player who responds in big games,'' he said.
	   He added, ``Although he doesn't like to hear it, I remind him
that he's our oldest player. ... He's a loud leader, and sometimes
it's even good stuff.''
	   Although he would like to don a U.S. jersey again, Harkes won't
fret if that doesn't happen.
	   ``If not, I'm just happy to continue on as a professional
player. I enjoy it very much right now, which is easier, of course,
if you're on a winning team like ours,'' he said.
	   ``I want to keep playing, help the future of soccer in this
country. I want to see it grow though my lifetime and I'd like to
see my son play in this league some day.''
	   Harkes smiled and added, ``My son (Ian) is 3 1-2 and he may just
miss the 2010 World Cup. But I think it'll be time in 2014; that's
when we're going to win it.''

Will radical group try to torpedo Mideast accord, or bide its
</HEADLINE>
time? &QL; 

<TEXT>

 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They weren't at the bargaining table. They
didn't sign any accord. They want no part of the peace process.
	   But fighters from the radical Islamic group Hamas are casting
their customary long shadow as Israel and the Palestinians try to
turn their new land-for-peace agreement into reality.
	   In the wake of the accord signed Friday in Washington by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
one big unanswered question is what Hamas will do next.
	   A centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by Arafat's
Palestinian Authority to crack down on Islamic militants _
particularly Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in bloody
attacks over the past several years.
	   Even before the accord had been formally signed, Hamas was
feeling the heat. Palestinian security forces moved Friday to
muzzle the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, by
detaining Palestinian journalists who were waiting outside his Gaza
City home to interview him.
	   In the past several weeks, more than two dozen suspected Hamas
members have been rounded up, and a self-confessed operative for
the group was captured after he hurled hand grenades at a bus stop
in the desert town of Beersheba last week, injuring more than 60
Israelis.
	   But the scope of any new crackdown is still unclear. In the
past, Arafat's government has balked at dismantling Hamas'
infrastructure, including a network of schools, clinics and
financial institutions.
	   One reason for that reluctance is that many poor Palestinians,
particularly in Gaza, depend on Hamas social services, so shutting
them down would be an unpopular move.
	   Yassin said pressure from Palestinian security forces could
temporarily curb activities by Hamas' military wing, but not for
long.
	   ``It cannot erase Hamas,'' he said Friday. ``It is an illusion
to think the agreement will put an end to our military work.''
	   In years past, progress on the peace front has been sabotaged by
suicide bombings and other violence. Even Arafat didn't want to
hazard a guess as to whether that would happen again.
	   When asked Saturday at a stopover in Vienna, Austria, whether
Islamic militants would accept the accord, the Palestinian leader
replied simply: ``I don't know.''
	   At the signing of the accords, Clinton seemed resigned to the
likelihood of retaliatory attacks, but pleaded with the parties to
remain undeterred in the face of them.
	   ``No doubt as peace gains momentum, the forces of hate ... will
once again lash out,'' he said. ``Staying on the path of peace
under these circumstances will demand even greater leadership and
courage.''
	   Arafat, meanwhile, offered one of his strongest public pledges
yet to fight terror.
	   ``I will do everything I can so that no Israeli mother will be
worried if her son or daughter is late coming home,'' he said.
	   But Arafat also repeated his often-voiced warning that no
guarantee against attacks is possible, even with the best efforts.
``Nobody can secure 100 percent results,'' he said.
	   Even amid a crackdown, Hamas' political wing could probably
continue to operate openly. But its leaders have said the group
could go completely underground if necessary.
	   Hamas isn't the only radical group that could try to torpedo
peace efforts. About 2,000 supporters of the militant Islamic Jihad
group turned out Friday for a rally in the Gaza Strip, wearing
white shrouds to symbolize suicide bombings and burning U.S. and
Israeli flags.
	   Hamas has not carried out a suicide bombing in an Israeli city
in 13 months, instead staging smaller-scale attacks like tossing
grenades, stabbings and shootings.
	   Observers are divided about whether that has been a deliberate
policy shift or simply a reflection of weakness and disarray.
	   The group has sustained some major losses. Hamas' chief
bombmaker was slain in March under mysterious circumstances, and
two other top fugitives were gunned down in a bloody raid on their
West Bank hideout last month by Israeli troops.
	   ``I don't think Hamas has the strength to respond effectively
against the accords,'' said Abdel Sattar Qassem, a professor at
An-Najar University in the West Bank city of Nablus who tracks
radical movements.
	   But strict security policies mainly meant to contain Hamas could
backfire by fanning popular resentment against the Palestinian
Authority. Already, some were complaining about plans for the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency to play a stronger role in reining in
Islamic militants.
	   ``I can't believe they will allow the CIA to interfere in issues
that should only be in the hands of the Palestinian Authority,''
said Youssif Abedallah, a 40-year-old teacher. ``It will only bring
about internal fighting.''

NBA players, owners meet again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American National Basketball Association club
owners and players returned to the bargaining table Saturday, but
made no progress toward ending the league's lockout.
	   The three-hour meeting in New York between NBA commissioner
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter was the first
negotiations since Oct. 13.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik, league general counsel Joe
Litvin, vice president of basketball operations Steve Mills, union
president Patrick Ewing and union attorney Jeffrey Kessler also
attended the meeting.
	   Granik and Hunter plan to talk again Monday to determine when
the next negotiations will take place. The league's Board of
Governors will meet Tuesday and Wednesday and the union is trying
to get all 400 players to be in New York for the meeting.
	   The NBA already has canceled the first two weeks of the season,
and the rest of the November schedule is expected to be scrapped
next week.
	   About 240 of the players met in Las Vegas this past week and
voted unanimously to never accept a hard salary cap, Hunter said.
	   The owners, demanding cost certainty, want an absolute ceiling
on player salaries in the next collective bargaining agreement.
They had the right to seek a new labor agreement if the percentage
of revenues devoted to salaries exceeded 51.8 percent, and it
reached 57 percent in the 1997-98 season.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   In their most recent proposal, owners asked that the cap be 52
percent of league revenues in the 2000-01 season, 50 percent in
2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The union has offered two methods to tighten the salary cap if
the percentage rises to 63 percent, as well as a ``tax'' _ or a
penalty each team would pay if it goes over the cap _ on the
salaries of the highest-paid players.
	   The lockout, which began July 1, has cost the players about dlrs
100 million in lost salaries.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An anti-government protest became
a riot when police fired pepper spray at thousands of demonstrators
and bombarded a mosque with tear gas.
	   By midnight Saturday, a standoff between the two sides had drawn
about 1,000 protesters and hundreds of riot police, whose
helicopters circled above. Dozens of people were arrested and
injured in Malaysia's capital.
	   Demonstrators have carried out a series of protests since ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month.
Protesters demand political reforms, the end of Prime Minister
Mohamad Mahathir's 17-year rule and Anwar's release.
	   Police have declared all demonstrations in support of Anwar
illegal. The former heir apparent to Mahathir has pleaded innocent
to charges of graft and sexual misconduct and is awaiting trial.
	   The government has threatened to arrest demonstrators under the
country's dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite
detainment without trial.
	   At the afternoon demonstration on Saturday, protesters taunted
police in a downtown shopping district. Officers warned women and
children to get off the streets, which were packed with weekend
shoppers, then huge police trucks lumbered into the area and fired
blue foam pepper spray that scattered thousands of people, crying
and coughing from the stinging chemical.
	   Police in civilian clothes, some wearing ski masks, chased
people through department stores and down side streets, grabbing
them and tossing them into waiting vans. Some were slapped, kicked
and wrestled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store
after she shouted that they were cruel. A policewoman carried the
woman's eggs and vegetables while police pulled her into the
street. Her husband called out, ``Are you trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect curtain fabric,'' said
one woman who was afraid to give her name, her young daughter
clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes.
	   Police followed protesters to a mosque where they had gathered
for evening prayers and to regroup. Police lobbed tear gas into the
building and protesters responded by chasing officers and pelting
them with stones.
	   An Anwar supporter who asked not to be identified said the
afternoon protest turned ugly when police began arresting people at
random.
	   ``It's sheer frustration,'' he said.
	   Some 400 riot police surrounded the capital's Freedom Square to
ward off any gathering there.
	   Anwar has been denied bail and will begin trial on Nov. 2 on 10
counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has condemned
the charges as false and politically motivated.

Reports Britain will lift arms embargo on Argentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government, responding to reports that it
would lift its arms embargo against Argentina, said Saturday that
it keeps its export controls ``under review.''
	   ``The embargo on the sale and export of arms to Argentina
remains in place,'' a Foreign Office spokeswoman said on customary
condition of anonymity. ``Naturally we keep our export controls
under review.''
	   Days before the visit of Argentina's Carlos Menem to Britain,
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported on its front page that
Britain is ready to lift the 16-year-old arms embargo it imposed on
Argentina after the Falklands War.
	   Britain also would participate in a joint exercise with the
Argentine navy next year, the newspaper reported.
	   It quoted unidentified senior Foreign Office and Defense
Ministry figures as saying the embargo would soon be replaced by
normal arms export controls. It said any equipment that might have
a direct potential use against the Falklands would still be refused
an export license.
	   Argentina still claims sovereignty over the British South
Atlantic colony, which the Argentines call the Malvinas. But Menem,
the first Argentine president to visit since the two countries went
to war in 1982, has said he intends to recover them by diplomatic
means.
	   Argentina, which claims the islands as an inheritance from the
Spanish crown, was defeated in the 74-day war that cost the lives
of nearly 1,000 servicemen, most of them Argentine.
	   No announcement on the arms embargo would be made until after
Menem's five-day visit, which starts Wednesday, the newspaper said.
The Observer newspaper carried a similar article on Sunday.

Typhoon Babs heads closer to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government opened storm shelters Sunday as
Typhoon Babs churned closer to Hong Kong after killing more than
130 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands
homeless.
	   The Hong Kong Observatory said that at 8 a.m. (0000 GMT), the
typhoon was centered 450 kilometers (279 miles) south-southeast of
the territory. Packing winds of 130 kilometers per hour (81 miles
per hour), Babs was moving northwest at about six kilometers (3.72
miles) per hour toward the south China coast.
	   The observatory hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a warning to
residents to take precautions as winds were expected to intensify
later in the day.
	   The government said it has opened up several shelters for those
seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if
needed.
	   Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not
to enter the water because of rough seas.
	   Fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada on Saturday
declared Catanduanes and three other provinces and a city in the
worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon island under a state of
calamity.
	   Babs was the second typhoon to hit the the Philippines in a
week. Earlier, Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Of the 132 deaths reported in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
struck on Thursday.
	   The worst landslides were in San Miguel, a coconut and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   Thirty other people died in landslides in Camarines Sur province
and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon
province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region along the
Philippines' eastern coast.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, Philippine disaster relief officials said.

	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union's leaders say
emphasis should be placed on sustaining Europe's growth through the
current world economic crisis as they map out a new path for the
15-nation bloc.
	   ``Reducing unemployment is the most important single question
for the people of Europe,'' Germany's Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder said Saturday in his EU summit debut. The 15 nations in
the European Union have 18 million unemployed workers.
	   The EU's 11 left or center-left leaders were quick to emphasize
the union's change of direction at a two-day summit in this
lakeside Austrian resort, with members urging public works projects
to create jobs and distancing themselves from past rightist policy.
	   Rudolf Scharping, Germany's defense minister-designate who
chaired a meeting of leftist leaders before the summit began
Saturday, said socialists throughout Europe were ``taking a new
responsibility.''
	   ``We are starting a new era within the European Union,'' he
said.
	   Leaders said the time had come to look beyond the Jan. 1 launch
of the euro, the EU's common currency, which German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl _ who lost power to a leftist in elections last month _
had made the EU's top priority in recent years.
	   To deal with the immediate threat posed by the global financial
turmoil, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he may call a
meeting of leaders of the world's seven most industrialized
nations.
	   To defend Europe's economy against the economic crises in Asia
and Russia, Italy's new Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a former
communist, said the leaders agreed there should be a cut in
interest rates _ something key central banks have been reluctant to
do.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to
raise loans to finance public works projects such as
transcontinental road and rail links. When French officials
proposed the idea a few years ago, Kohl shot it down.
	   Blair reversed his Conservative predecessors by calling for the
EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle regional
conflicts without having to rely on U.S. support.
	   He outlined plans for European military within NATO for
peacekeeping or combat missions. Scharping, who takes over as
German defense minister Tuesday, said he'd already discussed
Blair's ideas with the British and French defense ministers.
	   ``My sense is ... it's something the Americans will welcome
because they've been concerned about greater burden-sharing,'' he
told a news conference.
	   Leaders agreed the EU should be strengthened so the bloc, which
represents nearly 400 million people and one-third of the world's
economy, has a greater voice in international affairs.

Election of governors could influence Brazilian president's
</HEADLINE>
austerity plan &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With the success of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical
point, voters on Sunday were to select governors in 12 states and
the Federal District of Brasilia.
	   But many voters are indifferent, suspecting that whatever choice
they make, it only spells hard times ahead.
	   Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year
ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil needs to slash government spending
and raise taxes quickly if it is going to shore up it's flagging
economy and restore investor confidence.
	   The difficulty, however, of pushing through such unpopular
measures at election time has become increasingly evident as
Cardoso repeatedly put off announcing his belt-tightening package.
	   First, the measures were expected following the Oct. 4
first-round elections, in which Cardoso was re-elected and 14 state
governors were chosen.
	   Immediately following the election, Cardoso said the package
could be announced by Oct. 20. But with 13 government-allied
candidates facing tough run-offs, he postponed it until after the
Oct. 25 second-round elections.
	   David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the
University of Brasilia said it was a smart move on the president's
part.
	   ``Governors have far more power and a direct hold on their
states than the president has over the whole country,'' said
Fleischer. ``Their influence and political weight should not be
underestimated.''
	   Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is that
it is their overspending that accounts for a big chunk of the
government's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the
situation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso allies in Brazil's
four most developed states _ Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse with
more than 34 million inhabitants, incumbent governor and Cardoso
ally Mario Covas is running neck and neck with Paulo Maluf, a
populist candidate with a taste for extravagant public works
projects.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, polls put opposition candidate Anthony
Garotinho well ahead of Cardoso ally Cesar Maia.
	   ``Whoever wins, it's going to be difficult because it doesn't
look like there's going to be much money to spend,'' said Paulo
Benevides, a 22-year-old college student. He said he planned to
vote for Maia, Rio's mayor.

Aboriginal flag might fly at the Sydney Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander flag might be flown at the Sydney 2000 Olympics,
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said Sunday.
	   ``I haven't thought about that specifically but obviously there
are going to be issues that will be raised and that's another idea
I guess that can go on the table that people can speak about,''
Ruddock told Australian television.
	   The red, yelllow and black flag was recognized as being
Australian, he said.
	   World 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman received official
criticism but widespread public support at the 1994 Commonwealth
Games when she paraded with both the Australian and Aboriginal
flags after winning the 200- and 400-meter events.
	   Ruddock, who is also the Minister for Reconcliation with
Australia's Aborigines, said, ``obviously if people believe that
that will be helpful, I am sure it's a matter that can be
progressed.''
	   Meanwhile, Ruddock said he did not expect Australia would have
any problem with making sure that all Olympics visitors go home
after the Games.
	   Atlanta did not have a problem with asylum seekers after the
1996 Olympics, he said.
	   ``But we are very conscious in terms of our border control
arrangements, we need to be effective in ensuring we manage the
entry of people to and from Australia,'' Ruddock said..
	   ``We have seen a situation in recent years where the numbers of
people who are unlawfully in Australia and remain in Australia
after their visa might have expired has been largely consistent.''

Volcano erupts in northern Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A volcano erupted on Japan's northern island of
Hokkaido Sunday morning, sending a column of smoke into the sky,
the Japan Meteorological Agency said. No injuries or damage were
reported.
	   The 1,133-meter (3,739-foot) high Mt. Komagatake erupted at 9:12
a.m. (0012 GMT), the agency said. The mountain is near the city of
Hokkodate, 681 kilometers (426 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   White smoke was seen spewing from the top of the mountain
shortly after the eruption.
	   The mountain last erupted in 1942.

Out on a long, precarious limb, the early Oscar pick is ...

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ First, the disclaimers: True, it's only
October. True, the prestigious critic organizations and industry
wags have yet to add their influential voices. True, some of the
holiday movies have yet to hit the lab.
	   But if the studios can get into the Academy Award spirit
already, why can't we?
	   Here, then, are the early, early Oscar picks _ shamelessly
premature and admittedly subjective, but in their own way as pure
as can be, untainted by the studio hype machines, which are just
now firing up.
	   Going out on a long and precarious limb, the film to beat so far
is ``Pleasantville,'' out this weekend and a warmhearted antidote
to another contender _ the brutal ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   Written and directed by Gary Ross, who wrote the screenplays for
``Big'' and ``Dave,'' ``Pleasantville'' seems to have the best
shots at picture, director and lead actress for Joan Allen.
	   The strongest category for ``Saving Private Ryan'' is supporting
actor, with Tom Sizemore as the front-runner, while Ian McKellen is
the early pick for lead actor for either ``Apt Pupil'' or ``Gods
and Monsters.'' Strong buzz also surrounds Kimberly Elise, who
portrays Oprah Winfrey's daughter in ``Beloved,'' for supporting
actress.
	   Of course, all this is subject to change as the final wave of
films comes out, including ``The Thin Red Line,'' ``A Civil
Action,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``Meet Joe Black.'' All are highly
anticipated; all are big question marks.
	   There's also the impact of the studio spin operations. Art house
studios are already advertising Academy Award-consideration
screenings. The full-throttle promotions are just weeks away.
Nominations will be announced Feb. 9 and the awards presented March
21.
	   That said, here are the early picks:
	    &UR; BEST PICTURE &QC; 
	   It may come down to guts or goodness, the gritty ``Saving
Private Ryan'' or the life-affirming ``Pleasantville.''
	   Academy voters do love their epics _ ``Titanic,'' ``Dances With
Wolves,'' ``Braveheart,'' ``The English Patient,'' among them _ and
Steven Spielberg's World War II drama has the requisite sweep. The
question is whether voters will be turned off by the gore and the
fact that Spielberg already won for ``Schindler's List.''
	   If so, that tips the balance to the inventive, optimistic
``Pleasantville,'' the story of a black-and-white 1950s-era TV town
that turns to color when a pair of worldly teens from the 1990s
arrive. Its only shortcoming is that it may be too, well, pleasant,
pulling story punches.
	   The wild card is Italy's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' a favorite on
the festival circuit, but Miramax Films may decide to enter it in
the foreign language category.
	   Farther behind: ``The Truman Show,'' ``Beloved,'' ``Elizabeth''
and ``One True Thing.''
	   Question Marks: ``A Civil Action,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and
``Stepmom.''
	   Possible surprise: the delightful comedy ``Waking Ned Devine,''
which could get ``The Full Monty'' nod.
	   Early pick: ``Pleasantville,'' color it a winner.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEST ACTOR &QC; 
	   British actor McKellen is drawing raves as the former Nazi in
``Apt Pupil'' and as the dying movie director in ``Gods and
Monsters.'' But he could cancel himself out and Tom Hanks will
march off with another statue, this time for ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and his portrayal of the frightened leader of a squad that
has survived D-Day and has been given the unwanted mission of
tracking down a missing soldier to tell him he's going home.
	   Close behind: Edward Norton for ``American History X,'' Geoffrey
Rush for ``Elizabeth'' and Ian Bannen and David Kelly from ``Waking
Ned Devine.''
	   Question marks: Nick Nolte for ``Affliction'' and John Travolta
for ``A Civil Action.''
	   Big question mark: Jim Carrey for ``The Truman Show.''
	   Possible surprises: Dylan Baker for ``Happiness'' and Saul
Williams for ``Slam.''
	   Early pick: McKellen, for giving evil a good name.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEST ACTRESS &QC; 
	   Allen, the TV mom in ``Pleasantville'' who experiences things
June Cleaver could never even imagine, appears primed to receive
the Oscar she was denied as a supporting actress for ``Nixon'' and
``The Crucible.''
	   But perennial Oscar favorite Meryl Streep can't be ruled out for
her portrayal of a dying mother in ``One True Thing'' or ``Dancing
at Lughnasa.'' Nor can her ``One True Thing'' co-star, Renee
Zellweger, unless Universal Pictures enters one of them in the
supporting category. Indeed, Allen also could be considered a
supporting actress.
	   Close behind: Cate Blanchett for ``Elizabeth'' and Ally Sheedy
for ``High Art.''
	   Question mark: Gwyneth Paltrow in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
	   Possible surprises: Jane Horrocks of ``Little Voice'' and
Christina Ricci for ``The Opposite of Sex.''
	   Early pick: Allen. It is time.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SUPPORTING ACTOR &QC; 
	   Pick any soldier from ``Saving Private Ryan'' and you have the
front-runner for supporting actor, though two stand out: Sizemore
as the levelheaded sergeant and Jeremy Davies as his cowardly
charge.
	   Close behind: Danny Glover in ``Beloved,'' William H. Macy in
``Pleasantville,'' Ed Harris in ``The Truman Show'' and Donald

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Over 5,000 people in a northern jungle city
took to the streets to protest a controversial provision of the
recently announced peace accord with Ecuador, police said.
	   Protesters in the jungle city of Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000
kilometers) northeast of Lima, set two government trucks on fire
Saturday and smashed the window's of the hotel where two government
ministers were staying, police said.
	   Three people were injured when they were hit by a police vehicle
heading to the protests, police said.
	   Police broke up the crowd of more than 5,000 protesters with
tear gas.
	   The demonstrators were protesting the provision of the treaty
that gives Ecuador the jungle-cloaked hill, Tiwintza, as private
property, while allowing it to remain under Peru's sovereignty.
	   This one square kilometer (0.4 sq. miles) is a highly emotional
symbol to Ecuador, because its troops managed to defend it
successfully against repeated assaults by Peruvian troops during
the two countries' border war in 1995.
	   The pact, scheduled to be signed in Brasilia on Monday, defines
the 78 kilometers (49 miles) of previously unmarked border between
the two nations. The border strip has been the source of three wars
between the countries over the past 56 years.
	   The pact defines the border, except for Tiwintza, along the
lines Peru had indicated.

Moscow's cultural life feeling economic squeeze

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As the lights go up, technicians are still
adjusting the pulleys that carry the curtains and backdrops up and
down. They test the voyage of a small crescent moon across the
stage, and make way for the young couple that opens Anton Chekhov's
play, ``The Seagull.''
	   Director Iosif Raikhelgauz paces below, stopping short to kick
over a basket of props left lying in the wrong place and badger the
troupe about showing up late.
	   ``From now on, we concentrate on the production,'' he implores,
glaring at the actors who are still ambling into the theater. ``You
can do your talking some other time. You can make the rounds of the
shops some other time, too.''
	   It's the final stretch of rehearsals for next month's premiere
at the School of Contemporary Drama, one of dozens of theaters
partially funded by the Moscow city government.
	   Despite Russia's economic crisis, the theater season is off to a
roaring start, with two high-profile productions of Hamlet and a
series of well-received premieres playing to packed houses.
	   Music-lovers are likewise filling concert halls, and spectators
are lining up for museum and gallery openings. Ticket sales haven't
declined noticeably, probably because _ unlike most everything else
in Russia _ ticket prices haven't gone up and still cost only a few
rubles (a dollar or two).
	   Yet the country's grinding economic problems have led to a
reduction in corporate sponsorship that had been replacing
dwindling state funding in recent years.
	   The sponsorship has helped Moscow maintain its world-class
cultural scene in the post-Soviet era, but even the most renowned
institutions in Russia's richest city are now facing cutbacks.
	   The Tretyakov state art gallery, home to some of Russia's
richest treasures, has been receiving only enough funding from the
Cultural Ministry over the last year to cover salaries. It owes
12.9 million rubles (dlrs 860,000) for utilities, cleaning and
security services. Only the intervention of Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has
kept security guards on the job despite their lack of pay.
	   The gallery has built up an impressive army of international
corporations and Russian firms to support it. But with the economic
crisis, the support is evaporating, and the gallery already has had
to postpone the opening of a new children's wing and forgo
catalogues for two autumn exhibits.
	   ``If suddenly the sponsorship stops, and I mean Russian
sponsors, the museum simply won't survive,'' said Valentin
Rodionov, the Tretyakov's director. ``Because of the economic
slide, I don't expect there will be much economic activity here.
And that worries us a lot.''
	   The Russian National Orchestra, under the baton of Mikhail
Pletnev, is another cultural institution that has thrived on
corporate patronage _ and been completely independent of state and
city funding. Its backers include an art foundation in the United
States and corporate sponsors such as Chevron, Amoco and United
Technologies.
	   Even so, it's been forced to cancel two concerts this fall for
lack of funding.
	   ``Our Russian sponsors are still there, but how much we'll be
able to work with them in the future, I just don't know,'' said
Marina Makelyan, the spokeswoman for the orchestra.
	   Artists and cultural managers are also worried they'll lose the
following they've built up over the years.
	   ``Our audiences are middle-class, youth, intellectuals. We have
a duty to support them by keeping up our premieres, which is hard
without government support,'' said Marina Druzhinina, the director
of the School of Contemporary Drama.
	   Last year, the city budget provided for new productions and
equipment, and capital repairs for the seafoam-green, 19th-century
building where the theater is ensconced.
	   Now, the theater's cut of the city budget is just enough to
cover salaries and utility payments _ and they're already a month
late.
	   ``We're living on crumbs. If we want to be able to afford more
than a loaf of bread, we're going to have to earn it ourselves,''
Druzhinina says. ``That means working harder and finding
sponsors.''
	   This season, Druzhinina is launching a search for a new kind of
funder: one who will advance the theater enough money to stage a
new production, and recoup the investment a year after the show
closes.
	   First, though, she has to get the ensemble to agree to make
sacrifices beyond accepting a shrinking real income. Already, most
of the actors and other theater workers have jobs on the side.
	   ``They'll be required to play as many performances as possible
to return the money, and go on tour so that we can earn more,
because we don't have a big theater here,'' she said. ``It's a huge
risk; as a government-funded theater, we've never had to do such
things before.''

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Protesters set fire to government trucks and
offices during a demonstration in northern Peru against the
nation's new peace accord with Ecuador. Three people died in the
violence.
	   All three were trampled to death Saturday when police dispersed
the crowd of 5,000 with tear gas bombs, according to a hospital in
the jungle city of Iquitos, 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) northeast
of Lima.
	   Seven injuries also were reported, including three people
authorities said were hurt when hit by a police vehicle heading to
the demonstration.
	   Protesters ransacked then set fire to three government offices
and burned at least two government trucks. They also smashed the
windows of a hotel where two government ministers were staying
before setting fire to the hotel, too, police said.
	   The demonstrators were angry about a provision in a new pact
with Ecuador that grants the neighboring nation a hill within
Peru's territory. Ecuadorean troops had defended the area, which is
less than 1square kilometer (about half a square mile), against
repeated assaults by Peruvian troops during a 1995 border war.
	   The pact, which will be signed in Brazil on Monday, defines the
48 miles (78 kilometers) of previously unmarked border between the
two nations.
	   The border dispute dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a
war along the Pacific coast at a time when their frontier wasn't
fully defined. In 1942, the two sides defined 1,088 miles (1,750
kilometers) of border, leaving the 48-mile (78-kilometer) stretch
questionable. Peru and Ecuador fought twice more over that stretch
of jungle, in 1981 and 1995.

New Mexico celebrates 100 years as movie location
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By RICHARD BENKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ It's been Somalia, Abyssinia,
Kenya, Uganda. It's been Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Texas,
Oklahoma _ even another planet.
	   And, sometimes, New Mexico has just been its enchanting self.
	   But it has been up there bigger than life on the silver screen
for 100 years.
	   The first time a movie was made here, by Edison Co. in 1898, New
Mexico wasn't even a state. The movie didn't last long _ a mere 55
seconds. Called ``Indian Day School,'' it was filmed at Isleta
Pueblo south of Albuquerque, and showed children filing out of a
one-room schoolhouse.
	   More than 300 movies later, Mary Pickford, Mabel Normand, Tom
Mix, Johnny Mack Brown, John Wayne, Fred MacMurray, Henry Fonda,
Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas, Spencer Tracy,
Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman,
Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Charlton Heston, Ronald Reagan,
Kevin Costner and scores of others have toed their marks here.
	   The New Mexico Film Commission, working with New Mexico
Magazine, is celebrating this centennial year with a new book,
``100 Years of Filmmaking in New Mexico.'' It is a collection of
articles and photographs on the state's movie history, with a
sampler of locations, interviews with directors and a chronology of
all 308 films confirmed to have been at least partly shot under New
Mexico skies.
	   Pickford and Normand were part of a Biograph company that shot
two films here in one week during 1912 _ Pickford in a Romeo and
Juliet-style romance called ``A Pueblo Legend'' and Normand in a
Mack Sennett comedy, ``The Tourists.''
	   The state was Kenya and Uganda in ``King Solomon's Mines,'' with
Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. The mines were really Carlsbad
Caverns.
	   It was two other African countries, Somalia and Abyssinia, in
the World War II drama ``Sundown.'' It was Montana in ``Lonesome
Dove'' and ``The Missouri Breaks,'' and it was Earth 2, the
alternative planet, in the television series of that name.
	   Even ``Oklahoma!'' wasn't Oklahoma. That's right: New Mexico.
	   It has been in big-name movies and little-known movies, crass
exploitation vehicles, science-fiction stinkers, social-conscience
docudramas and lots of Westerns.
	   ``I found it an astounding place to work, where every day over
the course of the day, the sky was putting on a show,'' said
Lawrence Kasdan, who directed ``Silverado'' near the capital, Santa
Fe. ``And sometimes it wasn't the show you needed for your movie,
but it was always a great show.
	   ``To me it was like a kaleidoscope, New Mexico, working out in
that weather and that terrain, so every day was a surprise and a
delight.''
	   Gov. Gary Johnson observed the centennial at a news conference
in Santa Fe, and said the economic gain from film projects in the
state over the past decade has amounted to almost dlrs 1 billion.
	   The newest movie to be filmed in New Mexico is ``The Hi Lo
Country,'' starring Woody Harrelson, based on Max Evans' novel of
returning World War II veterans skirt-chasing the volcano country
east of Raton. The Stephen Frears film will be released by Gramercy
Pictures in December.
	   And because Evans has been such an integral part of state film
history, his colorful 30-page remembrance, ``Hollywood on the Rio
Grande,'' is the heart of the book, telling how then-Gov. David
Cargo organized the state Film Office in 1969 and led a delegation
to Beverly Hills, California, to pitch some Hollywood executives.
	   ``No one believed we could do it, even though there had been
many, many films here scattered throughout the years. But being so
ignorant of what to do, we just went ahead and did it,'' Evans said
in an interview. ``A bunch of amateurs turned the film commission
into an entity that created world history here in New Mexico.''
	   Evans said the state realized Westerns were ebbing and sought to
broaden the state's location appeal beyond the Western.
	   ``We told them they could make any film here they could make
anywhere in America, that the only thing we didn't have here was an
ocean and we could fake that with Elephant Butte Lake,'' he said,
referring to a large reservoir along the Rio Grande in southern New
Mexico.
	   ``The impact was immediate _ everything picked up.
Proportionally, we got more non-Westerns as well.''
	   Only four movies were made in New Mexico in 1969. But 11 were
made in 1970 _ seven of them non-Westerns. In 1971, the trend
continued: Thirteen films were made here, 10 of which were not
Westerns.
	   Westerns have been around since 1903 when Edwin S. Porter's
``The Great Train Robbery'' came out. Through good times and bad,
Westerns were staple cinema fare until the 1970s, when a new wave
of directors portrayed the West as venal and brutal. The
spectacular failures of such films as ``Missouri Breaks'' and
especially ``Heaven's Gate'' soured studios on making Westerns. A
decade later saw an attempt at reviving the genre, as movies like
``Pale Rider'' and ``Silverado'' hit the screen.
	   ``The trouble is,'' said Evans, ``you run out of people who know
how to make Westerns.''
	   The wheel had to be somewhat reinvented for ``The Hi Lo
Country.''
	   ``That's a post-World War II Western based on reality,'' Evans
said. ``I think there'll always be a place for the mythological
Western. ``I think in 20 or 30 years they'll come back and be like
`Robin Hood' and `Camelot' and that sort of legend.''
	   Many states now have huge film office budgets.
	   ``We can't compete on that level,'' Evans said, but the state
can still hang onto its share of films because of the climate, open
space and light New Mexico affords throughout the year.
	   The book is dedicated to Greer Garson, who never made a movie
here but did make a life _ and left a movie studio as well.
	   ``Every state these days has a movie studio somewhere within its
borders,'' Casey St. Charnez writes in the dedication, ``but only
New Mexico has its own guardian angel over the Garson
Communications Center, an angel who lived to see her biggest and
her fondest dream come true.''

Castro tells American editors he's still not ready for U.S.
</HEADLINE>
bureaus &QL; 
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro told top editors of
American newspapers that he still distrusts U.S. journalists and is
not ready to let them have permanent bureaus on the island.
	   ``Once they are established it is hard to remove them,'' Castro
told the top leadership of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors Saturday during a far-ranging meeting that lasted more than
six hours.
	   Granting permission for a bureau ``is a matter of confidence to
be built step by step,'' the editors quoted him as saying. ``We
have had a lot of experience with (American) journalists who are
biased.''
	   Nevertheless, Edward L. Seaton, ASNE president and editor of The
Manhattan (Kansas) Mercury, said he thought Castro listened to the
group's arguments for letting American journalists open offices in
the country. Currently, Cuba grants U.S. reporters work visas for a
week or two.
	   ``I think we got across quite well our message: that they need
to have print journalists from the United States in Cuba,'' said
Seaton. The ASNE has 870 members from newspapers across the United
States.
	   Currently, the only U.S. news organization that has Cuban
government approval to operate a permanent office in the country is
Cable News Network. CNN opened its Havana bureau, headed by
correspondent Lucia Newman, in March 1997.
	   The network is the first American news organization to operate a
bureau in the country since The Associated Press was expelled in
1969.
	   The 32-member ASNE delegation, made up of the board of directors
and other top leaders, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday and was
returning to the United States early Sunday.
	   During their four-day visit, the editors met with top government
leaders, including Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Vice President
Carlos Lage and Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's parliament.
	   They also toured Havana and Matanzas province to the east, and
met with church leaders as well as opposition leaders.
	   Dressed in his traditional olive green fatigues, Castro also
spent about an hour talking specifically with two executives from
the Miami Herald: Douglas C. Clifton, executive editor and senior
vice president, and David Lawrence Jr., chairman of the Miami
Herald Publishing Co.
	   Castro criticized the newspaper's story about him based on the
statements of a Cuban woman living in Costa Rica who claimed that
he had been near death last year. The woman later turned out to be
a fraud.
	   But he praised the newspaper's coverage of a series of bombings
at Havana hotels and other tourist spots last year, especially its
investigative work in identifying a Salvadoran man who later was
arrested in the attacks.
	   In other comments, he criticized major league baseball
recruiters for ``stealing'' some of Cuba's best players and
maintained that Cuba had a lot better players than Orlando and
Livian Hernandez, half-brothers who defected and went on to play in
the U.S. championship, the World Series. Orlando Hernandez plays
for the New York Yankees and Livian Hernandez for the Florida
Marlins.
	   As for whether he ever would retire, he told the editors: ``I
have a moral obligation'' to continue as Cuba's leader, especially
during the country's current economic crisis.
	   The Castro government invited the ASNE to visit Cuba after top
leaders expressed interest in getting to know the country better.
The board also has visited Mexico, Russia, China and South Africa.
	   Castro's relationship with the ASNE dates back to shortly after
he took power in 1959. That year, the society invited him to speak
at a convention it held in Washington.

Three dead in British storms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lashing rains and winds gusting to 80 mph (130
kph) have swept wide areas of Britain for two days, leaving at
least three people dead.
	   Police and firefighters searching for a 19-year-old canoeist
recovered a body from the river Dart near Holne Bridge on the edge
of Dartmoor in southern England. Another canoeist, a 47-year-old
man, was pulled from the river Barle at Dulverton, on Exmoor,
southwest England. Neither was immediately identified.
	   A man was seen swept away in a fast-flowing stream in the
Treorchy area of the Rhondda Valley, 20 miles (30 km) west of
Cardiff, on Thursday night. After a police search, his body was
discovered Friday.
	   Farmer William Mason, 62, was missing after he went out in the
storm to save his livestock from the flood-swollen River Wye near
his home at Clifford, 50 miles (80 km) north of Cardiff.
	   Many roads in Wales, and central and southwest England were
closed because of flooding or fallen trees.

Britain tells Chile it cannot intervene in Pinochet case

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's government cannot
intervene in the extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain has told Chile.
	   It was ``not proper, not possible'' to do so, Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook told Chile's visiting Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano
Fernandez on Saturday.
	   Cook said he did not want the Pinochet case to interfere in
relations between the countries, but that it was a matter of ``due
legal process,'' a Foreign Office spokeswoman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Fernandez arrived Friday night to try to secure the release of
the 82-year-old Pinochet, who is under arrest at a London hospital
following spinal surgery. Pinochet was arrested on a warrant from a
Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his regime.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a senator, he is entitled
to diplomatic immunity. Britain insists he does not have immunity.
	   A report in Sunday's edition of The Observer newspaper said that
police had made the arrest at the hospital late the night of Oct.
16 because they had been tipped off that Pinochet's aides had
planned to ``spirit him secretly'' back to Chile on the morning of
Oct. 17. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman declined early Sunday to
comment on the report.
	   Pinochet's lawyers go to the High Court on Monday to try to get
the arrest ruled invalid.
	   The Chilean Foreign Ministry said a formal note was handed to
British ambassador Glynne Evans on Friday afternoon with new legal
information to support Chile's claim that Pinochet has diplomatic
immunity.
	   The Spanish warrant for Pinochet cited 94 victims but could be
broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared during his 17-year-rule.
	   Outside the London Clinic, where he is hospitalized, more than
150 protesters gathered Saturday to demand Pinochet be tried for
genocide. Among them were 35 Chilean exiles who traveled from
France.
	   In the Chilean capital of Santiago, thousands of rightists
joined a mass rally on Saturday to express support for Pinochet and
demand his release.
	   One of Pinochet's closest associates, Alfonso Marquez, said in
Santiago, ``The general's health has improved somewhat'' in the
last few hours. Previous reports indicated he was in serious
condition.
	   In London earlier, Chilean senator Ignacio Perez-Walker told
reporters after visiting Pinochet that the former leader's health
``appears very, very detiorated.'' He added that Pinochet was only
informed 48 hours ago that he was under arrest. He underwent
surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated spinal disc.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander
until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator for life,
as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.

A tale of two wordsmiths _ or logolepts, if you will

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ You could call them logophiles, those who are
passionate about words. Or logologists, those who are scientific
about words. Or logolepts, those who are maniacal about words.
	   You could call them two of the great logolepts ever to dabble in
_ and with _ the English language.
	   Dr. James Murray was a tailor's son from the Scottish border who
as a young man tried to teach Latin to cows and for fun memorized
hundreds of Gypsy phrases. Dr. William Chester Minor was a
Connecticut surgeon traumatized by the Civil War, convicted of
murder in London and institutionalized in a two-room, book-lined
cell.
	   They both lived in turn-of-the-century England and they knew
each other well. They corresponded by mail for years. They were
friends even after Murray learned that Minor was an inmate, not a
doctor, at the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. They
were friends even after Minor imagined attackers crawling through
the asylum floor.
	   And they were collaborators on a historic project. Murray, an
old schoolmate of the real-life model for Henry Higgins, was
supervising the compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary.
Minor, whose confinement did not keep him from owning a handsome
collection of 17th- and 18th-century literature, was his most
dependable contributor.
	   ``They are THE odd couple, aren't they?'' said author Simon
Winchester, who tells the story of Minor and Murray in his
best-selling biography, ``The Professor and the Madman.''
	   ``They're part of this great tradition of enthusiastic amateurs,
people who made great contributions to all sorts of things. They
were people with time on their hands and their enthusiasms would
carry them away.''
	   Winchester, a New Yorker who has written about everything from
travel in the Far East to imprisonment in Argentina, said he got
the idea for his latest work right at home _ the bathtub, to be
exact. The author was relaxing with a good book (on lexicography,
of course) and came upon a brief reference to Minor. He sat
straight up in the tub and decided there was a story to tell.
	   ``The Professor and the Madman'' not only has made The New York
Times' best-seller list, but has attracted both Mel Gibson and ``La
Femme Nikita'' director Luc Besson for a possible film adaptation.
The HarperCollins publication is even being used in a joint
advertisement with the Oxford University Press, with both biography
and dictionary (the former selling at dlrs 20, the latter at dlrs
995) promoted under the tabloid slogan: ``Madman Special.''
	   ``I'm unhappy with it,'' Winchester said. ``It just seems so
uncharacteristic of the Oxford University Press.
	   ``I remember a meeting we went to and sort of threw that name
out, `Madman Special,''' Oxford publisher Laura Brown said with a
laugh. ``If you call a book something in draft it starts to take on
a life of its own.''
	   Murray and Minor's friendship was a highlight of one of the
longest, most cerebral quests in English history _ the quest for
the ultimate catalog of the English language. It was a quest that
would involve everyone from Jonathan Swift to Samuel Johnson, a
quest for which the Oxford dictionary provided the voluminous
conclusion.
	   Ever since the 17th century, Swift, John Dryden and other
British intellectuals had been looking to trim a language that
seemed to grow as freely as an English garden. There was no
agreement on how words should be spelled, used or pronounced. No
one even knew how many words were out there. A language mastered in
print by Shakespeare and Milton still followed the uncertain rules
of oral culture.
	   Would-be trimmers multiplied but the first great one did not
emerge until 1755, when Dr. Johnson published his dictionary. For
several years, Johnson had been tracking down every possible usage
for thousands of words _ he found more than a hundred just for
``take'' _ and added often-acerbic definitions. At least one
listing, for ``oats,'' soon became widely quoted: ``A grain which
in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports
the people.''
	   But Johnson's dictionary was more literary than scholarly, and
many continued to insist upon a reference guide that served as a
catalog rather than a critical review. That would begin more than a
century after Johnson's publication. Its working title: ``The Big
Dictionary.''
	   The Big Dictionary had the scale of a great public works project
and, like so many public works projects, it ran longer than
planned. The originators of the Oxford dictionary _ including the
grandson of Romantic poet Samuel Coleridge _ thought they could
wrap everything up within a few years. It would end up taking 70.
	   ``Every time they made an assumption about having limits on the
number of meanings for a word, they found the limits were being
breached,'' Winchester said. ``It was as if they discovered that
behind each soldier they were fighting there were a hundred more.''
	   By the late 1870s Coleridge was dead and Murray, an esteemed
teacher and philologist, had been called in to edit. Minor,
meanwhile, was an unstable ex-surgeon who had murdered a stranger
on the streets of London and had been committed to Broadmoor, less
than 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Oxford.
	   Soon after starting his new job Murray issued an Appeal for
Volunteers, an eight-page pamphlet that made a plea for specialists
in 18th-century literature. Minor, who kept up with events in the
literary world, wrote to offer his help.
	   Before losing both his mental and physical strength, W.C. Minor
contributed thousands of listings to the Oxford dictionary, entries
on everything from ``art,'' ``buckwheat'' and ``brick-tea'' to
``catamaran,'' ``cholera'' and ``cutcherry.'' He also developed a
meticulous system of documentation still used by researchers today.
	   The dictionary was completed in 1928, but neither Minor nor
Murray lived to see it. Murray, knighted in 1908, died seven years
later, at age 78. Minor passed away at age 85, in 1920.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council has declared
that action may be needed to protect unarmed international monitors
in Kosovo _ but council members disagree on just what that action
could constitute.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China abstained from
Satuday's vote and maintain the resolution by no means authorizes
force. The United States, however, said NATO retained that right
and Britain pledged to use whatever force was needed to protect the
unarmed monitors.
	   ``No one should be in any doubt that we will use to the full our
inherent right to protect our nationals if they are in danger, and
the right under this resolution to take action to ensure their
safety and freedom of movement,'' said British ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock, the council president.
	   After nearly eight hours of rare Saturday consultations, the
council adopted a resolution 13-0 to endorse the agreement to allow
monitors to patrol Kosovo and NATO to verify from the air that
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians has stopped.
	   In the resolution, the council demanded Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic implement the accord fully and promptly and
affirmed that action may be needed to protect monitors in the case
of emergency.
	   The resolution, diplomats said, was believed to have been the
first by the Security Council to endorse a NATO operation.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced about 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists began in February.
	   Under an Oct. 12 deal that averted NATO airstrikes on Serb
targets, Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, to withdraw his special
police forces from the province and to allow a 2,000-strong team
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
verify the agreement.
	   The council was under pressure to pass a strong resolution
because nations that may contribute to the OSCE team have been
concerned about the safety of their people on the ground.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could have vetoed
the resolution. Much of the negotiating Saturday was intended to
prevent a possible veto by easing language about the threat of
force, diplomats said.
	   The final resolution deleted an earlier reference to
international organizations taking ``appropriate steps'' to ensure
compliance with the agreement _ a move opposed by Russia and China.
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun, said NATO's decision to
threaten Milosevic with air strikes violated the U.N. charter,
which alone is responsible for the maintenance of peace and
security in the world.
	   ``It is a contempt and a challenge to the authority of the U.N.
and the Security Council, and has created an extremely dangerous
precedent in international relations,'' Qin said.
	   He said China abstained from the vote because the resolution
went beyond what was agreed to Oct. 12. Russia said details of it _
particularly an expression of deep concern about the recent closure
of independent media in Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution
endorsing the accord.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he regretted that
Russia had cited the free media part of the resolution as a reason
to abstain.
	   ``I thought we would all agree on the council that a free media
is essential to the solution to the political problems in Kosovo
and the evolution towards democracy,'' Burleigh said.
	   He called the resolution the ``strongest possible message,'' the
council could send to Milosevic.
	   Russia has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally opposed to any
military intervention into what it considers an internal matter,
fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with Taiwan
and Tibet.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Vince Vaughn doesn't care if people think
he's crazy for portraying serial killers. He has always been able
to do things differently yet still come out ahead.
	   The 6-foot-5-inch (1.95-meter) Vaughn broke onto the scene a few
years ago as the video-game loving, bar-hopping actor of
``Swingers,'' who was on the prowl for ``beautiful babies'' and
made the saying, ``You're so money,'' seem hip.
	   Vaughn, 28, plays a killer in ``Clay Pigeons'' and will star as
the equally demented Norman Bates in Gus Van Sant's remake of the
Alfred Hitchcock classic, ``Psycho.''
	   Based on his dead-on performances, will people think he's a
womanizing, smooth-talking, borderline psychotic, too?
	   ``It would be nothing new for me,'' laughs Vaughn, rubbing his
stubbly baby face. Still, he warns, ``Perception can be a bad
thing.''
	   He says the real Vince is often ``painfully shy'' and only turns
up his humor if he likes someone. If people are mean, he can be
downright ``boisterous.''
	   Over a lunch of chicken tacos near his Los Feliz home, Vaughn
speaks quickly, almost in a stream of consciousness. If his hands
aren't gesturing while he speaks, he taps them on the table. Every
so often, his denim-clad leg jitters below the booth. Vaughn is
always on the move, even while he sits _ perhaps a remnant of a
childhood hyperactive streak.
	   Vaughn offers a scary portrayal of a madman in ``Clay Pigeons''
_ a twisted, at times comic tale of a gas station attendant who is
befriended by a mysterious cowboy drifter named Lester Long (played
by Vaughn).
	   Vaughn said he didn't know the film would be released only
months before ``Psycho,'' but shows no worry about being pegged as
the guy who can only portray wackos.
	   Van Sant said Vaughn's physical appearance helped him get the
``Psycho'' role.
	   ``Vince came in for a meeting when we started to cast the film
and he scared my assistant because of the way he looked,'' the
director said.
	   ``He had close-cropped hair and a short beard ... but there was
something quite deep in his gaze which helped me make the decision
to cast him. Not looking like Anthony Perkins helped, too.''
	   Vaughn said he drew on personal experience to help the two
characters come alive: ``I identify with the fact of being young
and not being understood _ of having people come at you and not
being able to protect myself.''
	   Vaughn has tracked dinosaurs in Steven Spielberg's sci-fi
thriller ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' and co-starred with
Anne Heche in the recent love drama ``Return to Paradise.''
	   ``I like people who are real, and I don't like to play
characters that try to be liked,'' he says.
	   The Midwestern-bred actor _ born in Minnesota, raised in
Illinois _ said he has never tried to win praise by following the
norm.
	   ``I was weird. I'm a kid that they took to a psychiatrist at 5.
They thought I was crazy because I was never a follower,'' Vaughn
says. ``I was a kid who would take tap class and then I would go
play football. ... I was always lucky that I could do my own
thing.''
	   School was not his forte. He remembers talking back to teachers
and going to detention, even if it was to stick up for other kids
he felt were being wronged.
	   ``I had a lot of confidence. I think I got it from my parents
that you can't just let people pick on you,'' Vaughn says.
	   ``I had teachers yelling at me all the time. But I had one
teacher who never yelled or anything. He pulled me outside and
said, 'I just wanted to tell you, you let me down.' I cried my eyes
out, even at 13 years old, because I wasn't as comfortable with
that, I guess. My journey has been getting more comfortable with
that sort of thing.''
	   At the suggestion of the school, he went to counseling and then
was put in a special class for a while.
	   ``It was like, 'He's got issues. He's hyperactive. Talks out in
class and stuff like that.' So they made me go.''
	   Vaughn's parents decided acting would be a good outlet for his
energy. At age 7, he was in school plays and community theater.
After high school, he did some work in Chicago _ even temporarily
joining an improv group.
	   ``I liked (acting) because I liked movies. I thought they were
really cool,'' says Vaughn, who likes to tell stories using Marlon
Brando films as a point of reference.
	   Vaughn skipped college and headed to Los Angeles at 18, leaving
behind a life that had always been full of contrasts. He was raised
both Protestant and Catholic; born poor but later transplanted to a
rich Chicago suburb; obtrusive at school, yet still popular.
	   He describes his dad, Vernon, as being a hardworking man from a
``redneck outdoor plumbing farm in Ohio.''
	   ``My dad put himself through college, served in the Navy, and
became a self-made man and made a lot of bread,'' he says. ``He
worked in an insane asylum at night so he could do his homework and
put the kids to bed. He was so determined to change his life
existence.''
	   When Vaughn was in elementary school, the family _ parents and
two older sisters _ moved to affluent Lake Forest. His parents have
since divorced.
	   ``It was such an extreme thing,'' he says. ``So I was forced to
sort of look away at the kind of exteriors _ of needing a place to
fit in, trying to find a group _ to find the individual.''
	   Vaughn uses this philosophy to stay ahead of the game in
Hollywood _ being up front with people and ``being honest with
yourself.''

	   SIOUX FALLS, South Dakota (AP) _ Mato Nanji doesn't say much
when he's on-stage, but that doesn't stop the shy lead singer and
guitarist for the blues band Indigenous from putting on a good
show.
	   His hard-edged, fiery guitar playing _ half Jimi Hendrix, half
Stevie Ray Vaughn _ does plenty to energize audiences.
	   ``I just go with it,'' Mato said. ``I try to let it flow, and
whatever comes out is going to come out. That's pretty much how the
whole band is.''
	   Indigenous is made up of Mato and his three siblings: Horse, who
is known to do bongo solos, and drummer Wandbi and bass guitarist
Pte, who both provide backup vocals.
	   The all-in-the family, American Indian band has come a long way
since playing bingo-hall gigs on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in
South Dakota. Indigenous released its first album Sept. 1, and the
band was recently in New York to record a video for the title track
``Things We Do.''
	   The album made its debut at No. 90 on the Album Network chart, a
new chart that is gaining credibility in the music business.
	   Indigenous has already done more than 150 shows this year.
	   ``It was just incredible,'' Chuck Richmond said of a recent
Indigenous show at his Brookings bar, Skinner's Pub. ``Those guys
are getting so good.''
	   The band members grew up in Marty, a reservation town of about
100 in southeastern South Dakota, where they were educated at home
and learned their Nakota language and heritage.
	   Their names are evidence of this Nakota upbringing. Translated
to English, Mato Nanji means Standing Bear, Wandbi means Good Eagle
Woman, Pte means Little Buffalo Man, while Horse is just that _
horse.
	   The blues are a big part of Indigenous' background. Mato said he
fell in love with the blues the minute he listened to a Carlos
Santana record as a kid. But the musicians' biggest influence was
their father, Greg Zephier.
	   ``(Zephier) said, `Sit down and listen to these people,''' said
Mato, who started playing around with the guitar at age 10.
	   Zephier's record collection was almost exclusively blues, with
Hendrix, Vaughn, Santana, and the Three Kings of Blues, B.B.,
Freddie and Albert King.
	   Growing up in Marty, the band members were isolated from any
live music _ except for Zephier's band, the Vanishing Americans.
His blues-rock group toured the country in the 1960s and '70s and
also was made up entirely of family members.
	   ``When we were first starting out, we'd never seen anyone play
live besides him,'' Mato said.
	   The band spent five years practicing before performing live. The
first Indigenous gig was at a bingo hall on the reservation,
although Mato said the elderly crowd wasn't too excited about loud
blues tunes.
	   But Indigenous has no difficulty exciting typical blues and rock
audiences, whether at sold-out rock festivals or in front of 150
people at Skinner's.
	   By the end of the year, Indigenous could have nearly 200 shows
under its belt despite having had to stop playing for a while
because a drunken driver hit their car after a Minneapolis show.
Mato suffered a concussion, and Wandbi is in physical therapy,
forcing the band to hire a temporary drummer.
	   But Indigenous continues to dazzle audiences night after night
with its spirited blues.
	   ``We're just kind of doing our own thing, jamming out, having
fun,'' Horse said.
	   Mato, Horse, Pte and Wandbi don't care if they're jamming out on
MTV, at packed stadiums or small-town bars _ as long as they're
playing.
	   ``We've wanted to play music ever since we can remember. That's
all it's been about,'' Mato said. ``We just did it and our parents
were always there supporting us. That's all we wanted to do, just
make music, just make records and keep going.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the growing number of hip-hop producers

Dupri never wanted to get behind the mike himself.
	   After all, Dupri is a superstar among today's celebrity
producers, and like Sean ``Puffy'' Combs and Missy ``Misdemeanor''
Elliott, his celebrity status contributes more to record sales than
the artists he produces.
	   It's hard to find a Dupri-produced track that doesn't feature
his Southern drawl or a video that doesn't display his flashy,
diamond-studded image.
	   Yet as the 26-year-old rises on the charts with the release of
his first album, ``Life in 1472,'' Dupri said it was with
reluctance that he stepped fully into the limelight this year.
	   ``I didn't want to do it, because I like being a producer _ just
being behind the scenes and watching the artists that I make become
big,'' Dupri said in a recent interview.
	   But his growing popularity as a hit producer had fans _ and,
more important, music industry insiders _ cajoling him to do
otherwise.
	   ``I just said, 'I'll just try it, just to see what's going to
happen.' I ain't got nothing to lose.''
	   Dupri has come a long way from the eager kid who got his start
as a hip-hop dancer opening for acts like Whoudini and Grandmaster
Flash. In only a few years, he became one of the music industry's
most sought-after producers.
	   Since the early 1990s, he has created hits for artists like
Mariah Carey, Usher and others, becoming so successful that he was
given his own label, So So Def Records, by Columbia Records. He
also discovered and produced acts like Kris Kross, Da Brat and
Xscape.
	   He has produced some of this year's biggest singers, including
Carey, Monica and Usher's platinum album, ``My Way.'' Last year,
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers named
Dupri as Rhythm and Soul Music's ``Songwriter of the Year.''
	   Dupri's past work has ranged from fluffy pop (Carey's sweet and
sentimental ``Always Be My Baby'') to funky soul (he produced and
rapped on the sizzling remix of Dru Hill's ``In My Bed,'' one of
1997's best sellers).
	   But ``Life in 1472'' shows an edgy side of Dupri. Primarily a
rap album, it often plays like a raunchy, misogynist bragging fest,
and thoroughly deserves its parental warning label.
	   ``It's definitely different than any of my artists. I guess it's
me,'' he says. ``I think it's going to be a shocker for a lot of
people, 'cause it ain't as clean as a lot of people probably think
that it should have been or that it probably would be, because I've
been making big records like pop records, or whatever.''
	   Dupri's clout in the industry is evident on ``Life in 1472,''
which features a who's who of the rap world, including Mase, Jay-Z,
Snoop Dogg, DMX and Da Brat. Carey also makes an appearance. On
some songs, his guest stars are the main attraction, relegating
Dupri to a secondary role.
	   ``Usually a person would have been buggin' out about that, but I
didn't care because I wanted the record to feel like everybody has
that equal amount of input,'' he says.
	   Mase has become more than just a rapping duet partner for Dupri.
Earlier this year, Dupri signed a deal with the platinum rapper,
the brightest star on Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment label, giving
him a record company of his own. Mase, who will remain an artist on
Bad Boy, will head All Out records as So So Def tries to expand its
impact in the industry.
	   ``Me and Puff didn't ever discuss a label deal,'' says Mase.
``Me and J.D. spoke about it one time, hypothetically, and then
after a couple of months we just thought that it was a good idea.
	   ``I had a lot of ideas, and I felt with J.D. I could accomplish
what I had to do,'' he says.
	   ``I look at it as another eye for me. I can't see everything and
see everywhere,'' Dupri said. ``I'm based in Atlanta and he's up
here in Harlem, so he might see the next Michael Jackson at the
Apollo (Theater). If he puts him on his label, and I'm a part of
that, so that's how it goes down.''
	   Even as his solo effort creates chart hits, Dupri remains
devoted to his work as a producer and a creator for other artists.
He promises not to let his own success bypass opportunities to work
with the long list of singers hoping he will create some magic for
them.
	   ``It's cool with me being an artist, but I know I'm a producer,
first and foremost,'' Dupri says. ``So as long as I remember that
... I should be all right. The artist thing, that's just one
particular part of me.''

Scrutinizing Walt: Disney and the `architecture of reassurance'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Movies, ultimately, became too finite for him.
They created illusion, reassurance and a feeling of community, but
there was always that persistent problem: They ended. So Walt
Disney set to bringing the real world and the cinematic one ever
closer.
	   His eponymous result was Disneyland, a movie-cum-landscape
carved into the edge of California suburbia that could take
Americans on a memorable, whimsical journey that was physical
instead of merely celluloid.
	   What Disneyland begat _ Walt Disney World and the
multimillion-dollar theme-park mania of late-20th-century America _
is the focus of a new exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt, the National
Design Museum of the Smithsonian.
	   ``The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme
Parks'' explores the relationship between theme park and landscape
_ how they interact, how they affect one another, how both have
evolved and, ultimately, how theme parks create an environment
where synthesized dreams take on the sheen of comfortable reality.
	   ``The Disney park evokes things we're missing in the
contemporary world _ like community,'' says Karal Ann Marling, a
cultural historian at the University of Minnesota and the exhibit's
curator. ``It's holding out to you that you can recover or create a
community _ a world of which you are a part.''
	   Disney drew upon his experiences in small-town Missouri to build
Disneyland. It was his dreams of the future that created
Tomorrowland, his fairy-tale notions that animated Fantasyland, his
visions of the American West that crafted Frontierland, his
Hollywood-fed vision of exotic locales that begat Adventureland.
	   Those images _ born of a complex blend of reality, movies and
fanciful wishes for a simpler, more reassuring America _ are seen
today in Disney-inspired locales across the land. In a sense,
Disney feeds us back images of our own world.
	   ``There was a remarkable tale to be told,'' Nicholas Olsberg,
chief curator of the Canadian Centre for Architecture, writes in
the introduction to the exhibit's catalog. His institution was the
first to house the show.
	   Marling, who interviewed many of Disney's contemporaries and was
granted access to thousands of Disney documents, organized the
exhibit to mirror Disneyland.
	   The main corridor functions as Main Street USA; separate rooms
depict Tomorrowland, Adventureland and Frontierland. Other rooms
show the simulated placemaking of EPCOT Center and depict how
Disney ``imagineering'' has spread overseas and spilled into
real-world architecture.
	   Popular attractions, Marling proposes, are one of the keys to
understanding any society.
	   ``People's taste is nothing to be sniffed at by ivory-tower
academics,'' she says. ``It's preferable to figure out what
intrigues them about these places.''
	   In addition to a cohesive narrative of how the Disney dream
unfolded, the exhibit offers a plethora of interesting windows into
the interaction of Disney and culture:
	   _Disney's creative staff, in proposing Tokyo Disneyland, drew up
plans for a Ginza-style Main Street with a glass dome. But it was
too Japanese, said the Japanese, so it became a train-shed roof and
thus more American. Disney Paris, meanwhile, is more visually
intricate because Disney staffers realized that Europeans _ with a
centuries-old museum-going and architectural tradition behind them
_ have a more sophisticated eye.
	   _Walt Disney World's Main Street USA is five times longer and
five times wider than Disneyland's, and its builders were concerned
about how to maintain the feeling of small-town intimacy. So they
made the colors more intense and built the facades to stick out and
thus cast shadows and add texture.
	   _In all Disney parks, the left-hand side is the natural world
(Frontierland) and the right is technology (Tomorrowland).
Marling's theory: ``Left is where west is on a map. On the right is
the future, where the sun rises.''
	   _The ``Wild West'' paradigm of early Frontierland _ cowboys
against Indians _ is yielding to images of Missouri, Mark Twain and
a Midwestern farmer's life. Is it because we are re-evaluating what
we did there?
	   _Recent incarnations of Tomorrowland feature alien-invasion
attractions and exhibits that turn Jetsonian visions of optimistic
futures into an ironic riff.
	   ``This is not exactly your grandfather's Disney World anymore,''
Marling says. ``This is a good place to go for kids who have nose
rings.''
	   Thus a shift. Today's Disney, while retaining the reassuring
elements of a Main Street USA archetype, is simultaneously
simulating modern places and giving a nod to thrill and excitement
_ notions of reassurance in their own right, designed to remind us
that things could be worse.
	   ``The Disney people have been successful for two generations
because they look at how people move through space,'' Marling says.
	   ``Somebody has looked at all the details. Somebody cared enough
to get it right,'' she says. ``It's an adventure _ an adventure
like in the movies. You know something exciting is going to happen.
But you also know that the crocodile that comes up out of the river
is not going to eat you. That's reassuring. That's the architecture
of reassurance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme
Parks'' is on exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum
in Manhattan until Jan. 10, 1999. It then travels to the Modern Art
Museum of Fort Worth, Texas, from Feb. 14 to April 11, 1999.

Et tu, Tucci? An actor turned auteur

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stanley Tucci settles into a cushy sofa at a
midtown cigar bar and appears vaguely unsettled. He hasn't fired up
his fat La Fontana or ordered his Ketel One martini yet, but that's
not the problem. It's the decor.
	   The actor-turned-auteur has now turned design maven.
	   He looks around and says the book-lined, dark-wood, clubby
ambience seems like a Hollywood set rather than a real-life hangout
_ and the yellow in the wall paper should be a few shades darker.
	   After a drag or two on his cigar and several sips of the Dutch
vodka, it's clear that Tucci isn't perpetually persnickety. It's
just that he's used to worrying about everything as a filmmaker _
and it shows that he's his father's son.
	   ``I'm a very visual person,'' says Tucci, whose second film as
writer-director-star, ``The Impostors,'' has received warm reviews.
``If something is off visually or aesthetically, it's painful for
me _ sometimes to the point of obsession, but I try to let that
go.''
	   Tucci, whose father was a high school art history teacher and
painter-sculptor, says he can even find himself rearranging objects
on a table.
	   Loving attention to detail served as a theme in Tucci's 1996
movie-making debut, ``Big Night,'' and it's evident again in his
follow-up, an homage to acting and a sendup of artifice.
	   ``The Impostors'' stars Tucci and Oliver Platt as two jobless
Depression-era actors who work constantly, publicly and privately,
on improving. They rehearse death scenes in the park, run lines in
their underwear at home, even take on roles to scam cream puffs
from the baker _ all in an effort to become Master Thespians.
	   Since ``Big Night'' became an art-house hit, the 38-year-old
Tucci was surprised that he had to struggle two years to get
together the dlrs 8.3 million budget for this film.
	   But success doesn't necessarily beget funding, he says, unless
you want to do something similar to what you've just made.
	   ``People seemed to have faith in me as a director but they did
not have faith in the script or the genre,'' Tucci says.
	   ``They said, `You can't do it ... You can't make a farce on
film.'''
	   His response? ``Trust me.''
	   Fox Searchlight did.
	   Tucci says it's ridiculous to attempt a tour de farce with one's
second film. But if it fails, it's his responsibility, and he
doesn't want to foist any blame on a studio by saying it forced him
to do certain things.
	   ``I will look at the film, as I look at `Big Night,' and look at
performances that I've done and say, `That is the way it is because
that's where I was at the moment artistically.' And that, I think,
is a good thing to be able to say, because you did it without
compromise and you threw yourself into it. ...
	   ``It's like looking at a painter's work. Painters go through
different styles, different phases, different periods _ some of
them work and some of them don't work!''
	   For a solid decade before co-writing (with cousin Joseph
Tropiano) and co-directing (with good friend Campbell Scott) ``Big
Night,'' Tucci had a solid career as an actor.
	   His movie credits include ``Billy Bathgate,'' ``The Pelican
Brief,'' ``Undercover Blues,'' ``It Could Happen to You,'' ``Kiss
of Death'' and ``Jury Duty.'' On television, he played a memorable
Mafiosi named Rick Pinzolo on the old CBS series ``Wiseguy'' during
the 1988-89 season, and he received an Emmy nomination for his role
as Richard Crosshit
``Beethoven,'' Tucci often found himself cast as an Italian
mobster, Arab assassin and Hispanic mugger, and he concedes that
his frustration at portraying a parade of ``ethnic heavies''
motivated him to make a movie. But that wasn't the biggest factor,
he says.
	   ``The main reason I wanted to make `Big Night' was because I
wanted to make a movie that I wanted to go and see, a movie that
lived in its own time, and a movie that had an ambiguous ending,
and a movie that wasn't plot-driven but character-driven,'' Tucci
says.
	   Most of all, he wanted to make a movie with his own voice and
vision.
	   While striving for that, Tucci agrees that his latest movie is a
derivative smorgasbord: He and Platt are reminiscent of Laurel and
Hardy, the film's antic quality of the Marx Brothers, the mime of
Chaplin and Keaton.
	   ``You're certainly inspired and you steal from, let's face it,
all those different movies. It was all the stuff I watched as a
kid,'' says Tucci, who grew up in New York's suburban Westchester
County with two younger sisters.
	   He suggests that everything _ including early sitcoms like ``I
Love Lucy'' and the surreal works of Fellini _ can have a
cumulative, subliminal effect. ``All these things have informed
your aesthetic,'' he says. ``You create something of your own out
of it.''
	   Because ``The Impostors'' has an ensemble cast, was made in New
York, is stylized and set in a small universe, the film also has
some of the look and feel of a Woody Allen movie (a thought helped
along by Allen's unbilled cameo). At that notion, Tucci smiles and
says, ``Good. Yes.''
	   Tucci enticed his circle of friends to work for scale, in part,
by writing roles specifically with them in mind and casting them
against type.
	   Lili Taylor, typically in brooding roles, plays someone like
effervescent cruise director Julie McCoy on ``The Love Boat.''
Allison Janney, seen this year as a clumsy educator in ``Primary
Colors'' and a frustrated wife on Broadway's ``A View From the
Bridge,'' portrays a scheming femme fatale.
	   Tucci himself has succeeded in being cast against type in the
last couple of years, appearing in the comedies ``Deconstructing
Harry'' and ``A Life Less Ordinary.''
	   This month, he co-stars in the film ``The Alarmist'' with David
Arquette and Kate Capshaw; on Nov. 21, he fills the title role in
an HBO movie about gossip columnist and radio star Walter Winchell
_ who, Tucci notes, once said: ``There's nothing more `ex' than an
ex-big shot.'' And next year, Tucci will star as Puck in a new
movie adaptation of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
	   Tucci, the EX-ethnic heavy, again starts to sound like his
father's son as he drains his martini and gets ready to return to
the suburb where he lives with wife Kate, a social worker, and her
children from a previous marriage.
	   He says he's unlike his father in one key way _ he's not as
patient. But that can be a virtue, he adds.
	   ``There's also something about impatience that I think can be
very rewarding artistically. To me, abstract Impressionism in a way
came out of impatience, and annoyance. Jackson Pollock ... de
Kooning. ... Impatience, and annoyance with the status quo. There's
something to be said for it.''

`Tribute to Tradition' album raises money for retirement home

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Mac Wiseman is a 73-year-old
country-music musician who is still at it. But when age finally
catches up with him, he doesn't want to hang up his guitar or
change the company he keeps.
	   He wants to move into a retirement home with other veterans of
the country-music business. And he wants the home to have a stage
so they can play any time.
	   ``We could be among our own kind in our later years,'' said
Wiseman, a one-time member of Bill Monroe and The Blue Grass Boys.
``It would be great to wheel down to an old friend's room and tell
road stories, and they'd understand.''
	   He just might get his wish.
	   The Country Music Association has teamed up with Sony Records to
raise money for a retirement home. Sony has donated dlrs 50,000 in
anticipated profits from its newly released ``Tribute to
Tradition'' album to seed the fund.
	   No site has been chosen for the home, no blueprints drawn up and
no guidelines for residency eligibility established. Organizers
aren't sure how much it will cost, and believe it will take at
least a year before they have enough money to begin a serious
search for a location.
	   There is a model for the home, however: The 21-acre Motion
Picture and Television Fund's retirement home in Woodland Hills,
Calif., which has been taking entertainment industry retirees since
1942.
	   That home costs about dlrs 50 million per year to operate, said
Wayne Halper, an executive at DreamWorks SKG who is working on the
Nashville project.
	   Raising money is never easy, Halper said, ``But I'm getting
calls left and right from record companies, booking agents and the
like that want to participate.''
	   Wiseman said he knows many in the industry who would benefit
from such a home.
	   ``Quite frankly and candidly, a lot of (older country music
stars) weren't trained in business and didn't associate with people
that would give them the right guidance,'' Wiseman said. ``And the
ones that made good money didn't save it for their later years.''
	   The plans provide for the home to admit not just the famous, but
also those who toiled anonymously in bands and behind-the-scenes
country-music jobs.
	   To get the fundraising going, Sony asked artists to perform an
old song that influenced their music. Songs by Hank Williams Sr.,
Bill Anderson, Merle Haggard, Tammy Wynette, Billy Joe Shaver and
Lefty Frizzell are included on ``Tribute to Tradition.''
	   Among the highlights: Alison Krauss singing The Browns' hit,
``The Three Bells,'' and an all-star rendition of the Don Gibson
classic, ``Oh Lonesome Me,'' by Mary Chapin Carpenter, Mark
Knopfler, Vince Gill, Steve Wariner and Chet Atkins.
	   Sony plans to make ``Tribute to Tradition'' a series which may
continue to raise funds for the retirement home. One possibility:
album-length tributes from one artist to another, such as ``Patty
Loveless Sings Loretta Lynn.''
	   Halper said other fund-raising endeavors are being explored,
such as adding 50 cents to the price of parking at concerts.
	   ``Most of these older entertainers, as long as their health
permits, they'd just as soon die on the stage as anywhere else,''
Wiseman said. But if there were no alternative, the home ``sure
would be a little help with their dignity.''

That Was the Week That Was

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Oct. 25-31:
	   60 years ago: The radio play, ``The War of the Worlds,''
starring Orson Welles, aired on CBS. Using fake news bulletins and
simulated on-scene reports to portray an invasion by Martians, the
broadcast sparked panic among listeners who thought the dramatized
events were authentic.
	   And MGM's ``Young Dr. Kildare'' starred Lew Ayres and Lionel
Barrymore. It was the first in a series of Dr. Kildare films
released by MGM.
	   40 years ago: Buddy Holly and the Crickets made their final
television appearance. The group appeared on ``American
Bandstand,'' miming to ``Heartbeat'' and ``It's So Easy.'' Holly
was killed in a plane crash several months later.
	   35 years ago: Bob Dylan performed at a sold-out concert at
Carnegie Hall in New York.
	   30 years ago: Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn starred in
``The Lion in Winter.'' Hepburn won an Oscar for her performance.
	   25 years ago: ``Midnight Train to Georgia'' by Gladys Knight and
The Pips was at the No. 1 spot on the U.S. singles charts. The song
became a soul classic.
	   20 years ago: John Carpenter's ``Halloween'' starred Jamie Lee
Curtis. It was followed by several sequels and myriad clones.
	   10 years ago: R.E.M.'s album, ``Eponymous,'' entered the British
album chart. The album contained the rare and original version of
the group's debut single, ``Radio Free Europe.''
	   And the four members of Irish rock group U2 received the gold
medal of the city of Madrid, Spain. The presentation was made in a
ceremony before the premiere of the group's concert movie, ``Rattle
and Hum.'' U2 was praised for its musical ability and artistic
sensibilities.
	   Five years ago: Comedian Joan Rivers said she was ending her
``Joan Rivers Show'' and would replace it with a gossipy,
celebrity-filled, home-shopping hour, ``Can We Shop?''
	   One year ago: Comedian Bob Hope was named an honorary U.S.
veteran for his half-century of entertaining the troops around the
world. Hope, the first American to be so honored by Congress, began
his military shows in 1941.
	   A survey of pop wealth by Business Age magazine said David Bowie
was Britain's richest pop star, edging out Paul McCartney. Bowie
was listed as among the 25 richest people in Britain, with a
fortune of dlrs 919 million. McCartney was listed at second with a
fortune of dlrs 868 million, followed by Tom Jones at dlrs 460
million.
	   And a Howdy Doody marionette and more than 100 other pieces of
memorabilia from the classic kiddie TV show fetched more than dlrs
300,000 at an auction in New York. The sale marked the 50th
anniversary of America's first visit to Doodyville, where Howdy and
company entertained children from 1947 to 1960.
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``These acts of violence and brutality are absolutely
gratuitous.'' _ Director Martin Scorsese, referring to violent
demonstrations against his film, ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``I wasn't a Cindy Crawford or an Elle Macpherson or, you know,
Linda Evangelista. I was just a working model who was making a good
living off of catalogs and advertisements and commercials. I was
making a very comfortable living that way and successful in that.
But I wasn't on the cover of, you know, hundreds of magazines.'' _
Actress Cameron Diaz.

	    &UR; In the spotlight: Fran Lebowitz
	    &UR; Funny lady: The Washington Post Book World has called her ``the
funniest woman in America.''
	   She's Fran Lebowitz, born on Oct. 27, 1950. Her two books of
humorous essays, ``Metropolitan Life'' and ``Social Studies,'' have
been combined into one volume, ``The Fran Lebowitz Reader.''
	   In ``Metropolitan Life'' and ``Social Studies,'' Ms. Lebowitz
runs the gamut _ from laws (``to prevent the construction of
buildings that look like gigantic electric shavers'') to tips for
landlords (``the arrival of winter seems invariably to infect the
tenant with an almost fanatical lust for warmth'').
	   The books could be called survival texts for living in
Manhattan.
	   She's been promising an epic novel for years. (``I would have
made a perfect heiress,'' she says. ``I enjoy lounging. And
reading. The other problem I have is fear of writing. The act of
writing puts you in confrontation with yourself, which is why I
think writers assiduously avoid writing.'')
	   Ms. Lebowitz is also the author of a children's book, ``Mr. Chas
and Lisa Sue Meet the Pandas.'' The book tells the humorous
adventures of two 7-year-old children and two Panda bears.
	    &UR; Background: Ms. Lebowitz grew up in Morristown, New Jersey,
where her parents owned a furniture store. She moved to New York,
drove a cab and did other odd jobs before landing a column in Andy
Warhol's hipster magazine, Interview. Her dour columns there and in
Mademoiselle magazine in the early 1970s brought her money and
attention.
	    &UR; When she's not writing: Ms. Lebowitz loves to talk. And she's
always got strong opinions _ on everything from race to money to
riding in taxicabs.
	   Quote: ``Success didn't spoil me, I've always been
insufferable.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Madonna Badger. The name may not be familiar,
but the images are.
	   Remember those provocative Marky Mark underwear and jeans ads
for Calvin Klein?
	   Those seductive Kate Moss/Obsession ads?
	   These are two of the eye-catching campaigns that have sprung
from the imaginative mind of Ms. Badger, who, at 34, is president
and creative director of Badger Worldwide Advertising (BWA), her
own advertising, design and marketing agency.
	   Another image: supermodel Rachel Williams tugging on the
waistband of her Hot Sox tights.
	   And that's just the beginning.
	   ``I think what people come to me for is for what I think
instinctively is going to work, or I think is the next great thing,
or where I think this brand category is heading,'' said Ms. Badger
during an interview at her SoHo offices.
	   BWA has created campaigns for A/X Armani Exchange; 5S, a new
line of skin care and makeup from Shiseido; Francesco Biasia
handbags; and Adrienne Vittadini accessories.
	   ``What we really do for people is find the essence of who they
are and bring it to the public. Right now, our primary clients are
fashion and beauty clients,'' she said. ``For the most part, we
take who they are ... and bring that to the forefront and really
make that into the main image they're giving the customer.''
	   Ms. Badger is not afraid to be daring or playful.
	   BWA created a series of ads showing two women fighting over a
Francesco Biasia handbag.
	   ``The idea of two beautiful and chic women fighting over a
handbag conveys to our consumer that she must own a Francesco
Biasia handbag, too,'' she said. ``In the ads, they're very
playful, very fun, as sisters can be, in competition, and the ads
didn't come across as being gratuitously sexy. It was something
that appealed to all of us as women, so it made sense.''
	   About five years ago, Ms. Badger left her position as senior art
director at CRK, the in-house advertising agency for designer
Calvin Klein, to start her own company.
	   With a staff of 20, BWA offers a broad range of integrated
services including brand development, advertising, marketing, art
direction and media planning.
	   In other words, the works.
	   ``Consistency is the key,'' Ms. Badger said. ``Every aspect of a
business or product is equally important. Whether an ad, a label, a
poster or a package, the same effort must be focused on every
detail, every nuance must be addressed. Our strength is the ability
to identify and develop a one-image concept for reaching
consumers.''
	   For A/X Armani Exchange, photographer Regan Cameron shot 16
black-and-white scenes in two small towns in Arizona. Through
digital technology, the company's logo was superimposed on the
backs of playing cards, the screen of a drive-in theater and the
side of an old warehouse.
	   ``I developed this idea of the AX/Armani Exchange logo really
being part of your life, that's in every aspect of your life. It's
a very lifestyle-oriented campaign, it's very cinematic, it really
is about A/X being a part of your life and being in your life,''
she said.
	   The models were dressed in a mix of Armani basics and seasonal
items.
	   ``What we're really representing is, 'Heh, you know what? You
could be these people.' It's accessible, it's fun, it's playful,
and it's also incredibly great clothes, great style, at a really
great price,'' Ms. Badger said.
	   The A/X Armani Exchange campaign was launched in September, just
as the company's new Fifth Avenue store was opening.
	   For Shiseido's 5S line, BWA developed an integrated concept on
the tag line, ``Own your mind and body.''
	   Ms. Badger and her staff were responsible for naming the
formulations, designing the logo and the packaging, creating the
store environment and launching the products.
	   The 5S store opened in SoHo in May. Customers can sit at
``mingle tables'' and experiment with products. (The 5S senses are
energizing, purifying, calming, adoring and nurturing. For each
sense, the colors and formulations of the products were paired to
elicit the particular result desired.)
	   ``The best part about it for me was really looking at cosmetics
as being something that will transcend into the 21st century,'' Ms.
Badger said. ``And so that was the really great part about
developing this brand. It was making it modern and also giving it
staying power. And I think with a lot of my other campaigns that
I've done, I've always tried to keep that in mind, the idea of how
can I keep it incredibly modern but also in a way that gives it a
21st-century edge.''
	   Raised in Kentucky, Ms. Badger began her career working as a
graphic designer in the art department of Esquire magazine. One
year later, she left New York for Paris, where she worked at Madame
Figaro, a fashion and lifestyle magazine. She later returned to New
York where she worked as an art director for several magazines
before joining CRK.
	   Recently, BWA was hired to create ad campaigns for Emanuel
Ungaro collections, including the designer's eyewear and Ungaro
Parallele, Ungaro L'Homme, U Weekend and U Collection.

Mozart now getting credit for help on little-known opera

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Two hundred years after his death, an opera that
some believe was partly Mozart's is having its premiere.
	   Musicologist David Buch says he is certain that three segments
of an obscure Viennese opera were indeed written by the leading
composer of the classical period.
	   In all, 20 minutes _ nearly one-quarter of the late 18th century
work _ have been newly attributed to Mozart.
	   Buch has his doubters in the musical academy. But the professor
also has many music scholars and lovers on his side, including the
Boston Baroque Orchestra, which is debuting ``The Philosopher's
Stone'' Oct. 30. The performance is being billed as the
``modern-day world premiere'' of a work by ``Mozart and company.''
	   Scholars believe the work hasn't been played since about two
decades after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's death in 1791. The piece,
written in archaic German, will be recorded for the Telarc label
next month.
	   While other Mozart compositions have been discovered over the
last two centuries, this would be the first find from the height of
his career, Buch and his supporters said.
	   ``It's really astonishing to find there may be something we
don't know from right at the end of his life,'' said Martin
Pearlman, Boston Baroque's conductor and founder.
	   Although a Mozart connection to the 1790 ``Philosopher's Stone''
has been suggested before, there was never much proof.
	   The opera was attributed to four other composers and never made
it into the canon of more popular works of the day, such as ``The
Magic Flute,'' which Mozart wrote about a year later. ``The
Philosopher's Stone'' was thought to have survived in only two
copies, neither of which resolved the Mozart question.
	   Buch, who teaches music at the University of Northern Iowa, was
researching supernatural operas of the 18th century when he
stumbled upon a cache of music that the Soviets had taken out of
Germany at the end of World War II.
	   In the early 1990s, the Russians returned thousands of pages of
original manuscripts to the archives of the City and University
Library in Hamburg, Germany. Among them: ``The Philosopher's
Stone,'' or ``Der Stein der Weisen.''
	   Although some scholars had speculated that Mozart composed a
comic duet for the opera, none had determined that he played a
larger role, Buch said.
	   In 1996, Buch examined the Hamburg copy, one of three now
believed to still exist, and was stunned to find Mozart's name on
the list of composers.
	   Buch had expected to find Mozart's name alongside the duet that
had been tentatively linked to the great master. He had not
anticipated finding Mozart's name attached to two substantial
sections of the second-act finale.
	   Buch admits it is possible that someone wrote Mozart's name on
the manuscript to impress music-lovers of the time. After all,
Mozart was enormously popular in his own day. But why would someone
attribute only three small sections to him and not the entire work?
	   Moreover, Buch said, the Hamburg copy with Mozart's name matched
an identical version that had been housed in Berlin. And Mozart's
widow had referred on three separate occasions to a work her
husband had helped compose.
	   Buch's find _ provided it is accepted by the academy into
Mozart's canon _ won't do much to alter music historians' thinking
about Mozart. But it could provide insight into how the man worked
as a collaborator in what one musicologist described as a
``Broadway musical'' style of composing, and not just as an
isolated genius.
	   But whether this is truly a work by Mozart remains in dispute.
Buch's attribution will be a topic of conversation at a meeting of
the American Musicological Society, which is gathering in Boston
next week to coincide with the opera premiere.
	   Christoph Wolff, a professor of the history of music at Harvard
University who will moderate a panel on Buch's discovery, has his
doubts.
	   Mozart kept a meticulous journal of all his pieces _ even the
smallest works composed for others _ and is unlikely to have left
out sections of an opera, Wolff said.
	   ``I'm extremely skeptical about Mozart's involvement,'' said
Wolff, who authenticated several chorale preludes by J.S. Bach in
1984.
	   Neal Zaslaw, a music professor at Cornell University and a top
Mozart expert, believes Buch is on to something. ``My judgment is
that it's extremely likely that Mozart had something to do with
this operetta,'' he said.
	   Either way, the revival of the opera is a boon for music lovers
who rarely get to hear other works of the day, Wolff said, and
skeptics as well as believers are looking forward to its premiere.
	   The other composers to whom the opera is attributed are Emanuel
Schikaneder, who also wrote the libretto, Benedikt Schack, Franz
Xaver Gerl and Johann Baptiste Henneberg, who conducted the opera's
premiere. ``The Philosopher's Stone,'' it turns out, is remarkably
similar to ``The Magic Flute,'' one of Mozart's best-known pieces,
written not long before his death at age 35. Both operas were
written in a two-act structure and were based on the same fairy
tale collection. Both were performed within a year of each other in
the same theater, by the same actors and singers, Pearlman said.
	   ``I think any time there's a discovery of music by Mozart,
that's a surprising thing,'' Pearlman said. ``And it's a gift.''

At the Movies: 'Practical Magic'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Sept. 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ No wonder the citizens of a small New England
island shun the Owens women. They are witches. Not like the
fearsome crones huddling around a caldron and telling the fate of
Macbeth. The Owenses are attractive women who practice white magic,
not the black kind of ill repute.
	   White magic can perform supernatural deeds, though it is largely
benevolent. For the Owenses, their power is both a blessing and a
curse. The bad news: Whenever one of the women falls in love, her
man is not long for this world.
	   This is the premise of ``Practical Magic,'' a constantly
engrossing and surprisingly funny movie with a knockout cast. Alice
Hoffman's novel has been filmed under the sure comedic hand of
Griffin Dunne, noted for his offbeat performances (``After Hours'')
and direction (``Addicted to Love'').
	   In an amusing prologue, the film shows how the Owens women got
that way. An ancestor in colonial times faces hanging, charged with
witchcraft. Using some very practical magic, she escapes the death
sentence. Her knowledge, as well as the curse, are handed down
through generations.
	   The modern recipients are three generations who share the large,
ominous house that is feared by other islanders. The women are:
	   Aunts Jet (Dianne Wiest) and Frances (Stockard Channing), ages
unknown, keepers of the magic secrets, which they aim to hand down
to the next generation.
	   Nieces Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman), who
have been raised by the aunts and harbor mixed feelings about
continuing the family tradition.
	   Youngsters Kylie (Evan Rachel Wood) and Antonia (Alexandra
Artrip), daughters of Sally and targets of schoolmates' taunts.
	   Sally is blissfully married, but her husband suffers the fate of
all men who marry into the family. Both sisters begin to believe
that the debits of their heritage outweigh the benefits. Gillian,
the more unstable sister, abandons the family for a riotous life in
Arizona.
	   Gillian becomes involved with Jimmy (Goran Visnjic), a brutal
drifter. When fun turns to violence, the desperate Gillian puts out
a call for her sister. Together they dispose of Jimmy. Or do they?
He has an annoying habit of reappearing.
	   The case attracts the interest of an Arizona detective (Aidan
Quinn), who visits the Owens residence to ask questions. Now the
real fun begins.
	   The writing talents of Robin Swicord, Akiva Goldsman and Adam
Brooks crafted Hoffman's book into an intriguing, funny tale with
just enough thrills to satisfy the horror addicts.
	   Bullock brings the needed tone of credibility to ``Practical
Magic,'' while Kidman delivers excitement and unpredictability. As
for the aunties, they are terrific. Overdressed in ageless outfits,
Wiest and Channing complement one another with charm and
self-assurance that witchcraft is a valid and beneficial
occupation.
	   The ever-reliable Quinn contributes a welcome note of sanity.
	   The Warner Bros. release was produced by Denise Di Nova. Running
time: 105 minutes.

	   ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' opera in 3 acts by Gaetano Donizetti
(Sony) _ soprano Andrea Rost, tenor Bruce Ford, baritone Anthony
Michaels-Moore and bass Alistair Miles; Sir Charles Mackerras
conducting the London Voices and The Hanover Band.
	   ``Der Fliegende Hollander,'' opera in 3 acts by Richard Wagner
(Deutsche Grammophon) _ soprano Cheryl Studer, tenors Placido
Domingo and Peter Seiffert, baritone Bernd Weikl, bass Hans Sotin;
Giuseppe Sinopoli conducting the chorus and orchestra of the
Deutsche Oper Berlin.
	   ``Don Giovanni,'' opera in 2 acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
(Deutsche Grammophon) _ sopranos Carmela Remigio, Soile Isokoski
and Patrizia Pace, tenor Uwe Heilmann, baritones Simon Keenlyside,
Bryn Terfel and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and bass Matti Salminen;
Claudio Abbado conducting the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.
	   If the operatic recording industry is in crisis, these three
recent releases of repertory staples help to show why. The CD bins
are already filled to overflowing with versions of all three works
that offer superior casting and conducting, as well as excellent
sound.
	   So what incentive is there for the consumer to shell out dlrs 30
to dlrs 50 to pick up one of the new sets? The conductors and
orchestras are all excellent, but is anyone going to buy ``Don
Giovanni'' just to hear Abbado's latest interpretation?
	   In the case of ``Lucia,'' there's at least a gimmick. The
recording, conducted by the scrupulous musicologist Charles
Mackerras, offers the original 1835 version more or less as
Donizetti wrote it. What that means, most of all, is fewer of those
stratospheric high notes for the demented heroine that anyone who
grew up listening to Callas, Sutherland or Sills in the part
expects to hear. As Mackerras points out in his album notes, these
crept in as sopranos like Nellie Melba took over the opera and
turned it into pretty much a one-woman show.
	   On this recording, it's a more balanced ensemble, led by
Hungarian soprano Andrea Rost. She brings a penetrating, lively
voice to the role but only an adequate technique for the many
coloratura runs of the Mad Scene.
	   Tenor Bruce Ford is sympathetic as her hapless sweetheart,
Edgardo, but the real vocal honors go to baritone Anthony
Michaels-Moore, suave and black-voiced as Lucia's treacherous
brother Enrico, and bass Alistair Miles, a pillar of solace as
Lucia's tutor, Raimondo.
	   The Hanover Band plays with great spirit, and it's a treat to
hear a period harp in the ``fountain scene'' and a wooden flute in
the Mad Scene.
	   There's nothing much wrong with the latest ``Don Giovanni,''
except that its only name star isn't singing the title role. Welsh
baritone Bryn Terfel instead takes the part of the Don's
manservant, Leporello, and sings up a storm. Such a storm, in fact,
that he frequently overshadows the lighter-voiced baritone Simon
Keenlyside in the title role.
	   The sopranos are a varied lot. Best is the Finnish singer Soile
Isokoski as a sympathetic, nuanced Donna Elvira. Carmelo Remigio
sounds uncomfortably breathy in some of Donna Anna's higher
passages. Patrizia Pace brings charm to the role of Zerlina, but
her voice tends to turn hard and metallic when it should be melting
and warm. (Cecilia Bartoli originally was to have sung the role.)
	   Tenor Uwe Heilmann does nicely with Don Ottavio's two arias,
while the great Finnish bass Matti Salminen makes you wish the
Commendatore's relatively small role were much bigger.
	   Most curious of all is the new ``Dutchman'' _ ``new'' only in
the sense that DG has just seen fit to release it, since it was
recorded in early 1991.
	   It offers the sorry spectacle of baritone Bernd Weikl attempting
a role he was never meant to sing. The game is up from his first
appearance, the great monologue ``Die Frist ist um,'' as climactic
high note after high note forces his voice to spread and wobble. He
does much better elsewhere, in his long duets with his beloved
Senta and with her father, Daland, but it's not enough to make a
Dutchman.
	   As Senta, soprano Cheryl Studer, back in the days before she
apparently fell victim to vocal problems, again makes you realize
what a magnificent singer she could be _ at least on disc. She
sings warmly, truly and with evident commitment, though it's true
she never touches the hysterical core of the role the way a Leonie
Rysanek did.
	   Bass Hans Sotin makes a hearty and resonant Daland, while
Placido Domingo shows off his Wagner style to good advantage in the
limited role of Senta's suitor, Erik.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They looked like ordinary men.
	   Himmler, Eichmann, Goebbels, Mengele. Nazis. And one more _ Kurt
Dussander (Ian McKellen), head of a concentration camp until Berlin
fell and he slipped away to the United States to age into benign
old Arthur Denker.
	   But Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) has found the face in the jar by
the door. The baseball-playing A student with a tepid suburban
life, inattentive parents and an obsession with Holocaust history
has determined that the senior citizen who lives a few blocks away
and rides the public bus is evil incarnate.
	   This is the setup for ``Apt Pupil,'' based on a novella by
Stephen King. It is a taut, low-key thriller of blackmail and
spiritual decay that is chilling in its almost documentary
depiction of the bad things that men do and the violence that can
be passed by osmosis across generations.
	   The best movies of King stories are adapted from works that
explore inner, rather than supernatural, horror _ movies like
``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption.''
	   ``Apt Pupil,'' from the same quartet of novellas, is a case
study in historical curiosity gone awry. From its opening moment, a
slow-paced montage of sundry Nazis and their atrocities, the movie
latches on and never lets go.
	   Todd confronts Denker with proof and demands stories in exchange
for silence. He wants front-row retellings of events his textbooks
have made vague _ of Jews taking hours to die, of weird
experiments, of cruelties worlds away from a suburban history text.
	   Dussander complies. ``They died in a mountain of themselves,''
he begins. And the stories flow.
	   But Dussander issues a warning. ``Boy, be careful,'' he
admonishes. ``You play with fire.'' He is right. Todd begins to
decay. He draws swastikas in his notebook and withdraws from life
to spend afternoons and evenings with the old man.
	   Todd grows more insolent as, it seems at first, Dussander grows
softer. But there is fire left in the old man, and when Todd forces
him to don a Nazi uniform purchased from a mail-order costume shop,
Dussander's latent hatred is unleashed. The scene is stunning;
hunched octogenarian man rises erect and becomes agent of death.
	   When Todd's grades slip, Dussander poses as his grandfather and
gets him out of trouble, but at a price: The blackmail reverses,
and Todd is forced to sit and obey as Dussander watches ``I Dream
of Jeannie'' reruns and laughs uproariously.
	   As the whole mess smolders, the growing fascination between boy
and old man takes more violent turns. A bum visits Dussander's
house; his unfortunate demise is chronicled in an opera of
malevolence that builds to a musical crescendo.
	   McKellen shouldn't be ruled out for an Academy Award nomination
for his portrayal of Dussander. He conveys both the arrogant
presumption of Nazism and the terror of a vulnerable old man. This
is a guy (``Richard III'') who knows how to do evil; his
time-released fury is the spinal cord of the movie.
	   Renfro plays Todd with adept restraint, shepherding him from
confused adolescent to canny manipulator _ and, perhaps, killer.
David Schwimmer is unexpectedly effective as a high-school guidance
counselor trying to help Todd.
	   Director Bryan Singer and his editors know their material, when
to quick-cut, when to zoom in on a moment. The use of music,
especially the haunting whimsy of ``Das ist Berlin,'' heightens the
terror and strengthens the link between suburbia and hell.
Death-camp flashbacks, used very sparingly, also work well.
	   The movie retains its high-energy intensity while remaining
subtle and focused, which is its strength. It falters only in its
last few minutes, when, despite some strong scenes, it loses its
way slightly.
	   ``Apt Pupil'' is ultimately about lonely people _ Dussander,
Todd, the bum _ and what loneliness does when it begins to eat
away.
	   ``Apt Pupil,'' a TriStar Pictures release, is produced by
Singer, Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy from a script by first-time
screenwriter Brandon Boyce.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Soldier'' envisions a future in which
newborn babies are literally snatched from their cradles and
trained to manhood as professional killers. These are the men who
will fight tomorrow's wars.
	   Todd (Kurt Russell) is one of those warriors. No fruit salad on
his chest; his service in 21st century campaigns, both terrestrial
and on distant planets, is tattooed on his right arm. His name and
serial number adorn his left cheek.
	   Even though he seems in fighting form, the veteran Todd faces
obsolescence. The military bosses have developed a new, fitter
breed of fighter who can kill with startling efficiency.
	   The commanding officer (Jason Isaacs) pits Todd and two comrades
against Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee), a fearsome member of the new
corps. No contest. The three old-timers are defeated and consigned
to a planet where Earth garbage is discarded.
	   ``Soldier'' represents the latest example of the motion picture
as combat video game. The film will doubtless be embraced by
juvenile practitioners of such amusements. Enjoyment by anyone
older is problematic.
	   Todd survives the dumping and he explores the planet, a dark,
forbidding place with huge piles of refuse. He encounters a colony
of Earth refugees _ peaceful, family folk, the kind that Todd has
never known. He is puzzled by their expressions of affection,
feelings that are stirring within himself.
	   The colonists accept Todd, then exile him when his killer
instincts emerge. When Earth forces attack the planet, they realize
his usefulness.
	   The battle is the centerpiece of ``Soldier.'' Todd takes on his
former comrades single-handedly in an orgy of slaughter and
explosion. Guess who wins?
	   Director Paul Anderson adeptly stages the combat scenes, much as
he did in ``Mortal Kombat.'' The treatment of the evil commander
played by Isaacs becomes ludicrous, prompting applause on his
demise.
	   Russell, who beefed up for his role, has become skilled with
this kind of apocalyptic tale (``Stargate,'' ``Escape from New
York''). Because of Todd's training, Russell has to remain
emotionless through most of the film, and that limits his
performance.
	   Lee (``Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story'') brings a fierce presence
to the implacable killer Caine 607. Connie Nielsen adds welcome
gentleness, though her relationship with Todd is limited to
significant glances.
	   The real heroes of ``Soldier'' are production designer David L.
Snyder and the builders of the garbage planet. It is an achievement
worthy of Academy Award consideration.
	   The Warner Bros. release was produced by Jerry Weintraub and
written by David Webb Peoples. Running time: 104 minutes.
