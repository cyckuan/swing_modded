<HEADLINE> Two Nev. Killers Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SNEDEKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Two lovers were sentenced to life in prison
Friday for killing wealthy gambling figure Ted Binion and stealing
at least $5 million worth of his silver fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tabish will be eligible for parole in 25 years and Sandra
Murphy will be eligible in 24 years under the sentence from
District Judge Joseph Bonaventure.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was convicted of first-degree murder for killing Binion
on Sept. 17, 1998. Binion's family owns the Horseshoe Club in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Murphy and Tabish forced Binion, 55, to ingest a
cocktail of heroin and the prescription drug Xanax, then suffocated
him. The defense claims Binion, who was involved with Murphy, died
of an accidental overdose or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The judge called Tabish, a Missoula, Mont., contractor, a con
man and berated Murphy, a former exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your bland indifference and your attitude shows little
respect,'' Bonaventure said. ''You chose to betray and kill your
lover and now you must live with the consequences. Maybe you will
finally awaken from this 'Alice In Wonderland' dream state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaventure called Murphy's involvement in the crime
''horrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You presented yourself as a caring, loving girlfriend only to
lure him (Binion) into a trap that ultimately cost him his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have promised to appeal. Tabish and Murphy
each reiterated their innocence to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't an evil plot,'' Tabish said. ''It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I shouldn't even be here,'' added Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   David Mattsen, who once tried to collect a $100,000 reward for
information in the Binion case, and Michael Milot face a Nov. 13
trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Binion's death, Mattsen, Milot and Tabish were
arrested while trying to dig up Binion's silver from an underground
vault in Pahrump, 55 miles west of Las Vegas.

Downers Grove, Ill., hugged her coach and pumped her fists after winning; her
dad, Ben Napolski, was in the audience. The silver medal went to Kang Cho-hyun
of South Korea, and Gao Jing of China took the bronze. Johnson's gold medal
triumph came just hours after the extravagant four-hour opening ceremony.

N. Korea: Goodwill Begets Goodwill

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea said Friday that it will welcome any U.S.
goodwill gestures, now that the two nations have resolved a diplomatic flap over
the recent body searches of North Korean delegates..S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright sent a message of regret to North Korea, explaining that the
search in a German airport by American Airlines security personnel did not
reflect U.S. policy. North Korea's No. 2 leader Kim Yong Nam and his delegation
returned to Pyongyang after the incident, skipping last week's Millennium
Summit. North Korean officials denounced the U.S. action but later said they
took note of the American apology.

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- In a surprise attack aimed at rescuing 19
foreign and Filipino hostages, military planes and helicopter gunships pounded
rebel camps in the southern Philippines Saturday. Thousands of troops and elite
police arrived on ships to join the fight in the hills of Jolo island. People
stood in the streets of Jolo's capital watching the attack in the distance. On
Friday night, the military ordered all boats to leave the capital's port to
clear the way for the arrival of military ships. Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said President Joseph Estrada would make a statement in several hours.

hundreds of convicted murderers from execution on Caribbean islands has prompted
some politicians to reconsider ties to British law. The 4-1 ruling does not stop
Caribbean governments from executing convicted murderers, but experts say it

<HEADLINE> Mich. Journalist Cleared of Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALDWIN, Mich. (AP) -- A former newspaper editor who was fired
after allegedly leaving obscenity-laced threats and ethnic slurs on
a black township official's answering machine has been acquitted of
a felony count of ethnic intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Roger ''Bucky'' VanderMeer, 55, was acquitted by a jury of 11
whites and one black on Tuesday, despite acknowledging that he had
left the messages on the answering machine of Yates Township
Trustee Donel Brown. A judge tossed out a misdemeanor count of
making a threatening telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   VanderMeer was fired as editor of the weekly Lake County Star on
June 14, one day before he was arraigned on the charges. He said he
had been angry at Brown because Brown had scolded VanderMeer's
wife, Pam, the township's clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got drunk that night because he'd had enough,'' said John
Beason, VanderMeer's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Beason told the jury that VanderMeer was so intoxicated that he
could not possibly have carried out his threats, left in a series
of four messages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I heard the recording was in court,''
VanderMeer said in Friday's editions of The Grand Rapids Press. ''I
can't believe I said that. I must have been out of my mind. I'm
married to a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he wonders what message the acquittal sent to this
ethnically diverse community 70 miles north of Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his message, he said he, as a white man, was one of the
people who is allowed to do anything he wants and I, as a black
man, can do nothing about it,'' Brown said. ''At this point, I
would say he was right. It appears to me that Bucky VanderMeer is
the one with the real power in Lake County.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Chief Faces Allegations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director John M. Deutch, who
previously admitted to mishandling sensitive data while heading the
CIA, is now being investigated by the Defense Department for
similar incidents, according to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department documents allege that Deutch used unsecured
computers at home and his America Online account to access
classified defense information in the early to mid-1990s when he
held high-ranking jobs at the Pentagon, the Post said in Saturday's
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find his conduct in this regard particularly egregious in
light of existing DOD policy directives addressing the safeguarding
of classified information,'' the Post quoted an internal Defense
Department memo as saying. ''This situation was exacerbated because
Dr. Deutch, while serving as the (deputy secretary of defense),
declined departmental requests that he allow security systems to be
installed in his residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence we obtained clearly establishes that Dr. Deutch
failed to follow even the most basic security precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, confirmed that the probe had
been widened and asked the Justice Department to look into it, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is now a pattern,'' Grassley was quoted as saying.
''Evidently, Mr. Deutch is a congenital downloader of classified
information.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Grassley did not return a message seeking
comment late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   When allegations first arose concerning Deutch's use of
computers while at the CIA, the Pentagon said it would try to
determine whether similar problems had occurred while Deutch was at
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Tim Taylor, said that as
recently as Thursday, officials had said no results of that
investigation were available. He had no other comment on the Post
report.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch served as defense undersecretary for acquisitions and
technology from April 1993 to March 1994, when he became deputy
defense secretary. He was appointed CIA director in 1995, and left
the CIA in December of the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Deutch retired from the CIA, agency personnel
discovered classified information stored on government computers at
Deutch's home. Deutch eventually admitted the security breach,
apologized and was stripped of his security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that computer hackers or spies obtained
classified information as a result of Deutch's actions, though the
Post quoted officials familiar with the case as saying that a
Justice Department official and retired prosecutor, Paul E. Coffey,
has recommended that charges be brought against Deutch.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Looking to reclaim its world dominance
in women's volleyball, Russia swept past Peru in the first round of
the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Godina had 14 kills and the Russians took less than an
hour to record the 25-17, 25-13, 25-20 victory Saturday (Friday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Russia, ranked No. 1 in the world, is regarded as having the
best chance to unseat Cuba, which won gold in 1992 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have four gold medals and three silvers in the
eight Olympics in which they have participated. Their only blemish
was a fourth-place showing in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eleventh-ranked Peru, which had to beat Argentina in five sets
to qualify for the Olympics out of the South American zone,
committed 23 errors to 18 for the Russians.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Transit Talks Near Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bargaining between transit workers and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority took on new urgency Friday
after unions promised a strike if there was no settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A strike deadline was originally set for 12:01 a.m. Friday but
the United Transportation Union, representing 4,300 drivers, agreed
to a 24-hour delay. Talks resumed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the deadline, MTA spokesman Barry Liden said
the two sides were closer but had not reached a pact. ''It's highly
unlikely that we'll know until the last minute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, UTU spokesman Goldy Norton said there would be no more
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by bus and rail drivers, mechanics and clerks would
affect about 450,000 people who rely on public transportation in a
1,400-square-mile area of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I live seven miles from the hotel and I have no car, not even
a bike,'' said Rosalio Mendiosa, 62, a bus rider who works as a
waiter at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Talks began in June when the MTA said it needed to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor representatives said the MTA has failed to offer an
improved schedule, proposing instead to increase the number of
lower-paid and part-time drivers. Currently, drivers earn an
average $50,000 annually, but can make an additional $20,000 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 7 percent of commuters in Los Angeles County use
public transit, but those who do often have few alternatives.
Sixty-eight percent have household incomes under $15,000 per year,
and nearly three-quarters of bus riders are black or Hispanic,
according to the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Riders were worried as the negotiations went on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I blame the MTA for making it a difficult situation,'' said
Shepard Petit, 55, a disabled student who rides the bus to college.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis had urged resolution of differences to avoid
shutting down the nation's second-largest bus system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Los Angeles should not be subjected to gridlock
and lack of public transit because of intransigence on both
sides,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> US Pledges 3.3M to Olympic Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. government will provide $3.3
million to fund anti-doping programs for the 2002 Winter Olympics
in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey and Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala made the announcement
Saturday (Friday night EDT) on the first full day of competition at
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''This funding reflects the governmentwide commitment of the
United States to protecting the integrity of sports and the safety
of athletes, young and old, amateur and elite,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and Frank Shorter, the former marathoner who will head
the new U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said they expect a test for human
growth hormone -- one of the most widely used performance-enhancers
in sports -- to be in place in time for the Salt Lake Games.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey confirmed that the World Anti-Doping Agency had
recorded 20 suspected positives among 2,045 out-of-competition
tests conducted around the world since April.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tests were for an ''array of illegal substances''
but declined to give further details. He said it was up to the
individual sports federations to deal with the cases according to
their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've already seen people withdrawing before the Olympics,''
McCaffrey said. ''The deterrent is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House official praised the International Olympic
Committee for instituting a test for the banned endurance-booster
EPO in Sydney, but said the system needs to be improved to detect
the use of the drug use going back more than a few days.
</P>
<P>
   '''It is clearly not where we need to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the Sydney Games mark a turning point in the
fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an era where victories are the product of hard work,
dedication and natural talent, not pharmacology,'' he said. ''We
owe it to the athletes to build on the successes of Sydney and
raise the bar still higher.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Tigers 6  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY LAGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Jimy Williams was determined to use just about
every player he could to keep the Boston Red Sox in the wild card
race.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's 7-6 win over the Detroit Tigers on Friday night,
Williams used 24 players and Phil Garner countered with 18, as the
teams tied an AL record by using 42 players.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Oakland had already won before the Red Sox-Tigers
marathon ended after nearly four hours, but Williams insisted that
he didn't notice the scores on the right-field wall in Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have time,'' Williams said. ''I was crossing out too
many names. You have to take care of your own. That's all you can
do because we're playing a good team over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg hit a tiebreaking single in the ninth inning to
keep Boston two games behind Cleveland in the AL wild card race.
The Indians won 11-1 at New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers saw a 6-4 lead in the eighth vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek and Midre Cummings both had pinch-hit RBI singles
to tie the game in the eighth. Troy O'Leary and Dante Bichette
started the inning by drawing walks.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra hit a leadoff single against Nelson Cruz (5-2)
in the ninth and went to third on Troy O'Leary's hit. One out
later, Hatteberg singled up the middle through a drawn-in infield
against Todd Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried to sneak a fastball past me and I was just able to
get it back up the middle,'' said Hatteberg after seeing
four-straight sliders.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth. Derek Lowe worked the
ninth for his 35th save in 40 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked like we had never seen a breaking ball when Beck was
out there,'' Detroit manager Phil Garner said. ''We scored runs and
we had the ballgame, but we just gave it right back to them with
those two walks (in the eighth). And on the flip side, we won't
take walks. You'd think that after all of these games our games
would start to realize the advantage of taking walks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield and Steve Sparks started in a battle of
knuckleballers, but neither factored in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield pitched five innings and gave up three runs -- two
earned -- five hits and three walks while striking out six. Sparks
gave up four Red Sox runs on six hits and four walks in 4 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra began Boston's three-run second with a ground-rule
double. He scored on Brian Daubach's single and Trot Nixon hit a
two-run single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit cut its deficit to 3-2 in the home half. With two outs,
Deivi Cruz struck out but reached first on a wild pitch and Damion
Easley singled. Brad Ausmus hit an RBI single and Easley, who
aggressively was advancing to third, came home on a throwing error
by center fielder Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers tied it in the third when Juan Encarnacion scored on
Bobby Higginson's double.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 4-3 lead in the fifth on O'Leary's single, which
scored Jose Offerman. Easley prevented a second run in the inning
when he knocked down Dante Bichette's single and threw out
Garciaparra, who was trying to score from second, at home.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit tied it in the home half. Deivi Cruz hit a leadoff
double and scored on Ausmus' groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez hit a tiebreaking homer in the Tigers seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hit the stew out of it,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   The 448-foot drive to left-center off Jeff Fassero was
Gonzalez's 21st of the season and his first to clear the fence at
Comerica Park since June 17. He had an inside-the-park home run on
Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Easley hit an RBI single with two outs in the seventh to give
Detroit a two-run cushion, which wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which is 8&AMP;frac12; games behind the Indians in the wild card
race, are all but mathematically eliminated with 16 games
remaining. ''We just want to put a kink in these guys' plans,'' Hal
Morris said. ''My feeling is, if we're not going to make the
playoffs I don't want any of the teams we're playing to make it
either.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last time two AL teams used 42 players was when Oakland
and Kansas City played on Sept. 20, 1975. ... The 3:49 game marked
the longest nine-inning game for the Tigers this season. ...
Garciaparra's 48 doubles rank second in the AL. ... Cruz's 46
doubles are the most for a Tigers player since 1950. ... Wakefield
and Sparks also pitched against each other on Aug. 28, 1999, but
neither got a decision during that outing, either.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rookie Kelly Dransfeldt hit an RBI
single with two outs that capped a two-run rally in the bottom of
the 10th inning and the Texas Rangers, after blowing an eight-run
lead, beat the Kansas City Royals 12-11 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 37th homer of the season and 398th of
his career as Texas took a 9-1 lead into the sixth inning. The
Rangers have never lost such a big lead in team history, and barely
avoided doing it this time.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt, who entered as a pinch-runner in the ninth and took
over at shortstop, threw out a runner at the plate in the 10th.
Still, the Royals took an 11-10 lead on Mark Sweeney's sacrifice
fly -- Sweeney drove in two runs, giving him a Royals record of 135.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto had an infield single with one out in the
Texas 10th against Jose Santiago (7-5). Palmeiro doubled and Texas
scored the tying run on Gabe Kapler's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   After Santiago intentionally walked Ricky Ledee, Dransfeldt
lined a single to left. Palmeiro scored from second as Carlos
Beltran's throw to the plate was high.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland (5-5) pitched the final two innings for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it at 10 in the ninth. Rusty Greer led off with a
pinch-hit double and was replaced by Dransfeldt, who slid into
third ahead of shortstop Luis Ordaz's throw on Lamb's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt scored the tying run when pinch-hitter Ruben Sierra
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals went ahead in the 10th after Gregg Zaun led off with
a single and moved up when third baseman Mike Lamb threw away
Carlos Febles' sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon, whose grand slam keyed a seven-run sixth inning
for the Royals, hit a grounder to Dransfeldt, who threw out Zaun at
the plate. Mark Quinn's sacrifice fly put Kansas City ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee hit a three-run homer in the first as Texas took a 5-0
lead. Palmeiro homered in the third, moving him into a tie with
Dale Murphy for 33rd all-time, one behind Al Kaline.
</P>
<P>
   Down 9-1, the Royals rallied within a run in the sixth. Damon's
slam came on the first pitch from reliever Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Damon went 3-for-4 to become the first Royals player to reach
200 hits since Kevin Seitzer in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored twice in the eighth for a 10-9 lead.
Pinch-hitter Dee Brown hit an RBI single and Sweeney had a
sacrifice fly. Sweeney passed Hal McRae's team record of 133 RBIs
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Joe Randa had four hits for Kansas City. ... Palmeiro
walked in the first and fourth to give him a career-high 98. He had
97 last season, his previous high. ... Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan
Ryan participated in an informal lunch with the Rangers' pitchers,
catchers and coaches Friday afternoon at The Ballpark in Arlington.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Attacks Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military planes and helicopter
gunships pounded rebel camps in the southern Philippines Saturday,
in a surprise attack aimed at rescuing 19 foreign and Filipino
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of troops and elite police arrived on ships to join
the fight in the hills of Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   People stood in the streets of Jolo's capital watching the
distant attack, marked the bombing sorties by air force planes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the military ordered all boats to leave the
capital's port to clear the way for the arrival of military ships.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally broadcast speech Saturday, President Joseph
Estrada said he ordered the pre-dawn attack, abandoning months of
negotiations, after the Abu Sayyaf rebels continued to seize new
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough is enough,'' he said. ''We cannot allow the kidnappers
to mock our laws and control our land.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to comment on operational matters,'' Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said. ''Our people are there and I don't
want to compromise the lives of our soldiers. It's very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada cut short a visit to the United States this past week to
deal with the worsening hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages is American Muslim Jeffrey Schilling, who was
abducted Aug. 28 when he visited one of the rebel camps. Rebels on
Wednesday threatened to behead Schilling if they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the hostages was not immediately clear, and
telephone links to the remote island were not working.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers streamed into the capital to flee the fighting in the
countryside, Mayor Rashdi Abubakar said. But residents there were
unable to escape because of a naval blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Bombers and helicopter gunships were seen loading bombs and
missiles and then taking off early Saturday from nearby Zamboanga
city.
</P>
<P>
   Support for an assault has grown since last Sunday, when an Abu
Sayyaf faction abducted three more people from a Malaysian diving
resort despite their earlier pledge not to seize more hostages
while negotiations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   That kidnapping came just one day after the rebels released four
Europeans -- the last foreigners from a group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from another Malaysian resort. The four gained their
release as a result of Libyan mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said he talked
late Friday night to Estrada, who told him ''the die has been
cast.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In my book, the kidnap of the three Malaysians is the needle
that broke the camel's back,'' Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has prepared for weeks for an assault on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mercado said the armed forces were ''like an arrow
drawn against a bow'' waiting for orders to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the arrow has been released,'' he said Saturday.
''We hope it can find its target.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation over satellite telephone Friday night, rebel
leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang told government negotiators that the
military had nearly surrounded their camp.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a rebel spokesman threatened they would attack
southern Philippine cities if there is a military assault.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Abu Sayyaf rebels had tentatively agreed to
release two French television journalists on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is against various rebel factions holding three
Malaysians, one Filipino captured in April, the two French
journalists, Schilling, and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists. The
rebels claim they are fighting for an independent Islamic state in
the impoverished southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that
the United States hoped the hostages could be released peacefully,
but that a decision on whether to use force was up to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages had been suspended
because of fighting among Abu Sayyaf factions over the division of
the ransom money. Negotiators say about $15 million in ransom has
been paid so far, about $10 million of it by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, rebels ambushed two government emissaries who came to
fetch four other hostages. The emissaries survived unhurt.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 10, Orioles 2  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- With Rickey Henderson leading the way, the
Seattle Mariners began an important road trip in unusual fashion:
with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson scored two runs to pass Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron and
move into second place on the career list as the Mariners beat the
Baltimore Orioles 10-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had started its previous 10 road trips this season with
a loss and had dropped seven straight in Baltimore. The Mariners
emphatically ended both streaks and, more importantly, maintained
their two-game lead in the AL West over Oakland, a 17-3 winner over
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came at the right time,'' Seattle manager Lou Piniella said
of the streak-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with Henderson, who opened the game with a triple
and scored on a grounder to put Seattle ahead to stay. Henderson
has scored 2,175 runs, one more than Ruth and Aaron and trailing
only career leader Ty Cobb (2,245).
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a great honor, a great achievement. When I was a kid I
always looked up to the guys that played the game, that did well,''
Henderson said. ''You try to pattern yourself after the great
players of this game and it so happens I fell in that class with
them. It's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also drew two walks, moving within two of tying Ruth
for first place on the career list (2,056).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good achievement but right now all the records and
stuff ... we don't really recognize them until we're through
playing the game,'' he said. ''You just try to go out there and do
your job and when it's all over with, let the records speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele, who almost signed with the Orioles during the
offseason, pitched seven strong innings for the Mariners. He
allowed two runs, seven hits and two walks to earn his second
straight win after losing four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (15-10) was prepared to sign as a free agent with the
Orioles over the winter, but Baltimore withdrew its four-year offer
after a physical revealed wear on his arm. Sele then signed with
Seattle rather than accept a modified offer from the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Sele smiled when asked if he derived any extra satisfaction from
beating the team that passed on his services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not really. These are big games for the Seattle Mariners, and
we've got to go out and try to win them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson scored in the first and third innings, and Seattle
made it 6-0 with a four-run fifth against Jose Mercedes (12-6), who
had won his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes was 9-1 with a 2.68 ERA in the second half, tied with
Boston's Pedro Martinez for most wins since the All-Star break. He
allowed six hits, five earned runs and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners jumped on Mercedes in the first inning, then added
an unearned run in the third courtesy of two errors by shortstop
Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two errors we made in the third inning added a lot of
pitches to Mercedes' count,'' Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said.
''He hit 93 going into the fifth, so his pitch count was up there
and he wasn't as sharp as we've seen him. He was missing down and
out of the strike zone. People have outings like that, and that's
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Javier delivered a sacrifice fly in the fifth before Joe
Oliver hit a three-run homer. It was his ninth homer of the season
and first since Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields hit a two-run double in the Orioles' half.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell hit an RBI single and Mike Cameron singled in two
runs in a four-run ninth against Buddy Groom.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Orioles issued 12 walks, only one of which turned into
a run. ... Seattle's Jay Buhner was ejected by home plate umpire
Marty Foster for arguing a third-strike call in the third inning.
... Mercedes was bidding to match his career high for successive
wins. ... It was the 1,100th career victory for Mariners' manager
Lou Piniella, including 621 with Seattle. ... Mora has 11 errors in
40 games with Baltimore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The favored Australians got a boost
from the hometown crowd and the lead on the first day of the team
three-day equestrian event Saturday, with the United States in
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Connor of The Plains, Va., led the U.S. riders with a
score of 44.4 on Giltedge, second best of the day but far behind
the Aussies' Andrew Hoy, who scored 30.6 on Darien Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Australia also got help from Phillip Dutton on House Doctor,
with a 46.0, the fourth-best score of the day, for a team total of
76.6.
</P>
<P>
   The second U.S. rider, Nina Fout of Middleburg, Va., scored 58.6
on 3 Magic Beans, giving the U.S. a team total of 103.0 and fourth
place in the early going behind Australia, Britain (94.6) and
France (98.6).
</P>
<P>
   Beans, as Fout calls him, was chosen for the team based on his
cross-country jumping prowess rather than his dressage ability and
actually exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are thrilled,'' U.S. coach Mark Phillips said. ''It's the
best test I've seen him do.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two riders on the 12 teams will ride their
dressage test on Sunday, followed by cross-country endurance on
Monday and stadium jumping on Tuesday. The event is scored by
penalty points so, like golf, low score wins.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Dot Richardson, who sparked the U.S.
softball team to a gold medal in Atlanta in 1996, will alternate
with Jennifer McFalls at second base over the team's first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ralph Raymond said he would play Richardson in the first
game, against Canada on Sunday (Saturday night EDT), and McFalls in
Game 2 of the preliminary round against Cuba on Monday (Sunday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we'll see after that,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's popularity grew at the Atlanta Games because of her
bubbly personality. An orthopedic surgeon, she hit the game-winning
homer in the gold-medal game against China, but she didn't make the
team for 2&AMP;frac12; years before she returned in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the team's Olympic preparation tour this summer, the
38-year-old Richardson batted .287, compared to .367 for McFalls.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Praises Relations  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- India's prime minister praised the progress in
U.S.-Indian relations during his visit this week, agreeing on more
cooperative programs, particularly economic deals, but still he
refused to budge on nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
   His meeting with President Clinton on Friday ''reflects the
considerable progress made between the two countries even within
six months,'' Atal Bihari Vajpayee said. In March, Clinton visited
India and laid the groundwork for the White House session.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister met with U.S. and Indian business leaders
Friday night and discussed recent and planned changes in Indian
regulations to privatize state utilities and other industries. He
was there to woo foreign investment to help India gain the
high-tech infrastructure it needs to expand its economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he expressed awe at U.S. economic power. ''The
continued U.S. prosperity is almost a miracle,'' he said, adding
that it has ''inspired India.''
</P>
<P>
   At a welcoming ceremony on the White House South Lawn, Vajpayee
said: ''This is a time of new hope and new opportunities in
Indo-American ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreements were announced on enhancing cooperation on such
issues as trade, investment, counterterrorism, counterdrug issues,
energy and the environment, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over nuclear issues remained, but as the day
unfolded a strong sense emerged of a new comfort level between the
two countries and a perception that problems can be dealt with in a
trusting atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The chief bilateral problem is India's refusal so far to sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has yet to take effect.
The United States has signed the nuclear pact, but the Senate has
refused to ratify it. The Clinton administration has tried to
persuade India to sign and ratify regardless of what this country
does, arguing that it would be in India's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   India has said it would not stand in the way of the treaty's
implementation, indicating that once major powers such as the
United States and China ratify it, India will be prepared to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, India has vowed to maintain a moratorium on
nuclear testing, which drew praise from Clinton at the welcoming
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, has been hobbled by a bad knee throughout his U.S.
visit. Departing from custom, he remained seated as Clinton spoke
to the gathering, and sat during the meeting with business leaders.
A planned midafternoon news conference was canceled because
Vajpayee complained of exhaustion, White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Join Human Rights Drive  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- She is one of the lesser-known heroes. But her
eyes and the set of her jaw reflect the strength and determination
that earned her a place with better-known fighters for human rights
-- people like Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and former
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Digna Ochoa of Mexico is a Roman Catholic nun and human rights
lawyer. She knows the torturer's touch and the threats against
family and friends. She is one of 51 people from 40 countries
portrayed in the book, ''Speak Truth to Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, with photographs by Pulitzer
Prize winner Eddie Adams, the book profiles human rights activists
to disprove what Cuomo calls ''the lament that there are no more
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and the wife of
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, she hopes the book will focus
renewed attention on people who risk their lives for others.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a mother of three young girls,'' she wrote, ''I deeply
wished to understand of there were steps I could take to encourage
my own daughters to develop similar attributes or if moral courage
was something certain people are born with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ochoa tells how her father, a union leader, was
kidnapped and tortured. Years later, when she was a human rights
activist she was held by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I felt in the flesh what my father had felt, what other
people had suffered,'' she said. For a month she was tortured with
electric shocks. Mineral water was pumped up her nose.
</P>
<P>
   She escaped, went into hiding and finally was able to resume her
human rights work. Cuomo went to Mexico to interview Ochoa last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just a few weeks after this interview,'' Cuomo wrote, ''two
men assaulted her in her apartment. They blindfolded her, tied her
up, interrogated her, threatened her and pressured her to sign a
statement. They cut her phone line and opened a gas valve in a
closed room. Her attackers left files stolen a few months
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa was defending two environmentalists accused of belonging
to guerrilla groups when the threats against her intensified. In
August, she came to Washington. ''But only temporarily,'' she said
in an interview. ''My commitment is to human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government, she said, has only complied in part with
requests from the Inter-American Court for Human Rights to
guarantee her security and that of her organization, a Catholic
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, the day she arrived in Washington, a Mexican court
sentenced her clients to six and 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and Mexico's Human Rights Center say
police brutally tortured them in efforts to get confessions.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know how long she would stay in the United
States, which she has visited before. A new government, Mexico's
first takeover by an opposition party in 70 years, will be sworn in
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can only hope,'' Ochoa said. ''There has to be a change, at
least a change in personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people have heard of Juliana Dogbadzi of Ghana, also
interviewed by Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was 7 years old,'' she said, ''my parents took me from
our home and sent me to a shrine where I was a slave to a fetish
priest for 17 years ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived and worked in the priest's fields and kept the
compound clean. While doing so I was raped repeatedly by the priest
on torn mats on the cold floor of windowless huts ...,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that in 1997 approximately 5,000 girls and young
women were kept in 345 shrines in southeast Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Dogbadzi escaped on her fourth attempt after a man from an
organization called International Needs-Ghana came to the shrine
and spoke to the priest. She reached the organization's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that I have escaped,'' she said, ''I help to diminish the
women's fears by telling them my story ... I try to help the
priests to understand the pain that the women have endured.''

<HEADLINE> Aussies Top Kazakstan in Water Polo  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYDE, Australia (AP) -- There's no crying in water polo. Except
for this match, an Olympic first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never get emotional, I didn't think I would,'' said
Australia's Bridgette Gusterson. ''I never cry before a game. I did
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusterson scored three goals as Australia defeated Kazakstan 9-2
Saturday (Friday EDT) to open the first Olympic women's water polo
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me it was an absolute experience,'' said Australia's
Debbie Watson, who is 35 and unretired to take part in history. ''I
feel very lucky to have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, one of the favorites in the six-team tournament, got
two first-half goals from Gusterson. Yvette Higgins added two for
Australia, which should get a tougher game from Russia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the game was as much a celebration for Australia, serving as
host to the first women's tournament in a sport that that has been
men-only at the Olympics since its debut in Paris a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams stepped into the pool while a Shania Twain recording
said, ''Let's go girls'' and fans clapped along.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't sure there would be anybody here,'' said Higgins, at
22, one of the team's youngest members.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was she wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 4,000 people at the Ryde Aquatics Leisure
Center. About 50 of them wore green and yellow frizzy wigs with
shirts saying ''Giddy Up, Aussies,'' on the front and ''Australian
Women's Water Polo Olympic Cheer Squad,'' on the back. They broke
into Aussie chants and sang ''Waltzing Matilda'' as their team took
control.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the crowd stood and cheered. Players from both
teams waved back.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan led 1-0 on Olga Lechshuk's goal only 45 seconds into
the game. That would be one of Kazakstan's few highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started very strong in the first quarter, which we knew we
had to against Australia,'' said Rezeda Aleyeva of Kazakstan.
''Once we found the first goal, we knew we had to keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia wouldn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins tied the game four minutes later and Gusterson put
Australia ahead for good on a penalty shot with 1:53 left in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan had chances to get back in it. But goalkeeper Danielle
Woodhouse, a second-half replacement for Liz Weekes, made several
close-in stops to keep Kazakstan off the board during the final two
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Watson embraced teammates at the final horn. She remembered how
she was certain, after being told other sports would have to
downsize to get her sport in, that she'd never compete beneath the
Olympic rings. ''We heard maybe in '84 or '88, then '92 and '96,''
she said. ''I didn't think it would happen for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When she learned in 1998 that her homeland would be the host,
she dragged herself back into a sport she left about 2&AMP;frac12; years
earlier and earned a spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good that we could do this,'' said Gusterson, the team
captain, hugging her friend Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Australia coach Istvan Gorgenyi said his team's slow opening
probably stemmed from the emotions. ''It made things very
nervous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was glad when his team got rolling. ''It's good they
could play in this game,'' Gorgenyi said. ''Now we can concentrate
on tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Camps To Meet on Debates  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials from Al Gore and George W. Bush's
presidential campaigns are meeting to complete a draft deal that
sources close to the negotiations say features three debates -- one
traditional two-lectern event, one town hall, and one ''talk show''
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Democrat Gore were willing to accept the three-format
plan, which the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates
proposed in January. Republican Bush had earlier balked at both the
suggested formats and the commission's three-debate schedule, but
bowed to the plan after coming under criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns, after meeting 7&AMP;frac12; hours on Friday, broke to
review the proposal before meeting again Saturday to work out
details and sign off on the formats, said one source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Details still under discussion include the amount of time for
questions, responses, counter responses and whether these times
should vary based on format, this source said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign official, also demanding anonymity, confirmed
the two sides had tentatively agreed on the three-format plan and
were waiting to see the details in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign would comment on details of the debate
negotiations, but both sides sounded optimistic the deal would be
done soon.
</P>
<P>
   There was ''substantial progress made toward an agreement,''
Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said through a spokeswoman. Gore
campaign chairman William Daley also was in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Quinn, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said the Gore campaign went into the talks ''ready to
take the commission mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had pushed for more informal debate formats and said nearly
two weeks ago said he would accept only one commission debate and
two networks debates -- one on NBC and another on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.'' Gore rejected Bush's idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave in on Thursday and agree to the three commission
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the Republican co-chairman of the debate
commission, said after Friday's session, ''Different formats have
different dynamics to go along with it, and that is what we are
trying to iron out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, his Democratic counterpart, said, ''Ninety-five
percent of the issues are agreed upon. ... Great strides were
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential debates are to be held Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct.
11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis, with each
lasting 90 minutes starting at 9 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-minute debate between the vice presidential candidates,
Democrat Joseph Lieberman and Republican Dick Cheney, will go take
place Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky. All the debates are on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan and Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader, both registering single digits in national polls, most
likely will not meet the commission's threshold of 15 percent in
media polls for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan lost a legal battle to enter the debates in a ruling
released Friday. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Roberts rejected
Buchanan's claim against the Federal Election Commission for
dismissing his complaint against the debate commission concerning
the 15 percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's agreement to have the debates under the commission's
sponsorship ended a standoff lasting several weeks in which Bush
held out for doing only one debate sponsored by the commission and
less-formal matchups in other venues.

<HEADLINE> Fall Won't Fix Texas Drought Damage  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dried-up ponds and fast-growing fires. Overworked
lawn sprinklers and scorched crops. Legions of grasshoppers and
warped house foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Products of the relentless drought and heat wave are multiplying
in Texas, and the arrival of fall might not change things much.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter days, longer nights and cooler temperatures will come,
forecasters say, but the bone-dry conditions of this scorching
summer aren't likely to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving into fall. And it won't be as warm as it was in
the summer,'' said Skip Ely, a National Weather Service
meteorologist. ''But it is not at all clear that we're going to be
moving into wetter weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought has caused about $595 million in crop losses,
according to the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, and 178
counties have been declared federal agricultural disaster areas.
The Extension Service attributes $192 million in crop losses to
grasshoppers, plant-eating pests that have thrived in this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grasshoppers love this heat,'' said Beverly Boyd, spokeswoman
for the state's agriculture department.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas was rainless for the 77th day Friday, far surpassing
the previous no-rain record of 59 days originally set in 1934 and
matched in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 268 public water systems in 82 counties statewide
have implemented some sort of water restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wildfire threat, bans on outdoor burning remain
in effect for 186 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our big concern right now is that the weather is cooler,
humidity is up and some people want to burn off brush or trash, or
are outside camping or using four-wheelers,'' Texas Forest Service
spokeswoman Traci Bowen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains last week did stop fires in southeast Texas, but
Bowen said the northeastern quadrant of the state remains tinder
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for Sept. 22, the official start of fall, call for
moderate temperatures for north Texas -- highs in the 80s and lows
in the 70s -- and no precipitation, likely continuing the rainless
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the state receives a good soaking, ground temperatures
will remain high and offset fall's cooler air, Ely said. But even
moderate temperatures coupled with shorter days will help
drought-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evaporation rates will start going down. And after the
first freeze a lot of vegetation starts going dormant. The fall and
winter water demand will be much lower,'' Ely said.

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military planes and helicopter gunships
pounded rebel camps in the southern Philippines Saturday, in a surprise attack
aimed at rescuing 19 foreign and Filipino hostages. Thousands of troops and
elite police arrived on ships to join the fight in the hills of Jolo island.
People stood in the streets of Jolo's capital watching the distant attack,
marked the bombing sorties by air force planes. On Friday night, the military
ordered all boats to leave the capital's port to clear the way for the arrival
of military ships. Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said President Joseph

   MIAMI (AP) -- A hurricane warning was posted in Bermuda late Friday as
Hurricane Florence regained strength and speed as it turned away from the U.S.
mainland and moved toward the Atlantic island. At the same time, a storm system
in the Gulf of Mexico grew into Tropical Storm Gordon, prompting a hurricane
watch for Florida's west coast from Bonita Beach to the Suwanee River. That
storm, packing top winds of 60 mph, could become a hurricane by Saturday night,
according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It dumped
heavy rain Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and caused street flooding in

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Black Support  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A clearly relaxed Al Gore spent a day pitching
his message to blacks, a group of potential voters who already
overwhelmingly back him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the vice president and Democratic nominee spoke to
an overflow crowd of black appointees of the Clinton
administration. ''In a lot of previous administrations, they
wouldn't have needed a room this big to hold an event like this,
you know what I'm saying?'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience erupted into cheers of ''Go Al! Go Al!'' as the
vice president recited a list of Clinton minority appointees and
ended it by saying ''53 judges and not a Clarence Thomas among
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I hear the other side say affirmative action is
unnecessary -- please give me a break,'' Gore said. ''We need
affirmative action for the good of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to work for hate crimes legislation and
increased federal efforts to end racial profiling by law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Gore spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of students
at Washington's historically black Howard University.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still a lower and lower participation in our
democracy. Why is that?'' Gore asked, addressing some 1,600
students. ''Disillusionment. ... Cynicism, disaffection, civic
lethargy are the enemies of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotilya Brown, a Howard freshman who turns 18 on Sunday, has
already registered to vote, and plans to cast her first ballot ever
for the vice president. ''Not even an earthquake could keep me
away'' from the voting booth, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With solid black support, the presidential nominee's focus is
boosting turnout among a group that has not gone to the polls as
often as whites. About half the black population has voted in
recent elections, or 5 percent to 10 percent less than whites,
according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was spending Friday and Saturday at a trio of events to
court blacks and motivate turnout: the Howard University rally, the
dinner honoring the Clinton administration's black appointees, and
a Saturday speech at a Congressional Black Caucus dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Some Howard audience members expressed skepticism of Gore's
motives at the event, where he also promised to improve schools and
make higher education more accessible, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a political strategy to come to a black
university with a young minority vote,'' said Saleemah Speller, a
junior from New York. Speller said she would still vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that Gore, in a tight race against
Republican nominee George W. Bush, will have to work to get out the
vote, tapping the Democratic base in the unions and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to work it and work it hard, not just on special
occasions,'' said Roger Wilkins, who teaches presidential politics
at George Mason University in suburban Virginia. Black voters do
''not get tuned in and turned up until October. Those are the
people you have to motivate.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, senior policy analyst with the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said, Gore ''can
count on getting 90 percent of the black vote, but in the key
states he has to make sure the black turnout is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Such states include New Jersey, Missouri, Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Gore's support from blacks dipped to 64 percent,
according to a Pew Research Center poll. By September, that leapt
to 80 percent -- nearing the 84 percent President Clinton got when
he was re-elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gets about 7 percent black support in Pew polls. At the
NAACP annual conference in July, the Texas governor got a tepid
welcome, though he promised to work to improve relations between
the Republican Party and blacks.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Serb Leader In Self-Imposed Exile  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDVA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Shuffling around his summer apartment
in red Reebok sneakers, the opposition firebrand once known as the
czar of street protests looks haggard, glancing uneasily at the
bullet holes sprayed across his living room wall.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic says the June assassination attempt is the reason
that with the country heading toward a Sept. 24 presidential vote
that could be the climax of years of struggle against his nemesis,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, he's sitting by the beach in
Montenegro, leaving a colorless lieutenant to carry his party's
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' he says bitterly, looking around his apartment, ''is
how I live here.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past decade, Draskovic was the only figure in
Serbia with acknowledged rhetorical skills and a significant
following of common citizens who would spill onto the streets at
his command. And until this election season, he was the only
serious threat to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That's all changed, though, in the aftermath of two
assassination attempts, both of which Draskovic blames on
Milosevic's secret service. Now he appears certain that Milosevic
will flat-out steal the election since opposition candidates are
providing a strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Milosevic) has turned the country into a concentration
camp where gangland-style killings, harassment and intimidation
continue to be the way of governing,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is facing his strongest challenge in a decade in power
from an unexpected candidate, law professor Vojislav Kostunica. His
unexpected popularity appears to have caught the Yugoslav strongman
off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic apparently bet the opposition would pick Draskovic, a
mercurial figure who inspires as much anger as he does devotion.
But after the attacks, Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement party
refused to let him return to Serbia from his self-imposed exile in
Yugoslavia's smaller, republic, Montenegro, suggesting he would be
a target if he returned.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is understandable: In October last year, Draskovic
survived a road accident caused by a swerving truck in which four
ranking members of his party, including his brother-in-law, were
killed. Draskovic said the truck driver -- who escaped the scene of
the crash -- worked for Milosevic's secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, just after Milosevic shut down the country's
largest independent television station, rounded up opponents and
began roughing up dissidents, two men climbed up Draskovic's
balcony and fired into his apartment, grazing his head and leaving
their mark on his walls.
</P>
<P>
   Without its star, Draskovic's party has been dwarfed by the
Milosevic machine and the unexpected Kostunica fanfare. It
nominated Belgrade's Mayor Vojislav Mihailovic as its candidate and
polls show him trailing both Milosevic and Kostunica by a wide
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has disintegrated in the past 10 years, resulting in
four wars and hundreds of thousands of deaths. During this time,
Draskovic lost repeatedly in elections until the local vote in 1996
when the opposition won all major Serb towns, including the
capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, the traditionally divided Serbian opposition was
unable to work together to force Milosevic's ouster. Draskovic now
believes that everyone is against him and his party.
</P>
<P>
   As the opposition fizzled, he switched sides, joining Milosevic
in January 1999 -- just before the 78-day NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
to force the president's forces out of the southern province of
Kosovo. He briefly served as a deputy prime minister, but was fired
after publicly criticizing Milosevic's handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Draskovic expresses pessimism about the upcoming elections,
predicting major election fraud. The polls, he says, overestimate
Kostunica's support.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts a grim future for the country if Kostunica loses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country will be isolated even more, Kosovo will be lost,
they will expel Yugoslavia from the U.N., and Milosevic will turn
the country into an even worse concentration camp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Draskovic is ready to return to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where else could I go,'' he said, ''but back to the
concentration camp?''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Gore Has Lead in 3 Key States  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Al Gore has gained the upper hand over
George W. Bush in Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania, according to
new polls in several key industrial states critical to the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth state, Ohio, the two candidates were roughly even,
with Republican Bush at 43 percent and Democrat Gore with 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was up by 8 points in Michigan, 45-37; ahead by 15 points
in Illinois, 48-33; and had an 18-point bulge in Pennsylvania,
51-33, according to the polls conducted by EPIC/MRA of Lansing and
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent rise in state and national polls was not
particularly worrisome to Michigan Gov. John Engler, an adviser to
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan to refocus on his message of improving education and
cutting taxes could help the Texas governor regain some of the
momentum he has lost in recent weeks, Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll ''just reflects the fact that the message in the
last couple weeks has been about debates and peripheral issues and
not the central themes of the campaign,'' Engler said. ''I don't
think the debate about the debates has been helpful to George
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were cautious about making too much of the polls
showing a lead for Gore in the crucial Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   James Blanchard, a co-chairman of Gore's Michigan campaign and a
former governor, said he still expects a tight race as the
candidates woo the state's swing voters. But he likes Gore's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues are working for Democrats,'' Blanchard said,
referring to Gore's focus on education, health care, Social
Security and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were taken Sept. 6-13 with an error margin of 4
percentage points in Michigan's poll of 600 likely voters. In
Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania, 400 likely voters were polled in
each state, with error margins of 5 percentage points in each.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sarpolus of EPIC/MRA, said the poll reflects a loss of
confidence in Bush by Republican voters. Gore is starting to make
inroads into some areas where Bush has been stronger, such as among
men and those with moral concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, Bush led Gore in Michigan by about the same
margin he now trails -- 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The margin in Pennsylvania, similar to another poll taken after
the Democratic last month convention, is larger than the campaigns
have seen in their internal polling. But it still suggests Bush has
plenty of work to do in states that will help decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers suggest Gore is getting the momentum these days,
said Mike Young, a political scientist at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   ''This underscores the clear direction in the momentum of the
campaign that Gore has established in the last couple of weeks,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young suggested Bush's troubles may be related to a series of
bumps in the road for the campaign, such as the Texas governor's
vulgar remark, caught on an open mike, about a reporter and the
furor over a Republican ad that flashed the word ''RATS'' on the
screen for a split second.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania pollster G. Terry Madonna of Millersville
University said he expected Gore's lead is actually in the high
single digits, not 18 points. The race in Illinois has been
relatively close in other recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been solidifying his base and getting better support
from men at the same time that Bush has seen erosion in his base,
polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP strategists in the key states say Bush has let Gore
skate by relatively unscathed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, frankly, that George Bush is not punching hard
enough,'' said Tom Roeser, a former corporate lobbyist in Illinois
and now a conservative activist. ''I think Bush can still win,'' he
said. ''But he's got to fight.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Artist's Home Opens  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLIERS-LE-BACLE, France (AP) -- Leonard Foujita's spartan home
in this tiny village south of Paris is so well preserved, you'd
think the Japanese artist had simply stepped away for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked picture frames are stacked against the wall, an old
fashioned Singer sewing machine stands ready, with wads of fabric
and patterns nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Paint brushes, boxes of chalk, glass jars labeled in Japanese,
religious icons and unfinished frescoes adorn the bare walls of the
studio overlooking the lush Chevreuse Valley that inspired so many
20th-century artists, Fernand Leger and Jean Cocteau among them.
</P>
<P>
   But it has taken years of painstaking research to recreate
Foujita's ordered chaos, which opens to the public for the first
time this weekend as part of France's annual National Heritage
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Widely regarded as one of the greatest Japanese artists of the
century, the bespectacled, mustachioed Foujita lived in this
simple, stone farmhouse from 1960 to his death in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest challenge in reconstituting Foujita's unique work
environment was evoking the density, the apparent disorder that he
thrived on, while making it look as though nothing was touched,''
said museum curator Frederic Beauclair, who worked from archives
and photos.
</P>
<P>
   Foujita's 90-year-old widow, Kimiyo, who donated the home to
regional officials in 1991, was on hand for Thursday's unveiling in
the presence of Japanese Ambassador Kazuo Ogoura.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping and in a wheelchair, Kimiyo Foujita hid her face, and
refused to look around. She had lived alone in the house until
1991.
</P>
<P>
   She ran her hand over a Japanese screen separating the living
room and bedroom, breaking into tears upon seeing her husband's
collection of antique china dolls on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   She declined offers to be carried upstairs to the studio -- the
artist's sacred space that was off limits to her during her
husband's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The farmhouse -- in ruins when Foujita bought it -- was where he
designed one of his most famous works, the chapel at Notre
Dame-de-la-Paix in Reims.
</P>
<P>
   ''He designed it for Villiers, but for some reason, the village
priest didn't want it,'' Beauclair said. Foujita was buried in
Reims, but his remains later were transferred to Villiers' village
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Foujita Leonard Tsuguharu -- his full name -- was born in Tokyo in
1886, the son of a Japanese general. He became obsessed with
western art techniques at an early age, and arrived in France in
1913 where he lived a bohemian life in the bustling Montparnasse
quarter, frequenting the likes of Picasso and Douanier Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   So enthralled was he with his new life that he wrote a letter to
his father saying, ''Consider me dead until I become famous.'' He
was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by various 19th and 20th century schools, Foujita went on
to develop a unique style blending East and West. Among his
favorite subjects were cats, graceful women in repose and nudes.
</P>
<P>
   On display in the studio is ''Trois Femmes,'' one of Foujita's
most famous paintings on silk, executed in 1930 and depicting three
scantily clad prostitutes from the leading Parisian brothel of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Foujita returned to Japan during World War II and was sent to
Indochina as Japan's cultural attache. He later was drafted into
the army where he was ordered to portray the nation's feats on
paper and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, his style changed, his palette of colors
darkening as he began an intense spiritual quest. He converted to
Roman Catholicism in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Foujita finally found peace in Villiers-le Bacle, about 20 miles
south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spoke some French and had a happy personality,'' said
Pierre Druillennec, 79, who lived next door for many years. ''He
was definitely a bon vivant.''

<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Military authorities on Saturday blocked
the road to the headquarters of the democratic opposition led by
Aung San Suu Kyi, two days after announcing the easing of tough
restrictions against the party, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic police and plainclothes intelligence officers manned
road blocks marked by 'no entry' signs on the approaches to the
two-story National League for Democracy office in downtown Yangon,
where the party planned to hold a meeting Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if the meeting would be allowed to
go ahead. It commemorates the second anniversary of the party's
formation of a proxy parliament as a direct challenge to the
military government. The proxy parliament was formed after the
government refused to honor the party's 1990 general election
victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government announced it was lifting
restrictions against Suu Kyi and eight other National League for
Democracy leaders who were confined to their homes for two weeks
after Suu Kyi tried to travel outside Yangon for party work.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, party leaders emerged from their homes and reopened
the party headquarters, which were raided by authorities on Sept.
2. The government justified its actions by saying it was
investigating the movement's alleged links to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   At the first anniversary of the proxy parliament, the road to
the party headquarters was also cordoned off and diplomats and
reporters were blocked from attending, but National League for
Democracy leaders and some members were allowed in and it went
ahead.

<HEADLINE> Suharto's Son Ordered Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's reformist president raised
the stakes Friday in his fight against terrorism, ordering the
arrest of ex-dictator Suharto's youngest son two days after a
deadly stock exchange explosion many blame on supporters of the
disgraced former leader.
</P>
<P>
   The police were hesitant to carry out the order against one of
Indonesia's richest men, saying they needed more evidence, but a
confident Tommy Suharto on Saturday met with police on his own
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here on my own initiative rather than being chased here
by the police,'' Tommy, 38, said when he arrived at Jakarta police
headquarters with a bodyguard but no lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid initially admitted that he lacked
ironclad evidence against Tommy Suharto and another suspect, Habib
Alwi al Baaqil, who heads a pro-Suharto Muslim group.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we have reasons to arrest them to prevent another bombing
like the one that happened at the Jakarta Stock Exchange,'' Wahid
said. Later, he told reporters he had ''enough evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people were killed in Wednesday's car bombing, which set
off a huge fire in a garage beneath the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Many blame Suharto's supporters for the bombing as well as a
string of other unsolved blasts and accuse them of trying to derail
the prosecution of the ex-president on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's arrest order, a bold challenge to Indonesia's once all
powerful former first family, was thrown into doubt by senior
police officers within a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we are going to arrest anyone, we need enough
evidence,'' said national police spokesman Brig. Gen. Dadang
Garnida. Other senior officers said both men would be questioned in
the coming days but not detained.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night police said they did not know Tommy Suharto's
whereabouts. His lawyer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Al Baaqil told police he was innocent and threatened to sue
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, a Muslim cleric, has a reputation of unpredictability.
Some of his previous threats against opponents have come to
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bombings in the capital along with ethnic and
separatist bloodshed elsewhere in the Indonesian archipelago have
weakened his ability to govern the world's fourth most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Wahid has accused opponents of trying to destabilize
his year-old government, Indonesia's most democratic in more than
four decades, through a campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
   His international image was dented last week when Indonesian
security forces failed to stop a mob from killing three U.N. aid
workers in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Police say bombs used in Wednesday's stock exchange blast and
other attacks contained similar military-style explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the blasts coincided with major developments in a
corruption investigation and court case against Suharto, who is
accused of stealing at least $583 million in government money to
bankroll businesses controlled by his cronies and children,
including Tommy. Suharto has refused to attend his trial on the
grounds of failing health.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Wahid said he feared more bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to a telephone tap, there are several other places
that will be bombed and I have told the authorities to take strict
action,'' he said. ''We cannot tolerate this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, 38, is also known by his traditional name, Hutomo Mandala
Putra. Like his five brothers and sisters, he became a
multimillionaire during his father's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Until he married a Javanese princess in 1997, Tommy cultivated a
playboy image with a love of fast, expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   He has been implicated in shady commercial dealings, including a
failed national car project that cost Indonesia billions of dollars
in tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1999, Tommy was acquitted of charges relating to a
real estate scam.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, a bomb rocked the attorney general's office soon
after he was interrogated about his father's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a rifle bullet was fired through a window of
Indonesia's parliament as lawmakers questioned him over allegations
that he embezzled $400 million from spice farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Since his father was forced to quit amid riots and protests in
1998, some of Tommy's businesses have turned sour. However, he is
still believed to have a fortune.

<HEADLINE> Russia Official Urges Raising Kursk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior Russian government official insisted
Friday that the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk must be raised to
quell public fears of a future nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told the lower house of
parliament that the sub and its reactors could remain on the seabed
for ''decades'' without posing any radiation risks, but must be
recovered to allay public nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will remain a problem for Russia since it lies in a busy
fishing area,'' Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is necessary to raise and inspect the submarine
to draw a final conclusion about what caused the disaster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk sank in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, killing all 118
crewmen aboard. Klebanov, who heads the commission investigating
the catastrophe, has said experts were still considering three
possible versions of the disaster -- a collision with a World War II
mine, a collision with an ''underwater object,'' and internal
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that American subs were shadowing the
Russian naval exercise in the Barents Sea, but denied a collision
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov reaffirmed that next month divers will cut holes in the
sub's hull to remove the bodies of the 118 seamen who died in the
disaster.

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Stephane Matteau scored 3:09 into
overtime Friday night as the San Jose Sharks won their preseason
opener 4-3 over the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Matteau redirected a shot by Greg Andrusak from just inside the
blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Landon Wilson scored with 1:09 remaining in regulation
to send the match into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Montgomery had two goals for the Sharks before a crowd of
4,289 in the 19,596-seat New Arena, where the Golden State Warriors
also play.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (0-2-0) finally scored after 87 minutes of exhibition
hockey when Jean-Guy Trudel found the net. Ryan Lauzon scored the
Coyote's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson knotted the score after Wyatt Smith won the puck from
behind the net and tossed it into a crowd at the top of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's first goal came at 2:37 of the first period. His
second, a slap shot from the top of the face-off circle, beat the
buzzer at the end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Stuart added a power-play goal in the opening minutes of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (1-0-0) outshot the Coyotes 35 to 19.

<HEADLINE> Women's Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Margo Dydek and Poland made an
impressive Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
   Dydek, the 7-foot-2 center for the WNBA's Utah Starzz, scored 20
points and grabbed 12 rebounds as Poland beat New Zealand 75-52
Saturday (Friday night EDT) in the women's Olympic basketball debut
for both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, with Dydek dominating inside, took a 25-3 lead and was
up 43-23 at halftime, holding New Zealand to 19 percent shooting (5
for 26).
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand opened the second half with a 10-0 run to get within
10 points but Dydek and Joanna Cuprys each had six points in a 14-0
run that put Poland back in control.
</P>
<P>
   Cuprys, who scored all but one of her 16 points in the second
half, had two of her three 3-pointers in the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very important for us to play well in our Olympic
debut. You can't compare the Olympics to anything,'' Poland coach
Tomasz Herkt said. ''The first 10 minutes determined the final
result but it got dangerous in the first part of the second half,
but we were able to maintain the lead with 3-point shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Ofsoski had 13 points to lead New Zealand, which shot just
26 percent from the field (15 for 58), a lot of the misses because
of Dydek's presence inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing against a 7-foot woman is not what you come across
every day,'' said 6-2 New Zealand center Gina Farmer, who had eight
points on 3-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Brazil 76, Slovakia 60
</P>
<P>
   Janeth Arcain scored 24 points to lead Brazil, the 1996 silver
medalists. Arcain, who plays for the WNBA's Houston Comets, capped
the game with her only 3-pointer, a 60-foot heave at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   She had 15 points in the first half as Brazil took a 35-28 lead.
Marta Sobral scored six of her eight points in a 13-3 run that gave
Brazil a 55-37 lead with 9:15 to play. Slovakia, which was making
its debut in women's Olympic basketball, got within 65-56 with 2:22
left, but Arcain, who also had seven points and five assists, had
seven points in Brazil's closing run.
</P>
<P>
   Alessandra Olivera added 12 points for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Luptakova had 22 points for Slovakia, while Martina
Godalyova added 19.
</P>
<P>
France 75, Senegal 39
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Antibe scored 13 points to lead France to the easy win in
another matchup of countries making their debut in women's Olympic
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   France used a speed advantage to take a 42-21 lead, taking 20
more free throws in the first half than Senegal, which was called
for 25 fouls in the game -- 16 more than France -- and committed 28
turnovers, 22 more than France. France scored 32 points off Senegal
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Astou Ndiaye led Senegal with 11 points and seven rebounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Barbara Jelic's powerful performance
was just enough for Croatia, which made its Olympic debut by
struggling past lightly regarded Australia in the first round of
women's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Jelic, one of the world's most dominant players, slammed 23
kills to lead the Croatians to the 25-21, 22-25, 25-14, 25-16
victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians wouldn't even be in the tournament if they
weren't playing host to it. But with a lively crowd chanting
''Aussie Aussie Aussie! Oi oi oi!'' at the downtown Sydney
Entertainment Center, they made a match of it.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Jelic, whose father Ivica Jelic is the Croatian
coach, was virtually unstoppable but her teammates couldn't get her
the ball on the outside often enough. After one of her leaping
spikes tied the second game at 20-all, the Aussies ran off four
straight points.
</P>
<P>
   Christie Mokotupu drove a well-placed ball deep to the
Croatians' left side to win the game and tie the match 1-all.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia led just 9-8 in the third game but pulled away for the
easy victory. Australia never led in the deciding game, getting
within 12-11 before the Croatians surged again.
</P>
<P>
   Australian libero Elizabeth Brett took the brunt of Jelic's
blows in the final game, getting knocked backward onto the floor by
one smash.
</P>
<P>
   Tamsin Barnett had nine kills to lead Australia, and Mokotupu
had six of her team's 11 blocks.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Rockies 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark Grudzielanek homered with two outs in
the 10th inning Friday night to lift the Los Angeles Dodgers to a
4-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who had grounded out his four previous times up,
drove a 2-1 pitch from Mike DeJean (4-4) into the left-field
pavilion for his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (10-3) pitched a perfect 10th inning for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Ending an 0-for-11 slump, the Rockies' Todd Helton hit a two-run
homer -- the 100th of his career -- in the sixth off Darren Dreifort.
Helton went 1-for-5, lowering his major league-leading average by a
point to .374.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers down 3-1, Alex Cora drew them even with a
two-run double in the seventh, his second run-scoring double of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Kevin Jarvis allowed two-out walks to Todd Hundley
and Adrian Beltre before Cora doubled down the right-field line to
tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter Pedro Astacio held the Dodgers hitless through
the first three innings, allowing just one baserunner on a walk
before he went off with a strained oblique muscle in his left side.
He was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took a quick lead when Neifi Perez hit a solo homer,
his ninth, off Dreifort with one out in the opening inning. Perez
drove a 2-2 pitch over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied it in the fifth on Cora's RBI double off
Jarvis. Beltre walked and scored from first on the double, but Cora
was thrown at third by first baseman Helton, who cut off the relay
home and nailed Cora.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeff Cirillo led off the sixth with a double for Colorado,
Helton drove a 3-1 pitch from Dreifort into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, the winner in the Dodgers' 12-1 victory over Astacio
and the Rockies on Sunday, gave up three runs on five hits in six
innings in the rematch. He struck out seven and walked three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers and Mandalay Sports Entertainment announced the
signing of a player development contract that will make the
Triple-A Las Vegas Stars the Dodgers' top minor league affiliate
beginning next season. Los Angeles earlier announced it would end
its agreement with Triple-A Albuquerque this year. ... Dave Garcia,
senior advisor to Rockies manager Buddy Bell, celebrated his 80th
birthday on Friday. The only two men to remain involved in an
on-field capacity at older ages were the Philadelphia Athletics
manager, Connie Mack, who retired at 88; and former Angels
conditioning coach Jimmie Reese, who was still coaching when he
died at 92. ... Los Angeles catcher Jim Leyritz will leave the club
Tuesday to return home to Florida for surgery on a torn rotator
cuff in his right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Albright Attends Afghanistan Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In what was believed to be the
highest-level encounter of its kind in two decades, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi attended an eight-nation meeting together to promote peace
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she and Kharrazi were on opposite sides of the
horseshoe-shaped table and didn't have a one-on-one conversation
during the session Friday afternoon at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said she was pleased that Iran and the United
States took the same stand deploring Afghanistan's drug trafficking
and human rights record and its harboring of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very encouraged by the similarity of views that we all
had,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting was believed to be the first time American
and Iranian officials on such a high level had worked together on a
specific issue since the 1979 hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a useful meeting,'' Albright said when asked
about the session's significance on U.S.-Iran relations. ''I think
when there are problems to be solved like this together, this is
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech to the seven other members of the Afghan group,
Albright said the United States was particularly concerned about
the impact on Iran of drug trafficking in Central Asia and called
for ''closer contact among ourselves'' to bring peace to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had lingered at the doorway at the end of the meeting,
looking inside the small conference room where Kharrazi remained,
but eventually walked out to a gaggle of reporters outside.
Kharrazi walked out behind Albright while she was speaking to the
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism but
nevertheless has been seeking to improve relations with Tehran
since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a
reform-minded cleric. Earlier this year, the United States lifted a
ban on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods and called for a ''new
relationship'' with the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami said in New York last week that ''serious issues''
must be resolved between the two countries before there can be
dialogue. Iran has called for U.S. sanctions to be lifted entirely
and for an end to support by some U.S. lawmakers for opposition
groups Tehran accuses of being terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the General Assembly on Friday, Kharrazi called
for international efforts to combat terrorism, saying, ''In a
globalized world, nothing can justify harboring or providing safe
havens to terrorists or condoning their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. Millennium Summit last week, President Clinton
attended Khatami's speech. Albright was also in the audience when
Khatami addressed a conference on the sidelines of the summit. A
week before, four U.S. lawmakers met with the speaker of Iran's
parliament, or Majlis, Mehdi Karrubi, during a cocktail reception
in New York, the first such meeting of U.S. and Iranian lawmakers
since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Al Gore has gained the upper hand over George W. Bush
in Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania, according to new polls in several key
industrial states critical to the presidential election. In a fourth state,
Ohio, the two candidates were roughly even, with Republican Bush at 43 percent
and Democrat Gore with 41 percent. Gore was up by 8 points in Michigan, 45-37;
ahead by 15 points in Illinois, 48-33; and had an 18-point bulge in

Philippine Military Attacks Rebels
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military planes and helicopter gunships
pounded rebel camps in the southern Philippines Saturday, in a surprise attack
aimed at rescuing 19 foreign and Filipino hostages. Thousands of troops and
elite police arrived on ships to join the fight in the hills of Jolo island.
People stood in the streets of Jolo's capital watching the distant attack,
marked the bombing sorties by air force planes. On Friday night, the military
ordered all boats to leave the capital's port to clear the way for the arrival
of military ships. Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said President Joseph
Estrada would make a statement later in the day.

Florence Prompts Bermuda Warnings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A hurricane warning was posted in Bermuda late Friday as
Hurricane Florence regained strength and speed as it turned away from the U.S.
mainland and moved toward the Atlantic island. At the same time, a storm system
in the Gulf of Mexico grew into Tropical Storm Gordon, prompting a hurricane
watch for Florida's west coast from Bonita Beach to the Suwanee River. That
storm, packing top winds of 60 mph, could become a hurricane by Saturday night,
according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It dumped
heavy rain Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and caused street flooding in
the resort city of Cancun.

Fall Won't Fix Texas Drought Damage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dried-up ponds and fast-growing fires. Overworked lawn
sprinklers and scorched crops. Legions of grasshoppers and warped house
foundations. Products of the relentless drought and heat wave are multiplying in
Texas, and the arrival of fall might not change things much. Shorter days,
longer nights and cooler temperatures will come, forecasters say, but the
bone-dry conditions of this scorching summer aren't likely to leave. The drought
has caused about $595 million in crop losses, according to the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service, and 178 counties have been declared federal
agricultural disaster areas.

N. Korea: Goodwill Begets Goodwill

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea said Friday that it will welcome any U.S.
goodwill gestures, now that the two nations have resolved a diplomatic flap over
the recent body searches of North Korean delegates..S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright sent a message of regret to North Korea, explaining that the
search in a German airport by American Airlines security personnel did not
reflect U.S. policy. North Korea's No. 2 leader Kim Yong Nam and his delegation
returned to Pyongyang after the incident, skipping last week's Millennium
Summit. North Korean officials denounced the U.S. action but later said they
took note of the American apology.

Garner countered with 18, as the teams tied an AL record by using 42 players.
Cleveland and Oakland had already won before the Red Sox-Tigers marathon ended
after nearly four hours, but Williams insisted that he didn't notice the scores

   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Military authorities on Saturday blocked
the road to the headquarters of the democratic opposition led by
Aung San Suu Kyi, two days after announcing the easing of tough
restrictions against the party, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic police and plainclothes intelligence officers manned
road blocks marked by 'no entry' signs on the approaches to the
two-story National League for Democracy office in downtown Yangon,
where the party planned to hold a meeting Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if the meeting would be allowed to
go ahead. It commemorates the second anniversary of the party's
formation of a proxy parliament as a direct challenge to the
military government. The proxy parliament was formed after the
government refused to honor the party's 1990 general election
victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government announced it was lifting
restrictions against Suu Kyi and eight other National League for
Democracy leaders who were confined to their homes for two weeks
after Suu Kyi tried to travel outside Yangon for party work.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, party leaders emerged from their homes and reopened
the party headquarters, which were raided by authorities on Sept.
2. The government justified its actions by saying it was
investigating the movement's alleged links to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   At the first anniversary of the proxy parliament, the road to
the party headquarters was also cordoned off and diplomats and
reporters were blocked from attending, but National League for
Democracy leaders and some members were allowed in and it went
ahead.

<HEADLINE> Jones Ready To Start Olympic Quest  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Inspired by the magnificent opening
ceremonies at her first Olympic Games, Marion Jones is eager to
begin her quest for five gold medals, confident she can accomplish
the unprecedented feat.
</P>
<P>
   ''My days are filled with anticipation,'' Jones said Saturday, a
week before she begins competition in her bid to win golds in the
100 and 200 meters, the 400 and 1,600 relay, and the long jump.
''They're not filled with doubts, with hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had the dreams, the expectations of being on the podium.
I want to have all these dreams realized. I would love for it to
get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has no fears in the 100 and 200, where she has been
dominant throughout the world since 1997. In each of the past three
years, she has been ranked No. 1 in both sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I put together the race I'm capable of, I don't think
anyone can beat me,'' she said. ''I'm confident, I'm 24, I'm at the
top of my game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone's going to run 10.5 (seconds in the 100), let's get
out there and race.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one woman has run as fast as 10.5 -- the late Florence
Griffith Joyner, with 10.49, at the U.S. Olympic trials in 1988.
Griffith Joyner also is second and third on the all-time list, with
10.61 and 10.62. Jones is next at 10.65, and has seven of the next
eight-fastest times, with only Griffith Joyner interrupting her
streak at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner also owns the two-fastest times in the 200,
21.34 and 21.56, with Jones third at 21.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I step onto the track for the 100 and 200 finals,
wonderful things are going to happen,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   She also is not overly worried about the relays, even though she
hasn't run a 1,600 relay since her sophomore year at North
Carolina. She has anchored several 400 relays over the years and
has the speed to overcome any small deficits.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer relay, her final event, Jones' endurance will be
tested because of her lack of 400-meter experience. She has run
only a handful of 400s in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   If she gets to that point, she feels she'll be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I will have four gold medals and be going for a
fifth,'' Jones said. ''It may come down to adrenaline. I'm in the
best shape of my life. I'm not worried about fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   The long jump does concern her. It's by far her weakest and most
inconsistent event. In her final long jump competition before the
trials, she finished fifth, and last year, her bid for four golds
at the World Championships ended with a third place in the long
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''My approach to the board wasn't good,'' Jones said about her
fifth-place finish. ''I've made some corrections. My speed is
there, but it's difficult to adjust my speed to the long jump after
running the 100. I can't run 10.69 down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping for one big jump -- that's what people are saying. I
need to relax and transfer my speed to the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long jump is special because it's the big question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, Jones' inconsistent performances in
the long jump have resulted in experts offering advice. Jones has
brushed aside all suggestions for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident in Trevor (coach Trevor Graham), I'm confident
in my abilities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who bypassed an opportunity to be an Olympian as a 400
relay alternate in 1992 because she wanted a chance to be an
individual gold medalist, made her initial appearance in an Olympic
stadium Friday night for the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an overwhelming experience, simply incredible,'' she
said. ''Posing with Alonzo Mourning and meeting Venus and Serena
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked into the stadium and I was overwhelmed how big it
was. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it will be Jones' turn to perform in Olympic Stadium, and
she's anticipating the moments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will have my critics,'' she said. ''Some people will say I
can't do it. This is my goal. I'm not here to say I'm Superwoman,
but this is what I want to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what anyone says, it's not going to deter me from
going after five.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I've dreamed of.''

<HEADLINE> Sailors Right In the mix in Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When they look at the stunning scenery
of Sydney Harbor, Olympic sailors can hardly believe their luck.
</P>
<P>
   They've never had it this good. Normally shunted off to a remote
patch of ocean far away from the host city, they'll be right in the
middle of the action in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be tacking in front of the Sydney Opera House and its
sail-shaped roofs, with the Harbor Bridge and the skyline adding to
the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Red-roofed villas in the eastern suburbs look out over some of
the four harbor courses, and two more courses will be set on the
Pacific Ocean, out beyond the imposing sandstone cliffs of Sydney
Heads.
</P>
<P>
   The ''selling rices'' -- that's how Aussies pronounce ''sailing
races'' -- will be virtually impossible to ignore. Dinghies,
catamarans, windsurfers and the wild-and-wooly new 49er class will
skim across the city's nautical playground, which is one of the
world's most spectacular natural amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The harbor is an incredible thing,'' 49er crewman Charlie
McKee of Seattle said in amazement. ''The Olympics are right here
in the middle of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sydney's signature green and yellow ferries will have to
make way as Olympic sailing is held in a working port for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of spectators can watch from the shore or from boats.
It's only the second time in recent history that sailing has been
visible from the shore at the host city, and even in Barcelona it
was only to a limited degree.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors are here to win medals, of course, and won't care
about the scenery during the races. But they notice it on the way
to and from the courses. Craig Healy, one of two crewmen for
skipper Jeff Madrigali, said it'll be special for the Soling crews
that will match race for the medals off the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think on the 30th, whoever's in that top final round, is
going to really have a moment there against that backdrop,'' said
Healy, who like the rest of the Soling crew is from the San
Francisco area. ''It's going to be a fun thing. And the medal
ceremony's there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has always been a sailing hotspot, and U.S. team leader
Hal Haenel was stunned by a conversation he had with a cab driver
before a pre-Olympic regatta two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw that I was with U.S. Sailing and said, 'You really
think your McKees have a chance against the Nicholson guy?' I said,
'Do you sail?' And he said, 'No, we just follow it.'
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't get that in the states,'' said Haenel, who won gold
and silver medals while crewing for current Star skipper Mark
Reynolds of San Diego. ''When a cabbie knows the name of one of
your sailors, you know you're in the sailing Mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Chris Nicholson won the first three 49er world
championships and, with crewman Daniel Phillips is favored to win
gold here.
</P>
<P>
   In a colorful touch, the billowing spinnakers of the 49ers will
be imprinted with the national flag of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The 49er competition should be one the highlights. The winged
skiffs, based on the famous Sydney 18-footers, are light and fast,
capable of reaching 25 knots. Attached to safety lines, the sailors
hike, or prop themselves out over the edges of the wings, to keep
the boat level.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely on the edge,'' said Charlie McKee, 38, a
bronze medalist in the 470 class in 1988 who crews for his brother,
Jonathan, himself a gold medalist in the discontinued Flying
Dutchman class in 1984. ''I think that's why we're still in it.
This boat came along and it's like, 'Wow, this is definitely a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will try to atone for 1996, when they won just two
bronze medals in their home waters in Savannah, Ga. Those sailors,
Courtenay Becker Dey in the Europe and Madrigali return.
</P>
<P>
   The first races are Sunday (Saturday EDT) for the women's and
men's windsurfing, Soling and the Tornado catamarans.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Wins Gold Medal in Triathlon  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Brigitte McMahon had pictured the scene
many times before, envisioning her run toward the Sydney Opera
House at the end of the inaugural Olympic triathlon. But there was
an added twist when it became reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss iron woman outswam the sharks, bicycled with the pack
and then sprinted away from Australia's Michellie Jones in the
final 100 meters to win the women's triathlon Saturday (Friday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, 33, who took up triathlon after she failed to make the
Olympics as a swimmer, kicked past Jones as the two raced down
Macquarie Street and onto the plaza in front of the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind, in all my hard workouts, I actually pictured those
last kilometers toward the opera house,'' she said. ''I wasn't
picturing myself in the lead, but I pictured myself being happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The men get their chance Sunday (Saturday night EDT), contesting
their triathlon on the same course.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Dominic McMahon was napping in front of the opera
house until the final moments of the women's race. After his Mom
won, he celebrated by playing with a shiny new toy -- an Olympic
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon won in 2 hours, 40 seconds. Jones took silver, two
seconds behind McMahon, and Switzerland's Magali Messmer was third.
Joanna Zeiger, a doctoral student in genetic epidemiology at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a totally awesome experience. I don't feel a tiny bit
frustrated (by just missing a medal),'' said Zeiger, who finished
45 seconds behind McMahon. ''I'm so excited and psyched. It was a
great day -- I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Taormina, a former waitress from Livonia, Mich., and a
1996 Olympic gold medalist in a swimming relay, placed sixth.
Jennifer Gutierrez, a gym teacher from Denver whose father played
baseball in the Cincinnati Reds' organization, was 13th.
</P>
<P>
   The triathlon started in the shimmering water of Sydney Harbor --
crowded with everything from sailboats to ocean liners, but
apparently no sharks -- and ended on the plaza in front of the
city's landmark opera house.
</P>
<P>
   The running portion of the event turned into a duel down the
stretch between McMahon and Jones, who grew up in the Sydney
suburbs. They broke away from a five-woman pack early on the last
lap, then ran together until McMahon's closing sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was just was too strong. I surged with about 200 meters to
go and she surged and I tried to surge again and my legs just went,
'No,''' Jones said. ''It's going to give me nightmares, but at
least I got a silver medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McMahon, a former triathlete and tennis instructor from
North Sutton, N.H., who has been coaching his wife for the past two
years, said he sought a little help from nature before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went around the 'Wishing Tree' in the park three times
forward and three times backward,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina, an MBA who worked as a Waffle House waitress to
support her athletic career after attending college at Georgia,
finished the swim in 18 minutes, 39 seconds -- giving her a lead of
35 seconds over a pack of four competitors.
</P>
<P>
   She led for the first lap of the bike race through Sydney's
business district, but was caught on the second lap by Germany's
Joelle Franzmann -- who led a pack of 15 athletes through the rest
of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   A five-woman pack broke away from the field on the first of the
two running laps through the Royal Botanic Gardens, where thousands
of fruit bats hang from the trees. McMahon and Jones made their
move on the second lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw it was just Michellie behind me. I said to myself,
'First or second, this is as good as it can be,''' McMahon said.
''I pushed as hard as I could, and it was enough. It's the most
fantastic thing possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the competitors discounted the chances of a shark
attack, six divers equipped with shark-repelling devices escorted
the triathletes in the 1,500-meter swim through the brisk 61-degree
water of Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The race marked the Olympic debut of triathlon, which still has
provisional status as an Olympic event. Triathletes hope the
enthusiasm generated by fans who lined the waterfront and the race
route will help promote their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a fantastic day for our sport. I really think
we showed today that triathlon is an Olympic sport,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are going to see what happened out there today
and be amazed at this thing called triathlon, where they swim, bike
and run. It's fast, it's furious, that's what makes it so
exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Vinson Gives U.S. First Boxing Win  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Winning his first Olympic bout would
have been good enough for Clarence Vinson. But having Muhammad Ali
around to congratulate him made it even better.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson's Olympic boxing debut Saturday was an emotional one from
the time he rode to the arena until Ali greeted him after his win
over France's Rachid Bouaita.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was coming here and I had feelings I never had before,'' the
U.S. 119-pounder said. ''Tears came into my eyes. I'm here at an
Olympics. I never thought I'd get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment didn't overwhelm Vinson, though, who trailed after
the first round but scored the last eight points of the fight to
win 9-2 over Bouaita, who was fighting in his second Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who had entered the arena a few fights earlier, stayed
around to watch Vinson and then came up to him and gestured to the
boxer, as if to say he had done a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a dream come true,'' Vinson said of Ali's gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson's win was important not only because it advanced him to a
second round match against Taalaibek Kadiraliev of Kyrgystan, who
stopped Ngoudjo Herman of Cameroon in the third round. It also gave
the 12-member U.S. team a win in the first American fight of the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to give the other guys a lot of
confidence,'' U.S. coach Tom Mustin said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson, who at 5-foot-2 gave away five inches to the Frenchman,
needed to work inside to get his win and he was able to do so after
a round of trying to figure out what to do best.
</P>
<P>
   Bouaita was no slouch, having advanced to the quarterfinals in
the 1996 Games, and took a 2-1 lead after the first round in the
computer scoring that gives points only if three of five ringside
judges agree on a punch that lands.
</P>
<P>
   Bouaita would get no more points the rest of the fight, though,
as Vinson adjusted and pressured his opponent while landing
effectively with left hooks and right hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy was real tall and I felt as though I had a better
chance on the inside than on the outside,'' Vinson said. ''My coach
told me to get in there and be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinson, whose uncle, Mark Johnson, is a former IBF junior
batamweight champion, was not considered one of the top American
medal hopes coming into the games. He fights in a crowded division
that features several veteran boxers.
</P>
<P>
   But the energy level at which he fought the final two rounds
gave his coach the hope that high altitude training in Colorado may
pay off in some late round wins for American boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first bout gives you the chance to see if all your hard
work paid off,'' Mustin said. ''We're really strong the last two
rounds. I think it's probably because of the altitude training.''
</P>
<P>
   The first session of boxing at the Sydney Exhibition Center drew
a good, but not capacity, crowd, which witnessed a few new twists
in a sport that struggles with its image in the wake of some
Olympic boxing scandals.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, boxers fought four, 2-minute rounds instead
of three rounds at three minutes. They also fought under new rules
that call for a fight to end early if one boxer is ahead by 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in the first fight of the day, when Alisher
Rahimov of Uzbekistan landed a few punches at the bell to end the
third round to give him a 17-1 lead and the win over Cho Suk-hwan
of South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Lasorda's Speech Ready for US Team  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tommy Lasorda's speech is ready.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before the U.S. baseball team opens against Japan,
the Hall of Fame manager will rouse his minor-league roster with
his best major-league material.
</P>
<P>
   He'll wave his arms, stab the air and grow more emotional with
each sentence about country, family and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell them: This is it. This is what you worked for,''
Lasorda said. ''I have great confidence in you. I love you guys
very, very much. And just remember one thing: You represent the
greatest country in the world, so go out and do your job like
you're capable.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech is ready. Is the team?
</P>
<P>
   The first Olympic baseball tournament with professionals gets
underway Sunday (Saturday night EDT) with two medal favorites
facing off. Cuba, Japan, the United States, Australia and South
Korea are considered the best among the eight-team field.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is expected to start Daisuke Matsuzaka, his country's
version of the Chicago Cubs' Kerry Wood. Matsuzaka won the Rookie
of the Year award in 1999 for the Seibu Lions and is Japan's
pre-eminent player.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have an edge in experience -- their major league
teams sent players to the Olympics. The United States has minor
league players and a Hall of Fame manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here as the underdog, as I've supposedly heard,'' said
Lasorda, who won two World Series titles during his 20 years
managing the Los Angeles Dodgers. ''In 1988, they said we didn't
belong on the same field with the Oakland Athletics and we beat
them in five games because our team wanted it more than they did.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that's what's going to happen with this team. They're
going to want it more than the other team and that's the way we're
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Former A's manager Tony La Russa might disagree. So might the
Japanese, the Cubans and others in the Olympic tournament. Medals
could be decided not by which teams want to win the most, but by
which teams handle the pressure best.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of that to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the only country to win medals in all four Olympic
tournaments, including the first two when baseball was a
demonstration sport. The Japanese are serious about living up to
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in high school, I aimed for the Olympics,''
Matsuzaka said. ''I dreamed of the Olympics, but at the time I
didn't play very well. Now that I'm a professional, I've been
selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Norihiro Nakamura, a third baseman for the Osaka Kintetsu
Buffaloes, alluded to the pressure on the Japanese professionals to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel we have a load on our shoulders, but we're still aiming
for a medal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their counterparts felt the same thing. Ernie Young, a
31-year-old outfielder who has played for Oakland, Kansas City and
Arizona, hasn't experienced anything like the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable,'' he said. ''I've played in front of 59,000
in Yankee Stadium. When I step out there tomorrow, I'm going to
feel like I have about 100,000 out there because there's going to
be people around the world watching us play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda doesn't flinch from the pressure to win. In his frequent
talks to the team, Lasorda has made the stakes clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, this is bigger than the World Series, this is bigger
than the Dodgers, it's bigger than major league baseball,'' he
said. ''It's bigger because it's representing the entire United
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we (the Dodgers) won the world championship, the Dodger
fans were happy, the Giants fans were unhappy, the Cincinnati Reds
fans were unhappy. We win this thing, the whole country is pulling
for us. We're going to do everything we can not to let our country
down.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Wins 1st Gold at Games  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Nancy Johnson knew just where to turn
when things weren't going so well.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing qualifying round of the women's 10-meter
air rifle competition, the American talked to her husband, and
fellow marksman, Ken and went on to win the first gold in the
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got off the line,'' said Johnson, a 26-year old shooter from
Downers Grove, Ill, who won with 497.7 points Saturday (Friday
night EDT). ''I talked to my husband and coach -- they told me what
I was doing wrong. I was swaying.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took the advice of her husband, a member of the U.S.
men's air-rifle squad, steadied herself and won the eight-woman
final -- emerging from a four-way tie for second. She edged Kang
Cho-hyun of South Korea, who led from the start, by two-tenths of a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the first medal -- that's pretty cool,'' said Johnson,
who as a teen-ager wanted to go into archery. ''It's extra special,
no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got into position to win by scoring over 10 points in
seven of the first nine rounds of the finals. Heading into the last
shot, Johnson was tied with Kang -- who tied an Olympic mark with
397 points in the first round. Johnson scored a 9.9 to best Kang's
9.7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unbelievable. I knew I had a medal but I didn't know it was
going to be gold,'' said Johnson, who earned the first U.S. medal
in the event since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   France's Franck Dumoulin won the men's 10-meter air pistol with
an Olympic-record 688.9 points. Wang Yifu of China took the silver
with 686.9 points and the bronze went to Igor Basinsky of Belarus,
who had 682.7.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to describe,'' said the 27-year-old Dumoulin. ''I
feel like I've been in a boxing match and I've won with a knockout
punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang captured Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992 with the
previous record of 684.8 and took silver at Atlanta in 1996. He
established a personal best Saturday, but it wasn't enough to beat
Dumoulin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized I had finally won in the final round when I looked
at the scoreboard,'' Dumoulin said. ''Only when I reached the
final, I realized that I had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years ago, Johnson sustained nerve damage that
affected her arms and nearly ruined her hopes. But Johnson, who
also competed in the 1996 Atlanta Games, has been symptom free for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   When an archery range wasn't available, Johnson's father, Ben
Napolski, took his 15-year-old daughter to the local junior rifle
club. He was in attendance to see her win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very emotional, very teary,'' Johnson said. ''He just
said, 'I'm so proud of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was originally scheduled to
present the medals, but he left Sydney early in the day for his
home in Barcelona, Spain, to be with his sick wife. Olegario
Vazquez Rana, the chief of the International Shooting Sport
Federation, handed out the medals instead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won a silver medal at last year's Pan American Games.
She decided to skip Friday night's opening ceremony to get a good
night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said I could walk in the parade if I wanted to,'' Johnson
said. ''My coach said winning a medal could change my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that she ''slept like a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the 1999 national champion, also competed in air rifle
at the 1996 Games. In World Cup competition earlier this year, she
finished sixth at Atlanta and fourth in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   A second U.S. shooter, Jayme Dickman, finished sixth Saturday
with 495.4 points. Dickman, an alternate on the 1996 team, was
thought to be a contender for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   World champion Sonja Pfeilschifter of Germany finished fifth
with 495.9.
</P>
<P>
   ''She went out with a very grim look on her face,'' Johnson said
of Pfeilschifter. ''And I went out with a smile, determined to do
my best.''

<HEADLINE> LA Transit Strike Said Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bargaining between transit workers and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority came to a halt late Friday
night, with both sides saying a strike appeared inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke off between United Transportation Union and
the MTA more than an hour before the union's 12:01 a.m. strike
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have our strike and we'll come back to the bargaining
table when this negotiating team is ready to bring with them ...
the authority that is needed to sign an agreement,'' James
Williams, president of the union, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   MTA spokesman Mark Littman blamed the union for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made concession after concession after concession ... they
just walked out, stranding hundreds of thousands of people. This is
outrageous,'' Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike deadline was originally set for 12:01 a.m. Friday but
the union representing 4,300 bus and rail drivers agreed to a
24-hour delay, and talks continued.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by bus and rail drivers, mechanics and clerks would
affect about 450,000 people who rely on public transportation in a
1,400-square-mile area of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Its full impact likely wouldn't be felt until Monday, however,
when the bulk of the transit system's users return to work from the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I live seven miles from the hotel and I have no car, not even
a bike,'' said Rosalio Mendiosa, 62, a bus rider who works as a
waiter at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Talks began in June when the MTA said it needed to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor representatives said the MTA has failed to offer an
improved schedule, proposing instead to increase the number of
lower-paid and part-time drivers. Currently, drivers earn an
average $50,000 annually, but can make an additional $20,000 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 7 percent of commuters in Los Angeles County use
public transit, but those who do often have few alternatives.
Sixty-eight percent have household incomes under $15,000 per year,
and nearly three-quarters of bus riders are black or Hispanic,
according to the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Riders were worried as the negotiations went on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I blame the MTA for making it a difficult situation,'' said
Shepard Petit, 55, a disabled student who rides the bus to college.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis had urged resolution of differences to avoid
shutting down the nation's second-largest bus system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Los Angeles should not be subjected to gridlock
and lack of public transit because of intransigence on both
sides,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Lead Shared at Pa. Golf Tournament  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAOLI, Pa. (AP) -- Mark Calcavecchia hopes his experience pays
off in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, the biggest name remaining after two rounds in the
inaugural Pennsylvania Classic, shot a 5-under-par 66 on Friday to
match Frank Lickliter for the lead at 8-under 134.
</P>
<P>
   ''(At the Air Canada Championship), I thought, 'Well, I'm duking
it out with Chris Riley and Rory Sabbatini. These guys ought to
fall apart any second,''' Calcavecchia said. ''Didn't happen. Maybe
my experience will come into it a little bit more, but, then again,
maybe it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini won that tournament two weeks ago and Calcavecchia
finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, the 1989 British Open winner and three-time Ryder
Cup member, puts a familiar name atop the leaderboard in a
tournament missing many of the big names.
</P>
<P>
   None of the top seven money-winners are competing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week, it might be Chris DiMarco or Frank Lickliter or
me,'' Calcavecchia said. ''A lot of good players are right around --
well, they are all good out here, but still wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   While Calcavecchia chases his first victory of the year,
Lickliter is seeking his first tour victory. Lickliter finished
second to Payne Stewart in the 1999 Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically just made one error, and that was at the very first
hole yesterday,'' said Lickliter, who shot his second straight
bogey-free round.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter, who missed the cut in his last three tournaments, had
a 67 in the first PGA Tour event in Pennsylvania in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate (66) and Chris DiMarco (67) were a stroke behind at
134. Jim Carter shot a course-record 64 to join Australia's Mathew
Goggin (65) and Emlyn Aubrey (71) at 136. Aubrey, the co-leader
after the first round, double-bogeyed his final hole -- No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''To do it in the afternoon, that's a little bit more of a
feather in your cap because it had been walked on and stuff,''
Carter said about the record.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter teed off at 8:14 a.m. EDT and took advantage of the
soft conditions following overnight thunderstorms. He was off the
Waynesborough Country Club course well before the afternoon wind
could affect his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as it keeps blowing, it might be somewhat of an
advantage,'' Lickliter said. ''I can't tell you how great the
greens are here. The golf course is in such wonderful shape. The
fairways are just perfect. And the greens are actually perfect,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter, 105th on the money list, finished ninth in the
Western Open and Greater Milwaukee Open in consecutive weeks in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia was second in the Greater Hartford Open, and has
seven top-10 finishes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a lot of second-place finishes in my career,''
Calcavecchia said. ''I don't know if it's bad luck or what. Second
is OK, but it's not first. I've bounced back from those things.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMarco, who has two second-place finishes this year, is seeking
his first victory on the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a couple seconds. I've been close,'' DiMarco said.
''Hopefully I've learned from those and I'll go out and keep
playing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate is looking for his first PGA Tour victory since 1998. He
had one bogey and six birdies, including a 35-footer on No. 15.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Danny Briggs, the co-leader after the first round, fell
into a tie for eighth at 137 after a 72. ... John Daly missed the
cut after his second straight 72. ... Jim Furyk, born in nearby
West Chester, also missed the cut at 144.

<HEADLINE> Ivankov Helps Belarus in Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- If fist pumps and high-fives won
Olympic medals, then the U.S. men's gymnastics team would have been
standing on the podium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After a satisfying performance in preliminaries, the United
States had reason to believe it could break through when the team
finals roll around and the medal stand is wheeled out for real.
</P>
<P>
   With two of three sessions complete, and the favored Chinese
still to compete, the United States stood in third place,
comfortably in the top six that will make the team finals Monday.
The U.S. team was within 0.925 points of first-place Russia and
0.448 of second-place Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's the best team we've put on the floor since
1984,'' team director Ron Galimore said. ''They averaged over 9.5
per routine. That's what you need to challenge. The whole country
should be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States hasn't won a team medal since those 1984
Olympics, and hasn't won one in a non-boycotted games since 1932.
It was 0.923 points out of third at the Atlanta Olympics, the
beginning of the so-called ''Operation Flip-Flop'' program
installed by Galimore and coach Peter Kormann.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that effort was getting these athletes to work as
a team and show more heart. On the first night on the biggest
stage, the United States responded with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Top performances from Paul Hamm, his twin brother, Morgan, and
three-time Olympian John Roethlisberger brought spontaneous chants
of ''USA, USA'' from small corners of the SuperDome and giggles of
satisfaction from Galimore, who watched the meet from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Americans who traveled halfway across the world had
plenty to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger raised his fists, then threw a roundabout into
the air after a key performance on the pommel horse worth 9.6
points.
</P>
<P>
   One routine later, the 30-year-old Roethlisberger burst out with
a defiant yell toward the crowd after a perfect twisting double
back-somersault dismount to end his 9.625 rings performance.
</P>
<P>
   On vault, the normally staid Paul Hamm stuck the landing on his
handspring double-front somersault and smiled widely, lifting his
hands in the air, then high-fiving Kormann, who was nearly jumping
out of his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Five-time national champion Blaine Wilson one-upped that vault --
and Hamm's celebration -- pumping his fists in the air, then jabbing
another toward Kormann in an unusual display of emotion for an
athlete who rarely lets loose on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best news for a team trying to break through: Wilson,
the country's preeminent gymnast for half a decade, wasn't on top
of his game. The United States didn't use his scores on floor or
parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''All things being said, we can challenge for a medal,'' said
Galimore, who was especially encouraged that the United States had
finished a spot ahead of Japan and two in front of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans were celebrating, the Russians and Ukranians
were showing that this would be no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Nemov, who won six medals in Atlanta, was at his usual
showstopping best, working his flairs on the floor exercise like a
break dancer and flipping high above the bars, like a circus
performer on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Nemov took the lead in three events and was second in a fourth,
a legitimate contender for the all-around title that barely eluded
him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   European champion Oleksander Beresh led the Ukraine's chase to
the top with a 9.787 on the high bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Ivankov of Belarus made his Olympic debut after an
injury-plagued decade and helped his country into fifth place, one
spot behind Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov was the world champion in 1994 and favored to win the
all-around in 1996, but tore his Achilles' tendon two weeks before
the games and had to wait four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' Ivankov said. ''Finally. Finally. I wait so
long, I work hard and I thought about retiring, but then I came
back. It's a great feeling to be here and start to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The favored Chinese team didn't compete until the third session,
later Saturday night. Last year's world champions are seeking their
first Olympic gold medal, despite being favored in several Olympics
past. Earlier this week, Chinese team leader Zhang Jian said he was
looking forward to an all-night party ''when we get it.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Team Struggles  </HEADLINE>
By DENIS D. GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Once a swimming power, China is
struggling to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese failed to place even one competitor in the finals
Saturday at the opening of Olympic swimming.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal performance was epitomized by world record holder
Chen Yan's showing in the women's 400-meter individual medley. Yan,
reportedly in poor health, was 11th in the preliminaries at 4
minutes, 45.65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top eight advanced to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Five other Chinese swimmers fell short in the prelims, too. The
400 freestyle relay team placed ninth, also missing a spot in the
final, but was nearly three seconds behind eighth-place Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese still have a few good swimmers,'' Singapore coach
Tang Bock said. ''Once upon a time they swept everything, but they
are still a team to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese -- especially on the women's side -- blazed into the
limelight in the early 1990s, setting a spate of world records.
Nine still stand, including Chen's 3-year-old time of 4:34.79 in
the 400 free relay.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden, deep cuts of existing records sparked suspicions
that turned out true: The Chinese swimmers were caught in one
doping scandal after another.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Yanyan, world record holder in women's 200-meter medley,
could not make it to Sydney because she's serving a four-year ban
for doping.
</P>
<P>
   Four other swimmers were among 27 Chinese athletes cut shortly
before the national Olympic team was to leave for Sydney. Many of
those who did come are young, untested or in less than peak
condition.

<HEADLINE> Rickey Runs Up in the Record Book  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson ran right past Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron in the
record book.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson moved ahead of those Hall of Famers on the career runs
list, scoring twice Friday night as the AL West-leading Seattle
Mariners beat the Baltimore Orioles 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,175 runs, Henderson trails only Ty Cobb's total of 2,245.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a great honor, a great achievement. When I was a kid I
always looked up to the guys that played the game, that did well,''
Henderson said. ''You try to pattern yourself after the great
players of this game and it so happens I fell in that class with
them. It's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also drew two walks, closing within two of matching
Ruth for the most ever at 2,056.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good achievement but right now all the records and
stuff ... we don't really recognize them until we're through
playing the game,'' he said. ''You just try to go out there and do
your job and when it's all over with, let the records speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, Cleveland routed New York 11-1, Toronto
topped Chicago 6-5, Boston beat Detroit 7-6, Oakland trounced Tampa
Bay 17-3, Texas outlasted Kansas City 12-11 in 10 innings and
Anaheim downed Minnesota 16-5.
</P>
<P>
   All four contenders for the wild card spot won. Cleveland leads
by one game over Oakland, with Boston two games back and Toronto
trailing by three.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had started their previous 10 road trips this
season with a defeat, and also had lost seven in a row at Camden
Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson opened with a triple, and Seattle went on to end both
streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came at the right time,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
Indians 11, Yankees 1
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit a grand slam and Manny Ramirez hit his 30th home
run as Cleveland roughed up David Cone and his relief at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, in his first game since dislocating his left shoulder on
Sept. 5, struggled through 5 2-3 innings and left trailing 4-0.
After Jason Grimsley issued a walk that loaded the bases, Segui
homered for the third straight game, sending a drive into the upper
deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba beat New York for the first time. He had been 0-5 in
seven career starts against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
Athletics 17, Devil Rays 3
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi hit a grand slam and matched a career high with
seven RBIs as Oakland trounced Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi set an Athletics record with his fourth grand slam of the
season in the third inning. He had an RBI single in the fourth and
a two-run double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have 12 slams this year, tying the major league mark
shared by Atlanta (1997) and Cleveland (1999).
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays 6, White Sox 5
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch struck out Frank Thomas with runners on first and
third to preserve Toronto's victory over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have won seven of their last nine games at
Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez and Darrin Fletcher homered off Jon Garland. The
White Sox rookie, the youngest pitcher in the majors at 20, has not
lasted past the fifth inning in three starts since coming off the
disabled list 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson and Jose Valentin homered for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 7, Tigers 6
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg hit an RBI single in the ninth and Boston beat
Detroit at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox used 24 players and the Tigers employed 18 -- the
total of 42 tied the AL record for a nine-inning game set by
Oakland and Kansas City in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra led off the 10th with a single and Troy
O'Leary followed with a single. With one out, Hatteberg singled up
the middle through the Tigers' drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
Rangers 12, Royals 11, 10 innings
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kelly Dransfeldt hit an RBI single with two outs in the
bottom of the 10th as Texas won after wasting an eight-run lead at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt entered as a pinch-runner in the ninth. He moved from
second to third on an infield grounder, beating a throw, and scored
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt took over at shortstop in the top of the 10th and
threw out a runner at the plate, though Kansas City still scored
later for an 11-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the 10th, Gabe Kapler hit a sacrifice fly and
Dransfeldt singled to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City trailed 9-1 going into the sixth, then rallied
behind Johnny Damon's grand slam. Damon finished with three hits
and became the first Royals player to reach 200 since Kevin Seitzer
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney drove in two runs, giving him 135 RBIs and breaking
the Royals' record of 133 set by Hal McRae in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Angels 16, Twins 5
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson reached 100 RBIs for the first time and Tim
Salmon tied a career high with his 34th home run as Anaheim romped
past Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina drove in four runs and the Angels got a
season-best 21 hits at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Twins rookie Matt Kinney walked three and threw a wild pitch in
a five-run first inning. Darin Erstad singled twice during a
seven-run sixth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warships Sail Out Of East Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Four U.S. warships that delivered food
and reconstruction materials to devastated East Timor ended their
mission on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Tarawa, USS Duluth, and USS Anchorage, brought aid to
three widely separated parts of East Timor, including the isolated
enclave of Oecussi. While there have been similar previous U.S.
missions before to East Timor, the ships were escorted for the
first time by a warship because of recent violence on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The mission had been planned for months, but security for the
more than 4,000 sailors and marines was stepped up due to last
week's attacks by pro-Indonesian militia gangs, which killed three
U.N. aid workers in the West Timor border town of Atambua.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of some of the troubles on the border we've had a
fairly robust protection posture,'' said Navy Captain Allan Wall,
commander of the amphibious squadron.
</P>
<P>
   Wall said there were no incidents during the three-day mission.
More than 500 tons of building materials and food were delivered by
air and sea to hard-to-reach areas. The sailors and marines
repaired schools, opened dental and medical clinics and painted the
Dili cathedral steeple.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth such U.S. mission to the stricken island since
international peacekeepers intervened a year ago in response to
anti-independence militia violence following an independence vote.
The armed gangs fled to West Timor, where they have used border
refugee camps as bases for incursions into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   All four vessels are sailing to Singapore before heading to the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Attacks Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Thousands of troops and elite
police buffered by helicopter gunships poured onto a remote island
in the southern Philippines Saturday before dawn, moving in to
rescue 19 foreigners and Filipinos held hostage by Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Navy ships were blockading tiny Jolo island, and the military
had no immediate official word on the condition of the hostages.
Telephone and transportation links to Jolo were cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning months of negotiations, President Joseph Estrada said
he finally ordered the attack on the Abu Sayyaf after the group
seized three new hostages last weekend. The group claims it is
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the impoverished
south.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough is enough,'' Estrada said in a nationally broadcast
speech. ''We will not allow kidnappers or other lawless elements to
mock our laws or control our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The military refused to give information about the attack, but
an official who spoke on condition he not be named said there were
unconfirmed military reports that an American hostage, Jeffrey
Schilling, had been killed during an escape attempt Friday and that
12 Filipino Christian evangelists also being held were executed by
a rebel firing squad after the start of the military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The military also received a separate, also unconfirmed report
that two French journalist hostages had escaped, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A military officer, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said by telephone from Jolo that two rebels had been killed and
four were wounded. He also said troops had been able to gain some
territory around the main rebel stronghold but had met some
resistance. Four injured civilians were being treated at a Jolo
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen rebels had been captured, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   Military planes and helicopter gunships were continuing to pound
the rebels' camps with bombs and missiles at late afternoon
Saturday. The gunships returned every 30 minutes to Jolo's airport
to reload and refuel.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada cut short a visit to the United States this past week to
deal with the worsening hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made this difficult decision to authorize the military
operations, aware of the grave risks that the hostages and our
soldiers would face,'' Estrada said. ''It has become clear that I
must act and act decisively.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers streamed into Jolo's capital to flee the fighting,
Mayor Rashdi Abubakar said. Panicked residents crowded grocery
stores and were unable to escape from the island because of the
naval blockade.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the military ordered all boats to leave the
capital's port to clear the way for the arrival of military ships.
</P>
<P>
   Support for an assault has grown since last Sunday, when a
faction of the Abu Sayyaf abducted three more people from a
Malaysian diving resort -- despite their earlier pledge not to seize
more hostages while negotiations were underway.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings also came just one day after the rebels released
four Europeans -- the last foreigners from a group of 21 people
abducted April 23 from another Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now the military's show,'' said chief government
negotiator Robert Aventajado. ''I can't do anything more, although
my heart still yearns for the safety of the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a government emissary spoke with rebel leader
Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang Friday night and that he was already
frantic because of the military troops nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mercado said the armed forces were ''like an arrow
drawn against a bow'' waiting for orders to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the arrow has been released,'' he said Saturday.
''We hope it can find its target.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had threatened to attack southern Philippine cities
and to behead Schilling if there was a military assault.
</P>
<P>
   Various rebel factions are holding Schilling, the three
Malaysians, two French journalists, a Filipino captured in April,
and the dozen evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, a 24-year-old Muslim convert from Oakland, Calif.,
voluntarily visited an Abu Sayyaf camp on Aug. 28 and was abducted
when the rebels suspected he was a CIA agent, he says. He has
denied working for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that
the United States hoped the hostages could be released peacefully,
but that a decision on whether to use force was up to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for French President Jacques Chirac
criticized the military operation on Saturday, saying it was very
concerned that the move might put the hostages, including the two
French journalists, in danger. The German Foreign Ministry issued a
statement saying it shared the French concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages had been suspended
because of fighting among Abu Sayyaf factions over the division of
ransom money from the release of earlier hostages. Negotiators say
more than $15 million in ransom has been paid, about $10 million of
it by Libya for 10 Westerners.

<HEADLINE> 120,000 Chinese Women, Kids Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police freed 110,000 women and 13,000
children in a six-month crackdown on human trafficking gangs, the
state-run China Daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Security Ministry, the nationwide police force,
released the figures at a ceremony commending 65 local police
departments.
</P>
<P>
   The police force in Zunyi city was commended for breaking up a
gang that had abducted 84 women and children and sexually abused
them, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   The report gave no breakdown of where the women and children
were freed.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market reforms and a loosening of social controls in China
have revived a centuries-old trade in people. Women are usually
sold into prostitution, while children are often bought by
childless couples, especially in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown, which began in April, made use of high
technology, a rarity in Chinese police work. Police compiled a
national database on abduction rings and missing women and
children. They also took DNA samples from parents to help identify
their children, some of whom had been missing for years.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Earthquake Victims Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Hundreds of victims of last year's
devastating earthquake camped out in a park in central Taiwan
Saturday to protest the slow reconstruction of their shattered
towns and crumbled homes.
</P>
<P>
   They set up tents at a park in Nantou county just days before
the anniversary of the 7.6-magnitude temblor, which rattled the
largely rural county and nearby Taichung county on Sept. 21 last
year, killing about 2,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead were buried in collapsed apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said at least 50,000 people remain unemployed in the
two counties while thousands of others are still staying at
temporary homes, and have failed to get compensation from
developers they say should be held responsible for the shoddy
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed the protesters with banners reading
''We want homes. We want jobs'' as they squatted next to their
tents where they planned to stay throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, President Chen Shui-bian
apologized for the slow reconstruction, blaming government
bureaucracy and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The government has spent $10 billion on temporary housing and
other quake relief work.
</P>
<P>
   The private Reconstruction Foundation, which managed donations,
has also blamed local governments for misuse of private funds or
being slow in distributing the money for reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kerik reviewing NYPD's anti-drug efforts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik is reviewing
the NYPD's anti-drug efforts, focusing on the spending of tens of
millions of dollars in overtime and the high percentage of minor
arrests being made by narcotics detectives, The New York Times
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to unnamed law enforcement officials familiar with the
review, Kerik is concerned that misdemeanor narcotics arrests
outnumber felony arrests by three to one, an indication that a
large number of people charged with drug crimes serve little or no
time in jail, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, who served in the department as a narcotics detective for
four years, is also reviewing the process by which investigators in
the Narcotics Division are promoted to the rank of detective from
the rank of police officer, the officials told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik has emphasized that he believes a focus on quality-of-life
offenses has helped win record declines in crime, but the officials
told the newspaper he is concerned that some detectives are failing
to produce higher-quality cases, like arresting drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of misdemeanor narcotics arrests has been on the rise
for more than five years, and many police commanders say that
pressure within the department to push up arrest numbers has led to
a flood of minor drug charges, The Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, narcotics misdemeanors have climbed 295 percent,
while narcotics felonies over the same period have decreased 1.1
percent, according to the recently released Mayor's Management
Report. In fiscal 2000, felony arrests for narcotics dropped 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of 2000, Kerik's predecessor, Howard
Safir, spent more than $40 million of police overtime on a special
narcotics enforcement program called Operation Condor, an effort to
turn around the city's rising murder rate, which in 1999 and the
beginning of this year was inching up, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three months of this year, Operation Condor put
additional undercover narcotics buy-and-bust teams on the streets
in targeted neighborhoods. Starting in May, the overtime funds were
spent on additional uniformed patrols and quality-of-life
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of this year, the police made 60,950
misdemeanor narcotics arrests and 19,787 felony narcotics arrests,
according to statistics from the state Division of Criminal Justice
Services. During that period in 1999, the police drug arrests
included 39,260 drug misdemeanors and 21,604 drug felonies.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Launchers Found in Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNANI, Spain (AP) -- Police in this Basque town discovered six
grenade launchers Saturday 500 yards from an open air museum that
Spanish King Juan Carlos visited later in the day, said royal
security.
</P>
<P>
   The launchers, tubes placed in the ground to lob grenades, were
deactivated before the king and Queen Sofia inaugurated the open
air Chillida Museum nearby, said security. Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder were also
to arrive at the museum Saturday afternoon, after the King.
</P>
<P>
   Security didn't immediately blame anyone for the launchers, but
Basque separatists of ETA have used the notoriously inaccurate
devices in previous years on attacks on Spanish security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police swarmed the area surrounding the museum,
including a hilltop overlooking the grounds where police apparently
found the grenade launchers.
</P>
<P>
   The find comes amid increasing separatist violence and a swift
police crackdown on ETA separatists.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Torrential rains and strong wind
spawned by Tropical Storm Saomai battered much of South Korea
Saturday, killing two people and submerging rice paddies and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Suh Sang-jo, 63, was found dead in a rain-triggered mudslide
that engulfed his house near the southern town of Kosung, police
said. Another man was killed when he was hit by a signboard

</P>
<P>
   Two children were missing after they were swept away in
rain-swollen streams in North Kyongsang Province of central Seoul.
</P>

   High waves slammed the 40,000-ton Indonesian freighter Bintang
Biru onto a rock and the ship was broken in half in waters off the
southeast port of Pusan. All 29 of the ship's crewmen were rescued.

<HEADLINE> Suu Kyi Party To Draft Constitution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar's democratic opposition led by
Aung San Suu Kyi declared Saturday it would draft a national
constitution, in a sign that a recent official crackdown against
the party has not dented its ambitions to end military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred members of the National League for Democracy held a
meeting at the party's Yangon headquarters two days after
authorities eased restrictions against NLD leaders. The leaders had
been confined to their homes for two weeks after Suu Kyi tried to
travel outside Yangon on party work.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the party commemorated the second anniversary of
its Committee Representing People's Parliament (CRPP) -- a proxy
parliament formed as a direct challenge to the ruling military
government, which has refused to honor the NLD's 1990 general
election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Military authorities had earlier blocked the road to the NLD
office in downtown Yangon, but they allowed the meeting to take
place, attended by 200 party members and diplomats. Reporters were
barred from entering.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD passed three resolutions at Saturday's meeting: to
demand the government release all political prisoners; to maintain
the proxy parliament until a proper parliament is convened; and to
draft a national constitution.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 law, drafting a charter without the
government's approval could result in a prison sentence of up to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   A state-organized national convention was set up seven years ago
but was boycotted by the NLD on the grounds it was dominated by the
regime. It has not met for four years and has not produced a
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the support of the people and with support from countries
who support democracy, a democratic government will certainly
emerge,'' a declaration released Saturday by the CRPP said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Suu Kyi announced she would take over as CRPP
secretary and its representative for ethnic affairs, taking over
from Aye Tha Aung, who was arrested and sentenced to 21 years in
prison in June for violating a publication law and an emergency
law.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NLD leaders emerged from their homes and reopened the
party headquarters, which were raided Sept. 2 by the authorities.
The government justified its actions by saying it was investigating
alleged NLD links with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In her first public comments since her confinement, Suu Kyi
appeared determined Friday to maintain political pressure on the
military regime, daring authorities to stop her from traveling
outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle for
democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which has been ruled by
its military since 1962. She was kept under house arrest from
1989-1995. Her movements have remained heavily restricted.
</P>
<P>
   An NLD statement issued late Friday demanded the immediate
release of 11 party members it said were arrested earlier this week
in Yangon and the town of Kungyangon despite the government's
announcement that the party would be allowed to go about daily
activities as normal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 15 NLD members have been arrested outside the
capital since Sept. 2, NLD Yangon Division chairman Soe Myint told
reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to comment on the NLD's allegations of
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions on NLD leaders came after a nine-day standoff
between Suu Kyi and the authorities that began late last month.
</P>
<P>
   She and NLD vice chairman Tin Oo were blocked Aug. 24 by
security forces as they traveled to a planned NLD meeting in the
countryside. They refused to return to the capital and camped by
their vehicles on the outskirts of the city until police forcibly
transported them back to Yangon and confined them to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown drew vehement international criticism, mainly from
the United States and Britain, which accused the regime of
blatantly violating the Myanmar opposition leaders' political
rights. Myanmar accused both countries of meddling in its internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Top Cardinal Resigns From Key Posts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A Brazilian cardinal often mentioned as a
possible successor to Pope John Paul II resigned from two key
Vatican posts Saturday for reasons of health.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul accepted the resignation of Cardinal Lucas Moreira
Neves from the influential Congregation of Bishops and the
Pontifical Commission for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Neves, who turned 75 on Saturday, was archbishop of Sao Salvador
da Bahia for 10 years until called to the Vatican in 1998. Reported
health problems already then were a factor for observers
speculating about possible papal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul named Vatican Undersecretary of State Archbishop
Giovanni Battista Re to succeed Neves as head of the Congregation
of Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Re, a 66-year-old Italian, is expected to be elevated to
cardinal when the next list of cardinals is announced, probably
early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Re is believed to be very close to John Paul. Elevation to
cardinal means he would be eligible to vote on the next pope when
John Paul dies.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul named Argentine Archbishop Leonardo Sandri to replace
Re in the Vatican secretary of state's office. Sandri, 56, is now
papal nuncio to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Jumpers compete in parachuting contest for over-40s  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Pat Moorehead logs skydives like other
people pile up frequent flier miles. At last count Friday, he'd
jumped out of planes 5,072 times.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old has been feeding his jumping addiction for 33
years. He and hundreds of other skydivers from around the country
are competing here this week in the national Parachutists over
Phorty Society (POPS) championships. The competition ends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't quit skydiving because you get old, you get old
because you quit skydiving,'' Moorehead, of Long Beach, Calif.,
said, quoting a phrase seen on parachutists' T-shirts and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The divers compete in several categories, including who can land
closest to a spot on the ground about as big as a golf ball, and
which teams of four, eight or ten can make the most formations
before landing.
</P>
<P>
   All day Friday, teams of divers practiced their freefall
maneuvers on the ground at Cross Keys Airport, forming circles,
stars and 'X' shapes by holding each other by the arm or leg.
</P>
<P>
   Then they piled into small planes, flew to about 14,000 feet and
jumped out. Divers grabbed onto each other's legs and arms in the
predetermined manner, then switched to the next maneuver, trying to
form as many shapes as they could in 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached 4,500 feet, they separated and each opened
their parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like little kites with GI Joes dangling from them, they
drifted past the clouds and came to their landings.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead is president of a subgroup of POPS: Skydivers Over
Sixty, or SOS. The group has about 600 members in 17 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead, a great-grandfather, calls it ''exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt that says ''Remember when sex was safe and
skydiving was dangerous?'' Moorehead chats amiably with the other
divers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of camaraderie in this sport,'' he said. ''You
wind up diving with people you don't even know, and sometimes don't
even speak the same language, but it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it makes him feel young, he answered, ''Well, I
never felt old yet, so I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Alicia, on a skydiving trip 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd both sworn off marriage,'' he said, ''we didn't do well
at it. But we sat down on the plane next to each other and we've
been together ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Moorehead is past president of the World Parachutists
Over Phorty Society, which has 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason so many older skydivers stay with the sport is
technology, Alicia Moorehead said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do divers use the old, round parachutes. Today they
use rectangular ones that offer much more control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it much more safe,'' she said. ''The round parachutes
pound you into the ground, they're not as maneuverable.''
</P>
<P>
   They also use altimeters that are strapped to their chests to
remind them when to pull the ripcord. And, just in case they
forget, or for some reason are unable to, a sensor in their
backpack will automatically open the parachute when the jumper
reaches a certain altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also has allowed for ultra-lightweight fabrics to be
used in the parachutes. Even the divers' jumpsuits are computer
generated for different weights and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest skydiver at this competition is 76. Tom Morrison, of
Ambler, Pa., first dove in World War II. But this, he said, is much
more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's enjoyable. We have an exquisite bunch of people in this
sport,'' said Morrison, who has made 8,950 jumps, including one
last year with George Bush to celebrate the former president's 75th
birthday. ''We all share the same unusual activity out here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea when I'm going to stop.''

<HEADLINE> Thoughts from 2 miles up: A reporter's first dive  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOVE WILLIAMSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - I wasn't scared until we were at
the open plane door - looking 13,000 feet down. But then it was too
late to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen what happened to the other people who had just left
the plane. They got snapped away and started falling - fast.
</P>
<P>
   But when my skydiving instructor stepped out, I didn't have any
choice but to go with him, we were harnessed together.
</P>
<P>
   We shot down and were ripped away from the plane. Too scared to
speak, or do anything else, I just watched the clouds zoom by.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 long seconds, instructor Mark Kruse and I fell together,
the wind snapping in our ears. The air, surprisingly cold for a hot
September day, rushed past.
</P>
<P>
   A skydiver with a video camera attached to his head dived with
us to capture my first dive. At one point, he grabbed my hand in a
handshake and spun me around in a gut-wrenching circle. Things seem
to happen faster up here.
</P>
<P>
   I repeated to myself what Kruse had told me before we got on the
plane, ''Just arch your back, breathe and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skeffington, manager of Freefall Adventures, had given me
about 20 minutes of instruction on the ground on how to position my
arms and how to land, but he and Kruse acknowledged that most
people forget all that when they get up in the air. ''Arch, breathe
and relax,'' I could handle.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I had to remember - this one rather crucial -
was when to pull the ripcord. Kruse, of course, had his own cord,
but students are supposed to get the feel of pulling their own.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached 5,000 feet, I was to pull the orange handle at
my hip and release the parachute. I checked the altimeter strapped
to my wrist several times, surprised that we weren't there yet.
While I was enjoying the amazing ride, I knew I'd relax a little
once the chute opened.
</P>
<P>
   At just before 5,000 feet, Kruse gave me the OK and I pulled the
cord. The red, white and blue parachute opened with a snap, yanked
us up with surprising force, then settled us into a smooth float.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse gave me a thumbs up, I took a deep breath and enjoyed the
ride - calm, peaceful and beautiful. For five minutes, homes,
trees, baseball fields and golf courses drifted by. Philadelphia,
about 20 miles away, looked like a small town in the distance, and
clouds hugged the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting it to be over and at the same time not wanting it to
end, I reminded myself that this is probably the only time I'll
ever do this. So I tried to soak it all up - the graceful, floating
feeling, the beauty, the serenity.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached 1,000 feet, Kruse let me help steer the rig
toward the landing zone - a gravel 'X' in the middle of a field. We
angled in toward the ground and landed smoothly, but still a
surprising jolt ran up my legs.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved and excited, I felt like I'd accomplished something,
even though all I did was hang on for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after landing my stomach is still queasy and my legs are
shaking. I'm afraid to eat anything because I can't be sure it'll
stay where it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, nothing is the same. The sky seems bluer, the
clouds brighter white, the day happier. It's not just relief that
nothing went wrong. It's an intangible - the joy of having taken
that first step out and the peace of being in one piece 13,000 feet
later.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Head Urges China Trade Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian on
Saturday proposed talks with China aimed at ending his nation's
50-year ban on direct shipping links between the rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Chen had offered during March presidential elections to end the
ban. Lukewarm financial markets, bearish in recent months because
of the new government's prolonged standoff with China and the
public's lack of confidence in its economic policies, have added
pressure to deliver on the campaign promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''The normalization of relations must begin with the
normalization of trade ties,'' Chen said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is about time to have direct shipping links, and we must
seriously face the issue,'' he continued. ''We can no longer act as
an ostrich and use national security as an excuse'' to put off
opening the links.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said this week Taiwan will open transportation links
between the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the Chinese
mainland as soon as December.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen said this would be only a small step in the process to
legalize the small-scale trade that has already flourished between
the outlying islands and China.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the ban on direct shipping links would require
negotiations with the mainland, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope the Chinese communists can understand that it requires
mutual efforts to break the stalemate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949. Taiwan imposed
the ban on direct links for security concerns because China has
considered the island a breakaway province and has remained
hostile.
</P>
<P>
   But trade has flourished over the past decade, flowing mostly
through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in May, Chen has urged Beijing to set aside
its political dispute with Taiwan and discuss any topics of its
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing distrusts Chen, who in the past had called for
Taiwan's formal independence. It has insisted that dialogue won't
begin until Taiwan acknowledges that it is an inseparable part of
China, a precondition Chen has rejected.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Lawyer Pressures NATO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Carla del Ponte, the chief war crimes
prosecutor for the former Yugoslavia, said Saturday she was losing
patience with NATO's inability to arrest indicted war criminal
Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am effectively losing patience. I say to myself sometimes,
there must be something that they are not telling me,'' del Ponte
said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, accused of masterminding the ''ethnic cleansing'' of
non-Serbs from areas of Bosnia during the 1991-95 civil war, tops
the tribunal's list of wanted war criminals, along with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte told Le Soir that she had doubts as to whether Western
countries were still pursuing the arrest of Karadzic. ''The
political will to arrest him, is it really there? For the time
being Karadzic is the stronger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said she would like the creation of a special force to
go after indicted war criminals hiding out in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, located in the Netherlands, at The Hague, already has
some 40 suspects in custody. The tribunal has said it is working at
capacity to deal with the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic has reportedly been sighted near Sarajevo, but
authorities in the Serbian part of Bosnia refuse to arrest him, and
the area is out-of-bounds for international troops empowered to
seize him.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers, who previously were reluctant to undertake a
risky arrest operation, have shown greater willingness to carry out
the tribunal's arrest warrants. The alliance has said it aims to
capture all indicted war criminals in both Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said she would be going to Washington on Sept. 25 to
meet Defense Secretary William Cohen, and other officials to
discuss Karadzic and other fugitives still in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to know exactly what is being done,'' del Ponte said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Tax Relief From Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The projected budget surplus should be used
for tax relief and 90 percent of next year's surplus should go to
pay the national debt, a Republican congressman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Kuykendall of California said that while a proposed
law to get rid of the so-called ''marriage penalty'' tax died --
President Clinton vetoed it and Congress failed to override the
veto -- Republicans will not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed that America's working families aren't going
to get much-needed relief from this unfair tax,'' Kuykendall said
in the weekly Republican radio address. ''But we'll be back to try
again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the money set aside this year for marriage penalty
relief will instead be devoted to paying off the public debt,
saying a half-trillion dollars of it has already been paid back.
</P>
<P>
   Kuykendall noted that earlier this week, Republican leaders met
with Clinton, asking him to join Congress in devoting the lion's
share of next year's surplus to debt payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have said the new Republican goal was an abrupt
abandonment of the Republicans' push for big tax cuts, and of GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush's call for a 10-year, $1.3
trillion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, with their 90-10 debt reduction plan, Republicans have
essentially repudiated their own agenda, which they have pursued
vigorously for the last six years,'' House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuykendall said the remaining 10 percent can still go to
education and to increase Medicare reimbursements to health
providers. He added a host of other promises, including repealing
the phone tax enacted in 1898, health care tax relief, increased
military spending and the expansion of private retirement plans,
like IRAs and 401(k)s.

<HEADLINE> Man indicted in gang attack on Asian killed in car wreck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST SPARTA, N.Y. (AP) - One of seven young men accused in the
beating of an Asian man in a race-linked gang attack this summer
has been killed in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Tuso, 22, crashed his car almost head-on into a pickup
truck Thursday night near his home in Dansville in western New
York. Authorities said they were still trying to determine what
might have caused Tuso to drift into the oncoming lane on state
Route 36.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, a 62-year-old man, was treated for minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuso, his brother, Adam, and Shawn Schledorn, all of Dansville,
were indicted on felony gang assault and aggravated harassment
charges after an Asian man was beaten and kicked June 25 in a
restaurant-bar in Geneseo, a college town.
</P>
<P>
   All three were free on bond, but Tuso was to have been arraigned
Sept. 28. His brother and Schledorn pleaded innocent at another
arraignment earlier this month. Gang assault carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Four other men from Dansville face lesser charges in the
assault.

<HEADLINE> Old Song Tells a Modern Story  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLESBORO, Ky. (AP) -- She'd sing it wherever she went in those
days -- around the neighborhood, hanging the wash outside her
family's wooden shack, and especially when folks would gather to
play some harmonica, pick some banjo and push the blues away.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew the song was old, though they weren't sure where
it came from. But in 1937, around Middlesboro's desperately poor
Noetown section, it came from the mouth of the miner's daughter who
lived by the railroad tracks, the girl named Georgia Turner.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a man showed up from the East, a young guy in an old
car trolling Kentucky's mountains with a bulky contraption to
record people singing their songs. Georgia -- blond, pretty, just 16
-- gathered up her mother and headed over to Tillman Cadle's house.
In a nasal drawl she performed her favorite, the twangy lament
called ''Rising Sun Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   That day, Georgia Turner made her contribution to musical
history.
</P>
<P>
   Until she sang into Alan Lomax's Presto ''reproducer,'' her
beloved tune belonged primarily to the American folk tradition:
staunchly regional, shifting as it was passed from this front porch
to that one, rarely committed to writing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1937, it stepped into 20th-century popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Lomax put it into a songbook, and it spread like a cold into the
1940s New York City folk-music scene. To Pete Seeger and Woody
Guthrie, to Lead Belly, to Josh White, who may have known it
already. Each put it on a phonograph record and passed it to
thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   With each year the ripples widened -- into the folk revival and
beyond, to a British Invasion band called the Animals that arranged
the breakthrough version, The Hit, the one you hear in your head
when you think of the song.
</P>
<P>
   From there, as years passed, it crossed genres and oceans:
Celtic and Latin, reggae and disco, trance and punk and easy
listening. It has become a melody for a hip-hop artist's Haitian
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   One American tune of many, up from the folkways, onto the
highways and beyond -- propelled by technology and globalization and
the desire to make two things: money and a difference. It is the
story of modern mass culture, of taking something old, adding
something personal and creating something universal.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of the song called ''House of the Rising Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Georgie, she's the first one I ever heard sing it,'' says Ed
Hunter, who played harmonica at that 1937 session in Middlesboro.
Still sure-footed at 78, he has outlived her by three decades and
lives 200 yards from where her family's home once stood. ''Where
she got it, I don't know,'' he says. ''There weren't many visitors,
and she didn't go nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlesboro then was even more isolated than today, nearly 50
miles of winding roads from the nearest interstate highway. Tucked
into rugged mountains just west of the Cumberland Gap, where
thousands came west in the 18th and 19th centuries, the town was
laid out by English iron-ore speculators. But even before that,
mountaineers of English, Scots and Irish stock, including some
Turners, built lives in the hills and, in their isolation,
preserved a rich tradition of music and balladry.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this, it seems, ''Rising Sun Blues'' -- aka ''House in New
Orleans'' or even ''Rising Sun Dance Hall'' -- bubbled up.
</P>
<P>
   It probably started as a bowdlerization of British folk songs.
Its melody, Lomax wrote, resembled one arrangement of ''Matty
Groves,'' an English ballad dating to the 1600s. In Britain, the
term ''Rising Sun'' has long been a euphemism for bordello; in
1953, aging English folk singer Harry Cox sung for Lomax a profane
old song called ''She Was a Rum One.'' Its opening: ''If you go to
Lowestoft, and ask for the Rising Sun, there you'll find two old
whores, and my old woman's one.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, ''House of the Rising Sun'' has always been more
lament than dirty ditty. Various accounts have it kicking around
the South since the Civil War, a cautionary tale for those who'd
stray. Sometimes, when it came from a man's mouth, it was a
gambler's song. More often, it was a woman's warning to shun that
house in New Orleans that's ''been the ruin of many a poor girl.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other musicians from the region were singing it between
the world wars. Clarence Ashley, born three mountains over from
Middlesboro in Bristol, Tenn., sang it as a rounder's lament. The
song, he said shortly before his death in 1967, was ''too old for
me to talk about. I got it from some of my grandpeople.'' And a
Library of Congress correspondent, in a handwritten version
submitted in 1925, said he learned it ''from a southerner ... of
the type that generally call themselves 'one o'th' boys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So it was out there. Ashley, who said he taught it to Roy Acuff,
may have recorded it in the 1920s, and the Library of Congress
cites (but does not have) a couple of 78-rpm records that
apparently date from before Georgia Turner sang it in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The world then was convulsing with innovation. Just as offset
printing brought sheet music to the masses in the 1800s, now the
revolution of records and radio was making the sound itself
portable.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Alan Lomax, who learned music-collecting from his father,
John, a folk-song gatherer since Theodore Roosevelt's time. The
Lomaxes believed technology was threatening local music,
introducing homogenization that could overrun regional expression.
Even so, by the mid-1930s, the son was using that very technology
to capture people singing songs ladled from the stew of regional
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It put neglected cultures and silenced people into the
communications chain,'' Alan Lomax said years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress sent him out to record those neglected
cultures. And in September 1937, his journeys took him to the hills
of Eastern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   What did he ask Georgia Turner to sing that day? Her favorite
song? The saddest? Lomax didn't say, and now it may be too late: At
85, he is incapacitated by stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after Lomax recorded her, two other Kentucky
musicians, both men from two counties north, sang versions of
''Rising Sun Blues'' into his Presto. Bert Martin in Horse Creek
accompanied himself on guitar; Daw Henson up in Billys Branch sang
a capella. And though Lomax did credit Martin for ''other
stanzas,'' it was Georgia Turner's version, the only one with the
verse that starts, ''My mother she's a tailor,'' that he remembered
best.
</P>
<P>
   So Lomax gave her version a bit of immortality: In 1941, he
included it in a songbook called ''Our Singing Country.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, he told his friends about it. And these weren't
just any friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, the New York folk scene was incubating as
musicians black and white gathered at each other's apartments to
share songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, more than being musicians, were popularizers.
Though Woody Guthrie came straight from small-town Oklahoma, his
strength was as a showman, bringing white regional experience -- via
his own songs and others' -- into a radio and phonograph world.
Huddie ''Lead Belly'' Ledbetter, a former prisoner from Louisiana,
and Josh White, who grew up touring with black musicians in the
1920s, were helping to make ''race music'' more mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Into this mix, Lomax brought ''The Rising Sun Blues.'' Some
might have already heard of it distantly, but he deposited it onto
their musical doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   White, especially, took to the song. His intense, minor-key
version, with the first melody that resembles the one familiar
today, introduced a black bluesman's sensibility that entranced an
audience different from Guthrie's. (Though Lomax said he taught
White the arrangement, White later said he learned it from a
''white hillbilly'' in North Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   Roots music was popping up everywhere. Lead Belly sent
''Goodnight, Irene'' on its way. Aaron Copland adapted fiddler W.H.
Stepp's version of ''Bonaparte's Retreat.'' Seeger, with his new
group, the Weavers, turned to Africa for the melodic ''Wimoweh,''
which became the foundation for ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with ''Rising Sun,'' which, with the Weavers' help,
became a standard during the folk revival of the 1950s and early
1960s. Clarence Ashley, meanwhile, was still singing his old-timey
version and teaching it to guitar picker Doc Watson. Each musician
brought a new interpretation, a new sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1961, a skinny 20-year-old Woody Guthrie fan from
Minnesota took a turn with the song. His musician friend Dave Van
Ronk had arranged a haunting version, and the singer decided
''House of the Risin' Sun'' would be a memorable part of his debut
album.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Bob Dylan was right.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, in the coal town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
England, an electrical worker's son named Eric Burdon had immersed
himself in blues and folk. He especially liked a local singer named
Johnny Handel, who sang of shipwrecks and local mining disasters
and favored a tune making the rounds called ''House of the Rising
Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   As Burdon's fledgling musical group, the Animals, came together,
he and bandmate Alan Price heard others singing it; Dylan and Josh
White made deep impressions. So in 1964, when Chuck Berry and Jerry
Lee Lewis came to Britain on tour and the Animals wanted in, the
song seemed an ideal solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized one thing: You can't out-rock Chuck Berry,'' says
Burdon, playing air guitar as he reminisces in New Orleans, which
he visits frequently. ''I thought, 'Why don't we take this song,
reorganize it, drop some of Dylan's lyrics and get Alan Price to
rearrange it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Through musicians like Dylan, Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and
Mary, the music of the folk revival had begun to be a real force in
pop and rock. And the Animals were more than willing to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Their version began with Hilton Valentine's now-famous guitar
riff. Then Burdon's ragged voice began spitting out lyrics almost
resentfully before the organ music kicked in. It was a throbbing,
uniquely 1960s anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The band joined the tour and ended the song with a lone red
light bathing Burdon. The audience went nuts, and the Animals went
straight to the recording studio. Their electric version of Georgia
Turner's favorite song swept across the radio waves. On Sept. 5,
1964, ''The House of the Rising Sun'' displaced The Supremes'
''Where Did Our Love Go?'' to become Billboard's No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   From there it went everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Through the decades, artist after artist claimed it and reshaped
it: Disco. Country rock. Jazz. Punk. Cajun. Elevator music. Even
German tango and harmonica renditions. A band called Frijid Pink
recorded a version that a young serviceman named Gillis Turner grew
to love while serving in Vietnam, and had no idea it was connected
to his Aunt Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that everybody who's had a bad day can relate to that
song,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was even appropriated into hip-hop, a genre that relies upon
the reinterpretation of music that came before. When Wyclef Jean
used the melody of ''House of the Rising Sun'' and added Haitian
lyrics, Georgia Turner's old song was enlisted once again -- to
lament racism and police brutality in New York City in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you delve into it, you realize how pervasive traditional
songs are in our culture,'' says Peggy Bulger, director of the
American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. ''They're so
much a part of us, but we don't even recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Sunday churchgoers are finishing lunch as a friendly 59-year-old
named Reno Taylor sits in a diner in Monroe, Mich., a pugnacious
Detroit satellite town. He is discussing his mother, Georgia
Turner, who died of emphysema in 1969 after 48 years of life.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers her talking of hard times down in Kentucky and how
they coped. ''They sang,'' he says, ''and they drank.''
</P>
<P>
   But her eldest son has not come only to reminisce; he has come
to hear his mother sing.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is preserved on that old Lomax acetate disc in a
climate-controlled Library of Congress archive, and the library has
copied it onto a cassette, which sits on the table, next to the
ketchup, in a handheld recorder. ''Play'' is pushed.	   ''There is a house in
New Orleans ...''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor tries to remain impassive. But this is, after all, the
voice of his mother, dead 31 years. And here she is as a girl,
singing the blues before life had dealt her so many reasons to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother she's a tailor ...''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's eyes betray nothing. He sits ramrod straight,
contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sweetheart he's a drunkard, Lord, Lord ...''
</P>
<P>
   Then his cheek muscles twitch. The hint of a smile dawns. It
can't hold itself in.
</P>
<P>
   ''One foot is on the platform ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Georgia Turner is buried on a hill a mile away, but for a
fleeting instant she is present in the Monroe Diner, serenading her
son on magnetic tape.
</P>
<P>
   He never knew about the ''Rising Sun'' connection; he was in the
service when Lomax tracked her down in 1963 and began sending what
royalties there were. By then, Lomax told her, the song had been
''pirated.'' Taylor's sister, Faye, has kept the stubs from the few
checks that came -- $117.50 total, hardly enough to help support 10
children.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor wishes she'd gotten enough to buy better medical
treatment. ''It would be so nice,'' he says, ''if she did get some
recognition for something she did good.''
</P>
<P>
   She did do good, it seems. Her favorite song is a ringing tone
for a mobile phone in Hong Kong. It's background music in a Thai
restaurant in Keene, N.H., and in a hotel in Nanchang, China -- and
how many places in between? On the Internet, musicians upload their
own Rising Suns; a few weeks ago, Gillis Turner's daughter
downloaded the Frijid Pink version he so loved in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Why this song? Who knows? Georgia Turner didn't create it, but
she sang it and it soared. Up from the folkways, onto the highways
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, a computer-generated ''House of the Rising
Sun'' file is credited this way: ''By everyone.'' And that's it
exactly. Each time a song moves from new mouth to fresh ear, it
carries its past along.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen just right, you can hear the chorus that came
before. Clarence Ashley and Roy Acuff and Doc Watson are singing;
so are Woody Guthrie and Josh White and Lead Belly, each long gone.
The Weavers are harmonizing. Eric Burdon is belting out his best.
Germany's Toots Thielemans is manning the mundharmonika.
</P>
<P>
   And you can hear, too, the miner's daughter from Middlesboro who
never asked for much and never got much in return. Georgia Turner,
dead and silent 31 years, is still singing the blues away.

<HEADLINE> Nations Urge End to Angola Civil War  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States, Russia and Portugal
called for stepped-up efforts to end the civil war in Angola and
discussed strengthening sanctions against UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries, which have been working together to promote
implementation of a 1994 peace accord, did not disclose Friday what
new sanctions they were considering. The United Nations has imposed
sanctions on UNITA's arms, fuel and diamond trade, in an attempt to
strangle its source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said that ''for the time
being, we expect that the sanctions against UNITA combined with
tougher regulations for denying the diamond traffic could produce
some effects.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's hope on the UNITA side the option for a political move
will be stronger than the remaining option for residual military
activities,'' he said in an interview Friday. ''That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly ministerial debate, the so-called Troika of Observer
Countries on Angola said they continue to believe that only the
1994 peace deal ''will lead to lasting peace and an inclusive
democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord collapsed in December 1998 after the government and
UNITA resumed fighting a war that began after Angola's independence
from Portugal in 1975. The U.N. peacekeeping force that had been
overseeing the accord, known as the Lusaka protocol, pulled out in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in a first step to restore a U.N. presence in the country, a
30-member U.N. office has been established to focus on humanitarian
assistance and to promote human rights. It will also maintain
liaison with the Angolan government, military and police.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries said in the statement agreed by their U.N.
ambassadors that they remain committed to assisting in the peace
process and would actively cooperate with the U.N. office.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's Gama cited several ''steps forward'' that have
increased the possibility of peace -- the U.N. role in humanitarian
and human rights issues, a string of recent military successes for
the Angolan government against UNITA, and government preparations
for elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now on the UNITA side to make decisive options,
abandoning the military choice, coming back to the ... Lusaka
agreements, and rehabilitating itself from its past conduct,'' Gama
said.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General Ibrahim Gambari, a U.N. special adviser
for Africa, said in July that the government's military campaign
and tightened U.N. sanctions on UNITA were beginning to weaken the
rebels' ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited several ''positive'' events indicating that
prospects for an end to the conflict may be emerging.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he said, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos suggested
Savimbi could be pardoned if he surrendered and renounced war. The
president also reaffirmed that the collapsed 1994 peace deal was
still valid.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan government previously said it would no longer
negotiate with Savimbi because he reneged on the 1994 deal -- as
well as two prior ones.

<HEADLINE> Arrests Intensify in Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's
regime cracked down on opponents Saturday with several more arrests
of opposition activists ahead of this month's national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the popular, anti-Milosevic student group,
Otpor, were arrested in Belgrade for pasting posters urging people
to vote against Milosevic in the Sept. 24 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Otpor activists were arrested but later released in the
northern town of Subotica near the border with Hungary, the group's
central office said.
</P>
<P>
   A leading human rights group in Serbia, the Humanitarian Law
Fund, said police had beaten two Otpor members Friday for
distributing leaflets and stickers calling for resistance to
Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the president's main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica,
said that ''all that is happening now proves that the elections are
already unfair,'' the private Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has been campaigning across the country as the
presidential candidate proposed by 18 allied opposition parties,
united with the common goal to oust the autocratic president.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are struggling for is not a revolution, but democracy.
Most of all we need a normal life in a normal country... a
government that will put an end to the sanctions imposed by the
international community and ensure that people can lead decent,
peaceful lives,'' Kostunica said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 22 opposition activists were arrested in various
towns. Police raided at least two offices of non-government groups,
seizing computers and holding the detainees who were released after
hours-long questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear more, serious violence in coming days. Milosevic, who
tightly controls the country's armed forces as well as the powerful
state media, has showed resolve to stay in power at any cost.

<HEADLINE> U.S. court: 37 Swiss firms sought protection on slave-labor claims  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) - Thirty-seven Swiss companies, including some
well-known firms, sought protection from a U.S. court against
lawsuits over possible use of slave labor by German subsidiaries
during the Nazi era, documents disclosed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A deadline set by the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn prompted
the Swiss firms, most of which previously had been silent on their
possible involvement, to come forward, said a court-appointed
expert.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents posted on the Internet, giant
corporations Nestle, Roche and Novartis told a federal judge that
subsidiaries they owned in Germany or Nazi-occupied areas during
World War II used slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies said they could rule out any use of slave labor,
but that they were signing up any way. They thus receive protection
against separate U.S. lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland was not only a World War II banking center but also
a manufacturing base that used its neutrality to deal with both the
Nazis and the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were among the latest additions to an Internet
site that advises Holocaust survivors about progress in their $1.25
billion settlement with Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week the court-appointed expert, or ''special
master,'' Judah Gribetz, recommended on the site that the bulk of
the money should go to Holocaust victims and their heirs who had
claims to deposits in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   But Gribetz said former slave laborers - whether or not they
worked for Swiss subsidiaries - should receive between $500 and
$1,000 from the Swiss fund in addition to whatever the obtain from
a German fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz said that would save ''millions'' in administrative
costs and spare the former slave laborers from having to figure out
whether the company they had worked for was Swiss- or German-owned.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was impossible to say how many people had been forced
to work for the Swiss subsidiaries. Initial numbers are low, but an
estimate of 11,000 ''does not appear unreasonable,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last July, Judge Edward Korman said Swiss companies
which seek releases from slave labor claims should identify
themselves to the court within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chief Judge Korman's order appears to have prompted a great
many Swiss corporations to examine the slave labor use of their
wartime subsidiaries,'' Gribetz' report said.
</P>
<P>
   It ''clearly contributed to a greater understanding of the scope
of slave labor use by companies owned by Swiss entities,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz said the Swiss firms that contacted him before the
deadline sought ''releases for themselves and for hundreds of their
subsidiary companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The companies writing to the special master included small
businesses bankrupted after the war as well as some of the largest
industrial conglomerates in Switzerland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The firms include a wide range of industries, especially
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, aluminum and armaments.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies said their records were incomplete for the
era. Others said they did not believe their wartime subsidiaries
used slave labor, but they sought court protection because they
were unable to rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   The food giant Nestle identified seven German plants where it
understood slave labor was used, Gribetz said. Pharmaceutical group
Novartis said it had found two sites owned by its predecessor that
had used slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering and manufacturing conglomerate ABB Ltd., formerly
known as Brown Boveri and Cie., identified six subsidiaries that
used or possibly used slave labor. The aluminum-manufacturing
Alusuisse Group named five German subsidiaries which ''employed
force laborers assigned to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestle has taken the lead in coming forward about the issue. It
said last month it was giving $14.1 million toward the settlement
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is either certain or it may be assumed that some
corporations of the Nestle Group that were active in countries
controlled by the National Socialist (Nazi) regime employed forced
laborers,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis and Roche, another drug manufacturer, said this week
they, too, would each pay $14.1 million into the fund in the
expectation that would cover any possible claims against them.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though they acknowledged slave labor use to Korman,
their press releases earlier this week did not say they knew of any
cases.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Minister Dies in Crash  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A Muslim politician often called the
''kingmaker'' was killed along with 14 others Saturday when a Sri
Lankan air force helicopter crashed into a hill and exploded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mi-17 helicopter was flying between the capital Colombo and
Ampara, 130 miles to the east, where Ports Minister M. H. M.
Ashraff was to attend election meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Police ruled out the possibility that the helicopter had been
shot down by Tamil rebels, who are fighting to establish a separate
homeland in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   ''The probable cause is a technical failure,'' said Commodore
Lal Perera, director of Air Force Aeronautical Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he boarded the helicopter, Ashraff, 52, wrote a
statement withdrawing his party's legislative support of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper lost contact with the Colombo control tower and
crashed into a hilly area in Aranayake, 40 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Aranayake police said the fire hampered rescue efforts. The
rescue team traveled by jeep, then walked to the crash site, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fourteen bodies were brought to the hospital in a charred
state,'' said Habiba Jabir, medical officer in the nearby Mawanella
district.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being badly burned, she said the minister's body had
been identified by close friends. Only three others have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were a candidate from Ashraff's party, two
supporters, four security personnel and five crew members. The
identity of the others was not known.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after his death, Ashraff said: ''From
today, the National Unity Alliance and the Sri Lanka Muslim
Congress disassociate themselves completely (from) the People's
Alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashraff formed the National Unity Alliance Coalition
representing all communities in Sri Lanka, and led its main
constituent, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, which he formed in 1981
to represent the country's minority 1.1 million Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   His rise in politics gave the Muslim community more clout in Sri
Lanka. His party has seven seats in Parliament, crucial in a house
where the government has a single-seat majority. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ashraff, known as the ''kingmaker,'' pulled back support after a
report in the Daily News quoted D. M. Jayaratne, the general
secretary of the People's Alliance, as saying that the NUA was not
a partner of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A former lawyer, Ashraff is survived by his wife Ferial and son,
Aman, 20.

<HEADLINE> India PM Backs Better U.S. Relations  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton expressed hope Saturday that
the United States and India can ''turn back what could otherwise be
a dangerous tide'' of weapons proliferation, and Washington can
help bring peace in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
Clinton told reporters after a ceremony where the two leaders
dedicated a statue of Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi
that he hopes the countries ''will be better economic partners,
better political partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, who spoke before Congress and met with Clinton at the
White House this week, remained silent as Clinton spoke of the
nuclear proliferation peril.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee ordered tests in May 1998, and Pakistan followed with
tests of its own. This year, Clinton described the subcontinent as
perhaps the ''most dangerous place'' in the world, but he refrained
from such comments during Vajpayee's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we will both be able to help to turn back what could
otherwise be a dangerous tide of proliferation and dangerous
weapons -- not just nuclear warheads or missiles, either -- chemical
weapons, biological weapons,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope someday there will be some constructive role we can
play as a partner working with India and others to bring peace to
the subcontinent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   India has said it would not stand in the way of the treaty's
implementation, indicating that once major powers such as the
United States and China ratify it, India will be prepared to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, India has pledged to maintain a moratorium on
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony Saturday at a park outside the Indian
Embassy, Clinton and Vajpayee sprinkled red rose petals at the
front of the almost 9-foot-high statue, which shows Mahatma Gandhi
in a pose leaning against a staff.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old prime minister, assisted by Clinton because of a
bad left knee that will be replaced, called the dedication ''one of
the finest moments'' in U.S.-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, asked about the visit, which includes a gala White
House dinner Sunday night, said, ''I think it's been a great
success. It sort of rounds out our efforts to make a different turn
in our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vajpayee praised the progress in relations, agreeing on
more cooperative programs, particularly economic deals, but still
refusing to budge on nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
   The White House meeting Friday reflected ''the considerable
progress made between the two countries even within six months,''
Vajpayee said. In March, Clinton visited India and laid the
groundwork for the White House session.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister met with U.S. and Indian business leaders
Friday night and discussed recent and planned changes in Indian
regulations to privatize state utilities and other industries. He
was there to woo foreign investment to help India gain the
high-tech infrastructure it needs to expand its economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he expressed awe at U.S. economic power. ''The
continued U.S. prosperity is almost a miracle,'' he said, adding
that it has ''inspired India.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreements were announced on enhancing cooperation on such
issues as trade, investment, counterterrorism, counterdrug issues,
energy and the environment, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over nuclear issues remained, but as the day
unfolded a strong sense emerged of a new comfort level between the
two countries and a perception that problems can be dealt with in a
trusting atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Whitman admits 'mistakes' in 1st speech to NAACP after frisk photo  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) - Admitting ''I've made mistakes,'' Gov.
Christie Whitman addressed the state NAACP convention Saturday for
the first time since the now-infamous photo of her frisking a black
man during a police sweep in Camden surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The governor acknowledged lingering resentment over the photo in
the black community, but said black clergy and community leaders
know she has worked hard to improve things for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman made only an oblique reference to the incident in her
speech, which was devoted mainly to a defense of affirmative action
and a pledge to ensure that no one gets left behind in the state's
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview afterward, Whitman said she realizes black
anger over the photo has not completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at all surprised there's still some resentment,'' she
said. ''That was a bad photo; there's no question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 4-year-old photograph obtained by The Associated Press,
Whitman is standing behind a black man, his arms spread, palms
pressed against a wall. The governor is wearing jeans, a sweat
shirt, a baseball cap and black gloves and appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken during a police sweep of a Camden neighborhood. The
governor said she participated in the pat-down search because she
wanted to fully experience police work. The man in the photo was
not charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's comments on Saturday seemed to indicate a softening of
her position on the photo. Immediately after it became public, she
adopted a defiant stance and refused calls for her to apologize,
suggesting critics were trying to ''bully'' her out of making
reforms in Camden, New Jersey's poorest city, including a takeover
of municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milton Milan has been indicted on corruption charges, the
third of the city's last four mayors to face charges.
</P>
<P>
   Before Whitman arrived at the convention, held at the Somerset
Marriott, some speakers criticized the administration's handling of
Camden, noting continued problems there.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at Camden today, and if I lived in Camden, I'd say
enough hasn't been done, too,'' Whitman said after her speech.
''But it's more than has been done in any other administration. We
have one of the finest charter schools in Camden. We have new
housing starts; we're building new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with Camden is getting past an administration that
one after another has been stealing hope from the residents,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Some NAACP officials said Whitman's appearance before the group
should help ease tensions over the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see her doing something deliberately negative toward
anybody,'' said Mary Lee Gilmore, the New Jersey chapter's
secretary. ''People wonder why she did that photo. I think she did
it because she was asked to; she didn't realize the negative side
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not that kind of person,'' Gilmore said. ''I try to tell
people that's not her.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Raymond Daniels, who is heading the group's voter
registration efforts, said he was encouraged Whitman addressed the
conference. He noted she has addressed past NAACP conferences as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her presence, I think, makes a great statement,'' he said.
''Any opportunity for a (politician) from either party to reach out
to minorities is a good thing.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Leader Details 'Complexities'  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Fiji's interim prime minister outlined a
schedule Saturday to return the South Pacific island nation to
constitutional rule and urged countries that imposed sanctions
after its May coup to try to understand the ''complexities'' of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minster Laisenia Qarase devoted almost his entire speech
to the U.N. General Assembly's ministerial debate to explaining the
ethnic makeup of Fiji and the tensions that led to the country's
political crisis earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all live together side by side in Fiji, yet we remain
apart, separated by our ethnicity, religion and cultural
differences and our value systems,'' he said. ''I am committed to
building a united Fiji with a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural
society where all the different communities can live together in
peace, harmony and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians make up 44 percent of the nation's 814,000
population while indigenous Fijians make up 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman George Speight launched a coup May 19 in the
name of indigenous Fijians, who he said have been marginalized by
economically powerful Fijians of Indian decent.
</P>
<P>
   The coup toppled the democratically elected government of Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, who was the first ethnic Indian to lead
the country. Speight was arrested July 26, just days after
releasing the last of the hostages he seized after storming
Parliament and taking Chaudhry and others hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is now ruled by an interim government installed by the
military. Qarase has said his administration will work to redraw
Fiji's constitution to guarantee that indigenous Fijians hold top
political jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he hopes to hold fresh elections in two years and on
Saturday gave a detailed timetable for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution will be ready by August 2001, he said, with
general elections to follow within 12 months. A constitutional
commission to draft the new document will be appointed early next
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be representative of all our communities and it will
consult widely throughout the country giving the public at large
every opportunity to submit their advice and recommendations on the
new constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Qarase complained bitterly about the sanctions
imposed by Australia, New Zealand, the United States, France and
the Commonwealth on Fiji following the coup, saying they had done
nothing to solve the political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, the very opposite is true; they have only served to
harden attitudes of one community against the other,'' he said. ''I
therefore make a plea to members of the United Nations to show
greater understanding of, and sensitivity to, the complexities of
the situation in Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include cutting military links, slashing aid,
ending foreign scholarships and banning visits by Fijian sports
teams.

<HEADLINE> Grandmother of missing N.J. arrested; children recovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - The fugitive grandmother of 5-year-old
twins was arrested Friday after returning the children to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Marilyn Parsons, 53, was located in Tijuana,
Mexico, where she had been staying with the twins, Bobby and
Brittany Allison. She had been charged in Clifton with abducting
the children during a court-ordered visitation on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' son and the children's mother, Elena Allison, are
separated. Allison was awarded custody of the children, the FBI
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Gore, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Diego
office, said Parsons voluntarily returned to the United States with
the children, where she was arrested on a charge of unlawful flight
to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons is being held at the Las Colinas Womens' Detention
Center in Sanatee, Calif., where she will await extradition
proceedings to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The twins were taken to a local children's center pending their
return to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   They were visiting Parsons at her Dagsboro, Del., home when they
disappeared just days before a court hearing in which Allison was
attempting to have Parsons' visitation rights revoked, claiming the
grandmother was telling the children false stories about her.

<HEADLINE> Man accused of warning neighbors of pedophile's placement in group home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - An employee of the Southbury Training
School is accused of distributing the confidential records of a
known pedophile to residents of the community into which the client
was being placed.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Smith, 40, pleaded innocent Friday in Waterbury Superior
Court to a charge of unlawful removal of records.
</P>
<P>
   In an arrest affidavit, authorities claim Smith copied the files
of a 56-year-old mentally retarded man described as ''an
opportunistic same-sex pedophile with a long history of sexually
offending others, including children.'' The client's name has not
been released.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities claim Smith delivered the files to residents and
businesses near the Farmington group home into which the client was
to be placed. The home is located in a residential neighborhood
near two public schools, a day care center and the University of
Connecticut Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   The files included a statement from the client that read, ''When
I get returned, I'm going to get the first kid I see.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Mental Retardation blocked the client's
move to Farmington after his records got out.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Carpenter, who received copies of the client's
documents in her mailbox June 11, said she's happy to defend a man
she calls ''a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she doesn't know whether Smith distributed the records.
But she's convinced neighborhood children would have been harmed if
homeowners hadn't been tipped off.
</P>
<P>
   ''This person did the right moral thing,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is on paid administrative leave from the training school
pending an administrative investigation, director Fritz Gorst said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an unfortunate thing,'' Gorst said. ''The rights of the
individual involved were violated.''
</P>
<P>
   The client is not listed on the sexual offender registry
maintained by the Connecticut Department of Public Safety,
officials said. It was not clear Friday whether the man has ever
been charged with a sex-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   Martin C. Zito, chief of staff for the mental retardation
department, said confidentiality rules prohibit him from discussing
the client's background. He is also forbidden from speaking about
the reasons for moving the client to Farmington, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, clients undergo a rigorous review by an
interdisciplinary team before placement in a group home is
considered.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Vietnam Flood Waters Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodian troops struggled Saturday
to build a three-mile wall to stop flooding in a northeastern town,
as rising water displaced families and threatened the capital,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 soldiers and police were building the sandbag wall
to protect the provincial capital of Kratie, home to 20,000 people,
provincial deputy military commander Lt. Col. Mao Theavy said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Water had risen four inches in the last day, he said. The town
lies on the swollen Mekong River about 100 miles northeast of Phnom
Penh, where the speed of the water's rise seemed to be easing,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Flood levels remain about a foot below the point where the
center of Cambodia's capital would be inundated, although some
outlying rural districts were flooded. Home to one million people,
Phnom Penh lies at the confluence of three rivers, including the
Mekong.
</P>
<P>
   Record flooding in Cambodia and Vietnam has affected more than a
million people in recent weeks, killing more than 100 and leaving
thousands homeless, in need of food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, floods killed four people in Dong Thap since July
and 11 more, including 10 children, in An Giang province, officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier disaster report found flooding had killed about 94
people in Cambodia since July, when heavy rains began a month-and-a
half ahead of monsoon season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the flooding is the worst in 70 years. Weather
forecasters say water levels on the Mekong River have surpassed
that of disastrous 1996 floods that left nearly 200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of Laos and Thailand have also been flooded. The Mekong
River cuts through or skirts all four countries and feeds numerous
tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Rice paddies and rural communities in southern Vietnam's Mekong
Delta have become ''desolate lakes,'' the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Vietnam said in a report
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk, who had gone to Beijing for a
routine medical checkup, returned Saturday, a month earlier than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a hurry to meet my compatriots,'' Sihanouk, 77, was
overheard telling Health Minister Hong Sun Huot, one of dozens of
top officials standing in line along a red carpet to welcome him at
Phnom Penh airport.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, wind and rain from Tropical Storm Saomai battered
South Korea's coast Saturday, killing two people and submerging
rice paddies and homes. One elderly man died in a mudslide near the
southern town of Kosung, police said, and another died after being
struck by flying debris in nearby Chinhae City.
</P>
<P>
   Two children were missing after they were swept away in
rain-swollen streams in North Kyongsang Province of central Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical storm headed out to the Sea of Japan later
Saturday, where its force was expected to further weaken, weather
officials said.

<HEADLINE> State police investigating how documents from State Library ended up in Pequot museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State police have launched a criminal
investigation in an attempt to determine whether documents on
display at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum were stolen from the
archives of the State Library.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was requested by State Librarian Kendall
Wiggin on advice from Attorney General Richard Blumenthal's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal cautioned Friday that the criminal complaint does not
imply that state officials believe tribal members did anything
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact the Mashantuckets may themselves be the victims if
they legitimately purchased documents that had been stolen from the
state archives,'' he said. ''But the theft of that state property
is obviously an extraordinarily serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashantucket tribal lawyer Patrice Kunesh on Friday called
Wiggin to allow state archivists to examine the documents next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggin has said he is concerned about two Mashantucket-related
records, an 1857 court petition and an 1856 land record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had sufficient reason to believe that at least one of those
documents may be from our collection,'' Wiggin said Friday. But he
also said the Mashantuckets may have additional documents taken
from the state archives.
</P>
<P>
   Mashantucket officials released a copy of an Aug. 1 memorandum
Wiggin sent to the tribe identifying three collections of documents
at the museum that ''appear to have originally belonged to the
Connecticut State Library.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum also raised questions about six other
collections, but Wiggin wrote that ''it is impossible to determine
without direct examination whether or not some may at one time have
belonged'' to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Mashantucket officials said this week they believe they obtained
the 1857 petition around 1992 through a private sale or donation,
but have been unable to locate an invoice.
</P>
<P>
   Under its security procedures, the library should have records
of people who handled the missing Mashantucket-related documents.
Researchers who want to work with archival records must obtain
photo IDs, submit written requests for documents and submit to
searches of their personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials tightened procedures in 1980 in response to a
theft of letters from U.S. Marshal W.B. ''Bat'' Masterson, which
were recovered in Colorado by the FBI. It is the last known theft
of documents from the library.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - As Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become
a hurricane and strike Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Jeb Bush on
Saturday activated emergency response teams.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1
hurricane with winds of 74 to 95 mph when it strikes land anywhere
between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas
could expect a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning
Saturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just
south of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch
from Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said
Gordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39
and 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A
hurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could
hit within the next 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. EDT, Gordon was located about 355 miles southwest of
Tampa, with winds of 65 mph, 9 mph below hurricane strength. Two to
five inches of rain are expected across portions of South Florida
and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast
began recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier
islands and coastal or low lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties
told residents they should start packing, and that shelters would
be opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later
forecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic
coast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space
shuttle Discovery off it's seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.
Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction
mission on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba
early Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city
of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday
as Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the
storm is not expected to score a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was
reported, the National Hurricane Center said.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. EDT, Florence was 125 miles north of Bermuda and was
moving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed
hurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those are expected to miss the
island, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least
three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a third disturbance was sighted in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical depression with 35 mph winds was located about 260
miles east of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west
near 17 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm watch is in effect for the islands of Antigua,
Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, Saba
and St. Eustatius in the Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are likely over
parts of the Leewards later Saturday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - In the crowd that night were a cheerleader eager
to start college, a math and science whiz, another young man crazy
for sports and girls, and two guys known as regular church-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Royster and the boys, Robert Savage, Darryl Tyson, James
Stone and Jamel Murphy, were all from nice homes in respectable
neighborhoods in the New York City borough of Queens. The same
words came up over and over to describe the five teen-agers: good,

   But prosecutors and police charge another word needs to be added
to the list - murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The friends, ages 14 to 17, are accused of viciously beating to
death a Chinese food deliveryman earlier this month after luring
him to a vacant house. According to police, the motive was simple:
they wanted a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   The teens' families and friends are struggling to understand how
these youngsters could have committed the brutal crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not happen here,'' said Savage's neighbor, Troy
McIver.
</P>
<P>
   But it did - just as have other outrageous crimes that produced
big headlines after otherwise normal teen-agers got together as a
group.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's TV movie ''Our Guys'' recalled the tragic 1989 rape
of a mentally retarded girl by four popular high school athletes in
Glen Ridge, N.J. Just last month, seven boys were charged with
brutally beating a man walking home in Tacoma, Wash. They had
apparently grown bored while attending a barbecue, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the phrase ''good kids'' was used for the accused.
</P>
<P>
   So how could they allegedly do such horrible things?
</P>
<P>
   James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Boston's
Northeastern University, said the teens got caught up in a ''group
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids will do things in groups that they will never do on their
own,'' said Fox. ''It's not just that they get caught up in the
moment - it's really that the admiration and the approval of your
peers becomes all-important, more important than the safety of the
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Sickmund, a senior research associate at the National
Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, Pa., said there's often
a diffusion of responsibility in large groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like a mob effect - people seem to lose their
minds,'' Sickmund said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stop the violence probably never occurred to any of
the youths, Sickmund and Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being ostracized by your friends, being called a chicken, is
seen as a fate worse than anything the criminal justice system can
mete out,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, the teens wouldn't have killed the food
deliveryman because they wanted a free meal. ''It's not satisfying
their hunger that's the motivator - satisfying their need for
approval is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Savage, 14, and Stone, 16, say their clients'
families are in shock, finding it difficult to understand how their
boys could do such a thing. Attorneys for Royster, Murphy and Tyson
- all 17 years old - did not return repeated telephone calls for
comment. The teens' families refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''What his parents tell me, he hasn't been a discipline
problem,'' said Rudy Hirschheimer, Savage's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been no prior problems, nothing like that,'' said
Victor Knapp, Stone's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   To try and understand what happened, Fox said you have to
analyze the teens' friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's the leader who enjoys seeing people do what he says.
And the followers who enjoy being praised,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Richard Bellucci, head of the 113th Precinct's Detective
Squad, said police were still sorting out exactly what happened, so
it's not certain who hatched the scheme to rob Liu on Sept. 1 as
the five teens were hanging out together.
</P>
<P>
   There was Royster, so eager to start college she had already
packed her backpack and set it aside in her bedroom lined with
awards given for her cheerleading at Christ the King High School.
</P>
<P>
   She was introduced to three of the boys by her close friend
Tyson, who couldn't stop talking about sports and girls. Stone and
Murphy are a lot alike - both come from church-going families and
love sports. Murphy spent most of his summer nights coaching a
children's basketball team. Savage was called a smart kid who was
unfailingly polite to adults. Neighbors said he often did errands
for them.
</P>
<P>
   All five had just finished eating Chinese food but wanted more,
and this time they didn't feel like paying for it, said Queens
District Attorney Richard A. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   So they allegedly concocted a scheme to phone for takeout and
have the food delivered to a vacant house, then throw a sheet over
the delivery guy, grab the food and run.
</P>
<P>
   Royster used her cell phone to call the Golden Wok and placed
their $60 order - General Tso's chicken, chicken with broccoli,
shrimp egg foo yong, and shrimp lo mein. The teens grabbed a sheet
and - in case the deliveryman struggled - armed themselves with a
few bricks, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 11:30 p.m., Sheng Jin Liu arrived in his car. The
44-year-old Chinese immigrant owned the restaurant and made the
deliveries, while his wife and two teen-aged children did the
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Royster met him near his car. The four boys appeared and
allegedly threw the sheet over Liu's head. Then the beating began,
said Deputy Chief Patrick Timlin, head of the Queens detective
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was punched and kicked. Police said that Savage - the
youngest and perhaps the most in need of peer approval - picked up
a brick and hit Liu in the head. The teens then grabbed one of the
two bags of food and ran off.
</P>
<P>
   They ate the food at Tyson's house. The other bag of food was
nibbled on by neighborhood cats.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's wife called police when he didn't return, and officers
found him quickly by simply tracing the delivery order to the crime
scene. But when they arrived, Liu was already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Police cracked this case nearly as quickly by analyzing
telephone calls to the restaurant. One was traced back to Royster's
cell phone. Four days after Liu was killed, all five teens were
arrested at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Each was charged with the same offenses: second-degree murder,
robbery and criminal possession of a weapon. All remain behind bars
without bail. Because of his age, Savage faces a maximum sentence
of nine years to life in prison if convicted. The other four face
up to 25 years to life.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Troops Mass on Island  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Thousands of Philippine troops
pursued fleeing Muslim rebels Saturday and helicopter gunships
strafed their hide-outs from the air. The fate of their 19
hostages, including an American, was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The military imposed a news blackout after the surprise attack
aimed at rescuing the hostages held in a remote jungle on Jolo
island. Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday
following nearly five months of negotiations with Abu Sayyaf rebels
and the reported payment of more than $15 million in ransom for
other captives.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada said his patience broke after the
rebels, who claim they are fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the southern Philippines, seized a new group of hostages
from Malaysia on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have exhausted all efforts toward a negotiated
settlement,'' he said in a nationally televised speech. ''We will
not allow kidnappers or other lawless elements to mock our laws or
control our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Malaysia expressed concern about the
decision to attack the rebel camps, saying it could endanger the
lives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Various Abu Sayyaf factions are holding an American Muslim, two
French journalists, three Malaysians, a Filipino captured in April
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   A military officer on Jolo said two rebels were confirmed dead
and four injured in Saturday's fighting, but there were no reports
of military casualties. Five injured civilians were being treated
at a Jolo hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said 17 rebels were captured.
</P>
<P>
   The military was checking unconfirmed reports that the American,
Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland, Calif., was killed during an escape
attempt Friday and that the evangelists were executed by a rebel
firing squad after the military attack began, an official said. The
military also was trying to verify a report that the two French
journalists had escaped, said the official, who spoke on the
condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had earlier threatened to attack southern Philippine
cities and behead Schilling if troops launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and transportation links to Jolo were cut, isolating
panicked villagers who streamed into the island's capital and
snapped up goods in crowded grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Support for a military assault has soared since the rebels
abducted three more people last week from a Malaysian diving resort
-- despite their earlier pledge not to seize more captives while
negotiations were underway.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping came just one day after the rebels released four
Europeans -- the last foreigners from a group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from another Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, who cut short a visit to the United States to deal with
the crisis, said the continuing abductions showed the Abu Sayyaf
were ''plain terrorists and bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   The military had prepared for weeks for an assault on the rebel
camps. On Friday, Mercado said the armed forces were ''like an
arrow drawn against a bow'' waiting for orders to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the arrow has been released,'' he said Saturday.
''We hope it can find its target.''
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac criticized the assault, saying
he was concerned it might put the French journalists in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safety of Roland Madura and Jean-Jacques Le Garrec is
France's only priority, and we consider the Philippines responsible
for this,'' Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The French Defense Ministry was in contact with Philippine
military leaders, and Defense Minister Alain Richard asked his U.S.
counterpart, William Cohen, to convey France's concerns over the
safety of the hostages to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Manila on Friday, Cohen had said the United
States hoped the hostages could be released peacefully, but that a
decision on whether to use force was up to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he
was concerned about the safety of the Malaysian hostages, but that
''what the Philippine army does against separatist groups or those
out to create chaos in the country is its own responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippine presidential spokesman Ricardo Puno echoed that
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a matter that the Philippines has to decide on its
own,'' Puno said. ''Because after all, when the French leave, we
will be left with the problem here in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages had been suspended
because of rising tensions among Abu Sayyaf factions over the
division of ransom money from the release of earlier hostages.
Negotiators say more than $15 million in ransom has been paid,
about $10 million of it by Libya for 10 Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Critics had warned that large ransom payments would encourage
new waves of kidnappings in the troubled southern Philippines, home
of the country's Muslim minority.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Ross-Death Penalty, Conn Bjt,600  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pro forma execution date for serial killer Michael Ross has
come and gone, with no clear schedule in sight for his appeal
before the Connecticut Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' defense lawyers are still waiting for thousands of pages
of transcripts that record every minute of his monthlong death
penalty hearing, from the individual questioning of jurors to the
judge's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are long periods of time in appeals when nothing
happens. This is one of those times,'' said public defender Mark
Rademacher, who is helping handle the mandatory appeal.
</P>
<P>
   When Ross got six death sentences in May, New London Superior
Court Judge Thomas P. Miano set Sept. 15 as the execution date. But
that date was delayed by an automatic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, defense lawyers have notified the court only that they
plan to appeal based on alleged errors in the way Miano handled the
case. More specific points for appeal will have to be filed later.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts are expected to be complete by December at the
earliest. Defense lawyers then comb through the official record to
find any fault that the high court may see as grounds to grant Ross
a new trial or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''In capital cases, they generally throw everything in -
including the kitchen sink,'' said Senior State's Attorney Tim
Sugrue, who has represented the state in previous Ross appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, however, sometimes point out significant errors
that spare the criminal's life.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Johnson had his death sentence overturned in the 1991
killing of State Police Sgt. Russell Bagshaw. The Supreme Court
found Johnson should get life in prison because his crimes did not
meet the ''especially heinous, cruel or depraved'' standard that
would warrant an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' original death sentence from 1987 was overturned on appeal
and a new penalty hearing was ordered because information that
might have helped make the case for a life sentence was withheld
from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the new penalty hearing last winter, a jury decided Ross
should get six death sentences for killing 14-year-old friends
April Brunais and Leslie Shelley, and for raping and killing Wendy
Baribeault, 17, and Robin Stavinsky, 19, in New London County in
1983 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' trial lawyer, Barry Butler, said he counted at least 51
appealable issues during the penalty hearing, including motions
about testimony and evidence that the judge denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any denied motion is grounds for an appeal,'' Butler said.
''In Connecticut, we don't execute people until the Supreme Court
reviews it - and that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of Ross' victims have said they hope the appeal and
execution is carried out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing Debra
Smith Taylor, 23, and Tammy Williams, 17, in Windham County in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Ross previously had said he did not want any non-mandatory
appeals to be filed, to spare his victims' families more pain. He
once tried to go straight to his execution by signing a deal with
prosecutors - a deal that Miano rejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he was sentenced to death again in May, he said he would
allow his lawyers to pursue the appeals necessary to finish the
legal process.

<HEADLINE> In first major American show in decades, Met explores pivotal time for New York </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Strolling through the Metropolitan Museum of
Art's first major American exhibit in three decades is an
awe-inspiring journey through the rise of money, power and
creativity in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second quarter of the 19th century was an amazing time in
this city,'' said Catherine Hoover Voorsanger, who organized the
show with John K. Howat. ''The New York we know today was really
created during this period.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' which
opens Sunday and runs through Jan. 7, 2001, is also about much more
than the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the art history of this country as seen through
the lens of New York, which becomes the cultural and commercial
capital of the country during this time period, and the largest
city in the Western Hemisphere,'' Voorsanger said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is the first American exhibit of its size at the
museum since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The show covers the time between the completion of the Erie
Canal and the start of the Civil War, an era when artists first
found they had to come to New York if they were going to be truly
successful, and when the term ''shopping'' was coined.
</P>
<P>
   Lord &AMP; Taylor opened in 1826, Tiffany's (then known as Tiffany
and Young) opened in 1837 and Central Park opened in 1859 (the Met
itself was formed in 1870). The Associated Press and The New York
Times were both founded during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as obvious as the nose on our face. New York was the
center of things starting from 1825. But it's a period that's
really been overlooked,'' Voorsanger said. ''The density of
material is staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is ambitious and there's a lot to cover, a testimony to
the wealth and creative energy of the period. It took five years to
organize the exhibit, during which time a wish list of over 1,000
works was honed down to 310 gems from 84 lenders in the United
States and Europe. Many of the pieces have never before been on
public display.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is accompanied by a catalog of the same name, with
hundreds of color illustrations and text by more than a dozen
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a replica of the Battery Park boardwalk - complete
with a couple dressed up for a 19th-century stroll, ''Art and the
Empire City'' is divided into a dozen galleries organized
thematically within a chronological framework.
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with art works surrounding the 1825 competition of
the Erie Canal, which established the city as the gateway to the
West. Highlights include a full-length portrait of the Marquis de
Lafayette, much beloved at the time for his role in the
Revolutionary War, by Samuel F.B. Morse (on loan from City Hall),
and a pair of monumental silver vases given to Gov. De Witt Clinton
for his role in envisioning and overseeing the building of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a portrait gallery that recalls the Governor's Room
in City Hall as it looked around 1825. It is a window into the
important personalities of the time: Alexander Hamilton, the
nation's first treasury secretary, painter John Trumbull, President
Andrew Jackson, poet and newspaper editor William Cullen Bryant and
author Washington Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Next is a gallery on neoclassical architecture, with
architectural drawings and a facade from the Branch Bank of the
United States. And the fourth gallery, with furnishings dating from
1830 to 1845, gives the feel of one of the period's upscale homes.
Besides stunning ceramics, glassware, silver and furnishings, it
includes pilasters - rectangular supports or columns - and a
mahogany door from a grand Grecian-style house built in Brooklyn in
the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   Also examined is the interrelationship between the visual arts
and literature - including masterworks like Thomas Cole's 1825
painting, ''Last of the Mohicans,'' inspired by the James Fennimore
Cooper novel.
</P>
<P>
   And one gallery exploring connoisseurship and art collecting
shows some of the works that 19th century city dwellers would have
appreciated at a time when top quality foreign art works were on
public display or were acquired by wealthy New Yorkers for their
private collections.
</P>
<P>
   In the next is a sampling of works and displays seen in 1853 at
a major fair in The New York Crystal Palace, housed in a grand
building of cast-iron and glass in midtown Manhattan which stood
where Bryant Park, alongside the New York Public Library, is now
located.
</P>
<P>
   In counterpoint to the portrait gallery at the beginning of the
show, the gallery on ''Photography, the New Medium'' shows early
New York daguerreotypes and paper prints. Suddenly, this new style
of portraiture becomes accessible for anyone from the illustrious
P.T. Barnum and Walt Whitman to a fireman (who poses with hat and
horn) and a grocery boy with his parcel. There are even a few of
the earliest art photos, which look startlingly contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Great Emporium'' raises thoughts of window shopping on
Madison Avenue or Fifth Avenue and shows what made some of the
city's first shopaholics drool. There are elegant gowns and
gleaming silver, ornate furniture and pearled jewelry from the
early Tiffany's worn by Abraham Lincoln's wife - with lots in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The show culminates with a dramatic display of Frederic Edwin
Church's monumental 1859 painting, ''The Heart of the Andes,''
presented as it was originally - as a single picture in a darkened
room. It is shown in a reconstruction of the original elaborate,
freestanding wooden frame.
</P>
<P>
   The work was displayed at a fair in New York in 1864, which
inspired the citizens of New York to call for a city museum. That
museum became the Met itself, and the show's grand finale comes
full circle back to modern day New York.

<HEADLINE> Severe shortage of Portuguese-speaking priests sends Archbishop on foreign recruiting tour </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Five years ago, the Rev. Rene Lima was
serving happily as a priest in his native city of Sao Paolo,
Brazil, celebrating Mass and mingling with parishioners in one of
the world's most Roman Catholic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day his bishop called him in, and told him he was being
sent elsewhere to help meet a great need. Before long, Lima was on
a plane touching down at Newark International Airport, where he ran
head-on into some staggering statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are more than 100,000 Portuguese-speaking
Catholics in northern New Jersey, there are only about 10 priests
in the archdiocese who speak the language. And with waves of
Brazilians flocking to the area, joining the well-established
community of immigrants from Portugal, the need for clergy who
speak the language is becoming more acute every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love it if we had even a dozen,'' said Newark Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick, who has made reaching out to non-English
speaking parishioners a hallmark of his tenure as leader of
northern New Jersey's 1.3 million Roman Catholics. ''The reality
is, we have even less than that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarrick recently completed a trip to Portugal, where he
engaged in the ecclesiastical version of ''Let's Make A Deal'' with
bishops there in the hope of finding some Portuguese-speaking
priests to serve in parishes in New Jersey. But he flew back
empty-handed, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that easy,'' he said. ''Portugal is having the same
problems we're having with vocations. But I did speak to several of
the bishops in Portugal, and they feel a responsibility for the
Portuguese here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarrick said he explored several short-term solutions with
Portuguese bishops, including lending a priest or two to the Newark
Archdiocese for a while in return for English-speaking priests who
could serve in Portuguese churches with significant
English-speaking populations. And McCarrick also hopes to send some
seminarians to Portugal to study the language and culture before
returning to Newark once they are ordained.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has its roots in the diaspora of
Portuguese-speaking Catholics beyond their once-insular enclave in
Newark's Ironbound section, where they were quite literally penned
in by the elevated railroad tracks that defined the largely
Portuguese neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy improved, Portuguese who were renowned for their
skill as masons and restaurateurs began spreading out to areas
where there hadn't been a sizable community before. Couple that
with a recent wave of Brazilian immigrants, and you've got a quiet
explosion of Portuguese-speaking Catholics in an area with few
priests to serve them in their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Ward of St. Cecelia's R.C. Church in Kearny
spent three summers in Portugal before being ordained three years
ago. He said it's essential for parishioners, particularly new
arrivals, to be able to talk about God with someone in their own
language.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been through this myself,'' he said. ''I spent a great
deal of time in Portugal trying to learn the language, and
Portuguese not being my native tongue, it wasn't as easy to pray,''
he said. ''If we consider the Mass as a type of prayer, it's easier
to pray in your own language.''
</P>
<P>
   His parish offers a Sunday morning Mass in Portuguese that's
regularly attended by 300 to 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lima, who was sent to St. Benedict's R.C. Church in
Newark from his native Brazil, said the church is often the first
place new immigrants go for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they come here, they are totally lost,'' he said. ''They
need support and guidance, and we need to welcome them. They need
housing, jobs, (work) papers, they need to learn English. Each
church tries to help as much as it can.''
</P>
<P>
   His church has held fund-raisers to help two Brazilian
parishioners who have been stricken with cancer, and occasionally
helps raise money to offset funeral and transportation expenses for
church members who have died and wanted to be buried in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Church and civic leaders agree the influx of immigrants from
Portugal has slowed dramatically, but it has been replaced with an
influx of Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every week, at least 100 Brazilians move into this town,''
said Francisco Sampa, the president of Baua, a Brazilian civic
association in Newark. ''We are far from home, and we need
spiritual support. People miss their culture and their families,
and need support. They find it in the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese has a much harder time allocating its resources
to serve Portuguese-speaking Catholics now because they have spread
out so much, McCarrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In years past, they were largely in the Ironbound section of
Newark, but now we've got sizable populations in Elizabeth,
Harrison, Kearny and many places in Union County,'' he said. ''That
makes it all the harder, because religion is so essential to the
lives of these folks.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarrick said the church will continue to look for potential
priests among its home-grown Portuguese communities, but said the
shortage probably won't ease for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced that vocations will come from the community but
not right now,'' he said. ''We have three or four young men right
now in the seminary, but my concern is for the next few years.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-assistant principal sentenced for inappropriate sex talks with boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The former assistant principal of a Winslow
Township elementary school received two years' probation Friday for
making suggestive remarks to a 10-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Lee Tomasello could have received 18 months in prison for
each count. It was his first offense.
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Superior Court Judge Samuel D. Natal ordered
Tomasello, of Winslow, to get a job, complete 50 hours of community
service and undergo a psychological investigation of 30 days if
deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Natal also barred Tomasello from contact with the victim,
seeking employment in the public sector and from involvement with
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Tomasello had inappropriate sexual
conversations from October 1999 to last January with two male
students, then aged 10 and 12. He had been an assistant principal
at Winslow School No. 5 since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasello was charged in January and freed on $5,000 bail, and
retired that month from the school district. Charges involving the
12-year-old were later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing hearing, no one spoke on behalf of Tomasello,
who had pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with the prosecutor.
Several letters commending his character, however, were submitted
to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Guardians for the now 11-year-old boy asked Natal to impose the
maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel shame, emptiness and mistrust,'' one guardian said.
''These children were entrusted to Tomasello. To prey on a child is
cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasello and his lawyer declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Standards for judges in some courts same as frontier days  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COXSACKIE, N.Y. (AP) - With handwritten ''Check with the officer
on arrival'' signs tacked to rafters, and a tin of chocolates
kisses on a table, Judge Richard Roberg's courtroom looks like a
piece of America's past.
</P>
<P>
   What Roberg had to do to become a town judge, or rather what he
didn't do, is also something from another time. Roberg was a
longtime 10th grade math teacher before donning a black robe 20
years ago. Along with 1,750 other town and village judges in the
state, he never went to law school before getting the power to put
people in jail for up to a year, to order dogs killed and to assess
fines.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing judges to serve without formal legal training dates
back to frontier days, when the country was young and lawyers
scarce. Yet because hiring lawyers is expensive, and in some rural
spots still impossible, and since many believe education does not
necessarily ensure justice, little has changed. And little is
expected to any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-five years ago, when a lot of court reforms were being
pushed around the country ... legally trained judges became far
more the norm,'' said Kenneth Pankey, of the National Center for
State Courts in Virginia. ''There are so few states where now this
is an issue at all.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, along with Texas, has the greatest number of judges
not professionally trained as lawyers. Other states with nonlawyer
judges include Mississippi, Arizona, South Carolina, Georgia and
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have town and village justices sitting in their eighties,''
said Gerald Stern, of the state Commission on Judicial Conduct.
''Of those sitting for the longest time, many did not have any
full-time education. Some may have sixth- or eighth-grade education
and some have high school education. A small percentage have
college degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   The state constitution requires that higher court judges, from
the Court of Appeals down to surrogate and family courts, must be
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Town and village judges undergo a one-week training before
beginning work and once a year after that. The standards for the
town and village judges, almost all of whom are elected, are not so
different for other, seemingly less powerful, jobs. To become a
technician that waxes unwanted hair off eyebrows, for example, New
York requires 75 hours of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Even to a former educator like Roberg, though, the lack of
educational standards is OK. He believes Republicans chose him to
run because he was well-regarded as a teacher. And, frankly,
because no lawyer would accept the $12,000 he earns for the
part-time job annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have doubts,'' Roberg said about being a judge without a
law degree. ''I thought law was quite intrinsic and complicated and
it can be. But you know what? Mostly it's good common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberg's demeanor and the homey setting clearly make people less
nervous when they visit for the first time his courtroom in
Coxsackie, 21 miles south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The old storefront court is in the center of the one-block
business district on Main Street. Next door is a century-old
restaurant that was once a watering hold for shipmen taking a break
from transporting ice and produce on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent court session, a widow with a thick Italian accent
blew the judge a smooch after a loan dispute was settled. A young
West Point cadet asked the judge to advise her on what to plead to
a Thruway speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In all his years on the bench, Roberg only ordered one dog
destroyed, because it was wild. ''That hurt,'' he said. ''I'll
never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are horror stories about nonlawyers making decisions that
appeared to be based on anything but common sense. Like in the case
of Thomas R. Buckley, a retired phone worker who had been a judge
in Dannemora since 1987 until his career was ended this year by the
Commission on Judicial Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling cited Buckley for, without a hearing and
no witnesses other than himself, ordering the destruction of his
neighbor's 12-year-old beagle because he saw it running loose.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers' shortcomings can certainly be just as egregious. J.
Kevin Mulroy, a lawyer who served as a judge in Onondaga County for
13 years, was ousted this year for using racist remarks and
profanity on the bench and in social settings.
</P>
<P>
   Law degree aside, Roberg too is aghast at the lack of
professionalism some counterparts show. He shakes his head in
disbelief when asked what he thinks about judges who hold court in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't happen does it?'' he asked, before allowing, ''At
least get an office in a fire company or something, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Court Administration says less than one percent of
judges hold court in their homes and suggests it's a fading
phenomenon. Yet home meetings are not exclusive to judges on the
edge of retirement. Some open doors to their homes as a sort of
social service.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, 30-year-old Mendin Judge June Patterson had
the police bring a 16-year-old drug addict to her home in handcuffs
- for brownies, milk and encouragement to get treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Which proves the point of Paul Biderman, of the National
Association of Judicial Educators, who says nonlawyer justices tend
to be more creative about problem solving than their trained
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And, Biderman added, ''the stakes are not so high,'' in the
cases town and village courts handle. In these lower level courts,
judges rule in misdemeanors. For most felony cases, they arraign
suspects and turn the cases over to higher courts.
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics offer little proof that lawyers are necessarily
better judges. Last year, .04 percent of nonlawyer village or town
judges were disciplined in the state. Among lawyer judges, 1
percent were disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers prove nothing, said Laurie Shanks, a professor at
Albany Law School. ''If you have one town justice and lawyers who
have to practice before the judge over and over again, are they
going to run the risk of going to the Commission?''
</P>
<P>
   Shanks said that the acceptance of nonlawyer justices is bound
to be challenged again, as it was 24 years ago, when lawyers in
Kentucky, New York, and Utah were trying to get verdicts overturned
based on the judges' familiarity with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The American Judicature Society said at the time the lay-judge
system ''violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution and undermines the
effective administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, though, in the Kentucky case, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled 6-2 that nonlawyer judges could serve over criminal trials
when defendants can appeal for a second trial before a judge who is
a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, New York's Office of Court
Administration says there have been no challenges to allowing
non-lawyer judges. When New York's Chief Judge Judith Kaye and Gov.
George Pataki proposed court reforms this year, there was no
mention of requiring law degrees for town and village courts.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's as if everyone accepts what Kentucky's Court of
Appeals declared in the aforementioned case: ''We fully appreciate
the absurdity of having a lawsuit - any lawsuit - presided over in
this day and age by a person without legal training or experience.
Nevertheless ... the federal Constitution does not deny the people
the right to have it that way if they so desire.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton camp calls Lazio bully; he says he's a fighter  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In aggressively going after Hillary Rodham
Clinton during the first debate of their Senate campaign,
Republican Rick Lazio risked a possible backlash the first lady's
campaign has been encouraging ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The visually defining moment came at the very end of the
one-hour debate Wednesday night when Lazio walked to Clinton's
podium, waving his pledge to ban soft money from the campaign under
her nose and demanding her signature. She demurred.
</P>
<P>
   When he crossed the stage, he crossed the line, according to the
Clinton camp.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said the congressman
from Long Island appeared ''menacing'' at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not a nice guy,'' Wolfson told cable television's New
York 1. ''He looked senatorial in the tradition of Bobby Knight,''
the fired Indiana University basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debate there has been much talk about the danger men
face attacking women in politics and the fine line to be walked
when doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp insists any backlash on that front is
''mythical'' and exists largely in the minds of members of the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go too far, but he didn't,'' said Mike Murphy, Lazio's
chief campaign strategist. ''He didn't make any real personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They lost the debate. Their campaign is in trouble and they
know it,'' Murphy added. ''Their candidate did not perform and so
they're inventing this canard to try to distract everybody from the
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 274 registered voters who watched the debate,
conducted for the New York Daily News and WCBS-TV by Blum &AMP; Weprin
Associates, gave the edge to Clinton, 49 percent to 36 percent,
when it came to who had done a ''better job'' in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the debate, independent polls had shown that while
Clinton was making some gains among white women voters - a key bloc
for her and one where she had been trailing - Lazio was still doing
well among them.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the debate, Lazio and his aides were defending
the congressman's aggressive style. They were also being asked
about the wisdom of attacking Clinton for blaming the ''vast
right-wing conspiracy'' during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Polling
then had shown the first lady's standing highest when she was
viewed as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll leave that for strategists,'' Lazio said Thursday when
asked about such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't high tea. It's the Senate race in New York,'' Lazio
spokesman Dan McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a theme pushed by Lazio as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a race for the Senate, people expect plain talk,'' the
congressman said Thursday before leaving Buffalo, appearing pleased
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go to the Senate, you've to be prepared to fight for
New York,'' he added during his next campaign stop at a charter
school in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Oswego County, Lazio told supporters that viewers of
the debate ''found out something else about New Yorkers - we don't
back down from a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was at a farm near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Senate, nobody's going to care if you're a man or a
woman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the debate from pundits and voters has varied.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote that while Lazio
''was supposed to be the 'likable' candidate'' he ''morphed into a
political predator. Darth Vader with dimples ... (''Survivor'' show
winner) Richard Hatch with clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's David Broder came away from the debate
believing ''the 'stature gap' between Hillary Rodham Clinton and
her challenger, Rep. Rick Lazio, is smaller than many Democrats
would wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan McCormack, an undecided Democrat from Rochester told the
Buffalo News that she came away from the debate still undecided,
but feeling Lazio was ''too rough.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody who would like to slap her, raise your hand,'' said
Arthur Deruve of Yonkers as he watched the debate at the Sons of
Italy Lodge in White Plains.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to correct photo numbers  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) - Admitting ''I've made mistakes,'' Gov.
Christie Whitman addressed the state NAACP convention Saturday for
the first time since the now-infamous photo of her frisking a black
man during a police sweep in Camden surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The governor acknowledged lingering resentment over the photo in
the black community, but said black clergy and community leaders
know she has worked hard to improve things for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman made only an oblique reference to the incident in her
speech, which was devoted mainly to a defense of affirmative action
and a pledge to ensure that no one gets left behind in the state's
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview afterward, Whitman said she realizes black
anger over the photo has not completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at all surprised there's still some resentment,'' she
said. ''That was a bad photo; there's no question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 4-year-old photograph obtained by The Associated Press,
Whitman is standing behind a black man, his arms spread, palms
pressed against a wall. The governor is wearing jeans, a sweat
shirt, a baseball cap and black gloves and appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken during a police sweep of a Camden neighborhood. The
governor said she participated in the pat-down search because she
wanted to fully experience police work. The man in the photo was
not charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's comments on Saturday seemed to indicate a softening of
her position on the photo. Immediately after it became public, she
adopted a defiant stance and refused calls for her to apologize,
suggesting critics were trying to ''bully'' her out of making
reforms in Camden, New Jersey's poorest city, including a takeover
of municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milton Milan has been indicted on corruption charges, the
third of the city's last four mayors to face charges.
</P>
<P>
   Before Whitman arrived at the convention, held at the Somerset
Marriott, some speakers criticized the administration's handling of
Camden, noting continued problems there.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at Camden today, and if I lived in Camden, I'd say
enough hasn't been done, too,'' Whitman said after her speech.
''But it's more than has been done in any other administration. We
have one of the finest charter schools in Camden. We have new
housing starts; we're building new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with Camden is getting past an administration that
one after another has been stealing hope from the residents,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Some NAACP officials said Whitman's appearance before the group
should help ease tensions over the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see her doing something deliberately negative toward
anybody,'' said Mary Lee Gilmore, the New Jersey chapter's
secretary. ''People wonder why she did that photo. I think she did
it because she was asked to; she didn't realize the negative side
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not that kind of person,'' Gilmore said. ''I try to tell
people that's not her.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Raymond Daniels, who is heading the group's voter
registration efforts, said he was encouraged Whitman addressed the
conference. He noted she has addressed past NAACP conferences as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her presence, I think, makes a great statement,'' he said.
''Any opportunity for a (politician) from either party to reach out
to minorities is a good thing.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Police Release Documents  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- After defying a court order for almost
24 hours, police on Saturday allowed attorneys for the main
opposition party to begin retrieving illegally seized membership
lists, check books, financial records and computer data, a party
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, police searched the offices of the Movement for
Democratic Change -- searches that a judge on Friday said were
illegal when he ruled that the property must be returned. When
officials tried to pick up the property, however, they were forced
to leave empty-handed, said Welshman Ncube, the party secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to release the materials until Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not surprising. I think overnight they copied everything
they wanted,'' Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, police forced their way into party offices and
removed almost all documentation, including membership lists,
address books and details of party organizers and fund-raisers
across the country. The court's ruling came just hours after the
last search had concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Police have refused to comment on the searches that began early
Thursday with a warrant stating they suspected the party was in
possession of ''arms of war.''
</P>
<P>
   No weapons were found, Ncube said. Police then were granted a
second search warrant, which stated that documents and other data
were needed to continue investigations.
</P>
<P>
   High Court Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku ruled the warrants invalid
because they did not sufficiently specify alleged offenses or
identify suspects or documents being sought, Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   Court and police officials were not available for comment on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Personal files of party leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who was out of
town, were also taken, Ncube said. Tsvangirai was scheduled to
return to Harare on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ncube said the opposition viewed the police action as an effort
to gather information ''with a view to unleashing terror on people
assisting MDC materially or financially.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the MDC won 57 of 120 elected seats in parliamentary
elections. The results posed the biggest challenge to President
Robert Mugabe's hold on power since he led the nation to
independence in 1980. In the outgoing parliament, Mugabe's party
controlled all but three seats.
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people died and thousands were left homeless in
political violence ahead of the elections. Most of the victims were
opposition supporters.

   HERNANI, Spain (AP) -- Police with helicopters and sniffer dogs
uncovered eight grenades in woods near a Basque town Saturday just
hours before a visit by King Juan Carlos, Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the grenades were planted by the armed Basque
separatist group ETA -- whose political allies warned this week that
although Schroeder was welcome in Hernani, the king and prime
minister were not. About 1,000 people marched through Hernani on
Saturday to protest the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The grenades were found in rudimentary launching tubes in a pit
about 600 yards from the open-air museum of sculptor Eduardo
Chillida, which was inaugurated by the king and later visited by
Aznar, Schroeder and more than a dozen other Spanish politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grenades had a launching mechanism but it was so sloppily
put together they would have not gone further than a few'' yards,
said a spokeswoman for the Basque regional Ertzaintza police force
who refused to be identified. ''There was no danger of anyone being
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The event went ahead as scheduled, and ETA issued no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   There had been conflicting police reports earlier as to whether
the grenades had launching devices.
</P>
<P>
   The grenades were found only half an hour before the king's
arrival, despite a week of intensive police searches of the hills
and woods around the museum to prevent any attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has admitted to about 800 killings since it began fighting
for independence of northern Spain's Basque region in 1968. It has
escalated its campaign since ending a cease-fire last December and
claimed 11 killings so far this year. It is also blamed for a 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred police, many in full riot gear with
rubber-bullet rifles and masks, manned controls for miles around
the museum and Hernani, a traditionally pro-independence town.
Helicopters constantly hovering overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to reach the museum, about 1,000 people paraded through
Hernani chanting: ''The king of Spain should stay in Spain!'' and
''Independence now!'' Others shouted in favor of ETA, whose name is
a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family and I are Basques, through and through. We're not
Spanish,'' said Jose Alarda, a 60-year-old native of Hernani. He
said he felt ETA's killings were often wrong, but insisted ''it's
the only way they can fight, and if they don't fight for
independence, who will?''
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim of the violence was a university teacher and
former Socialist politician who survived a shot in the face
Thursday outside his house in nearby San Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   The museum visit came three days after Spanish police arrested
20 suspected ETA fund-raisers and organizers. Then on Friday,
French police just across the border detained Ignacio de Gracia
Arregui, also known by his nom de guerre Inaki de Renteria,
considered the head of ETA's military planning.
</P>
<P>
   Gracia Arregui, a fugitive for more than a decade, is under
investigation for his alleged role in several ETA killings. He also
is accused of planning a foiled assassination of the king in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The king also was believed to have been the target of an
attempted attack in a 1997 visit to the Basque region to inaugurate
the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. A day before the museum opened, a
policeman was killed when he tried to detain suspected ETA members
posing as gardeners to place a bomb outside the museum's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder was visiting the Chillida museum Saturday at the
invitation of the artist, who designed a sculpture titled
''Berlin'' for the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the gigantic rust metal structure, said to
depict two entangled hands as symbols of German reunification,
Schroeder admitted he ran a risk by visiting Hernani.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I confirmed I was coming here last year,'' he said, ''and
I didn't want to cancel it so as to show solidarity against
terrorism and with Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder was officially in Spain for an annual bilateral
summit. He and Aznar agreed to push for stable fuel prices as
Europeans across the continent continued protests over high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar asked Spaniards for patience in the battle against ETA. He
insists there is no political problem in the Basque region -- just
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque region is one of 17 semiautonomous divisions of Spain
and enjoys substantial self-governing powers.

<HEADLINE> Dali Show Opens Amid Forgery Charges  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER HINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Organizers of an exhibition of works by
Salvador Dali are defending the show against accusations from art
experts that some of the pictures are forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dali, Mara e Bepe -- Pictures of a Friendship'' opened Thursday
at the Roman Museum in Augsburg and runs through Nov. 26. It
includes about 140 Dali works owned by the family of an Italian
doctor who had a decades-long friendship with the Spanish
surrealist.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the exhibition opened, several art experts charged
that some of the works were not really painted by Dali, who died in
1989 and was suspected of signing many forgeries himself in his
later years.
</P>
<P>
   A French Dali expert, Robert Descharnes, was quoted in media
reports as saying he had identified at least three forgeries, while
a German, Ralf Michler, told ZDF television that at least 25
percent of the paintings being shown were fake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a shame that such a show is used to hang a lot of
false exhibits in between the real ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Winfried Heid told about 500 visitors who packed the
grand opening that the charges were false.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the works shown here are real and carefully examined by
world-renowned experts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Schauber, who initiated the exhibit, also dismissed the
critics' accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp of the three leading Dali experts -- Bernard Ewell,
Albert Field and Giorgio Pillon -- are on the back of each picture,
she said. ''One can't do any more than that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening, Mayor Peter Menacher thanked Mara and Cristiana
Albaretto for loaning the works, which will be shown only in
Augsburg at the family's request.
</P>
<P>
   Cristiana Albaretto, Dali's goddaughter, explained that Dali was
''different, as everyone knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal photos and other items in the show is a
matrimonial bed designed by Dali for his goddaughter.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Urges India on Karmapa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The Dalai Lama urged the Indian
government Saturday to allow the Karmapa -- the teen-age monk who
was refused asylum after fleeing China in January -- to stay in
India.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, the supreme Tibetan leader, made the request in
a meeting with Lal Krishna Advani, the interior minister, Press
Trust of India reported. The Tibetan leader also requested the
government to let the Karmapa travel to the Rumtek monastery in the
remote Sikkim state.
</P>
<P>
   Advani reiterated the Indian position that asylum would not be
granted to the Karmapa, United News of India reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa, the third highest Tibetan Buddhist leader, has
arrived in India to reclaim the traditional black crown kept in the
Rumtek monastery for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assured him of discussing the matter with the prime minister
... after he returns home,'' Advani told reporters. Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee is currently on a state visit in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the boy recognized as the 17th Karmapa defected to
India from a China in a grueling trek by car, horse and foot over
900 miles through the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   His departure from Tibet has led to widespread speculation that
he is being groomed to succeed the Dalai Lama as political and
spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama said the 15-year-old monk's main aim was to serve
the Buddhist faith and the Tibetan nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two goals cannot be fulfilled if he remains inside
Tibet,'' the Dalai Lama was quoted as saying by PTI.

<HEADLINE> Gordon expected to become hurricane, strike Florida's Gulf Coast  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - As Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become
a hurricane and strike Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Jeb Bush on
Saturday activated emergency response teams.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1
hurricane with winds of between 74 and 95 mph when it strikes land
anywhere between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas
should anticipate a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state
emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning
Saturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just
south of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch
from Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said
Gordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39
and 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A
hurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could
hit within the next 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. EDT, Gordon was located near latitude 24.1 north and
longitude 86.1 west - about 345 miles southwest of Tampa. Its winds
have increased from 65 to 70 mph, 4 mph below hurricane strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two to five inches of rain are expected across portions of South
Florida and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast
began recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier
islands and coastal or low lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties
told residents they should start packing, and that shelters would
be opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later
forecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic
coast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space
shuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.
Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction
mission on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba
early Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city
of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday
as Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the
storm is not expected to score a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was
reported, the National Hurricane Center said.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. EDT, Florence was 180 miles north of Bermuda and was
moving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed
hurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those missed the island,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no structural damage. There was no flooding,'' said
James Buxton, meteorologist with the Bermuda Weather Service. ''For
a few hours, winds reached tropical storm force.''
</P>
<P>
   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least
three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical depression that was sighted in the tropics
early Saturday has been downgraded to a tropical wave because
hurricane hunters could find no clear center of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the wave is still carrying 35 mph winds and gusts to
tropical storm force in squalls are likely over parts of the
Leewards later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. EDT, the wave was located about 230 miles east of
Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west near 17 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm watch has been discontinued for the Leeward
Islands.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Challenger: Vote Is Fixed  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic's main challenger
warned Saturday the Yugoslav president will use ''thugs and liars''
to rig this month's presidential election. The warning came as the
government continued its crackdown on opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally here in the country's main northern city,
Vojislav Kostunica told about 20,000 supporters that Milosevic's
''thugs and liars are known for stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have stolen years of our lives,'' said Kostunica, who is
leading Milosevic in opinion polls before the Sept. 24 balloting.
''And now they are preparing the theft of the century,'' to secure
victory for the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica was referring to widespread fears that Milosevic, who
has been indicted by the international tribunal in The Hague for
war crimes, could resort to fraud and violence to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we will cast more votes than they can steal,'' Kostunica
said. The crowd responded by cheering ''He's finished,'' referring
to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   With the crucial election drawing near, police continued their
crackdown on Milosevic's opponents. Three members of the popular,
anti-Milosevic student group, Otpor, were arrested Saturday in
Belgrade for putting up posters urging people to vote against the
autocratic ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Otpor activists were arrested Saturday in the northern
town of Subotica near the border with Hungary but were released,
the group's central office said.
</P>
<P>
   A leading human rights group in Serbia, the Humanitarian Law
Fund, also said police beat two Otpor members Friday for
distributing leaflets and stickers calling for resistance to
Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, 22 opposition activists were arrested in various
towns across the country but were eventually released. Police
raided at least two offices of nongovernment groups, also seizing
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica is backed by an alliance of 18 opposition parties. He
is considered the strongest of the three major candidates running
against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Kostunica told supporters in the northern town
of Sombor that he was calling not for revolution ''but democracy''
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of all we need a normal life in a normal country ... a
government that will put an end to the sanctions imposed by the
international community and assure that people can lead decent,
peaceful lives,'' Kostunica said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 22 opposition activists were arrested in various
towns. Police raided at least two offices of nongovernment groups,
seizing computers and holding the detainees who were released after
hours-long questioning.

<HEADLINE> End to Austria Sanctions Analyzed  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- With the diplomatic sanctions that failed to keep
the far right from power in Austria now lifted, Europeans are
pondering the lessons of the punishment and wondering if the bitter
experience could poison relations among European Union members.
</P>
<P>
   Two key questions whirled around European capitals after
Wednesday's decision to end Austria's diplomatic isolation: Was
anything of value learned? And was the discord the sanctions caused
worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing seemed sure at week's end: The European Union
didn't look set to discipline one of its members again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Romano Prodi, chairman of the European Commission -- the EU's
executive body -- told the Austrian magazine Format that while the
inclusion of a radical party in government was ''very irritating,''
the European Union would have to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That won't happen again,'' Prodi said of the sanctions. ''A
bigger Europe will often have problems, but we will have to respect
the results of those elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts of the interview, which was to appear in Monday's
issue, were distributed Saturday by the Austria Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The EU took the unprecedented act of imposing sanctions on
Austria in February, after Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel decided to
include members of the far-right Freedom Party in a coalition
government with his Austrian People's Party. Freedom Party leader
Joerg Haider has raised alarm in Europe for past statements
sympathetic to aspects of the Nazi regime, as well as for his
party's strong anti-immigrant rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   A report commissioned by the EU released Tuesday concluded that
the sanctions, which ranged from freezing bilateral relations
between Austria and its 14 EU partners to boycotts of school trips,
were counterproductive and should be halted. A day later, France,
which now holds the EU presidency, announced they were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Austria's position is very unpleasant. It will take years,
possibly a decade, to repair the damage,'' said Arnold Suppan, a
history professor at the University of Vienna. ''The sanctions have
been lifted, but they are still having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least two respects, the sanctions clearly backfired. They
did not force Schuessel to abandon the Freedom Party -- which
remains part of the governing coalition -- and, according to the EU
report, they reinforced nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EU partners did not obtain change, so it's a relative
failure,'' said Phillipe Moreau Defarges, a senior fellow at the
French Institute for International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller EU nations, the sanctions deepened their worst fears
of being dominated by the larger ones, of interference in their own
democratic affairs. In Denmark, where a referendum is to be held
Sept. 28 on whether to accept the single European currency, the
sanctions issue has hurt support, according to a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''For small countries, this was chilling, and I don't think they
will act in such a panicky way in the future,'' Suppan said.
</P>
<P>
   For bigger countries, the sanctions showed the risk of taking
the moral high ground and interfering in the politics of a member
nation. For French President Jacques Chirac, one of the strongest
supporters of the measures, the EU report was a humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The participation of an extremist and xenophobic party in a
European government is abnormal in the Europe of today,'' Chirac
said Friday in his first public comment after the sanctions ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is out of the question to trivialize an ideology that has
not broken with a disastrous past,'' Chirac said, reaffirming the
EU's intention to keep a close watch on Austria's political
development.
</P>
<P>
   Influential French dailies on the left and the right were
unsparing in their criticism. The leftist Liberation called the
sanctions a ''bitter pill'' for Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   ''The European Union cannot punish one of its members without
blocking its own work,'' Le Figaro said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Haider, crowing, called the sanctions a ''complete
flop,'' and heaped scorn on Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   For history professor Tony Judt, director of the Remarque
Institute at New York University and a keen observer of Austria,
the sanctions had an unintended side effect.
</P>
<P>
   The measures showed just how many people outside of Austria,
where Haider long has been a familiar part of the political
landscape, are put off by him, Judt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly woke up Austrian politicians and intellectuals
community in a big way,'' Judt said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, Judt added, the sanctions were a ''gross
error.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next three months, France has the difficult job of
trying to get the EU to adopt institutional reforms as it prepares
to expand, and the sanctions could come back to haunt the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crisis is not over,'' Moreau Defarges said. ''There is a
malaise. ... If Austria is too arrogant, the crisis is going to
start again.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Warmer Ties With India  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday he would work
for closer U.S. ties with India in hopes of stemming a ''dangerous
tide of proliferation of dangerous weapons'' in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Standing feet away from a newly dedicated statue of Mohandas K.
Gandhi, the Indian independence leader and advocate of nonviolence,
Clinton spoke of ''a whole new era of partnership between India and
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He then addressed the nuclear saber-rattling by India and
neighboring Pakistan, and the need to defuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we'll both be able to help to turn back what could
otherwise be a dangerous tide of proliferation of dangerous weapons
-- not just nuclear warheads on missiles, either, (but) chemical
weapons, biological weapons. I hope we'll be able to turn that
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I hope some day that there will be some constructive role
we could play as a partner in working with India and others to
bring peace on the subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton at his side, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India's ailing
prime minister, whose official visit to Washington ends with a
White House dinner Sunday, dedicated the almost 9-foot-tall Gandhi
statue in a canopy of trees across from the Indian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statue depicts Gandhi, assassinated by a Hindu
fanatic in 1948, in a classic pose, dressed in peasant's clothes
and striding with the aid of a staff.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, who has chronic pain in his left knee from
osteoarthritis, which erodes the cartilage around the knee, walked
in small steps, sometimes with Clinton's hand under Vajpayee's arm
or supporting his back.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, India was a founder of the Nonaligned
Nations Movement, conceived as a third course between capitalism
and communism. In practice, India, the world's second most populous
country after China, appeared to side more often with the Soviet
Union than with the other superpower.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officially neutral United States seemed
often to favor openly India's adversary Pakistan, especially in the
1971 war that dissected Pakistan and created Bangladesh from its
eastern half.
</P>
<P>
   Current problems between the two focus on Vajpayee's return to
nuclear testing in May 1998. The tests, India's first since 1974,
led to retaliatory tests by Pakistan and to Clinton's assessment
this year that the subcontinent is perhaps the world's ''most
dangerous place.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither country has signed the international Comprehensive
Test-Ban Treaty. The United States, which has signed but not
ratified it, has sanctions in place against India for not signing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly pleased Saturday with the rapport he has
found with Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   The visit ''sort of rounds out our efforts to take a different
turn in our relationships, to deepen and broaden them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this change in partnership goes beyond my service
(as president), into a whole new era of partnership between India
and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a natural fit, he said. ''There is probably no country
outside India that has been more enriched by Indians than the
United States,'' he said. ''So that's another reason I think it's
important we continue to go forward together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian-Americans contributed toward the cost of the Mahatma
Gandhi Memorial, which was built by the Indian government in
collaboration with the U.S. government and the National Park
Service.

<HEADLINE> Haider Makes Surprise Visit to Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIESTE, Italy (AP) -- Far-right Austrian politician Joerg Haider
made a surprise appearance Saturday at a local ceremony across the
border in Italy -- his first known one since Italy asked Austria to
do what it could to keep him away.
</P>
<P>
   ''What an ugly surprise,'' fumed the vice mayor of Trieste,
Roberto Damiani, one of the officials taking part -- by invitation --
in the ceremony on the outskirts of the northern city of Trieste.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to make a political issue of it, but it's just
bad manners,'' Damiani said.
</P>
<P>
   Applause mixed with catcalls greeted Haider when he appeared at
an anniversary ceremony for a thoroughfare linking Trieste and
Vienna. The road opened 170 years ago, when that part of Italy was
under Austrian rule.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third known trip to northern Italy in three months by
Haider, who angered some Italian officials over the summer by
proposing a ''super-region'' between northern Italian provinces and
the Austrian province of Carinthia. Haider is governor of
Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini wrote his Austrian
counterpart on July 22 to ask Austria to take ''all the possible
measures to avoid'' more protest-provoking cross-border trips by
Haider.
</P>
<P>
   The letter came in the middle of what was Haider's second trip
to northern Italy that month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a private citizen and I can go where I wish,'' Haider was
quoted as telling Italian journalists asking his itinerary for the
day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Haider unexpectedly took the place of another Carinthian
official invited to the ceremony, Italian media said.
</P>
<P>
   When Haider rose at one point, apparently to make some remarks,
the center-left Trieste vice mayor reportedly asked him to keep his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Haider told local reporters that relations between Austria and
northern Italy had improved since he started making his trips, and
said cooperation should move faster now that the European Union has
lifted sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
   He called the lifting of the sanctions after seven months ''a
great victory by Austrian democracy against illegal pressure from
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told Italian reporters he was ''very hopeful'' the
center-right would win in their country's next national elections.

<HEADLINE> Mediator in Buffalo teachers' dispute labeled no longer useful  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A state mediator who was taken on a central
role in the Buffalo teachers' pay dispute has ''outlived his
usefulness'' over the last 10 months and become too closely tied to
their union, the school board president asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders by a judge, striking teachers returned to work
without a contract Friday and promised to stay there until a
proposal is released Tuesday by mediator Alan Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman is being assisted by the state Public Employment
Relations Board, which determined last December that the union and
the district were at an impasse that required state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Teachers Federation's 3,700 teachers walked out for
two days earlier this month and unexpectedly resumed the strike
Thursday, canceling classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Buchanan, president of the Buffalo Board of Education,
thinks Kaufman can no longer can be counted on to help settle the
dispute - a view echoed by fellow board members. Kaufman had a role
in organizing contract settlements in 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has outlived his usefulness,'' Buchanan said. ''Ten months
to mediate a dispute that has ended up in two strikes, and now
trying to assert himself, seems to me to be a day late and a dollar
short. He has been immersed in it too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman did not return telephone messages seeking his comment,
but the union denied that it had any special relationship with him
or the Public Employment Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   That board's job, said teachers' union president Phil Rumore,
has been ''to beat up on us a lot. They can come into us, they have
threatened, they are using every tactic they can.'' At the same
time, the board has calmed proceedings and ''the strike has been
delayed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon sharply criticized
Thursday's sudden walkout and solidified a temporary order against
the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the district's latest offer Wednesday contained
annual hikes of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the next three years. The
teachers want slightly higher raises, he said. The increases would
be on top of automatic 2 percent annual raises, district officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Offers Health Care Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuban lawmakers on Saturday outlined an offer
to send doctors to poor parts of the United States and to provide
free medical training in Cuba annually to 500 Americans, mostly
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Saez, who led the delegation of five black members from
Cuba's National Assembly, said at a news conference that Cuba has a
surplus of doctors and is offering to send an undetermined number
to Mississippi and other U.S. states where trained medical
personnel are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''The figure depends on the needs,'' said Saez, a member of the
Communist country's policy-making Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba also is offering medical training for 250 black Americans
and for 250 Hispanics, American Indians and other Americans from
poor families.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the Clinton administration has
taken no position on the Cuban proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of an anti-Fidel Castro group in Miami said the Cuban
government should worry about taking care of its own citizens and
ensuring that medicine is available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuban-Americans send millions and millions of dollars to Cuba
each year to help the Cuban people medications,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, head of the Democrat Movement. ''If (Castro) enough
resources to send to the United States, why doesn't he utilize them
to better the conditions of the Cuban people?''
</P>
<P>
   Saez said the legality of Americans traveling to Cuba for
medical training must be determined, given the restrictions the
U.S. government imposes on travel to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Clinton administration has been encouraging
Americans to go to Cuba for purposes unrelated to tourism.
President Clinton stressed his commitment to that principle this
summer in response to a legislative effort to block any further
liberalization of travel by Americans to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be explored is whether a Cuban medical certificate would
meet U.S. licensing standards. Many Cuban doctors who have
resettled in South Florida have had difficulty obtaining licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leader Castro first made the offer during a Havana meeting
in May with visiting U.S. lawmakers from the Congressional Black
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be hard for your government to oppose such a
program,'' Castro told the Americans. ''It would be a trial for
them. Morally, how could they refuse?''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's offer came after Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson told
him that parts of his Mississippi Delta district have an infant
mortality rate that is second in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Saez said 6,000 Cuban doctors were practicing at the time of the
Cuban revolution 41 years ago, but that figure has since risen to
66,000. President Fidel Castro decided to commit 3,000 doctors for
service abroad, Saez said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says its family doctor program ensures that all Cubans,
including those in remote areas, have access to free health care.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Cuban health system point out that the country is
heavily dependent for basic supplies on donations by U.S.-based
relatives and by humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been complaints by ordinary Cubans that the best
care on the island is reserved for foreigners under a program
designed for those in need of medical treatment that is unavailable
or of substandard quality in their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a number of disaffected Cuban doctors serving in
Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Zambia have asked for political asylum in
recent months.

<HEADLINE> Leftists Attack German Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEUMUENSTER, Germany (AP) -- Leftist demonstrators threw a hail
of bottles and stones Saturday at around 500 neo-Nazis protesting
the closure of their local hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Police took more than 100 people into custody. No injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Leftists split from a simultaneous counter-demonstration in
Neumuenster, just north of Hamburg, that drew some 800 people.
Among them was Schleswig-Holstein state governor Heide Simonis, who
appealed for vigilance against neo-Nazis and violence against
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 police kept the leftist and neo-Nazi marchers apart,
but the leftists threw stones, bottles and other objects.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 101 people were taken into temporary custody and 17
charged with resisting police orders.
</P>
<P>
   City officials revoked the club's license and ordered it closed
Sept. 5 after determining it was being advertised on the Internet
as a hangout for neo-Nazis.

<HEADLINE> Former Kan. Lottery Worker Accused  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HANNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A former lottery administrator is accused of
using his access to the agency's computers to steal tens of
thousands of dollars from the Kansas Lottery through dozens of
small cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lee Knowlton, 55, was charged Friday with 268 criminal
counts involving felony computer crime, theft and official
misconduct. He was the lottery's information resource manager from
1992 until March, when he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Karla Stovall accused Knowlton of altering
lottery tickets and computer files so he could present winning
tickets to retailers and claim cash prizes that were small enough
not to be too suspicious but that brought him $62,000 over 18
months, ending in March.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused only of creating additional winning tickets for
himself, not changing other players' tickets, and his actions did
not alter the outcome of any drawings, Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton's attorney, William Rork, did not return a telephone
message from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton said in Friday editions of The Topeka Capital-Journal
that he had no comment. ''I think you will hear a lot more about
this in the near future. There is a lot more to this than meets the
eye,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Knowlton resigned, the lottery has changed its operations
so no one person has unrestricted access to its main computer and
every keystroke is now monitored, said Ed Van Petten, the lottery's
deputy director. He said no other lottery employees are under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Web site critical of bagel chain allowed to stay at least one more month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A Clifton man who has used an Internet
Web site to criticize the franchise practices of a coffee and bagel
chain will be allowed to keep the site going for at least another
month.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Elizabeth on Friday rejected a request
by Eatontown-based New World Coffee/Manhattan Bagel to immediately
shut down the site where Michael Abrams has published his
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from the company's dispute with franchisees over
closed or money-losing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams wife, Lidia, was a franchisee, and Abrams contends he is
an Internet journalist, publishing commentary from franchise
holders on how New World/Manhattan Bagel does business.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued the Web site only seeks to disparage, defame
and libel the company's executives.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action filed Tuesday, the company is seeking
restitution for losses and damages it alleges are caused by the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern of Manhattan Bagel is that the sites are false and
defamatory,'' Lee Plave, an attorney for New World Coffee, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has charged that 30 franchises have grievances against
New World Coffee, which has more than 500 stores nationwide. Plave
said the figure is closer to six.
</P>
<P>
   Although she rejected New World Coffee's request for immediate
relief, Superior Court Judge Miriam Span ordered Abrams and lawyers
for the chain to return to court Oct. 16, when she will decide on
the preliminary restraining order the chain is seeking.

<HEADLINE> Six Honored for Medical Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six scientists have won prestigious Lasker
medical awards for research that includes showing a key way cells
get rid of proteins and cutting the risk of hepatitis from blood
transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes have been bestowed since 1946 by the Albert and Mary
Lasker Foundation in New York. Sixty-two recipients have gone on to
win Nobel Prizes. This year's awards will be presented on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 award for clinical research will be shared by Dr.
Harvey J. Alter of the National Institutes of Health and Michael
Houghton of Chiron Corp. in Emeryville, Calif. They were honored
for research that led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus and
development of blood-screening methods that virtually eliminated
the risk of hepatitis from transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 award for basic research will be shared by Drs.
Aaron Chiechanover and Avram Hershko of the Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology in Haifa and Alexander Varshavsky of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered a complex procedure cells use to destroy
unneeded proteins, based on a small targeting protein called
ubiquitin. This process influences a wide range of activities, such
as cell division and embryonic development.
</P>
<P>
   The Lasker foundation will present its $25,000 award for special
achievement in medical science to Sydney Brenner, founder and
president of the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, Calif.,
for ''50 years of brilliant creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner established the existence of messenger RNA, the copy of
genetic material that cells use to make proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to embryonic development and the nervous system in the
1960s, Brenner and colleagues worked out the detailed nerve wiring
of the tiny worm called C. elegans and launched other
investigations in the creature, raising it to a central place in
experimental biology.

<HEADLINE> Russian Soldiers Killed in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Four Russian soldiers were killed when
rebel fighters ambushed a military unit in central Chechnya in the
second attack on a convoy in two days, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy was fired upon Friday while moving through the Vedeno
Gorge, a region that has seen heavy rebel activity since the start
of the war, according to an official with the pro-Russian civilian
government in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not have
further casualty figures. The attack was one of 12 carried out by
the rebels in the last 24 hours across Chechnya, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Six soldiers were killed Thursday when rebels ambushed a convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian special forces were sent to the area of Friday's ambush
and nearby villages were blocked off as troops searched for the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel ambushes and checkpoint attacks have sapped the morale of
Russian troops, though both sides have refrained from major
offensives in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Russian helicopters rocketed the mountains of
southern Chechnya. Russian forces also defused several remote
control mines that rebels had planted along a main highway running
west from the Chechen capital Grozny to the neighboring region of
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials are planning to return Chechnya's civilian
government headquarters to Grozny from the nearby city of Gudermes.
Rebels were trying to block the move, the civilian government
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Akhmad Kadyrov, head of the civilian government, sharply
criticized the Russian military for its harsh action in Chechnya,
including mass detentions as part of ''mopping-up'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke openly against the Chechen illegal armed formations
because they terrorized the people, but the same people continue to
suffer from the forces for whose protection they hoped so much,''
Kadyrov said in Gudermes, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Further employment of mass mopping-up operations can lead to
serious negative consequences,'' Kadyrov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces returned to Chechnya last September after rebel
raids on a neighboring region and four bomb blasts across Russia
killed some 300 people. Russia blamed the blasts on Chechen rebels,
though no one has been convicted of involvement.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, residents of the city of Volgodonsk marked the
one-year anniversary of the apartment bombing there that killed 17
people. That explosion was the last of the four and Russian troops
entered Chechnya shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people attended a mourning gathering in the city.
Konstantin Galkin, the city's chief psychiatrist, estimated that 10
to 15 percent of the city are still traumatized by the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Def Leppard Appeal Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) -- Rock group Def Leppard has been around
for 23 years, and its appeal doesn't seem to be fading, at least
not in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 fans stood for a two-hour concert Friday night as
the band drew the largest grandstand crowd of the summer at the
Kansas State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've improved with age,'' said Susan Durbin, who first saw
the rock band from the British Isles 20 years ago. Durbin was at
the concert with a second-generation Def Leppard fan -- her
16-year-old daughter.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani joins Lazio, while Clinton stumps in suburbs  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton got friendly with her
voting neighbors in Chappaqua on Saturday, while her rival Rick
Lazio pounded the Manhattan pavement with two brash New Yorkers at
his side: Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a day after his prostate cancer treatment, the Republican
mayor walked in the annual German-American Steuben Parade up Fifth
Avenue on a crisp September day.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a cap inscribed ''Mount Sinai'' - the hospital where he
underwent the procedure Friday - Giuliani said the doctors there
''did it in such a skillful way that I'm able to march.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees' owner Steinbrenner, the parade's grand marshall, joined
the mayor for a news conference at Park Avenue and 86th Street, the
end of the parade route that started at 63rd Street and Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Before they stepped off at noon, accompanied by Judith Nathan,
the woman Giuliani calls his ''very good friend,'' the mayor
received hugs from both Lazio and Steinbrenner. ''You're amazing!''
Lazio whispered in Giuliani's ear.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd lining Fifth Avenue, one man wore a pro-Lazio cap
that said, ''Made in New York,'' a dig at Clinton's carpetbagger
status. And a group of spectators held a long banner that read:
''VIP Hillary. Vicious, insufferable phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani walked over to them and said, ''Hold it up higher!''
</P>
<P>
   Observing his fellow Republican, Lazio said the mayor was an
inspiration to ''cancer survivors around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had radioactive seeds implanted in his cancerous
prostate gland Friday, and held a news conference five hours later.
Doctors at Mount Sinai said the treatment went ''perfectly'' and
called the mayor' prognosis ''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Lazio marched in the Westchester County
volunteer firefighters parade in Tarrytown. Along with state Sen.
Nicholas Spano and Tarrytown Mayor Paul Janos, Lazio brought up the
read of the parade, marching in front of his campaign bus, ''The
Mainstream Express,'' which blasted rock music.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westchester community of Chappaqua, where Clinton now
lives, she appeared at the 17th Annual Community Day hosted by the
Chappaqua Rotary Club at the railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   She strolled past stands that offered everything from blood
pressure screenings to hot dogs, Girl Scout cupcakes and campaign
tables for Gore-Lieberman, as well as Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton greeted volunteers at the table of the Democratic
presidential ticket, drawing hundreds of people. She also met
singer-actress Vanessa Williams, a native of nearby Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked to comment on a Daily News story Saturday
about the American Conservative Union, which had rejected a request
to refrain from personally criticizing her. She said the group
''has been supporting Rick Lazio for months, and they have proudly
said they sent out something like seven million letters and books
on his behalf. And so I think it's a clear indication that there
isn't any serious effort being taken to rein in those so-called
independent expenditure groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the same issue earlier in the day, Lazio said: ''I'm
prepared to not just call on all outside groups, but if anybody was
to resist our call, I'm prepared to repudiate the ads - if she's
willing to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, accused by her opponent of being unfamiliar with
New York, also sang the praises of the town she's known since last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know about Chappaqua before we found the house
here,'' she said. ''But now, everywhere I go there are people who
have relatives or friends or connections with Chappaqua. So there
is an extensive - I don't know what the word is,'' she said,
turning to town supervisor Marion Sinik. ''Marion, what is it,
Chappaquidians? Chappa-what? Chappaquidians? What do we call
ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Sinik replied: ''Residents of Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   At the near-empty Republican table, the chairman of the town
Republican Party, Ed O'Keefe, said Clinton's move to Chappaqua
''has been a boon to local Republicans. We used to have three
people on the town committee. Now we have 30.''

<HEADLINE> Tabloid, Giffords Fight Over Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tabloid lawyers have asked a judge
to throw out a libel lawsuit filed by Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford,
saying a story depicting the couple's 9-year-old son as a bratty
monster didn't harm the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giffords' lawyer said the National Examiner article
claiming Cody spit out food in a restaurant, behaved badly on a TV
movie set and colored on a pair of pants in a clothing store was
fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's made up and it's defamatory,'' Deborah Drooz said after a
Friday court hearing. ''They hurt a 9-year-old kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giffords sued the Boca Raton-based tabloid after the
February story appeared.
</P>
<P>
   National Examiner lawyer Gerson A. Zweifach told Judge Timothy
McCarthy on Friday that accounts of Cody's behavior don't meet
defamatory law standards. The boy would have had to suffer ridicule
or disgrace as a result of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you subject one to ridicule or disgrace for
(saying he) spit out squid,'' Zweifach said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge didn't indicate when he would issue a decision.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Congress May Boost Visas  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton predicted Saturday that
Congress will increase the number of visas for foreign high-tech
workers before the end of the current session and indicated he
would sign the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters from India, origin of many of the
so-called H1B visitors, Clinton said a major question remaining is
how many more than the current 115,000 a year will be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   H1B visas allow skilled workers to enter the United States for
specified periods to do specific jobs for which employers say
American workers are unavailable. The technology industry says the
need is as high as 300,000 a year. Labor unions object to the
concept, contending that the high-tech industry recruits overseas
mainly to hire a less expensive work force than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of H1B visas will be increased in this Congress, I
believe. I'll be quite surprised if it isn't,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that we're going to increase the visas.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Congress begins in January.
</P>
<P>
   A long-pending Senate bill would increase the number of visas
for each of the next three years to 200,000 a year. Otherwise, the
115,000 falls to 107,500 in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and
65,000 a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ran into problems this year when Clinton said in May
that any visa increase had to be linked to changes in immigration
policies mainly involving Hispanics. Republican leaders insist the
two questions have nothing to do with each other and should be
considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate Majority leader, acted
Friday to bring a long-pending visa bill to a vote as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments Saturday, Clinton did not mention the Hispanic
question or any other links.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is how much will it be increased by and can we use
the occasion of increasing the quotas to get some more funds from
the companies that are hiring people for the training of our own
people,'' the president said. He said they ''could also do these
jobs -- the people who are already here -- if they had training.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, welcomed the president's
comments, although he said a lot of time has been wasted on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to take it out for months now, but the
Democrats in Congress have been inventing all kinds of reasons why
it couldn't come out. The real reason was their labor friends
didn't like it,'' Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the president is signaling his support for us, we welcome
that and view that as a positive development, albeit at the 11th
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2045.

<HEADLINE> Maya Angelou Cancels Omaha Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Maya Angelou canceled an appearance in
Omaha after becoming ill.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old poet went to a hospital emergency room Friday,
hours after she left an appearance at the University of Nebraska in
a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was extremely exhausted and needed the wheelchair to get
around,'' said Karen Wills, an organizer of Angelou's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou wasn't admitted into the hospital, but she did cancel a
speaking appearance Friday at a fund-raising luncheon in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou left the university's Lied Center for Performing Arts in
a wheelchair Thursday night after speaking to 2,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   During her speech Thursday, Angelou told students that they are
not in college to get a degree, marry and buy a three-bedroom house
with a two-car garage. Instead, she said, they are learning to
compose ''this world you find yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou, author of the 1970 autobiographical ''I Know Why the
Caged Bird Sings,'' had pneumonia last year.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani breaks loose  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A day after undergoing major treatment for
prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was billed as ''amazing''
on Saturday for marching two dozen blocks in a Manhattan parade.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sprang loose, enjoying a private walk home on a sunny
Manhattan afternoon, including a drugstore stop.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor appeared to be operating at full force again, stepping
off at noon in the German-American Steuben Parade up Fifth Avenue.
Wearing a cap inscribed ''Mount Sinai'' - the hospital where he
underwent the procedure Friday - Giuliani said the doctors there
''did it in such a skillful way that I'm able to march.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the parade route at 63rd Street, Rep. Rick Lazio
and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner greeted Giuliani with hugs.
''You're amazing!'' Lazio whispered in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor proceeded up Fifth with Lazio and Steinbrenner,
followed by Judith Nathan, a woman Giuliani has called his ''very
good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the parade route at Park Avenue and 86th Street,
the mayor held a news conference - as he had done on Friday, barely
five hours after radioactive seeds were implanted in his cancerous
prostate. His doctors said the treatment went ''perfectly'' and
called the mayor' prognosis ''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's parade, Giuliani dove into the crowd on the
sidewalk, shaking hands and chatting before ducking into the
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, accompanied by only a handful of people, including Nathan,
he walked toward Gracie Mansion, greeting surprised passersby and
spreading his jovial mood in all directions - including diners at a
corner restaurant, one of whom yelled out, ''How are you feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   At the sight of the pedestrian mayor, a car heading toward a
crosswalk to avoid traffic suddenly veered back on track.
</P>
<P>
   And when a little boy on his bicycle recognized Giuliani, he
turned to his mother and said, ''Look, it's the mayor!''
</P>
<P>
   She responded: ''Is it? I didn't recognize him.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura Criticizes Media  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Surrounded by the media types he loves to
bash, Gov. Jesse Ventura mixed playful banter with a stern lecture
to leaders of the broadcast news industry.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech Friday at the Radio Television News Directors
Association conference, Ventura criticized news coverage for being
more entertaining than informative.
</P>
<P>
   Using himself as the prime example, Ventura said reporters tend
to focus more on his celebrity than his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we want to be entertained, there's hundreds of sitcoms,''
he said. ''We want to be informed. Stick to informing us rather
than entertaining us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Ventura was gentle and his tone was less
confrontational than in his new book, ''Do I Stand Alone? Going to
the Mat Against Political Pawns and Media Jackals.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garcia, the association's chairman, said Ventura's novel
style is the reason for the unique coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are not many governors who go make appearances on soap
operas,'' Garcia said. ''It's kind of a natural for us to report on
that. People find it interesting, they find him interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Chief Faces Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA director John M. Deutch is under
investigation by the Department of Defense for the same type
security violations he has admitted to while heading the CIA,
according to Pentagon documents.
</P>
<P>
   The breaches allegedly occurred during the mid-1990s while
Deutch was a high-ranking official in the Defense Department,
before he went to the CIA. They involve classified information
accessed from unsecured computers in Deutch's home and, in one
case, computer cards containing a 1,000 page journal with
classified information Deutch carried in his shirt pocket,
according to the documents, obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, the papers said, also turned down departmental requests
to install security systems in his home. The documents said he
continued handling data on unsecured computers even after signing a
February 1995 memorandum on ''the need to properly safeguard
information.'' The documents noted he was the deputy secretary of
defense at the time of the memo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find his conduct in this regard particularly egregious in
light of existing (Defense Department) policy directives addressing
the safeguarding of classified information,'' an internal Pentagon
memo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence we obtained clearly establishes that Dr. Deutch
failed to follow even the most basic security precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch left the CIA in 1996; he now teaches at MIT. A message
left for him at his office seeking comment was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, confirmed Saturday that the probe had been widened. He
said the Justice Department has also expanded its probe to include
Deutch's activity at the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Deutch should be treated as any other commoner and held
accountable for what he did,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin would not comment on
the scope of his department's criminal investigation of Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Justice official, requesting anonymity, said no
decision is imminent on whether to charge Deutch for mishandling
secret data on unsecured computers. The inquiry is still in the
department's criminal division and no recommendation has been sent
to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran criminal division executive, Paul Coffey, was recalled
months ago from retirement to conduct a comprehensive new look at
the Deutch matter. While Coffey was certain to examine any data
gathered by Pentagon officials about Deutch, the statute of
limitations in most of the relevant laws would probably prevent him
from bringing any charges for activities that occurred more than
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department initially decided not to prosecute
Deutch. But, after criticism earlier this year that Deutch was
treated more favorably than former Los Alamos nuclear scientist Wen
Ho Lee, Reno decided to review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley also invoked Lee, accused of downloading nuclear
secrets but freed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Deutch is being investigated for not just downloading CIA
information but also Defense Department information while he was at
(the Pentagon),'' Grassley said. ''Yet, I don't see him in solitary
confinement with no bail, even though he downloaded information
that Wen Ho Lee could never get access to.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that computer hackers or spies obtained
classified information because of Deutch's actions. But the papers
said Deutch used his America Online account to download Pentagon
data, an ''extremely risky'' practice that could have left his
computer susceptible to a computer hacker.
</P>
<P>
   When allegations first arose concerning Deutch's use of
computers while at the CIA, the Pentagon said it would try to
determine whether similar problems had occurred while Deutch was
there.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Tim Taylor, said that as
recently as Thursday, officials had said no results of that
investigation were available. He had no other comment on the Post
report.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch served as defense undersecretary for acquisitions and
technology from April 1993 to March 1994, when he became deputy
defense secretary. He was appointed CIA director in 1995, and left
the CIA in December of the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Deutch retired from the CIA, agency personnel
discovered classified information stored on government computers at
Deutch's home.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch eventually admitted the security breach, apologized and
was stripped of his security clearances, though there is no
evidence that computer hackers or spies obtained classified
information as a result of Deutch's actions.

<HEADLINE> Sandy Hook, Raritan Bay cleanup ends, clam ban remains after fuel leak </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Cleanup crews finished work
Saturday in Sandy Hook Bay, two days after a Navy ship spilled
30,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the water.
</P>
<P>
   But a ban on harvesting shellfish in the area remained in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection imposed the ban
Friday morning. It was expected to remain in effect until at least
Tuesday. DEP officials will meet Monday to discuss when it will be
safe to re-open the clam beds, spokeswoman Loretta O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   A tugboat helping guide the USS Detroit, a Navy supply ship,
toward the pier at the Earle Naval Weapons Station in the Leonard
section of Middletown collided with the 58,000-ton ship Thursday
afternoon, ripping a 4-foot-by-4-inch hole in its side.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed 30,000 gallons of No. 2 diesel fuel to spill into
the bay, prompting a cleanup involving vessels from the Navy, the
U.S. Coast Guard and private companies.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was completed at about 3 p.m. Saturday, said Earle
Commander Chuck Caudill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We completed what we call a tug wash, where we sprayed water
under the pier, and it came out clear,'' he said. ''We're starting
to collect the booms because this is now considered cleaned up. As
of now, there is no sheen anywhere in the bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle officials had no estimate on how much of the fuel was
recovered from the water using absorbent booms and ''skimmer''
ships that scrape it from the water's surface. But Andrew Willner,
the baykeeper for New York and New Jersey, said such cleanups
typically remove only about 15 percent of spilled fuel from the
water.
</P>
<P>
   A storm that rolled through the region early Friday morning
wrecked much of the containment booms that cleanup ships had placed
around the slick, allowing it to spread. Winds and high waves from
the storm dissipated most of the 4-mile-long slick on Friday, and
there were no reports of fuel washing up on any New Jersey beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists fear the toxic effects of the fuel on marine
life and migratory shore birds, but there were no reports of any
animals dying as a result of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The clamming ban forced the closure Friday and Saturday of a
depuration plant in nearby Highlands, where clams harvested from
the Sandy Hook and Raritan bays are processed to remove
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   The 23,000 acres of shellfish beds in northern Monmouth County
produce almost 40 million clams a year, or about one out of every
four sold in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey class-action lawsuit filed against Ford, Firestone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - A class-action lawsuit has been filed
against Ford Motor Co. and the maker of Bridgestone/Firestone tires
on behalf of New Jersey customers, accusing the companies of
knowingly marketing defective and potentially dangerous tires and
in some cases refusing requests to have them replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Filed Friday in Superior Court in Bergen County, the lawsuit
charges that the automaker and the tire manufacturer violated the
state consumer fraud act by marketing unsafe tires.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said it
is investigating 88 deaths and more than 250 injuries over the past
decade involving Firestone tires. A recall of 6.5 million ATX,
ATX-II and Wilderness AT tires was announced Aug. 9, mostly on Ford
Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA in May began investigating accidents in which
Firestone tires suddenly lost their tread or suffered blowouts.
Many cases involved Ford Explorers rolling over.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of New Jersey residents who
bought or leased Explorers, Lincoln Mountaineers or other Ford
vehicles that came equipped with the tires specified in the recall.
</P>
<P>
   No dollar amount was specified in the New Jersey action, but it
seeks recovery of out-of-pocket replacement costs and related
expenses stemming from the use of the vehicles and other
inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, one of several dozen similar actions brought in
state and federal courts around the country, also seeks to penalize
the companies under New Jersey law and require the return of
profits.

   The U.S. Attorney's office described Jonathan Burton's Aug. 11
death as an act of self-defense by frightened passengers and said
it would not file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 19, of Las Vegas, became combative 20 minutes before
Flight 1763 was due to land, hitting other passengers and pounding
on the locked cockpit door. As many as eight of the plane's 120
passengers subdued him and held him down until the flight arrived
in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Burton died after being removed from the plane, and authorities
believed he had died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, the autopsy report classified his death a homicide
because it resulted from ''intentional actions by another
individual or individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released by Burton's family, said he suffocated. He
also had bruises and scratches on his torso, face and neck and
suffered blunt force injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was strangled, beaten and kicked,'' said family attorney
Kent Spence. ''We'd like to know how this could have happened to
this young man. This kid had no history of violence, he would
sooner take a spider outside than kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy found low levels of marijuana in Burton's body but
said that was an ''unlikely explanation'' for his violent outburst.
</P>
<P>
   The family has not decided whether to sue Southwest Airlines or
the passengers, Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials recently reported a dramatic increase in
air-rage incidents nationwide. Statistics from the Federal Aviation
Administration showed 292 incidents of ''unruly passengers'' last
year, up from 138 in 1995. The FAA can recommend fines of up to
$25,000 for airline passengers who ''assault, threaten, intimidate
or interfere with a crew member.''

Russian Soldiers Killed in Chechnya
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Four Russian soldiers were killed when rebel fighters
ambushed a military unit in central Chechnya in the second attack on a convoy in
two days, an official said Saturday. The convoy was fired upon Friday while
moving through the Vedeno Gorge, a region that has seen heavy rebel activity
since the start of the war, according to an official with the pro-Russian
civilian government in Chechnya. The attack was one of 12 carried out by the
rebels in the last 24 hours across Chechnya, the official said.

Florida Prepares for Storm Gordon

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Gov. Jeb Bush activated emergency response teams
today as Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become a hurricane and strike
Florida's Gulf Coast. Up to 5 inches of rain is possible by tomorrow in the Keys
and much of South Florida, officials said. The storm already had poured up to 10
inches of rain on western Cuba early in the day. Storm watches and warnings were
posted along much of Florida's Gulf Coast, and several counties recommended

Clinton: Visas for Workers May Increase
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton predicted today that Congress will
increase the number of visas for foreign high-tech workers before the end of the
current session and indicated he would sign the legislation. Speaking to
reporters from India, origin of many of the so-called H1B visitors, Clinton said
a major question remaining is how many more than the current 115,000 a year will
be allowed in. H1B visas allow skilled workers to enter the United States for
specified periods to do specific jobs for which employers say American workers
are unavailable. The technology industry says the need is as high as 300,000 a
year.

today. Shane Walton returned an interception 60 yards for a touchdown as the
Irish (2-1) scored 17 points off Purdue mistakes to send the Boilermakers to
their 12th straight loss at Notre Dame. The Boilermakers (2-1) also were hurt by
a blocked punt that set up a Notre Dame touchdown and a failed fake punt that
led to an Irish field goal.

<HEADLINE> Jenoff says rabbi also tried to have witness slain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A private investigator who says Rabbi Fred
Neulander hired him to kill Neulander's wife also claims the rabbi
tried to have a witness slain.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Jenoff has admitted hitting Carol Neulander in the back
of the head with a metal pipe in her Cherry Hill home. He pleaded
guilty to aggravated manslaughter and agreed to testify against
Neulander in the Nov. 1, 1994, killing.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities claim the rabbi wanted his wife of 29 years dead so
he could continue an affair with Philadelphia radio personality
Elaine Soncini. Neulander allegedly believed a divorce would
jeopardize his position as senior rabbi at a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill reported in Saturday's editions
that Jenoff told authorities that Neulander suggested using a stun
gun against Pepe Levin, a Pennsauken businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander allegedly made the request after he found out Levin
had testified against him before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Levin said Neulander had asked if he knew
anyone willing to kill Neulander's wife, the Courier-Post reported.
Levin also said the rabbi had expressed a desire to go home one
night and find his wife dead on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said to me that Pepe had, uh, a bad heart or had heart
attacks, that if the gun was placed on his heart, would it kill
him?'' Jenoff said in a July 27 interview in the Camden County
prosecutor's office. ''And I said I really don't know. I said they
have new models with like 200,000 volts, it probably would, but
mine is an old model.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff said Neulander suggested that Levin be attacked outside
his Route 70 business or a gym in Cherry Hill. Jenoff claims he
turned down the rabbi's request, and suggested Neulander was in
enough trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff also claimed Neulander once asked if a stun gun could be
used to kill Mrs. Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, no, it would just knock her out ... for probably three
to five minutes,'' Jenoff said during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff did not specify when the alleged statements about the
stun gun took place.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zucker, one of the attorneys representing Neulander,
said Jenoff's comments ''were as incredible as everything else he's
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's attorney said he had not read his client's statement.
Levin's attorney, Jaime Kaigh, could not be reached for comment. An
answering service at Kaigh's office said Saturday that Kaigh would
be unavailable until Monday.

European Truckers Win Concessions

   LONDON (AP) -- The Netherlands and Hungary handed concessions to truckers

intensified. British motorists were still lining up at gas stations two days
after truckers ended their blockades of oil facilities as the country worked to
recover from the protest. Scattered protests continued in parts of Europe. After
initially refusing any subsidies to truckers, the Dutch government agreed to
give taxi, bus and trucking companies, as well as other fuel-using companies,
some $300 million to compensate for high fuel prices, Dutch television said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Netherlands and Hungary handed concessions to
truckers Saturday to avoid more of the fuel-price protests that
have clogged Europe's highways, but Germany warned its truckers of
a crackdown if blockades there intensified.
</P>
<P>
   British motorists were still lining up at gas stations two days
after truckers ended their blockades of oil facilities as the
country worked to recover from the protest. Scattered protests
continued in parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After initially refusing any subsidies to truckers, the Dutch
government agreed to give taxi, bus and trucking companies, as well
as other fuel-using companies, some $300 million to compensate for
high fuel prices, Dutch television said. Companies also will be
granted an extra three months to pay road taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch truckers, who have paralyzed highways with roadblocks for
nearly a week, halted their protests. They had threatened action on
Tuesday when Queen Beatrix is due to ride through the streets of
The Hague in a horse-drawn carriage to parliament to present the
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian truckers had also threatened protests, but the
government averted that for the time being at least when they
agreed Saturday to postpone a 6 percent increase in excise taxes as
long as the world crude oil price remains above $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an important achievement for us,'' said Istan
Galambos, spokesman for the seven organizations representing
truckers and taxi drivers. Union officials agreed in return to hold
off on any demonstrations while the two sides hold further
negotiations next week.
</P>
<P>
   Without the revenues expected from the delayed tax, which had
been due to start Jan. 1, ''we'll just grit our teeth and squeeze
it out without backtracking on our planned public sector wage hikes
and investment plans,'' Economics Minister Gyoergy Matolcsy said.
</P>
<P>
   MOL, the Hungarian oil and gas company, raised wholesale
gasoline prices by 2.7 percent and diesel prices 5.4 percent
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   European governments have taken a variety of stances when faced
by the truckers protests that have swept across the continent,
starting in France on Sept. 4. France granted the truckers a tax
break. The British government rejected any changes in its fuel
taxes, Europe's highest.
</P>
<P>
   Europe adopted high gas taxes decades ago as an environmental
measure to discourage excessive fuel consumption. Taxes range from
51 percent in Greece to 73 percent in Britain, where diesel cost an
average of $4.33 a gallon last month.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have tripled since last December, to more than
$30 per barrel from $10, reaching a level transport workers call a
threat to their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany on Saturday, truckers with horns blaring drove at a
snail's pace through Hanover, Osnabrueck and Meiningen as well as
on highways around Ulm, but caused no serious disruptions, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   As in Britain, truckers in Germany appear to have broad public
support -- some 70 percent in favor, according to a poll for the
Bild newspaper and MDR television.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Otto Schily, in an interview with Der Spiegel,
warned that he would use federal border patrol officers to clear
any illegal blockades.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar agreed Saturday to push for stable fuel prices and
said they're weighing measures to aid sectors hit by rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to take any decisions in the short term that
won't contribute to the stability of fuel prices,'' Aznar said at a
joint news conference with Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, some 15 truckers protesting high fuel prices blocked
one of Stockholm's two main harbor areas Saturday, obstructing
ferry traffic. Protesters said they would allow only foods and
medicines to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   Trucker spokesman Adam Flamholc warned of more protests if the
government doesn't act to cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian truckers threatened strikes. In Denmark, about 1,100
truckers met Saturday and decided to hold off on similar protests
until they meet with the government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where the fuel distribution system was still
recovering from the strikes, the government continued to struggle
with the political fallout. ''We need to do more to get OPEC to get
the world petrol price down,'' Treasury chief Gordon Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, ending a four-day visit to
London, said he would press fellow OPEC members to create a
mechanism to link production to price, to stabilize prices for
consumers. But he said it was unfair to blame the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries entirely for recent protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the oil producer gets paid is about 16 percent. The
majority of it is tax, which in fairness to the government of this
country they have accepted and admitted,'' Obasanjo said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Dead, 4 Hurt in Burundi Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Men in military uniforms attacked a
Hutu suburb of Burundi's capital, killing six people and wounding
four others, witnesses said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour battle began late Friday and lasted until early
Saturday morning in Kamenge, where a health clinic owned by a
member of the Hutu majority was raided for medical supplies.
Patients were not harassed, but the attackers did ask for the Hutu
medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   Deo Tungicimana fled through a back door and hid until the end
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attackers spent an hour and a half trying to break open
the door. I think the people who attacked were familiar with the
place because they directed themselves straight to the storage
room,'' Tungicimana said.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's Tutsi dominated army has been fighting Hutu rebels
since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu. A Tutsi elite has
dominated the government, army and business interests since
independence in 1962, though they are a minority.
</P>
<P>
   A woman living behind the clinic told The Associated Press that
her baby was kidnapped by the attackers, but later returned in
exchange for a small ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attackers had military uniforms and they were accompanied
by very young children. All had guns. Some had boots and others
wore sandals,'' she said, asking not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers tried to stop the attack, but were killed in the
fighting, said Nimbazi Deogratias, the Hutu chief of Kamenge. He
added: ''If it had not been for the security forces, a lot of
people would have died. There are a lot of rebel infiltrations in
this area.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attackers came to steal and kill. They took their time and
the security forces did not assist us,'' said one eyewitness, who
watched the attack from a hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   Kamenge, a predominantly Hutu suburb, was largely destroyed in
1993 when it was used by rebels to attack the capital, Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, one of Burundi's main Hutu rebel groups agreed
to participate in next week's cease-fire negotiations, Deputy
President Jacob Zuma said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the rebel group Forces of National Liberation will
travel to Nairobi, Kenya, to take part in negotiations aiming to
end Burundi's seven-year civil war, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting is set to be the first time Hutu rebels have
participated in the peace talks. Rebel groups had refused to take
part, though they did meet with former President Nelson Mandela,
chief mediator in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The government, the military, seven Hutu parties and 10 Tutsi
parties have signed a power-sharing agreement. That document does
not provide for a cease fire.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Camps Meet About Debates  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign aides for Al Gore and George W. Bush
agreed Saturday to a series of three debates moderated by Jim
Lehrer of PBS that both sides said will provide more flexibility
and more of a ''free-flowing style'' than previous debates.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns and officials from the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates called the new approach ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the strict guidelines of past debates, the
moderator more discretion in following up on questions and allowing
the candidates to continue to debate a particular topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives the moderator a more free-flowing style and more
discretion to stay on one particular subject,'' said Don Evans,
campaign chairman for Gov. Bush. ''There will be an opportunity for
a very free-flowing, substantive, real and genuine discussion of
the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman William Daley said he was pleased with
the final lineup of formats and the expanded discretion for Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are interesting formats and they give the American people
the greatest opportunity... to see these candidates and to listen
to them specifically speak on issues of great importance to the
American people,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he spoke with the vice president who told him he was
''extremely pleased'' with the results of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials were enthusiastic about the final plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good day for the process and a good day for
America,'' said Paul Kirk, co-chairman of the commission and a
former chairman of the Democratic National Committee
</P>
<P>
   Commission co-chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, a former chairman of
the Republican National Committee, said having three different
formats will allow voters to see the candidates in a variety of
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not electing the best debater and that is why seeing
these candidates in different formats is particularly important,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said of the final plan:
''It is a new way to debate. For the first time, we are going to
have a wide-open format.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute debates are set to start at 9 p.m. EDT on:
</P>
<P>
   --Oct. 3 at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts
in a traditional, two-lectern format.
</P>
<P>
   --Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. in a
talk show style format seated around a table with the moderator.
That approach is unprecedented in a presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   --Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis, the candidates
will hold a town hall debate similar to ones held in 1992 and 1996
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential candidates will debate Oct. 5 at Centre
College in Danville, Ky. The running mates will also hold their
debate in the talk show format with the moderator to be named early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The televised presidential debates, which have taken place in
every election since 1976, began with the Nixon-Kennedy debates in
1960. Before 1988, the debates were sponsored by either the
campaigns themselves or groups like the League of Women Voters. The
bipartisan commission first sponsored debates in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides had already accepted the three-format plan, which the
bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates proposed in January.
Republican Bush had earlier balked at both the suggested formats
and the commission's three-debate schedule, but agreed to the plan
after coming under criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns met 7&AMP;frac12; hours on Friday then broke to review
the proposal before meeting again Saturday for 5 hours to work out
details and sign off on the formats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had pushed for more informal debate formats and said nearly
two weeks ago said he would accept only one commission debate and
two networks debates -- one on NBC and another on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.'' Gore rejected Bush's idea. Bush aides gave in Thursday and
agreed to the three commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan and Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader, both registering single digits in national polls, most
likely will not meet the commission's threshold of 15 percent in
media polls for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan lost a legal battle to enter the debates in a ruling
released Friday. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Roberts rejected
Buchanan's claim against the Federal Election Commission for
dismissing his complaint against the debate commission concerning
the 15 percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Of being selected to be moderator for a second straight
election, Lehrer said through a spokesman: ''It's an honor to be
asked. I am delighted to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Camps Agree on Debates  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign aides for Al Gore and George W. Bush
agreed Saturday to a series of three debates moderated by Jim
Lehrer of PBS that both sides said will provide more flexibility
and more of a ''free-flowing style'' than previous debates.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns and officials from the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates called the new approach ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the strict guidelines of past debates, the
moderator more discretion in following up on questions and allowing
the candidates to continue to debate a particular topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives the moderator a more free-flowing style and more
discretion to stay on one particular subject,'' said Don Evans,
campaign chairman for Gov. Bush. ''There will be an opportunity for
a very free-flowing, substantive, real and genuine discussion of
the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman William Daley said he was pleased with
the final lineup of formats and the expanded discretion for Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are interesting formats and they give the American people
the greatest opportunity... to see these candidates and to listen
to them specifically speak on issues of great importance to the
American people,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he spoke with the vice president who told him he was

Bush Criticizes Gore's Policies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP)-- George W. Bush sharpened his criticism of
Democratic rival Al Gore's policy proposals today and told Republican activists
that Gore is taking a California victory for granted. ''My opponent has made the
mistake of already counting the votes of California -- but we are going to earn
them,'' Bush said, looking to reassure the GOP faithful that he will fight
all-out to win the nation's largest state. Bush used the address beamed by
satellite into the California Republican convention to pull together attacks on
Gore's initiatives on Medicare, Social Security, taxes and education.

Fate of Philippine Hostages Unclear
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Thousands of troops leading an assault to free
rebel-held hostages pursued Muslim guerrillas through the jungle Saturday and
helicopter gunships strafed rebel hide-outs. But the fate of 19 hostages,
including an American, was unclear. The military imposed a news blackout after
the surprise attack aimed at rescuing the hostages held on remote Jolo island.
Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday following nearly five
months of negotiations with Abu Sayyaf rebels and the reported payment of more
than $15 million in ransom for other captives.

Wildfire Rages in Colorado
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Flames leapt from tree to tree and shot high into the
air today as a wildfire raged through almost 500 acres west of the city,
prompting authorities to call for the evacuation of 200 mountain homes. A plume
of smoke thousands of feet high was visible from Fort Collins, nearly 50 miles
away. Lt. Joe Gang, spokesman for the Boulder County Sheriff's Office, issued an
urgent plea for more help, saying the 100 firefighters struggling to extinguish
the blaze had been slowed by the area's rough terrain.

Storm Gordon Looms Over Florida
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast today as
Hurricane Gordon bore down on central and southern Florida. The storm had
deluged Cuba with up to 10 inches of rain before reaching hurricane strength
with 75 mph winds this afternoon. Gordon was expected to strike land between
Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late tomorrow. But its unpredictability
and direction changes left forecasters urging all coastal areas from Florida to
Alabama to closely monitor its progress.

Clinton Presses Nursing Home Funds
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending $1 billion to remedy
what he said is inadequate staffing at nursing homes, the ''number one culprit''
leading to neglect for too many older Americans. ''Older Americans, who have
worked hard all their lives, deserve respect, not neglect,'' Clinton said today
in his weekly radio address. He was broadcast live from the Washington Home, a
venerable nursing home not far from the White House.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At the Sydney International Aquatic Center,
Australia's teen ''Thorpedo'' launched his Olympic career Saturday with two gold

Saturday -- when only four finals were held.

UCLA Beats Michigan, 23-20

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ryan McCann had a sub-par first half again and it
proved to be the right decision as the Bruins beat the country's third-ranked
team for the second time in three games. McCann passed for 236 yards and two
touchdowns, including a 2-yarder to Ed Ieremia-Stansbury with 6:30 remaining, as
the No. 14 Bruins rallied for a 23-20 victory over Michigan today.

Washington Beats Colorado, 17-14
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Marques Tuiasosopo rallied Washington to two
fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the No. 9 Huskies held off Colorado 17-14 today
as coach Rick Neuheisel made a triumphant return to Boulder. Washington (3-0)
trailed 7-3 until Willie Hurst ran 2 yards for a touchdown on the second play of
the fourth quarter, capping a 63-yard drive.

<HEADLINE> Pygmy Sperm Whale May Stay Captive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A baby pygmy sperm whale found stranded on
a Key West beach might become the first of its species to live
permanently in captivity because it might not be able to hunt for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Marine mammal experts will decide within the next few weeks
whether Summer, a 205-pound, six-foot female whale found in June,
can be released to its natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the calf, who was never weaned by her mother, can't
forage for food and possibly has a ruptured air sac on her head.
</P>
<P>
   Though a ruptured sac isn't serious in captivity, it makes deep
diving impossible. Pygmy sperm whales catch squid and jellyfish at
depths of more than 800 feet. Veterinarians are planning an MRI to
determine the air sac's condition.
</P>
<P>
   If marine biologists decide that Summer can't be freed, the
11-month-old would be the only rehabilitated pygmy sperm whale in
captivity. According to experts, the most time a baby pygmy sperm
whale has lived in captivity after being stranded is 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   The whale, named by handlers at Wildlife Rescue, has been living
at a seaside nursery on Stock Island near Key West.

<HEADLINE> UN Said To Pledge Mideast Troops  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United Nations is prepared to send
peacekeeping troops along a future Israeli-Palestinian border
should a peace accord be signed, a top Palestinian official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of final borders between Israel and a future
Palestinian entity is one of the main subjects to be resolved in
negotiations for a peace deal, which have been deadlocked over the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath, in Washington for
consultations on the floundering peace process, said U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan made the assurance during a meeting
between the two at the United Nations earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. spokesman's office had no immediate comment on the
secretary-general's reported assurance to Shaath.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli negotiators returned to the region after
several days of separate talks in New York and Washington with U.S.
officials trying to revive the talks after their breakdown over the
Jerusalem issue at a Camp David summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath, speaking to The Associated Press from Washington, said
the Americans were drawing up an assessment paper to help determine
how the sides can best move forward in their last-ditch effort to
clinch a Mideast peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paper will show where we are and how things can be pushed
forward. Maybe it will lead to serious negotiations,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Palestinians were ''not ready to make concessions''
on Jerusalem. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has insisted on
Palestinian or Muslim sovereignty over all of east Jerusalem --
including holy sites there -- something Israel has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, some 50
Palestinian teen-agers, on their way home from a pro-refugee march
Saturday, threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired several
rounds of tear gas to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
   The youth hurled the stones at soldiers who guard an Israeli
enclave in Bethlehem -- Rachel's Tomb -- the traditional burial site
of the biblical matriarch.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers had broken away from a march by some 250 people
from Bethlehem's Dheisheh refugee camp to Rachel's Tomb, demanding
the right of Palestinian refugees who were displaced during wars
with Israel to return to their homes. The refugee question is one
of the main issues being dealt with in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The march marked 18 years since the September 1982 massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians, many of them women and children, by
Lebanese militiamen allowed into the Sabra and Shatilla refugee
camps by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been looking to Arab leaders to ease
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into a compromise over Jerusalem.
But many Arab countries have backed to the Palestinian stance.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Saturday, the foreign minister of the
Persian Gulf state of Oman insisted that there was ''no sovereignty
possible'' over Jerusalem -- known in Arabic as al-Quds -- ''except
that of the Palestinian state.''

<HEADLINE> BIC to sue N.J. company over national lighter recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - Bic Corp. announced Saturday that it will
file a lawsuit against a New Jersey company accused of illegally
importing 294,000 BIC lighters for sale in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vaid Enterprises of Jersey City, N.J., is recalling the lighters
because young children could ignite them, the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission said. The lighters, made by Milford-based BIC,
lack federally required child-resistant mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the company nor the agency is aware of any injuries
involving the lighters, the product safety commission said. CPSC
announced the recall on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recalled lighters are gray goods, meaning they were never
intended for sale in the U.S., and were illegally brought into this
country by Vaid Enterprises,'' said Thomas M. Kelleher, senior vice
president-administration and general counsel for BIC. ''The
recalled lighters were produced in a BIC factory in France for sale
in markets outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   BIC plans to file the lawsuit next week, said Linda K. Kwong, a
company spokeswoman. She could not say where the lawsuit would be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to take a real aggressive posture with the importer,''
Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said BIC has brought lawsuits in federal court against
importers of gray market BIC lighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''BIC aggressively approaches stores that are selling illegally
imported products to find the source of the product and, where
appropriate, we pursue legal action against the importers and
distributors,'' Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaid could not be reached for comment Saturday. The company is
not listed in the telephone directory. A number supplied by BIC was
outdated.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable lighters being recalled are oval-shaped ''BIC''
and mini-''BIC'' brand lighters. They have a green, red, blue,
black or yellow body; a metal top; and do not have a metal shield
over the sparkwheel.
</P>
<P>
   The standard size lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600020.
The mini-lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600051.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, gas, grocery and thrift stores in the East sold the
lighters from January through April for about $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should stop using these lighters immediately and
return them to the place of purchase for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The recall does not involve lighters sold by BIC in the U.S.,
which all comply with the CPSC child-resistant standard.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, consumers should call the CPSC at
1-800-638-2772.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli Conductor Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Israeli conductor David Shallon, a one-time
assistant of Leonard Bernstein at the New York Philharmonic who
went on to lead orchestras around the world, died in Tokyo after
suffering an asthma attack. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
   Shallon, in Japan to conduct the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony
Orchestral, was rushed to a hospital following the Friday night
attack and pronounced dead soon thereafter, Kyodo News agency said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor, who until recently was musical director of the
Jerusalem Israel Broadcasting Authority Orchestra, came to Japan in
early September for concerts with the Tokyo group.
</P>
<P>
   Shallon's wife, violist Tabea Zimmermann, had performed in the
Tokyo concerts as a soloist, associates in Israel said. The two
often performed together.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shallon was at a very promising stage of his career,'' said
Gidon Paz, who served as the IBA orchestra's managing director
while Shallon was musical director.
</P>
<P>
   He said Shallon was promoted new music and was especially
helpful in giving voice to upcoming Israeli composers by providing
venues for their music to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Shallon worked closely with the late conductor Leonard Bernstein
throughout the years and served as his assistant at the New York
Philharmonic in the 1970s, Paz said.
</P>
<P>
   Shallon was currently serving as conductor of the Luxembourg
Symphony Orchestra and had homes both in Tel Aviv and in a small
town outside of Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Shallon studied at the Vienna Academy of Music. He went on to
conduct at orchestras around the world including the Dusseldorf
Symphony, the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony, and the San
Francisco Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The Tel Aviv-born Shallon is survived by his wife and their
two-year-old son Yuval.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles Transit Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bus drivers hoisted picket signs under the
scorching Southern California sun, and riders scrambled for other
transportation Saturday as a transit strike expected to affect as
many as 450,000 of Los Angeles County's poorest residents began.
</P>
<P>
   The contract dispute with the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority left only a handful of buses serving a 1,400-square-mile
area. Several suburban municipal bus lines expanded their service
to downtown Saturday, but their routes reach only a tiny fraction
of riders.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Koujamanian, 46, sat at a bus stop for more than an hour
Saturday before learning about the strike and realizing no bus
would come. She ended up paying $20 for a taxi ride from Hollywood
to the downtown Men's Central Jail to visit her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't afford it,'' she said. ''I'm a nanny. I live day by
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Three unions representing 6,750 MTA drivers, clerks and
mechanics walked out of negotiations Saturday at one minute after
midnight, and no new talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   MTA board chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke released a
statement Saturday asking the union to resume contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The MTA calls upon the bus drivers' union to get our employees
back to work and to get back to the bargaining table,'' she said.
''The MTA management is empowered to negotiate and is ready to
resume negotiations immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Contracts with the United Transportation Union, Amalgamated
Transit Union and Transportation Communications International Union
expired June 30. The waiting period imposed by Gov. Gray Davis to
avoid a strike during the Democratic National Convention ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides disagree over work rules, wage and benefits
increases. The MTA offered 2.7 percent raises per year for three
years; the unions wanted 4 percent per year. The MTA dropped its
proposal for a four-day, 10-hour work week, which had been a major
point of contention. The union had argued it would amount to
forced, unpaid overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The strike idled 2,000 buses as well as Metro Rail commuter
lines. Authorities had planned to keep five routes operating with
private contractors, but Teamsters union members are honoring the
strike and refusing to comply, MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is out of luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 7 percent of commuters in Los Angeles County use
public transit, but those who do often have few alternatives.
Sixty-eight percent have household incomes under $15,000 per year,
and nearly three-quarters of bus riders are black or Hispanic,
according to the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Latrice Gamble of Los Angeles said she relies on the bus to take
her 9-year-old daughter to school and to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need that bus. That's my means of transportation,'' she
said. ''They shouldn't inconvenience people this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers sympathized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel bad, because some people have got to get to hospitals
and things like that,'' said driver Jose de Freitas, wielding a
picket sign outside MTA headquarters. ''But we've got to protect
what the other drivers have fought for.''
</P>
<P>
   De Freitas scoffed at MTA contentions that the average driver
earns $50,000 per year and can make an additional $20,000 in
overtime. He earns $18,000 per year, de Freitas said. The ''$70,000
guys'' have 20 years of seniority and work seven days a week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA says it must cut costs. It averages $98.66 per hour to
run a bus, 50 percent higher than for some other county transit
agencies, the MTA said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Transportation said road
maintenance and construction will be suspended during morning and
evening peak commute hours during the strike.

<HEADLINE> Officials weigh spraying to fight West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Garrison, a leader in the small rural community of Hebron,
suddenly finds himself making a potentially life-and-death
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison and officials from Columbia and Lebanon met Saturday
with residents to discuss plans to spray a pesticide to fight the
West Nile virus. The meeting was held in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection is recommending
spraying in a two-mile radius covering those towns as well as in
Milford, Bethel and Danbury.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying would not begin until Wednesday at the earliest,
DEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation comes after horses in Danbury, Hebron and
Milford were diagnosed with the West Nile virus, the first cases of
infection in mammals in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
   The horses in Hebron and Danbury were euthanized on Aug. 30 and
Sept. 7. The horse in Milford became sick on Sept. 5, but is
recovering, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are concerned about the effects of the
pesticides. Garrison said he understands those concerns, but he is
worried that a lack of spraying could lead to human fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be sitting here a month from now lamenting why
we didn't spray and we have some fatalities,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   While Garrison wants to spray, Joyce Okonuk, first selectman in
Lebanon, wants more information after hearing the residents'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I haven't decided. I want to learn more,''
Okonuk said.
</P>
<P>
   A phone conference is planned Monday between the DEP and
officials from Columbia, Hebron and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP has a preliminary agreement with officials in Milford,
Bethel and Danbury to spray, said Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state takes the recommendation for spraying very
seriously,'' Sullivan said. ''Any pesticide has a risk, but this
pesticide poses a low risk to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of human transmission is higher now because the type of
mosquitoes which bit the horses also bite humans, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the highest risk we've ever seen for West Nile virus
in Connecticut,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that risk remains low, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been reported
in Connecticut this summer, but infections have been reported in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems
are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of flu-like symptoms. In the
most serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or
swelling of the brain, which can lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 130,000 mosquitoes have been trapped around
the state and tested at the Agricultural Experiment Station.
Infected bird-biting mosquitoes were found earlier this summer in
Stamford and Norwalk. The state also has found the virus in 279
dead birds in 47 different municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Nile virus is back with a vengeance this year. It is much
more widespread than any of us expected it would be,'' said
Theodore Andreadis, head of the mosquito testing program at the
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.

<HEADLINE> OAS: Peru Should Suspend Spy Chief  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Organization of American States demanded
Saturday that the government of President Alberto Fujimori suspend
Peru's intelligence chief and other officials allegedly involved in
the bribing of an opposition legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The strongly-worded demand came as opposition parties increased
their calls for Fujimori, who was re-elected in a controversial
vote earlier this year, to step down and allow new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS said that opposition groups had informed the
organization that unless intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos
were fired, they would not join OAS-sponsored talks with the
government on strengthening democracy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations ''are of the utmost seriousness'' and require
the government to ''respond with quick and severe actions which
result in the suspension from public duties of those accused,'' the
OAS said in a statement released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the numerous accusations'' against Montesinos in recent
months, it would be difficult to move ahead with the OAS-sponsored
democracy talks ''if prompt action is not taken,'' the OAS said.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, Fujimori's closest adviser and the feared head of
the National Intelligence Service, was seen in a video released
Thursday apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri to
support the government.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-minute video, which had poor sound quality, showed Kouri
signing a document that apparently formalized his resignation from
the opposition. Montesinos then handed Kouri what seemed to be a
thick wad of bills.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the broadcast was broadcast Thursday night, Kouri
said the meeting with Montesinos had been to discuss matters of
national security. Hours later, he admitted having received $22,500
from Montesinos -- but said it was a loan to buy a truck to
distribute food to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Montesinos has been accused of illicit
enrichment and engineering smear campaigns against Fujimori's
opponents in this year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The political storm over the bribery allegations came as
Fujimori was trying to repair damage to his image abroad from
charges of widespread fraud in his election to an unprecedented
third term in May.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fujimori's political alliance won only 52 seats in the
120-member Congress in May, a dozen opposition congressmen quickly
joined the government's ranks, giving Fujimori majority control.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the May presidential runoff
after charging Fujimori planned to rig the results, later accused
the government of offering congressmen elected on his ticket
$50,000 and upwards to join Fujimori's alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Olivera, the opposition congressman who released the
tape, said Saturday that Fujimori's vice president, Francisco
Tudela, should head a transition government and call new elections
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Valle Riestra, a constitutional expert and a former prime
minister in the Fujimori government, urged Congress to shorten
Fujimori's five-year term to one year and call ''truly free
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Fujimori for not speaking out since the video
scandal erupted. ''If Fujimori remains silent, he is going to be
dragged down by this crisis,'' Valle Riestra said.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rain in Guatemala Kills 20  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Floods and mudslides from four days of
torrential rains have wrecked buildings and bridges and swept
through villages in Guatemala, leaving at least 20 people dead and
dozens injured, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have evacuated more than 200 families, while
collapsed bridges have caused dozens of injuries. Major highways
were flooded and more than 50 homes have been destroyed throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Crews rescued three people Saturday from a school that collapsed
under the weight of heavy rains in Zacapa, 70 miles northwest of
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny mountain hamlet of Teleman, 125 miles north of the
capital, crews Saturday recovered the bodies of 15 people swept
away Wednesday by strong currents while trying to push a pickup
truck across a river. Nine others in the truck survived.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a mudslide demolished a home on the southwestern
outskirts of Guatemala City, killing an 8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the Concepcion River overflowed its banks after
officials opened the flood gates of a dangerously full dam,
flooding at least 20 homes and injuring 10 people in Escuintla, 30
miles south of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, mudslides buried two poor communities on the
hillsides outside the Guatemalan capital, killing three children
and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated two dozen other families from the same
area early Saturday before more falling mud engulfed their homes.
One person remained missing, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains also forced the evacuation of more than 100 people
from mountain villages in three other northern Guatemalan states,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expected the rains to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan Health Minister Mario Bolanos said the tragedies have
occurred in areas where people have been warned of the dangers but
have refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say they aren't afraid and choose to live in areas that
during the rainy season are always hit with mudslides and floods,''
Bolanos said. ''The tragedies we are seeing now are in areas that
everyone knew were unsafe.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses Nursing Home Funds  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending $1 billion
to remedy what he said is inadequate staffing at nursing homes, the
''number one culprit'' leading to neglect for too many older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Older Americans, who have worked hard all their lives, deserve
respect, not neglect,'' Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio
address. He was broadcast live from the Washington Home, a
venerable nursing home not far from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress, which expects to consider
health care this fall, ''will try to find fair middle ground'' on a
variety of issues, said John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Special Committee
on Aging, found the president's proposal ''promising'' and awaited
details.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking before about 100 residents and employees at
the nursing home, said he believes Congress could act this year on
his five-year plan to increase nursing home staffing levels and
raise the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the obligations we owe to one another, our most sacred
duty is to our parents,'' Clinton said. ''They kept us safe from
harm when we were children, and we must do the same for them as
they grow older. They shouldn't go another day without the care
they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1.6 million Americans are cared for in 16,500 nursing
homes, many of which Clinton said provide quality care. Others,
however, lack both adequate staff and training.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said these problems will only increase as the baby boom
generation ages. He cited a recent government study that concluded
''patients in these homes are more likely to lose too much weight,
develop bed sores (and) fall into depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The report issued in late July by the Health Care Financing
Administration said that at more than half -- 54 percent -- of the
nursing homes surveyed, nursing aides spent less than two hours a
day with patients. The study examined 1,786 nursing homes in three
states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan includes penalties against homes found to be
''endangering the safety of their residents.'' Fines collected
would pay for improved patient care. He also directed the
regulators to establish minimum staffing requirements for homes
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   To help families in selecting a nursing home, Clinton said the
government will require all facilities to post the number of health
care personnel on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''A key factor for my support is securing accountability from
nursing homes that they will spend the additional money only on
staffing,'' said Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging
said the president's plan was ''a very important step.'' Mary Alice
Ryan, head of the group's board of directors, said the proposal
would let states ''reward homes that staff at higher levels'' or
have innovative programs to recruit, retain and train staff.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International
Union, which represents 100,000 nursing home workers, said
Clinton's recognition of a link between staffing and quality care
is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles H. Roadman II, president of the American Health Care
Association, which represents 12,000 long-term care providers,
cited a need for a government program to attract 250,000 new
certified nursing assistants and 60,000 new licensed practical and
registered nurses to the profession.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United Nations is prepared to send peacekeeping troops
along a future Israeli-Palestinian border should a peace accord be signed, a top

negotiations for a peace deal, which have been deadlocked over the future of

<HEADLINE> Gay Army Reservist Fights for Job  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- The Army started making its case
Saturday to dismiss reserve Lt. Steve May, the Arizona legislator
accused of violating the military's ''don't-ask, don't tell'' by
running for office as an openly gay candidate.
</P>
<P>
   May, whose military record is unblemished, wants to finish the
last seven months of his Army commitment.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that while he spoke of his homosexuality as a citizen
and as a public servant, he never spoke of it while actively
serving in the Army. He was honorably discharged in 1995 and not
recalled to active duty until February 1999 in preparation for
possible deployment to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends May was on active status as a reservist
when he acknowledged his sexual orientation during a legislative
debate the same month, even though he had not been yet been called
to duty.
</P>
<P>
   Army attorneys also suggested that May's interviews about his
case on ''Larry King Live,'' ''60 Minutes'' and in a cover story
for Newsweek violated his military duty, May's attorney Christopher
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that's an absurd argument,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three colonels is hearing the case at the Army base
in this Orange County suburb south of Los Angeles and could finish
as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Army attorneys declined to discuss the specifics of the case,
and May requested the hearing be closed.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, instead of seeking a dishonorable discharge, as is
more common in ''don't ask, don't tell'' cases, the Army attorneys
are seeking a general discharge. A dishonorable discharge would
prevent May from getting benefits and being able to re-enlist; a
general discharge is benign.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said the Army spent much of Saturday morning establishing
what both sides already agree upon: May is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the panel believes May violated the ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy, the colonels could allow him to remain in uniform
under a Defense Department provision by declaring the action was
for the good of the military, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Walter C. Herin Jr., deputy staff judge advocate for
the 63rd Army Regional Support Command supervising May's unit, said
that is just one of five provisions May would have to meet.
</P>
<P>
   May also would have to show that his homosexual conduct is a
departure from his usual behavior, that it is unlikely to occur,
that he has not forced homosexual acts on someone else and that he
does not intend to engage in such acts in the future, Herin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army began investigating May after he acknowledged his
sexuality during a legislative hearing on a state bill that would
have prohibited government benefits for employees' gay partners. He
had been open about his homosexuality since his first campaign for
elected office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator recommended May be discharged, though his report
recommends May's commanders consider his performance first. May has
been rated an exceptional officer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamitos is the headquarters for the Army 63rd Regional
Support Command, which oversees May's unit, the 348th
Transportation Company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the first full year of ''don't ask, don't tell,''
discharges totaled 617.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Deaths Shocks Ind. Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Police arrested four people Saturday in
connection with the execution-style killings of three construction
workers found dead inside a barn where they were installing a loft.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Wayne A. Shumaker, 59; Corby Myers, 30; and Lynn
Ganger, 54, were found Thursday afternoon by a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Each victim had been shot in the head, and all were found with
their hands tied behind their backs, said Mike Swanson, commander
of the St. Joseph County Special Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said the three workers may have stumbled upon a burglary
attempt. ''It appears they were caught by surprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Washington Jr., 20, and Phillip A. Stroud, 21, both
of South Bend, were arrested on preliminary charges of murder in
the killings, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Curtiss F. Smith, 24, of South Bend, and
Charity Lynn Payne, 18, of North Liberty. Smith was arrested on a
preliminarily charge of assisting a criminal, and Payne was
arrested on a preliminary charge of burglary, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The barn where the bodies were found is in a rural area midway
between Lakeville and Lapaz in St. Joseph County, about 25 miles
south of South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said Saturday that more arrests were possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the victims' relatives struggled to cope with the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem real,'' said Vonna Miller, a sister of Wayne
Shumaker. ''There' no reason for it.''

<HEADLINE> Fire forces evacuation at Catskill resort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A smoky fire at a storied Catskill
Mountain resort Saturday forced the evacuation of more than 300
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Only minor injuries were reported after the 12:50 p.m. fire at
The Nevele Grand Hotel in Ellenville, in Ulster County about 75
miles northwest of New York City. A handful of guests and two
firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, said
Ellenville Fire Chief Tom Coniker.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started in a maintenance closet next to a ballroom at
the hotel. Coniker said fire damaged only the closet but smoke
spread throughout the eight-story building where 850 people were
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Of the guests, less than half had to be evacuated, Coniker said.
The hotel was back in full swing later Saturday after firefighters
used 17 high powered fans to clear the building of smoke.

<HEADLINE> Fire Prompts Evacuations in Colo.  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Flames leapt from tree to tree and shot
high into the air Saturday as a wildfire raged through more than
600 acres west of the city, prompting authorities to urge the
evacuation of 200 mountain homes.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of smoke hundreds of feet high was visible from Fort
Collins, nearly 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joe Gang, spokesman for the Boulder County Sheriff's Office,
issued an urgent plea for more help, saying the fewer than 200
firefighters struggling to extinguish the blaze had been slowed by
the area's rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the resources to fight this,'' Gang said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started Friday in Walker Ranch Park, an open space area
in the Boulder Mountain Parks about 12 miles southwest of downtown
Boulder. Authorities evacuated Pine Needle Notch subdivision near
the park late Friday, then used reverse 911 calls to encourage
residents of four other communities to evacuate as well.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuations were not mandatory, and Gang said it appeared
some people were staying in their homes or taking family members
and some possessions out and then returning.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze, the fifth major wildfire in Colorado this season, was
devouring forests of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Colorado blue
spruce and pinon, said Justin Dombrowski, spokesman for the
interagency firefighting team.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a serious fire,'' Dombrowski said. ''It's hard to get
crews in there and get good work done because it's so steep and
rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation, but Dombrowski
said there was a strong possibility it was started by people,
possibly as a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were about a half mile from Bill Johnstone's home
Saturday when Johnstone threw some outdoors gear and his checkbook
into his car and climbed a nearby hillside with Denver's skyline in
view. He cheered as slurry bombers fighting the fire roared just a
few hundred feet over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have trade-offs,'' Johnstone said. ''There are bears, a
mountain lion might eat your pet, and there are fires. I'm here
because I love the mountains. If I'm not in the mountains I might
as well be back in Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, firefighters on Saturday were taking control of a
handful of fires in central and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Two wildfires at the Vandenberg Air Force Base burned 9,700
acres before firefighters were able to contain them, accoring to
new satellite photos of the areas.
</P>
<P>
   An 8,500-acre fire between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo,
was about 90 percent contained, Maj. John Cherry said. Earlier in
the week, it had forced the evacuation of the town of Casmalia.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6.7 million acres have burned across the United States
this year, among the nation's worst fire seasons in a half century.
As of Saturday, the National Interagency Fire Center reported 23
fires burning in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,
Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming.

Officials: No Sign of Philippine Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military mortars pounded the camps of Muslim
rebels Sunday as thousands of troops continued their assault to free 19 foreign
and Filipino hostages, but there was still no sign of the captives, officials
said. ''They haven't been eyeballed,'' said presidential press secretary Ricardo
Puno. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to place.'' The military
imposed a news blackout after the surprise attack aimed at rescuing the hostages
held on remote Jolo island. Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday
following nearly five months of negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf rebels and the
reported payment of more than $15 million in ransom for other captives.

another nine Olympic athletes have recorded suspected positive tests.
International Olympic Committee director general Francois Carrard said Sunday

nation is suspended from competition for the rest of that year if three or more
of its weightlifters test positive for banned drugs. A third Romanian

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Rangers 5  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Brian Meadows won his fourth straight
start and Jermaine Dye hit his 33rd homer as the Kansas City Royals
beat the Texas Rangers 8-5 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows, 6-2 with the Royals since he was acquired from San
Diego on July 31, pitched into the eighth inning before Gabe Kapler
hit the 100th pitch he threw for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the three runs in the eighth, only two Texas runners had
past second base against Meadows. Frank Catalanotto beat out an
infield single and Royce Clayton doubled to set up Kapler's 13th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows allowed eight hits and four runs over 7 2-3 innings. He
struck out one with no walks.
</P>
<P>
   Dye, who became the fastest player in Kansas City history to 30
home runs on Aug. 20, hit only his third since on the first pitch
of the fourth inning. That put Kansas City ahead 2-0. Gregg Zaun
had homered an inning earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took advantage of two walks and an error to score
three runs in the sixth. They scored three more times in the
seventh, aided by three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Brian Sikorski (1-3) struck out six through the
first five innings, but was taken out after giving up a walk and a
single to start the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   After Dye walked and Joe Randa singled to start the sixth,
Rangers reliever Jonathan Johnson walked Dee Brown to load the
bases and then threw a wild pitch for a run. An error by first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro allowed another run before Wilson Delgado's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski, who allowed five hits and walked three, is winless in
his four starts since making his debut in the majors with seven
shutout innings against the New York Yankees in a 5-0 victory on
Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit a batter and walked another at the beginning of the
seventh before Randa and Mark Quinn had consecutive RBI singles to
chase him from the game and put the Royals up 7-1. Delgado later
hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored in the sixth after Catalanotto led off with a
single and later scored on Palmeiro's double.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kapler homer that chased Meadows, Ricky Ledee greeted
reliever Ricky Bottalico with a triple off the left-field wall and
then scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Meadows was 7-8 with a 5.24 ERA in 22 starts for San Diego.
... With a win, Kansas City moved its record to 69-80 and avoided
falling to a season-worst 13 games below .500. ... Sikorski was
making a spot start because the Rangers had to play a doubleheader
last Tuesday and manager Johnny Oates didn't want to start Kenny
Rogers on three days rest. Rogers (12-13) will pitch Sunday. ...
Catalanotto had 17 hits in his previous 94 at-bats (.181) before
consecutive singles.

<HEADLINE> Lumberyard fire burns through the night  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEE CENTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fire at a family-owned lumberyard
burned throughout Friday night and much of the day Saturday, doing
about $2 million worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out shortly before 11 p.m. Friday at Bowers &AMP;
Sons Hardwood Lumber, an architectural supply specialist that
produces things like stairs, custom flooring, doors and moldings.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, piles of melted machinery were all that
remained at the nearly 20,000-square-foot storage and manufacturing
building. Firefighters, who pumped hundreds of thousands of gallons
of water on the blaze Friday night, continued to put out hot spots
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least Monday before investigators can get on site
to search for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   The family said it plans to rebuild the business started in
1979. They have insurance.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sydney: Romanian Weightlifters Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Romanian weightlifting team was
thrown out of the Sydney Olympics after two lifters failed drug
tests before the games.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee director general Francois
Carrard said Sunday (Saturday night EDT) that the expulsion of the
Romanian lifting team was ordered by the International
Weightlifting Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Under federation rules, any nation is suspended from competition
for the rest of that year if three or more of its weightlifters
test positive for banned drugs. A third Romanian weightlifter
tested positive earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federation has a rule that if three test positive, the
entire team is suspended,'' Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard also said pre-games tests by the World Anti-Doping
Agency had recorded 20 suspected positives. Of those, nine had been
identified as ''problematic,'' including two cases involving
athletes in the Olympic village, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard did not identify the athletes or federations involved
but said the cases were separate from the Romanian weightlifters.
He said it was up to the federations to sanction the athletes
according to their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is carrying out its own drug testing in Sydney apart
from those of the federations. Carrard said there have been no
positive results so far in those tests.
</P>
<P>
   Traian Ciharean, a bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics,
and Adrian Mateias failed dope tests administered to all 257
Olympic weightlifters. They were expelled from their team.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IWF, weightlifting is the only Olympic sport in
which all athletes were tested for drugs before the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Razvan Ilie, a 1999 world champion in the
snatch at 169&AMP;frac34; pounds, tested positive and was thrown off the team
before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian weightlifting federation last year began
automatically banning for life any lifter who fails a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   At least four other weightlifters have been tossed out of the
Olympics for failing pre-games drug tests: Stian Grimseth of
Norway, and Chen Po-pu, world champion Chen Jui-lien and Wu Mei-yi
of Taiwan. Also sent home was Taiwan coach Tsai Wen-yee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RYDE, Australia (AP) -- Bridgette Gusterson scored two
second-half goals, including the one that put Australia ahead to
stay in a 6-3 victory over Russia at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian women, who had beaten Kazakstan 9-2 in the
first-ever women's Olympic water polo match, had a more difficult
time in this one Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Gusterson, though, pulled them through, scoring twice in under
three minutes. She struggled with Elena Toukoun in close to the
goal, finally breaking free and skipping the ball into the net as
the Aussies went up 4-3 with 52 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mills tipped in a pass from Browyn Mayer for another
Australian goal and Gusterson, the team captain, finished things
with a power shot that chunked off the left sidebar before going
in.
</P>
<P>
   That delighted another packed crowd of Aussie crazies at the
Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center.
</P>
<P>
   Taryn Woods also had two goals for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, at 2-0 in the tournament, face Netherlands on
Monday (Sunday night EDT). The Russians, 0-1-1, take on the United
States later that day (Monday morning EDT).

<HEADLINE> A Heart To Match Thorpe's Big Feet  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Everybody knew about his big feet. What
Ian Thorpe proved to the world Saturday was that he had a heart to
match.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anybody showed up at the Olympic Games with this
much hype to justify, it was Michael Jordan in 1992 with the
original Dream Team in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe has owned every age-group swimming mark worth having
since he was 13. All of Australia has been riding his considerable
wingspan ever since. And so when he took his mark at the Sydney
International Aquatics Center, there was no way to overstate how
much was expected from the Olympic debut of this special
17-year-old with the size 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt,'' he would say afterward, ''like a gladiator walking
into the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   All Thorpe proceeded to do was jump in the pool, break his own
400-meter freestyle record, climb out long enough to collect one
gold medal, then jump back in and anchor the winning leg of what
likely will go down as the greatest 400-meter freestyle relay ever.
</P>
<P>
   All in the span of 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doff my swimcap to the great Ian Thorpe,'' American Gary
Hall said. ''Everybody who had a ticket tonight got their money's
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is as brash as he is talented, yet at that moment he was
nothing but shocked. He had just battled Thorpe stroke for stroke,
breath for breath down the stretch for a U.S. team that broke the
world record by more than a second -- and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is a sprinter, a specialist at the 100 meters the last leg
requires, and Thorpe is not. With 50 meters to go, he led Thorpe by
seven-tenths of a second, a huge gap in the pool, and somehow got
passed.
</P>
<P>
   America vs. Australia in the pool was supposed to be the rivalry
at the center of these games. A ''Thorpedo'' may have changed the
balance of power for good. Little wonder, then, that the smile on
Hall's face was still frozen in place an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dawn Fraser said the race tonight was something the world had
never seen before and who am I to argue?'' he said. ''She's been
around a lot longer than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's blessing might be as important to Thorpe as two more
world records since no Aussie is more beloved, even today. Fraser
won the first of three swimming golds at the 1956 Melbourne Games,
but more important, she inspired the home team to break the U.S.
stranglehold on the sport for the first and, so far, only time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   What Thorpe accomplished in one grand night, beyond burnishing
his own legend, was to reawaken in his countrymen the sense that it
could happen again. In their pool. In their land. And in the sport
Australians consider their birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, this lifts the spirits of the team. Hopefully, this
starts a successful Olympics for us all. Hopefully,'' Thorpe said,
choosing his words carefully, ''this is going to have an avalanche
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 95 percent of Australians live within 10 miles of the sea.
The culture practically resonates to the sound of the surf. When
Thorpe swam in the national trials in May, 60 percent of Australia
tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   A producer for Seven News, which is broadcasting the Olympics
domestically, said he wouldn't be surprised if the number Saturday
night swelled to 80 percent. What he didn't say, but could have, is
that nearly everybody in that audience would be holding their
breath.
</P>
<P>
   For every Dawn Fraser that Australia has produced, there is a
Steve Holland. Much like Thorpe, he stormed into the 1976 Olympics
with 11 world records under his belt. Unlike Thorpe, he bombed,
leaving Montreal with just one bronze. That proved to he his
homeland's only swimming medal of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe has already delivered better, and more, and the games
have just begun. On Monday, he goes after gold in the 200, another
event in which Thorpe holds the record. But his worth already
extends well beyond whatever he hauls in by himself.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Hall had written in his diary for a Web site how
much he respected the Australian swimmers. But maybe because the
U.S. men had never before lost an Olympic 400-meter freestyle
relay, he closed the article with a prediction that Thorpe and his
countrymen couldn't forget: ''We're going to smash them,'' Hall
wrote, ''like guitars.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's teammate, Michael Klim, set a world record on the first
100-meter leg of the race Saturday. Seconds after Thorpe held up
his end of the bargain by relentlessly hunting down Hall like a
shark, Klim spun poolside toward the Americans and began playing an
air guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, someone asked Hall whether the imaginary tune would
fracture the psyche of a U.S. team that came to Sydney almost
certain it couldn't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I go home and all the guys are lying around in a state of
depression,'' he said, ''I'll know the answer.''

<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Sylvain Cloutier and Jay Pandolfo
scored third-period, power-play goals to lead New Jersey to a 5-4
exhibition victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 3, Cloutier beat Penguins goalie
Sebastien Caron at 7:41 of the third. Just over five minutes later,
Pandolfo fanned on a shot, but the puck still slid through Caron's
pads.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champion Devils, playing their
preseason opener, jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the opening 9:25 of
the first period. Ed Ward scored 34 seconds into the game, Colin
White tallied at 2:12 and Steve Kelly netted a short-handed goal at
9:25.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka and Robert Lang rallied
the Penguins to a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksey Morozov's goal with 32 seconds left in the third put the
Penguins within a goal. But with 4.4 seconds left, Devils goalie
Frederic Henry gloved a deflection of a Toby Petersen shot.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Gordon Threatens Florida  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast
on Saturday as Hurricane Gordon bore down on central Florida. The
storm had deluged Cuba with up to 10 inches of rain before reaching
hurricane strength with 75 mph winds Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was expected to strike land between Fort Myers and the
Panhandle sometime late Sunday. But its unpredictability and
direction changes left forecasters urging all coastal areas from
Florida to Alabama to closely monitor its progress.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put emergency response teams on standby
Saturday, and in some counties, disaster officials recommended
voluntary evacuation of barrier islands and areas prone to
flooding. Coastal areas were told to anticipate a storm surge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gonna be a nuisance, bringing a lot of rain, possible
flooding along the Gulf Coast with storm surge and possible
tornadoes,'' said Chris Robbins, a meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The center's tropical storm warning Saturday covered a 210-mile
stretch from Bonita Beach, just south of Fort Myers, to the
Suwannee River, about 100 miles north of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was issued for a 400-mile stretch from Bonita
Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. The watch means a
storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could hit within the next 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   As skies grayed over the Tampa Bay area Saturday, people didn't
seem too concerned about the approaching storm. Along Clearwater
Beach, only a few homeowners had boarded up their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Nava of Tampa and Jim Phillips of Clearwater bought 15
50-pound bags of potting soil to use as sandbags. Both live in low
lying areas and said they planned to barricade their front doorways
with the potting soil to keep flood water out.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lehfeldt recently moved to Tampa from New York City and
wasn't sure what to expect. He bought plastic weatherproofing to
cover windows of his house, duct tape, batteries and flashlights --
just in case. ''I'll secure parts of the house that are vulnerable,
then watch TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, the meteorologist, said people shouldn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a minimal hurricane,'' he said. ''Of course, I don't
want to minimize its importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, Gordon was about 235 miles southwest of Tampa
and moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, a slight shift to the
north from earlier in the day when the storm was headed
northeasterly.
</P>
<P>
   Two to five inches of rain were expected to fall across parts of
South Florida and the Keys on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties
told residents who wanted to leave to start packing and that
shelters would be opened in the evening. Other counties were
awaiting later forecasts before deciding whether to advise
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state on the Atlantic Coast, NASA considered moving
the space shuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad at Cape
Canaveral and into its hangar. Discovery is scheduled to blast off
Oct. 5 on a space station construction mission.
</P>
<P>
   A Sunday baseball game between Oakland and Tampa was also
postponed as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gordon's rainfall in Cuba early Saturday, the
storm pounded Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, causing street
flooding in the resort city of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlantic, wind blew across Bermuda at 60 mph early
Saturday as Hurricane Florence passed north of the island. There
was no damage or flooding, said James Buxton, meteorologist with
the Bermuda Weather Service. Florence, down-graded to a tropical
storm, was 510 miles southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Saturday
evening with sustained winds of 70 mph and was expected to pass
near eastern Newfoundland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least
three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Near its center, Florence still packed hurricane force winds of
80 mph but some weakening was forecast in the next day and the
storm was forecast to lose its tropical characteristics, said
meteorologist Dan Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a tropical storm watch in the Leeward Islands was
discontinued after a tropical depression sighted early Saturday was
downgraded to a tropical wave.

</P>
<P>
   Nashville trailed 2-1 after a period, but Classen's power-play

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Auburn 34, LSU 17  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- For all the talk about Auburn's newfound
running game, the No. 24 Tigers proved they can win with the pass --
and a huge return.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Leard threw two touchdown passes and Tim Carter returned a
kickoff 100 yards for a score as Auburn beat LSU 34-17 on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first SEC win at home for Auburn (3-0, 2-0 in
the league) since 1997. The Tigers did it before a record crowd of
85,612 at a rollicking Jordan-Hare Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a step back for LSU (2-1, 0-1), which outscored
nonconference opponents 86-13 in its first two games and was
looking for a sign it can once again compete in the SEC. LSU has
won only three league games in two years.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for years to find a consistent rushing threat,
Auburn has relied this year on the running of Rudi Johnson, who
gained 339 yards and scored five touchdowns in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gained 139 yards on 36 carries, making him the first
Auburn back to run for more than 100 yards in three straight games
since Stephen Davis did it in 1994. Johnson scored on a 2-yard run
with three seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Leard's arm and Carter's speed made the difference against LSU,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Standing deep in the pocket with little pressure, Leard threaded
the defense for touchdown passes of 20 yards to Robert Johnson and
19 yards to Clifton Robinson. Leard went 21-of-30 for 225 yards
with no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carter's return that knocked the wind out of LSU for
good.
</P>
<P>
   After LSU pulled within 20-17 on a 45-yard pass from Josh Booty
to Josh Reed, Carter took the kickoff at the goal line and cut
right. He raced the length of the field and was still pulling away
when he crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Booty, under heavy pressure most of the game, got LSU on the
board first with a 75-yard touchdown pass to Reed. Booty, who led
the SEC in passing efficiency headed into the game, completed only
13 of 29 attempts for 214 yards with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   John Corbello had a 22-yard field goal for LSU, but he missed on
a 51-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Damon Duval added field goals of 42 and 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On his 45-yard touchdown, LSU's Reed beat Travaris Robinson, a
sophomore in at cornerback after senior Larry Casher suffered a
neck injury while making a tackle one play earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Casher was strapped to a back board and taken off the field in
an ambulance as a precaution. School officials said the injury --
which delayed the game about 10 minutes -- did not appear serious.

<HEADLINE> Men's Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The pile of bodies at midcourt looked
like the end of an NCAA tournament first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday (Saturday night EDT), players from Italy, not
Valparaiso, were jumping on each other, and it was the Olympics,
not March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Meneghin's 3-pointer with 25 seconds to play -- his only
points of the game -- gave Italy a 50-48 victory over Lithuania. The
celebration that followed capped a tense, possession-by-possession
game between the teams most consider the second and third best in
Group A behind the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first game is always the most important. That's why we're
so happy,'' said Italy's Carlton Myers, who had nine points in a
foul-plagued 22 minutes. ''It was very tense, close and ugly, but
at the end we won it and that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Meneghin, the son of Dino Meneghin who is considered the
greatest player in Italy's history and is an assistant coach, had
missed all six shots he had taken, including two 3-pointers in the
previous 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But he made the one that counted and when Lithuania misfired on
two 3-point shots in the final 12 seconds, Italy won its first
Olympic game since 1984 when Dino Meneghin was the star of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came down to one shot and they made it and we didn't,''
said Lithuania's Mindaugas Timinskas, who played at Iona College.
</P>
<P>
   Timinskas' driving layup with 41 seconds left gave Lithuania a
48-47 lead and were his only points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe we scored 50 points. There were no easy
baskets,'' Italy coach Bogdan Tanjevic said. ''I didn't think we
played that well but we were fortunate and it was a game of good
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy finished with better shooting percentage, 32.6
(15-for-46), as Lithuania managed a 13-for-50 effort (26 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ''The shooting hurt us but maybe it was also the Italian
defense,'' Lithuania coach Jonas Kazlauskas said.
</P>
<P>
France 76, New Zealand 50
</P>
<P>
   France, making its first appearance in men's Olympic basketball
since 1984, used its speed advantage to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Yann Bonato and Cyril Julian each had had eight points in a 26-4
run that gave France a 35-19 lead with 2:32 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   France held New Zealand to one field goal over that stretch as
it overcame a six-point deficit and went on to a 38-23 lead. France
then scored the first nine points of the second half and the rout
was on.
</P>
<P>
   Bonato finished with 16 points for France, which hadn't been in
the basketball competition for 24 years before competing in Los
Angeles and finishing 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks, who played at the University of California and for
the NBA's Toronto Raptors, had 12 points to lead New Zealand, which
was making its first appearance in the basketball competition.

<HEADLINE> Theft suspect accidentally shot by trooper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, N.Y. (AP) - A 21-year-old man suspected of stealing a
car ended up with a bullet in the buttocks when a state trooper's
gun accidentally went off, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a report by a woman who heard someone steal her car
out of her driveway about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, a state trooper saw
the car at a nearby intersection. As the trooper approached the car
on foot, the driver put the car in motion, hitting the trooper and
knocking him off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the trooper's gun accidentally went off, the bullet
passing through the door of the car and hitting Phillip K. Boyce.
Boyce drove about a mile before crashing the car. He was stuck in
the car and had to rescued by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Albany Medical Center where he remained Saturday
night in police custody, charged with felony counts of assault,
reckless endangerment and possession of stolen property and a
misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the shooting is continuing. The trooper
was not identified.

	   STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) - Five members of a Yadkin County family
were killed in the fiery collision along Interstate 77 in Iredell
County caused by an inattentive driver, the Highway Patrol said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were riding in a 1989 Dodge minivan that was hit in
the rear Friday afternoon by a tractor trailer, setting off a chain
of collisions that involved three other cars, said Trooper Todd
Keller.
</P>
<P>
   No charges had been filed yet, but Keller said he planned to
talk to prosecutors Monday and expected there to be charges in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Victims were identified as the driver, Mickey Dean Blackburn,
47, of Boonville in Yadkin County. Passengers in the van were his
wife, Christine Kimmer Blackburn, 38, and their children: Mikki
Blackburn, 2; Bobbi Kimmer, 4, and Destiny Kimmer, 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just so sad, to take five people out of my family,'' Fay
Kimmer, the mother of Christine Blackburn, said Saturday. ''I
definitely I want to know that it was quick, that there was no
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Rick Barrett of the Highway Patrol said the cause of the
accident, which occurred where the interstate narrowed from two
lanes to one, appeared to be inattention by the truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just came up on that traffic and wasn't paying attention
and ran right over them,'' Barrett said. ''We have no indication of
mechanical trouble or that the driver was impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said speed didn't appear to be a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   Truck driver William Robin Townsend, 41, of Hudson, was treated
for minor injuries and released. He was driving an empty truck for
Merchants Distributors of Hickory, Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of a New Jersey family, who were in the second
car, were taken to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Woodward, 68, of Randolph, N.J., was in serious condition
Saturday night in the burn unit of Baptist Medical Center in
Winston-Salem Baptist. His daughter, Lee Ann Standridge, 21, was
treated and released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Woodward, Edward Woodward's wife and the driver of the
car, was treated and released from Iredell Memorial Hospital in
Statesville.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened about five miles north of Statesville
about 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened near a construction zone, but that the
cars and tractor-trailer had not yet reached it.
</P>
<P>
   The burning mini-van was lodged underneath the tractor-trailer,
witnesses said.
