HOW GOLFER SE RI-PAK BECAME A SUPERSTAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In South Korea, golf is a game primarily for the wealthy, with
annual membership in country clubs costing $200,000 to $1 million.
Se Ri-pak's family was not on that level. Her background was
considered middle class, and her father had a reputation of being
in the Korean underworld.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a sophomore in high school in Taejon, Pak played in
the Golf Digest Cup tournament. On the first day of the tournament,
her father, Joon Chul-pak, saw several parents of young golfers
talking. He approached them to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``They completely ignored me,'' he said recently. ``I guess my
daughter and myself didn't seem like much to them, because of their
high social status. So I called Se Ri in front of the trophy and
handed it to her, saying, `This is yours.' The others looked at me
as if I was some crazed lunatic. So I screamed back: `So what if I
touch it! My Se Ri is going to take it home with her anyways!' Se
Ri nodded in agreement. Later, she did take the trophy back home
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   That trophy, to be sure, was not the only one Se Ri-pak would
win. She dominated the amateur and the professional ranks in South
Korea, and this year, as a 20-year-old rookie on the Ladies
Professional Golf Association Tour, she has demonstrated precisely
what her father envisioned for her when she first picked up a club
at age 11: that she would be a star on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   But even he could not know the full measure of what she would
accomplish so soon. On Sunday, she won the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic
in Ohio, her fourth victory of the season and third in the last
four weeks, giving her a tour-best $768,211 in earnings. Two of the
victories came in major championships, the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in May and the U.S. Women's Open this month. She is
the youngest Women's Open champion ever and the youngest player to
win two women's majors in a season.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jamie Farr Classic in Ohio this month, she wreaked havoc
on the record book: a four-round total of 261 that was four strokes
lower than the record for an LPGA event, a 23-under-par total that
tied another tour record and a second-round score of 61 that was
the lowest in LPGA history. Through it all, she has seemed immune
to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who will try to win a third major in the Du Maurier
Classic, beginning Thursday in Windsor, Ontario, has made an impact
in golf on a level of Tiger Woods' phenomenal rookie splash last
year, and her debut has been compared to that of Nancy Lopez. As
the latest of the sudden stars who have captured golf's spotlight,
winning with attitude and the fearlessness of youth, she joins the
likes of Woods, Ernie Els and Justin Leonard, and this year's
upstart amateurs, Matt Kuchar of the United States and Justin Rose
of England. And like Woods, who is of Thai descent, Pak has
energized an already fervent Asian market in a sport that is
rapidly globalizing.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, Se Ri (pronounced suh-REE) credits the father who
grabbed that trophy back in Yeo Ju City and willed her to win it.
And while there is a strong patriarchal quality to family life in
South Korea, the relationship between this father and daughter
seems to have gone beyond even the aggressiveness of the
conventional, and notorious, Hollywood stage mother.
</P>
<P>
   Joon Chul-pak often scolded his daughter so severely for not
following his golf instructions from the time she was a
pre-teen-ager that he sometimes reduced her to tears. Every day
that she was not in school, he said, from early in the morning into
the evening, regardless of whether there was a heat wave or
freezing cold, he worked with her at the one golf course in Taejon.
Sometimes, in the cold, icicles would form in her hair while she
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the golf course, the father occasionally camped out in
a tent with her in a cemetery, then left her alone in the dark to
develop, he said, ``her bravery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he told the trembling girl, ``I will not let
the ghosts get you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the neighborhood, at the golf course, said I was
crazy, that I was insane,'' Joon Chul-pak recalled. ``My wife was
worried that I would kill Se Ri. And for what _ a game that was not
so popular in Korea? But I was very straight, very stern with Se Ri
about her golf because I believed she had the talent, the patience
to one day be a great player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the glow of her success, the relationship between
father and daughter has softened _ at dinner, she will push a plate
of vegetables toward him, and he will smile and say, ``She takes
care of me now.'' But her discipline and hard work remain. ``I had
good mental training,'' she said. ``I think the way my father
taught me: `Attack the course.'''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing anywhere from 11th to missing the cut in her
first nine events this season, Pak burst onto the women's golf
scene by winning the LPGA Championship in mid-May. Her reign at the
top has provided considerable drama, including a classic duel with
the amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in the Open, which Pak won in a
20-hole playoff; her record performance at the Jamie Farr, and a
birdie putt on the final hole to win last Sunday in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon, a former U.S. Women's Open winner herself, was
paired with Pak for that stunning round of 61 at the Jamie Farr
Classic. ``I had a chance to observe her closely,'' Mallon said.
``I felt like she plays just one shot at a time. She never gets
ahead of herself. Each shot is like the only shot of the day for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon laughed. ``But my favorite quote of Se Ri's is, `I have
no nervous.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, like her father, is solidly built at 130 pounds, with
muscular legs. (She was a sprinter and hurdler in high school.) At
5 feet 6 inches, she is about his height, and her hands appear as
strong as his.
</P>
<P>
   Both believe that he knows her game so well, the rhythms of her
swing so clearly, that after several practice swings he will tell
her, ``That's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``I will tell her in midswing, and she
will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the cemetery tactic was ``my creation,'' and several
times a year for several years he would take her there at night.
When she was about 16, he said, she said to him one night, ``I'm
warm here,'' meaning she was comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I knew her heart was strong,'' he said. ``We never
went back to the cemetery.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pak's confidence and self-possession are so strong that recently
she politely but firmly turned down an invitation from the
president of Korea, Kim Young-sam, to return there to be honored in
a parade and receive the Blue Dragon, the nation's highest medal of
achievement for sports. She wrote him that she is committed to
playing golf for the rest of the season but would be delighted to
return for any presentations later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Korea,'' said Steve Sung Yong-kil, her business manager,
``she is a great sports hero.'' The only other internationally
prominent South Korean athlete at this time is Chan Ho-park,
pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``But,'' Kil said, ``Se Ri is
like Michael Jordan there. Park is like, well, Scottie Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Pak's achievements receive huge coverage in the South
Korean news media, and her image can be found on television and in
advertisements. Her playoff victory in the Open was televised live
in South Korea, at 1 a.m. there, and was watched by millions. At
the recent JAL Big Apple Classic in New Rochelle, N.Y., there were
so many fans of Asian background in her gallery that signs were
posted in Korean requesting a common courtesy: Please don't move
before players hit shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pak does not seem overwhelmed by the attention she has received.
``I like it,'' she said. ``It means I'm playing good. If I not play
good, nobody want to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Joon Chul-pak was so driven by the notion of his daughter's
becoming a champion that he made a bet with his life, he said, and
his daughter's. He would devote his time and energy and money _
costs for fees and travel would come to thousands of dollars a year
_ to her golf future. He placed his construction business in Taejon
_ about 100 miles south of Seoul _ in the hands of his wife, Jeong
Suk-kim, but she was inexperienced in that area, and the business
declined. Yet Joon Chul did not change course.
</P>
<P>
   He also did something else for his daughter _ and his family. He
quit being, as he said, a gangster.
</P>
<P>
   The Shisa Journal, a South Korean weekly, reported on July 23
that Joon Chul-pak, ``who was a member of the underworld in Taejon
City, fled to Hawaii in 1988 ... when the police began clamping
down on organized crime there.'' Joon Chul confirmed this. ``To be
honest,'' he said, ``I was a thug in the past. I lived a tough
life.'' He displayed long scars on his stomach and thigh that he
said came from stabbing wounds.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to South Korea by himself after four months, and his
family followed soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Joon Chul-pak had been a good-enough amateur golfer to represent
his city in South Korean national tournaments, and one day he was
in a park in Hawaii practicing his chip shots. Se Ri, then 11, had
tagged along. She asked to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than 30 minutes,'' he recalled, ``she was gripping the
club perfectly and hitting surprisingly good shots.'' He decided
that she was a natural. She just thought it was fun. Soon, though,
the father had made a business out of it for her.
</P>
<P>
   She bridled. She wanted to play with friends. He said he was her
friend. She kept at the game, getting better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he would say: `Keep pushing. Why you cannot do like
this? I teach you like this,''' Se Ri recalled. ``I was really
upset many times because I just wanted my dad to give me more rest,
but he didn't do that. It made me strong. Many, many times I cried.
But then I thought to myself: `Show your dad you can do it. You can
do anything if you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were times in her late teens, recalled her mother, when Se
Ri had hit a bad shot in a tournament and she stayed hitting that
shot for hours afterward. ``We would call her, `It's midnight; it's
time to come in,''' her mother said. ``And Se Ri would call back,
`Just five more minutes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri said: ``I had respect for my father, and I stayed with
golf in the beginning because I wanted to prove to people that he
wasn't crazy for what he was doing with me. He was pushing me,
pushing me to be better. I knew that. I wanted to make him and my
mother proud. And then I began to love golf.''
</P>
<P>
   When Se Ri began showing real talent, Joon Chul joined a country
club with a $200,000-a-year membership fee. But after a year, Joon
Chul could no longer afford the fee, and of the 86 18-hole golf
courses in South Korea, only one on the mainland is public. So, to
give his daughter the competition and instruction he felt she
needed, he began to travel with her to national tournaments around
South Korea and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri demonstrated remarkable skill _ a satiny smooth but potent
swing, a singularly consistent putter _ and won 30 tournaments in
South Korea before turning pro in 1996 and winning six of 14 events
there, and finishing second seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Joon Chul understood that while he knew something about golf, he
did not know everything. So last year he sent Se Ri to live in
Orlando, Fla., by herself to train under David Leadbetter, the
noted instructor who had worked with Nick Faldo and Greg Norman,
among others. Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate that signed Se
Ri in 1996, paid Leadbetter's salary.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to improve, and last fall she tied for first at
qualifying school for the LPGA Tour in her first attempt.
</P>
<P>
   She has learned English well enough to comprehend and converse.
Her father, in his limited time in America, has picked up a few
catch phrases. He used one recently when his daughter left the
restaurant earlier than the others in order to get her rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it easy,'' he said to her. He smiled. She smiled. She
pursed her lips. It was just that mixture of ease and intensity
that has helped catapult Se Ri-pak to the top of the golf world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, each generation grows into the news its elders could
not quite impart. But war is news that lies hidden even within the
generation that experiences it. Men who have survived combat find
that what they knew in that irretrievable now is something they
will always know. But they can barely tell each other what it was.
If nothing else, their silence is a kind of respect for the dead,
whose understanding _ though it is a metaphor to call it that _
surpasses explanation.
</P>
<P>
   So it falls to the generations that did not experience war to
come at the truth of it somehow, not only in order to understand
their elders but to protect themselves as well. We will know how
close we get by how shattering the attempt feels.
</P>
<P>
   Every boy or girl who leafs through the history books looking
for pictures of war dead is trying to look at death itself _ always
a kind of missing information _ and, more importantly, at the
happening of death, the moment portrayed when, for instance,
Praskukhin dies, killed by shrapnel in the second of Tolstoy's
``Sebastopol Sketches.'' By profound instinct we cannot help
gracing the act of dying with ceremony, whether, as in Tolstoy's
case, it resembles a procession of mourners leaving a cathedral or
whether, as in Pat Barker's ``The Ghost Road,'' it merely ends
awareness. But something is denied, and with difficulty reaffirmed,
when death erupts everywhere, at once, with profligate disrespect
for instinct or cause or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   That is how it is portrayed in Steven Spielberg's new movie,
``Saving Private Ryan.'' There is every reason to believe that this
is as close as one generation can come to an artistic knowledge of
war elicited from the firsthand experience of its elders. Certainly
no one has ever come closer, cinematically. Spielberg depicts in
battle here not only the knowledge that results from war, but what
has been, and remains, the inexplicable knowledge _ pure trauma in
which consciousness itself is all the narrative there can ever be.
</P>
<P>
   Art elicits faith and distrust. Faith, in watching ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' is measured by the extent of one's personal horror.
Distrust _ call it an awareness of artistic conventions _ is
measured by the realization that there was, for tens of thousands
of men 54 years ago, a place and time where art's ultimate
usefulness _ the ability to shape experience _ was utterly lacking.

SCHIZOPHRENIC INDICTED IN FIANCEE'S DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A Yale Law School graduate whose struggle
to overcome schizophrenia gained him national attention was
indicted Monday by the Westchester County district attorney's
office in connection with the stabbing death of his pregnant
fiancee in June in their apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The four-count indictment charges Michael Laudor, 35, with two
counts of second-degree murder and two counts of weapons possession
in the death of Caroline Carriel Costello, 37. If convicted, Laudor
could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. His lawyer,
Andrew Rubin, said he would probably argue that his client was not
responsible because of mental impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor has been held without bail at Westchester County Jail in
Valhalla. Rubin said that two court-appointed psychiatrists had
found Laudor unfit to proceed with a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor is to be arraigned here Friday before County Court Judge
Kenneth Lange.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   Awash with money from Congress for covertly promoting Iraqi
opposition to Saddam Hussein, the Clinton administration is once
again dreaming about engineering his ouster. The only problem is
that no one in Washington has figured out how to do so. Instead the
administration is preparing to renew its courtship with Massoud
Barzani, a Kurdish factional leader who betrayed Washington and
other opposition groups by forming a temporary military alliance
with Bagdad in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There are no magic strategies for managing Saddam, parrying his
threats against neighboring countries and blocking his efforts to
develop mass-destruction weapons. That will take patient diplomatic
containment and occasional shows of U.S. military force. Washington
should also overtly encourage credible opposition forces that could
one day rescue Iraq from the international isolation, internal
terror and blighted development hopes of the Saddam Hussein era.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of covert operations is that they are relatively
cheap, do not require U.S. troops and can proceed without
Washington's skeptical gulf war allies. In recent months, Congress
has pressed the administration to step up covert activity against
Baghdad. But Iraq's opposition groups are even more divided and
discredited now than in 1996, when Barzani invited Iraqi troops
into the Kurdish region to thwart a rival leader, Jalal Talibani.
The soldiers smashed the CIA's operations center and executed
opposition activists. Yet for want of a better alternative,
Washington has invited Barzani, along with Talibani, to new
planning talks.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious internal opposition to Saddam comes from
Iranian-backed Shiite groups in southern Iraq, from which the
United States keeps a healthy distance. The Iraqi National
Congress, which Washington once hoped would create a broad-based
opposition, has little remaining support. Iraqi military officers,
meanwhile, are understandably reluctant to plot against Saddam
without clearer promise of U.S. military backing than Washington is
prepared to offer. The United States should learn from past
mistakes and steer clear of covert operations in Iraq. &QL;

MOSLEY, DEFEATING UKRAINIAN, SHOWS HIS BOXING POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ga., Texas)   (bl)  
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 18, Larry Mosley Jr. is being billed as the next
hope for the beleaguered U.S. boxing program. Monday night in the
first round at the Goodwill Games, Mosley showed glimmers of that
promise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mosley scored mostly on counter-punches to defeat Sergei
Dzinziruk of Ukraine by 6-3 in a 147-pound bout at the Theater in
Madison Square Garden. The Los Angeles-based welterweight gave
himself a ``7 or 8'' out of 10 for his performance in a competition
that is by far his most significant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him an 8,'' said his coach, Kenny Croom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough for American boxing, which is still
reeling from winning just one gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and
no medals at all at the 1997 world championships. Mosley was not at
either, but the whispers were already beginning that he could
reverse the trend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't try to put that much pressure on me,'' said Mosley,
the cousin of Shane Mosley, the World Boxing Association
lightweight champion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, a 5-foot-7-inch right-hander, entered the arena with his
usual bravado, beating his chest and winding up his right hand as
he circled the ring. But he was tentative against a seasoned
opponent. The 23-year-old Dzinziruk, a 6-0 left-hander, was a 1996
Olympian and finished second in the world championships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was off-balanced a little bit and I was trying to maintain
my composure,'' Mosley said. He took control in the second round,
sneaking in a right to the chin for a point and then countering
Dzinziruk's jab with another right. Mosley began to move with more
fluidity and throw more punches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mosley absorbed a scoring left in the third round, then
increased his lead to 4-1 with another right counter off
Dzinziruk's left jab and a lunging right that caught Dzinziruk by
surprise. The round ended with Mosley grimacing from a low blow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mosley began to trade punches out of anger, and Dzinkziruk
tagged him with a left. Mosley settled back into his style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mosley surrendered 2 points in close quarters in the fourth and
fifth rounds, but he retaliated with a right-left combination and a
long right that smashed against Dzinkziruk's cheek. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a learning experience,'' Mosley said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 201-pound division, DaVarryl Williamson of Aurora, Colo.,
unleashed a right that dropped Giocachino Mocerino of Italy to his
knees in the first round, stopping the bout. ``I wanted to get the
jitterbugs out,'' Williamson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans advancing into the semifinals were Jose Navarro
(106 pounds) of Los Angeles, Antonio Rodriguez (119) of Waianae,
Hawaii, Jacob Hudson (132) of Augusta, Ga., Miguel Espino (147) of
North Hollywood, Calif., and Jose Santa Cruz (119) of Monterey
Park, Calif., and Malcolm Tann (201) of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban heavyweight Felix Savon, the 1992 and 96 Olympic champion,
stopped Dmitri Gerasimov.

LURE OF HIGH SPEEDS MAKES RACES A THREAT TO FANS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ind., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Experiencing the speed of race cars up close is, without a
doubt, what attracts fans to the track. But that is just the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's accident at Michigan Speedway, where three fans were
killed and six others were injured by flying debris from a car, was
another reminder of the danger that auto racing poses to fans.
Although the accident at Championship Auto Racing Teams' most
prestigious race, the U.S. 500, marked the first time in 11 years
that spectators were killed at a major auto race in the United
States, the possibility of fans being killed or injured always
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot guarantee that things like this won't happen,'' said
Fred Nation, the publicity director for the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway, which will be host to the Brickyard 400 NASCAR race
Saturday. ``There is an element of risk for spectators, as there is
risk in anything we do. I think fans know the risks. Whenever you
have a car going 220 miles per hour, there is the potential for a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Races held by CART and its rival open-wheel circuit, the Indy
Racing League, routinely see speeds of 230 mph in the
straightaways, although Indy Racing League cars are less powerful
by design and therefore run slower average speeds. Formula One, the
open-wheel circuit based in Europe, uses road courses, which has
two effects: speeds are slower and fans are seated farther from the
track. NASCAR racers can reach 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The danger to fans, it seems, increases as the speed of the cars
on the track increases. The last two spectator fatalities have
occurred on superspeedways, oval tracks that are more than a mile
in circumference (Michigan Speedway, in Brooklyn, is a two-mile
oval) and where speeds get higher because of the longer
straightaways and banked turns.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, both NASCAR and CART have taken measures to slow cars
down on superspeedways in an attempt to protect drivers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   An accident involving the driver Bobby Allison in 1987, in which
his car flew into the catch fence at Talladega, Ala., and nearly
through it, inspired NASCAR to require the use of restrictor
plates, which cut down the flow of air into the carburetor. NASCAR
has also employed roof flaps, aerodynamic devices that help
stabilize a car when it is in danger of losing contact with the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   CART introduced a new aerodynamic wing, designed to slow its
cars, in Sunday's race. Called the Handford device, it is a small
extension on the rear wing, which reduces speeds by as much as 15
mph on superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   The debris Sunday came off the car driven by Adrian Fernandez.
After he lost control of his car, it hit the concrete retaining
wall, and a wheel and several pieces of the suspension flew into
the grandstand. The parts, which were heavy and traveling fast,
landed on top of spectators sitting in the eighth and 10th rows.
The victims did not have time to move out of the way, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   CART officials did not comment Monday. pending further
investigation of the incident. But at a news conference Monday at
Michigan Speedway, Gene Haskett, the track's president, said that
extending the 15-foot catch fence by several feet was very likely.
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has a 19-foot fence.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when debris from a race car becomes airborne, the parts
are kept on the track by the retaining wall or fence, which is
angled on the top toward the track. Sunday, the wheel did not hit
any part of the 15-foot fence on its way into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the percentages,'' said Kevin Triplett,
the director of operations at NASCAR. ``What happened yesterday,
while it was a tragic situation, it is rare. When you look at the
number of laps run at Michigan since 1969, it's easy to see that
this is not a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the injured spectators, Doris Shuman, 70, remained
hospitalized Monday. She was in good condition. &QL;

TRAGICALLY HIP: OF CANADA, IN SLOW MOTION BUT NOT ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just how Canadian is the Tragically Hip? Well, the
band started its set Thursday night at Wetlands with ``Fireworks,''
in which the singer is astonished to meet a girl who couldn't care
less about hockey. ``I never saw someone say that before,'' he
marvels.
</P>
<P>
   The Tragically Hip fills arenas in Canada and Detroit but is
still on the club circuit in most of the United States. Its
five-night stand at Wetlands, which ended Saturday, sold out
completely, with a prominent Canadian contingent in the audience
chanting ``Hip! Hip!''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1986, the Tragically Hip harks back to 1960s rock,
building songs on guitar riffs that look back to the Rolling
Stones, the Byrds, Neil Young and the blues. The lyrics are about
endless varieties of disillusionment, with titles like ``The
Inevitability of Death'' and ``Chagrin Falls.'' Gordon Downie, the
band's lead singer, sounds frustrated but dogged, an Everyman whose
consolation, as he sang in ``Springtime in Vienna,'' is that ``We
live to survive our paradoxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Having outlasted grunge and other alternative-rock vogues, the
Tragically Hip could find a place alongside jam bands and
neo-folk-rock bands if a broader audience could get used to
Downie's lead vocals, delivered in an earnest, quavering tenor
voice that teeters between Michael Stipe and Harry Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   And the band's guitar riffs are both its strength and its
limitation. Many of its songs go no further than their riffs; the
band settles too often for one-note tunes, and it has to push
itself to write full-fledged melodies. But onstage, the riffs
foment jams that are as determined and resilient as the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   In a set that concentrated on the band's current album,
``Phantom Power'' (Sire) and its previous studio album, ``Trouble
at the Henhouse'' (Atlantic), the songs worked their way from
frustration to triumph, with brash guitars to clear away any
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, a Canadian songwriter who opened the show, plays
slow-motion music that is not exactly lackadaisical. In one song,
he sang about trying to get off a couch where he'd been inert for
four days; in another, he sat on a resort beach watching a girl
getting seduced. His songs are laconic, usually placing a verse or
two between a measured introduction and a long instrumental coda by
his band, and he sang in a scratchy, lethargic voice until his last
song, when he worked himself up to a grunge growl.
</P>
<P>
   But like one of his obvious models, Dinosaur Jr., he puts
melodies and character into his somnambulistic repertory. He just
demands that listeners adjust to his sense of time.

Spectators' deaths bring safety concerns
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grand Prix of Houston will exceed precautionary standards
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The tragic death of three spectators during the U.S. 500 CART event
Sunday at Michigan Speedway left the entire racing community
stunned and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Houston will be the site of a new CART event Oct. 4,
and officials want the fans to know that the chances of a similar
occurrence at the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston are extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday's tragedy was only the second time in CART history this
has happened,'' said Dick Stahler, marketing director of the
Houston race. ``But it never has happened at a street race.''
</P>
<P>
   Three people in the grandstand were killed at Michigan on Sunday
when the car of driver Adrian Fernandez slammed into the outside
wall of the fourth turn, snapping off the right front wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel and tire, which weigh more than 40 pounds, flew into
the air and barely cleared the 11-foot debris fencing, which is on
top of the four-foot concrete barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel was airborne _ flying parallel to the track _ for more
than 100 feet before it landed about 10 rows up in the stands,
instantly killing two people. It then bounced and struck another
spectator, who also died. Six other people were injured as the
wheel ricocheted through the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 11 years that any non-race official had
been killed at a major racing event.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Kurtenbach, 41, was killed at the Indianapolis 500 in 1987
when he was struck by a tire that flew into the stands after a
crash involving the cars of Tony Bettenhausen and Roberto Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtenbach's widow filed a $9 million wrongful-death lawsuit
against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which was settled out of
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those incidents were at superspeedway ovals where the
cars reach speeds in excess of 200 mph, including the turns,''
Stahler said. ``The cars in Houston will be making turns at less
than 100 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though no spectator death ever has occurred at a street
race, TGPH officials have gone beyond the standard safety
requirements that CART uses for a street or road course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using eight-foot debris fencing, which has never been
done before at a street race,'' Stahler said. ``These races usually
have six-foot debris fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost us an additional $500,000 over our budget to do it,
but we want everything in Houston to be state-of-the-art in safety.
It will be the highest and strongest fence (with reinforced steel)
ever constructed for a street race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston race will have more than 40,000 seats in temporary
grandstands that will be set up along the 1.68-mile course, which
has 10 turns.
</P>
<P>
   The start-finish line will run in front of the George R. Brown
Convention Center, and the fastest part of the course will be a
seven-block backstretch on Austin Street at the eastern edge of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The Champ cars are expected to reach speeds of 180 mph on the
Austin straightaway, but the drivers will need to slow to a crawl
on some of the turns, which are at a 90-degree angles or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the layout, many of the seats are near a
braking zone,'' Stahler said. ``It's not comparable to an oval
track where the cars are coming out of a turn at 220 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been rare incidents in which fatalities happened
at street courses.
</P>
<P>
   At the Molson Indy Toronto Grand Prix two years ago _ a race
similar to the one that will be run in Houston _ CART flagman Gary
Avrin was killed when he was struck by the crashing car of driver
Jeff Krosnoff, who also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Avrin was standing in a spot next to the course where a paying
customer would not be allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   One spectator was killed at Michigan in 1969 in a Trans Am road
race on the speedway infield when a car went out of control and
veered off the asphalt, striking several people who were standing
in the infield grass. The infield road course has not been used
since that accident.
</P>
<P>
   Even on high-speed ovals like Michigan, a fatality among
spectators is less likely than being struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first time in the 31-year history of the speedway
that a death was caused by flying debris in the grandstand. But
that is little consolation to the families and friends of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dawson, 31, was treated for minor arm lacerations, but his
friend Kenneth Fox, 38, was killed in the seat next to Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is devastated by this,'' said Nancy Dawson, Steve's
mother. ``He told me he saw the tire coming and had just enough
time to turn away, but it hit his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller, 40, who came to the race from South Bend, Ind., was
sitting one row behind the other two people who were killed _
Sheryl Laster, 40, and Michael Tautkus, 49, both of Milan, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tire had to be coming at us at 200 mph,'' Miller said.
``It makes you realize this is an inherently dangerous sport and
you take certain risks when you come to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Thompson, who works as a nurse at the Jackson, Mich.,
hospital where the victims were treated, attended the race and
suffered a minor leg injury when the tire bounced in front of her
and her husband, David Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were watching the race, but the next thing I knew, a black
blur hit two rows in front of me, then hit my leg,'' Joyce Thompson
said. ``It was like a bomb going off. People were lying around with
blood everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Bramer, 31, and his brother Richard Bramer, 20, also
suffered minor arm injuries when hit by the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it was coming,'' Gerald Bramer said. ``I
was looking at it thinking, `Why is this tire coming at me?' The
only thing I could do was throw my arms up to protect myself and
keep it from hitting me in the head. I've never seen anything
coming at me that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Haskett, the president of the Michigan Speedway, said track
officials will conduct an exhaustive investigation to determine
exactly what happened Sunday and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will evaluate every aspect of the accident,'' Haskett said.
``We want to know if anything can be done to prevent this in the
future. It's very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The next major race at Michigan is less than three weeks away.
The NASCAR Winston Cup series will make its second stop of the
season at Michigan for the DeVilbiss 400 on Aug. 16.

BASEBALL COLUMN: THE METS SAVE WORST FOR NL LEAST TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people in baseball have this misguided notion
about how some teams should beat other teams. A contending team,
for example, should beat expansion teams, they believe. But the
idea must be misguided because Bobby Valentine thinks it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the thought that we're supposed to beat another major
league team because of something in the standings,'' the Mets'
manager said one day last month.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking after the New York Mets lost to the Florida
Marlins, after it was suggested that the Mets were supposed to beat
teams like the Marlins, that indeed if the Mets wanted to contend
seriously for the wild-card spot they had to win those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a New York mentality that gets people in a rut,''
Valentine said. ``And I'm sorry that my team believes it when they
hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Marlins, he added: ``They're a major league
team, one that's playing pretty good out there, and so is Montreal.
To think we should just beat them because they don't have a good
record or because they have younger players is appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the situation, however, says teams that seek
division championships or wild-card spots should beat up on certain
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   En route to some of the best seasons in history, the 1927
Yankees (.714) won 21 of 22 games from the St. Louis Browns (.386),
the 1939 Yankees (.702) wiped out the Browns (.279) 19 games to 3,
the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates (.724) annihilated the Boston Braves
(.294) 20 of 21 times, the St. Louis Cardinals (.355) 18 of 21 and
the Brooklyn Dodgers (.359) 18 of 22.
</P>
<P>
   In this new era of wild-card playoff spots, each league has
become basically divided into four segments: the division leaders
and their serious challengers, the wild-card contenders, teams that
can be competitive but fall too far back to be in playoff
contention and the weakest teams, those least likely to win any
given series unless it is against another team in their group.
</P>
<P>
   With this category open to some challenge, the members of the
National League Least this season have been the expansion Arizona
Diamondbacks, the dismantled Florida Marlins, the low-paid Montreal
Expos and two teams that have their moments but never had a chance
once the season began, the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   In April and May the Mets compiled a respectable 13-5 record
against the Marlins, the Pirates, the Reds and the Diamondbacks.
But in June and July the Mets stumbled badly against the NL Least,
winning 7 and losing 12 against the Marlins, the Pirates and the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   That was no way, despite Valentine's view, to challenge for the
wild-card lead. By losing to those inferior teams, the Mets gave
themselves no cushion for their games against tougher opponents;
Atlanta, for one.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost all three games of a three-game series in Atlanta
early this month, then dropped the first two games of a four-game
series at Shea Stadium against the Expos. Last month the Mets took
two of three interleague games from Boston but could not capitalize
on 13 consecutive games against expansion Tampa Bay (of the
American League Least), the Marlins and the Expos. They won 6, lost
7.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is right about one aspect of games against the weaker
teams: nothing is automatic. That's why they play the games. But
that does not mean the contending teams should not expect and be
expected to win the bulk of those games.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets were struggling to a 7-12 record against the NL
Least in June and July, the Chicago Cubs amassed 13 victories in 17
games with the Marlins, the Pirates, the Diamondbacks and the
Expos. That's a seven-game difference in the standing between two
wild-card rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse the records against the NL Least _ make the Mets 12-7,
the Cubs 4-13 _ and the wild-card standing would look drastically
different today. It would be the Mets ahead of the Cubs by a
whopping 10{ games instead of trailing the Cubs by 3{.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Mets' part of the wild-card equation were reversed,
if the Mets had won 12 of those 19 June-July games, they would lead
the Cubs by a game and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants are half a game ahead of the Mets in
the race for the fourth spot in the NL playoffs. They have
benefited from games against the NL Least, winning 22 of 30.
Philadelphia is in the wild-card race with the help of 11 victories
in their last 12 games against the NL Least.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Mets lost two games to the Braves and
evenly split four-game series with the Phillies and the Cubs. The
outcome of none of those series was surprising. The Mets are not
good enough to dominate any of those teams. But that reality makes
it all the more imperative for them to dominate the teams they
should beat, Valentine's view notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have only 14 games remaining with teams in the NL Least
so they basically have squandered their best chance to gain ground
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will have to win it the old-fashioned way. They will
have to earn it by beating good or, at least, competitive teams. &QL;

DODGERS HOPE FOR WILD FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 CUBS VICTORY TONIGHT-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It will be hot and sticky tonight on the floor of
Veterans Stadium, but the Dodgers better get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   With two months remaining in the 1998 season, the Dodgers are a
part of the heated National League wild-card race at 5{ games
behind the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   And with four days to baseball's trading deadline, it also could
mean a deal for a starting pitcher to replace Ismael Valdes. The
right-hander will miss two starts with a strained left side.
</P>
<P>
   From the less-than-overwhelming crowds during the past two home
stands, it appears fans have not bought into the concept of the
wild card, which rewards the team with the fourth-best record to
qualify for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But it means so much to the Dodgers that new general manager Tom
Lasorda was boasting at the Hall of Fame weekend in Cooperstown
that his club will be playing in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee we're going to make the playoffs,'' Lasorda said.
``I told our players that, and I believe it. I told them we would
catch the Giants, and we have. Now we're going to catch the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's future as general manager probably depends on that,
which is why he will be busy working the phones this week.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Dodgers to overtake the division-leading San
Diego Padres, who lead them by 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, the new ownership, has not been as quick as Lasorda to
guarantee that anyone in the front office will be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers haven't exactly caught the Giants, who fell out
of the top spot after a 1-8 road trip to start the second half. The
Giants trail Chicago by 3{ games and are a half-game ahead of the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are entering a critical stretch. The first seven
games on this road trip are against the Phillies and Mets, two
teams ahead of the Dodgers for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Races, even wild-card races, rarely are won in head-to-head
matchups, making the nine games that follow so important.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers close the trip with three games in Montreal, where
they traditionally do not play well. Then they come home for six
games against lowly Pittsburgh and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't taken off yet,'' center fielder Raul Mondesi
said. ``Looks like now is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers have won nine of their past 14, they still
have not won four in a row this season. They dropped two of seven
on the just-completed home stand, but both were difficult losses.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be tested further now that it has lost Valdes, who
was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think with their pitching the Dodgers cannot be
counted out of any race,'' said St. Louis manager Tony La Russa,
whose team split with the Dodgers two weeks ago. ``It's great for a
team to be able to throw that many good arms at an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, which began in 1995 when the leagues were
expanded to three divisions, has a far different look for the
Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   The first year, they won the West by a game over the Colorado
Rockies, who qualified as the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Dodgers lost the division title on the final
weekend of the season when they were swept by the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the front office thought the Dodgers lost that year
because there was little incentive to win. They still qualified for
the wild card, although they had to play the eventual National
League champion Atlanta Braves in the first round and were swept in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Dodgers finished out of the playoffs. The Florida
Marlins, the wild-card team, won 93 games during the regular
season, beat first-place Atlanta in the playoffs and went on to win
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we showed, we were a great team,'' said the Dodgers' Bobby
Bonilla, who played with the Marlins last season. ``We beat the
Braves all year. This year you don't see real races except maybe
with Houston and the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some managers accept their wild-card fate. Others refuse to
acknowledge that second place is all that is left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be realistic,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said.
``If we get to within five games of the Padres, that's great. Then
we'll think about that. But get real. The race is for the wild
card.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine disagrees. He saw how quickly
everything can change last weekend. His club moved within 1{ games
of the Cubs before losing two in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran track in high school and learned a valuable lesson,'' he
said. ``When you reach a turn, concentrate on that one and not the
next one. Why should I limit myself to saying we're only in this
for the wild card? We're in this to win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, 18-13 since taking over for Bill
Russell on June 22, knows the wild card is his only chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going a day at a time since I've been here, and
we've started to move a little,'' Hoffman said. ``That's what
matters. We're in a good spot right now, but we have to play
well.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes was placed on
the 15-day disabled list Monday with a strained oblique and
intestinal muscle on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes suffered the injury in Sunday's win over the Arizona
Diamondbacks. He was replaced on the roster by Sean Maloney, whose
contract was purchased from Triple-A Albuquerque. Valdes' spot in
the rotation goes to rookie Mike Judd, who was promoted from
Albuquerque last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He strained his left oblique, and he's missing the next two
starts,'' head trainer Charlie Strasser said. ``But right now
that's all we know. He stayed in L.A. and will be working with
therapist Pat Screnar. We'll just have to watch his progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (9-9, 3.92 ERA) won his third consecutive start Sunday
but left after throwing two pitches in the sixth inning. Valdes
leads the Dodgers with complete two games and 1432/3 innings
pitched. He is tied for the team lead in victories with Chan Ho
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes said Sunday that he never had back problems during his
career. His only other appearance on the DL was from July 10-28 in
1997 with a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed Maloney, 27, to a minor-league contract on
March 20. At Albuquerque, he was 2-1 with a 4.30 ERA and nine saves
in 22 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney spent time last season at Triple-A Tucson and Milwaukee.
With the Brewers, he was 0-0 with a 5.14 ERA in three appearances
before undergoing surgery on his right shoulder Aug. 4.

   Floyd quickly sees &QL; 
dark side of NBA
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT has been nearly a week since Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry
Krause installed Tim Floyd as director of basketball operations,
and as yet there has been no white-smoked puff of approval from the
residence of either the Pope or Michael Jordan, who, with the
exception of the beanie, are regarded in many quarters as being
identical in infallibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no surprise in Jordan's reticence to comment, since it
is obviously more fun for the King of the NBA to keep Krause
squirming and wriggling before Bulls fans like a millipede having
its legs removed with a dull butter knife.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we already know Jordan's opinion of the erstwhile head
coach of the Iowa State Cyclones. In conversations with friends and
reporters alike, he has referred to the new man on the job
derisively as ``Pink,'' as in the rock group Pink Floyd. All in
all, it's just another brick in the wall of contempt that His
Airness has constructed between himself and team management.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that by giving Floyd only the title of
director of basketball operations and not naming him as the new
head coach, the Bulls are hoping that Jordan will acquiesce on his
threats to retire again and actually get to know and come to
respect the new man as Phil Jackson's successor. Then, sometime
between now and November _ or whenever the knuckleheads on both
sides of the NBA labor dispute settle their differences _ Floyd can
be given the reins to the Bulls' bench.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jordan might go out and hug a porcupine like it was
Ahmad Rashad before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   A stack of reasons to return
</P>
<P>
   However, there are several reasons why Jordan might not want to
go public, not the least of which is his desire to play basketball
next season, and the only place he can be paid his going rate of
$36 million or more per season is right there in Chicago, where
Krause and team owner Jerry Reinsdorf still control the purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Jordan's current position as one of the unofficial
leaders of the NBA Players Association. If he were to simply
denounce Floyd and say he is retiring this minute, a Jordan-less
union would be minus one very big hammer in its negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is another possibility: Jordan is waiting for Floyd
to show up at his front door on bended knee and kiss his, ah, ring.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question in the soap opera is why Floyd would
have been thrust into this no-win situation by his good pal Krause.
</P>
<P>
   There is an inevitability to the end of any dynasty, and to be
put in charge of the dying days is like being given a spotlight
dance on the Titanic. From a practical standpoint, fans, players
and management all know that the end is inevitable and expectation
levels must be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   But emotionally, that never happens. When close games become
painful defeats, when losses begin to pile up, there is always a
rush to find the guilty party. And while much of the blame will
rightfully fall on the heads of Krause and Reinsdorf if the makeup
of the team is different next season, Floyd, too, will catch flak.
Wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   Footsteps are hard to follow
</P>
<P>
   If Krause truly believes that the 44-year-old Floyd is the right
man to lead the Bulls into the next millennium, then it makes no
sense to serve him up now as a sacrificial lamb. And history says
that is exactly what he will be _ Gene Bartow following John Wooden
at UCLA, Dan Devine following Ara Parseghian at Notre Dame, Camilla
Parker-Bowles following Princess Di at Buckingham Palace, unable to
measure up to the record or the myth. In the NBA, the last three
sinking dynasties to change coaches saw Ron Rothstein in Detroit,
Jimmy Rodgers in Boston and Mike Dunleavy in LA all gone after no
more than two years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   For any coach who comes from the outside, this a job that stands
on a trapdoor. Much of the Zen phony Jackson's popularity in recent
years had to do with his public feud with Krause. He was shrewd to
cultivate an ``us-against-them'' attitude that reeled in Jordan and
Scottie Pippen and forged the team.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to keep that air is to maintain continuity. That
would mean naming one of the current assistants, Frank Hamblen or
Bill Cartwright, as the new head coach. The Bulls could keep right
on running the triangle offense of the venerable Tex Winter, and
Jordan could keep right on running the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty could run its course, Jordan could retire in a year
or two, and then Floyd could move in as head coach for a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   The end of an era is never pretty. But it doesn't have to
include the blood of an innocent.

Team USA 
braces for 
Greek fans
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flying projectiles just &QL; 
part of Athens game
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Greek fans are legendary for their zest in
supporting the local sporting arts.
</P>
<P>
   Impassioned doesn't begin to describe them. They don't just blur
the lines of good sportsmanship. They erase them and draw up all
new rules of etiquette. And Rule No. 1 is: Anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. basketball team that begins play in the Federation
Internationale de Basketball Association World Championships on
Wednesday included such recognizable names as Grant Hill, Gary
Payton and Tim Duncan, perhaps the team might be spared some of the
wrath of the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   But without NBA players, who undoubtedly would command more
respect, the Americans don't expect any preferential treatment from
the home fans in this country, which has been smitten with hoops
fever. When the 16-team World Championships begin at the Olympic
Stadium and the Peace and Friendship arena, these fans will do
anything they can get away with to help their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't believe the hatred the opposing crowd will have
for us,'' says David Wood, who played a season for the team in
Greece that uses Olympic Stadium as its home court. ``When you go
someplace, if they can get you in an alley and beat your face in,
they would do it. They truly hate the visiting team, especially in
the playoffs. They'll try to hit you in the face with coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything they can throw at you, they will. It's weird. In
America, you might get some hecklers who want to hurt your feelings
and have you look at them so they can smile and joke with their
beer-drinking buddies. But they don't want to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in Thessalonika one year, and they throw everything
they can get their hands on. I've been on the court when it's been
like machine-gun fire with the coins hitting the floor at such a
rapid pace. After the game, the janitor had a pocketful of coins.
And Greek coins are big. They're like big 50-cent pieces. They'll
probably have to have at least 500 armed guards at the games just
to keep the fans under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories like these often don't come to pass. And the
Americans will have one thing going for them: They won't play the
Greeks until at least the quarterfinals, assuming both make the top
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the American players have played in Europe and
agree this tournament will feature the rowdiest fans in all of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of heckling, a lot of `USA go home,' and a lot of
anti-American sentiment, that's what we'll get,'' said Wendell
Alexis, a 10-year veteran of European basketball. ``I think we're
going to get a lot of disrespect, but I think that most
importantly, we just have to go out there and win every game and
not worry about the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about winning at this tournament. And even though NBA
players aren't involved, the U.S. still is a strong candidate for a
medal and most insiders believe they have a decent shot at the
gold. But they will have to beat not only Yugoslavia and Australia
and Greece but the Greek fans as well. The Greek players are well
aware how rabid their fans are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to improve on our (fourth-place) finish in the 1994
World Championships,'' said Panagiotis Fassoulas, a Greek center.
``Our fans won't accept anything less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans know how tough it's going to be. Most of them have
played in Europe before and know all too well about the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be very tough,'' says Michael Hawkins, whose
Olympiakos team last season used one of the World Championships
venues, the Olympic Stadium, as its home floor. ``As Americans, we
wouldn't dream of throwing objects on the floor and trying to harm
the other team or even the referees or their own team. But they
have no control. They're tough fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Jimmy Oliver: ``I know some of the European cities have
really rowdy crowds. They get to the point where they are throwing
cigarette lighters and money and toilet paper. It can get
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just for the visitors. Alexis has hopscotched across
Europe in his pro career, and he has learned that fans will turn on
their own team if things aren't going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opposing team, the underdog team, comes in and starts
kicking butt, things turn very quickly in an international game,''
Alexis says. ``If there's an upset or their team is not doing well,
things can get very ugly quickly. The idea is not to let the home
team and home crowd get going. It can be really tough on the
visiting team if that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the Americans are prepared for the worst as the
tournament prepares to open, they also are wary of just how
difficult the atmosphere could be. This tournament, dubbed
WorldBasket '98 in Europe, is the most coveted gold medal of all
for teams on this continent, even surpassing the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks will be in rare form when it comes to distracting
everybody but their team. And especially so for the Americans,
since the fans here were hoping for NBA stars but were delivered
replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about it and experiencing it are two different
things,'' Rudy Tomjanovich says. ``We all know it's going to be
crazy. I just hope we can keep our composure and play smart when it
gets wild.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Stop us if you've heard this one before _ you know, the one about
how the Astros fare against pitchers they've never faced.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone forgot to brief Florida Marlins rookie Brian Meadows,
who just happened to be on the mound on a night when the Astros'
offense felt like taking out some frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros beat up on Meadows and fellow rookie Ryan Dempster on
their way to a 9-1 victory over the Marlins on Monday night before
a scattered crowd of 20,888 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, the Astros have had their share
of problems against new pitchers. In fact, the last time they were
in the Dome, Colorado Rockies rookie Mark Brownson fired a four-hit
shutout against them.
</P>
<P>
   That game sent the Astros on the road with a bad taste in their
mouths, and their buds weren't exactly satisfied by the 2-3 West
Coast road trip. Whether it was home cooking or easy prey, the
Astros feasted on the carcass of the defending World Series
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marlin Moises Alou was 4-for-4, tying his career high for
hits in a game. He smacked his 26th homer and paced the Astros'
14-hit attack. Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell each homered and drove
in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima held the Marlins to six hits and tossed his second
complete game of the season. The Astros gave Lima all the runs he
needed and then some with a five-run outburst in the first that
silenced anyone who thought this would be another big night for an
opposing rookie pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people may think that way, but I guarantee you none of
our hitters think that way,'' Bagwell said. ``We don't feel like
anyone is going to get us out consistently. If we score four runs,
people around here think we stink. No matter how many runs we
score, the bottom line is that we're going after wins. That's all
that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   They should have plenty of opportunities to pile up victories
over the next nine days. The stripped-down Marlins are in town for
three more days before the Astros leave on a six-game road trip to
Pittsburgh and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to play for a week or so and be on top
of our game,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We need to
prove to ourselves that we're the kind of team our record says we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   What better time to have the schedule stacked with the Marlins
and Pirates?
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, we should be able to win some games,'' Bagwell said.
``But you know baseball. The Marlins took three of four from the
Braves, and they're very capable of beating you.''
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't proved that to the Astros, who have won each of
their first three games against the Marlins this season. Alou has
played a major part in the early dominance, going 8-for-11 (.727)
at the plate against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing should happen more often with the type of
lineup we have,'' Alou said. ``We've been in a little team slump
lately, but it was nice to score those five runs early and give
Lima some support. He pitched a hell of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadows, who made his first appearance at the Astrodome, didn't
have much time to get comfortable with the surroundings. He hit
Craig Biggio with his first pitch of the game and proceeded to
allow the next four Astros to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Spiers and Bell singled, Bagwell drove them home with
a towering three-run homer to left. It was his 22nd home run of the
season. Alou followed with a first-pitch homer into the
general-admission seats in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can put up a five-spot in the first inning,
that's obviously a good thing,'' Bagwell said. ``It was nice to
have that cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadows retired nine of the next 11 batters he faced, before his
misery was resumed in the fifth. The Astros opened the inning with
five consecutive hits, including an RBI double by Spiers and
run-producing singles by Bell and Alou. Meadows left the game
because of a strained right groin after Spiers' double.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's 15th homer, a leadoff shot in the seventh, ended the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very aggressive,'' said Bell, who was 3-for-4.
``Sometimes when we face guys we haven't seen, we let them bring it
to us instead of taking it to them. Tonight, we took it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Marlin who scored never should have reached base. Cliff
Floyd led off the fifth with an infield pop-up that dropped between
Biggio and shortstop Ricky Gutierrez. Floyd scored from third on
Mike Redmond's double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Lima retired the first 11 It was the fewest runs he has allowed
since June 6.

YOUNG _ ACTOR, FATHER, FRIEND, ICON _ LAID TO REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Actor Robert Young was remembered as ``an
icon of American fatherhood'' at a memorial service held at Forest
Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his roles as perfect dad Jim Anderson on the
1950s sitcom ``Father Knows Best'' and as a trusted physician on
``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' Young died Wednesday at 91 at his home in
Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many people wish they had a father like the one
on `Father Knows Best,''' said the Rev. Jim Obermeyer, who led the
service Monday at the Little Church of the Flowers at Forest Lawn
in Glendale north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost much of the innocence of that era when `Father
Knows Best' aired,'' said Obermeyer of the Christ the King Church
in Santa Clarita. ``America needs those values now.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1954 through 1960, Young's Jim Anderson dispensed fatherly
advice to his three children, Princess, Bud and Kitten, all of whom
faced a different moral dilemma for their father to solve each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Later, from 1969 through 1976, he became a role model for
doctors across America when he took on the part of ``Marcus Welby,
M.D.'' Instead of helping Princess cope with prom stress, this time
around he offered comfort to the sick and dying.
</P>
<P>
   At the service Monday, his daughter Carol Proffitt remembered
her father as her own ``Papa,'' of getting her first pony as a gift
and of spying on his Saturday night poker games with Lucille Ball
and Desi Arnaz.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Proffitt, Young is survived by three other daughters.
Young's wife, Betty, died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Wyatt, who played Young's wife, Margaret, on ``Father Knows
Best,'' said her co-star was a ``wonderful actor.'' Their TV
marriage was a happy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked together six years,'' Wyatt said as she left the
memorial service. ``In all those six years we never had a cross
word with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Gray, the actor who played Bud on ``Father Knows Best''
also attended the service. Gray, now 60, said on TV Young counseled
his children each week on the show but in real-life he ``wasn't
into giving advice.''

OLD PRO MOON LACKS LEVERAGE OF ROOKIE LEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Warren Moon and his super-agent, Leigh Steinberg, have
spent the summer crying foul at the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   They claim Paul Allen's slush-fund franchise has under-budgeted
for the quarterback position by about $4 or $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Moon won't accept the Seahawks' explanation that the
Hawks have no cap room to pay their starting quarterback want he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Show Moon the money?
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks seem like they're leaning toward showing Moon the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shawn Kemp's divorce tiff with the Sonics, in which Kemp
went nuts over the Sonics' 1996 summer spending spree on free
agents, Moon and Steinberg suggest it was the Seahawks'
responsibility to clear cap room.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the Hawks could make a new deal, two or three years in
duration, to ``take care of Warren Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains why Moon is working out somewhere with a personal
trainer while his teammates sweat through two-a-days in sunny
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the proverbial twist of the knife: It can't make
matters any easier for Moon now that the Chargers have made rookie
quarterback Ryan Leaf a very rich man _ if you consider an NFL
contract worth $31 million to be really big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie with nothing on his resume but a ton of promise gets a
bundle of dough.
</P>
<P>
   A future Hall of Fame quarterback gets a phone and fax machine
that still won't ring with an improved offer from Seahawks' vice
president Randy Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   The Moon-Seahawks' standoff has reached nine days. No one is
budging.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Seahawks, who have offered $2 million, plus $1.6 million
in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   And not Moon, who wants a three-year, $15 million deal that
includes a $6 million signing bonus. Last week, Moon told reporters
he would be willing to settle for a two-year deal worth $7-8
million, but he hasn't told the club that.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot help one bit that the tall kid with the cannon arm who
took Washington State to the Rose Bowl for the first time in 67
years could now fill his swimming pool full of dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just from his signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers, who already traded away players and draft picks
galore just for the right to draft Leaf, have just given Leaf an
unprecedented lump sum of $11.25 million, just for being Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of Matchbox 20 CDs and chicken enchiladas, two of
Leaf's favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moon believes he should get similar high-priority
treatment, simply for being Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Moon is mistaken. That is where he has little
clout or leverage, especially on a team where he has played only
one season. He is a short-term, short-time solution for the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Moon's career in pro football to what Ryan Leaf might
do is like comparing apples and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the same thing. Moon's value is only what the
Seahawks will pay him. Leaf's value is what the Chargers will pay
him, which could top out at $5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Chargers took a gamble trading away so much and
committing so much cash to Leaf, although it's a gamble the
Chargers had to take.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Colts now will be lavishing more money on Peyton
Manning, drafted No. 1 ahead of Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, the chance for a team to draft a top-rated
quarterback around whom you bank on building your franchise is the
most dramatic and most expensive move you can make, more than
hiring a general manager or coach.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf and Manning are not only the arm of the future, they are
the face and the marketing tool to sell tickets, jerseys and
TV/radio ad time.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for these sorts of monster rookie deals can be just
as awesome as the risk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer were the top two picks in
the NFL draft. Both were franchise-saviors. Both were lavished with
monster contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer's deal was so cleverly constructed, the Seahawks wound up
paying Mirer an additional $2 million, even after it was clear
Mirer was not going to cut it. But Mirer had the leverage because
his contract included some nebulous incentive clauses, which Mirer
reached and the Hawks were forced to pay.
</P>
<P>
   At least in New England, the Patriots got their money's worth in
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the key to these blockbuster rookie quarterback deals
is time.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonuses and incentives are spread out over several
years. Leaf and Manning have at least that to offer their new
employers. Time is on their side to make the huge investment
somewhat palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Moon does not have that luxury. Moon, who will turn 42 in
November, lacks the one thing necessary to structure such a
high-priced deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are unwilling to enter into any deal that commits
money to Moon that would extend their financial obligation to him
beyond this single season.
</P>
<P>
   That's not as much ageism as it is practical salary cap-ology.

NO PROBLEMS WITH WATTERS; SEAHAWKS EMBRACE HIS INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ One question: Who is that wearing No. 32 at the
Seahawks' training camp?
</P>
<P>
   The roster lists him as Ricky Watters. The face inside the
helmet looks like Ricky Watters. When teammates and coaches call
that name, the guy in the No. 32 jersey answers.
</P>
<P>
   But it just can't be Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawks signed him as a free agent in March, Watters
checked in with more personal baggage than the touring cast of
Cats.
</P>
<P>
   Watters has tried to say and do all the right things, but has
not been able to run from the ghosts of his previous stints with
the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   He's selfish, one critic points out. He's a malcontent, another
chimes in. He's a human time bomb who is wound too tight and could
go off at any moment over any number of things, others predict.
</P>
<P>
   Well, nine days and 14 practices into training camp, and three
days shy of the Seahawks' preseason opener at Dallas, Watters has
displayed none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've see nothing but the best out of Ricky, and I've been
pleasantly surprised by how hard he works,'' fullback Mack Strong
offered. ``Ricky Watters has been the hardest worker at each of the
camps we've had _ the minicamps and now in training camp. It just
goes to show you can't always listen to what you hear or believe
everything you read about a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that capital ``I'' that is supposed to be the focal point
of Watters' first name, linebacker Darrin Smith shakes his head at
even the suggestion. Smith and Watters were teammates in
Philadelphia last season and bitter rivals in 1993 and 1994, when
Watters was with the 49ers and Smith was playing for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Philadelphia, there was a negative perception of
Ricky in a lot of people's minds,'' Smith said. ``What I saw was a
guy who wants to win. What's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Michael Jordan. You would never hear Michael Jordan
say, `No, let him take the (game-winning) shot.' No, Michael says,
`Gimme the ball,''' Smith said. ``That's Ricky. He wants the ball
with the game on the line. It's a desire to get it done. I want to
play with players like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Watters goes at interviews the same way he runs
toward holes in the offensive line _ with quickness, exuberance and
no fear.
</P>
<P>
   No questions are off limits, including those about his past and
the problems his frankness have created.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm tired of trying to defend myself,''
Watters said. ``If you already have a slanted view of somebody, it
doesn't matter what they do because you're already looking at them
like, `I don't like him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people come up to me and say, `I love the way you are,
don't change a thing.' Then I'm going to have the people who say,
`I don't think you should do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever questioned Watters' talent. He has averaged
1,105 yards rushing and 50 receptions in his first six seasons and
been voted to five Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   And he sounds content to be one of the guys, rather than the
guy, on his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to remake the offense around me,''
he said. ``They were the No. 1 passing offense last year, and they
were in the top half of the league in rushing, so it's already
here. The nucleus is here. I'm just going to try and fit in and
help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this be the same guy who ruffled egos by complaining about
not getting the ball enough on a 49ers team that included Steve
Young and Jerry Rice? Can this be the same player who ignited a
thunderstorm of negativity in Philadelphia in 1995 by failing to
extend for a pass over the middle at the end of a blowout loss and
then tried to explain it by asking, ``For who? For what?''?
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks did extensive research into Watters' troubled past
before signing him to a four-year, $13 million deal. Their
conclusion was that each of the incidents that have become such a
large part of the Watters' legacy was related to his wanting to win
and a feeling that he can help a team do that only if he has the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to say that I'm an emotional player, that's
true,'' Watters said. ``That I'm a fiery competitor? That's true.
Do I want to win every game I'm in? Yes. Do I want to do well? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is play my game and be the person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. And then some.

L.A. CHARMS DEMOCRATS IN BID FOR 2000 CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With mariachis, a helicopter cruise over the city
and a tour of Universal Studios, Los Angeles officials began wooing
52 Democratic Party officials who will determine the site of their
party's 2000 national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Monday, city, business and union officials
announced that they have solved potential labor problems that could
have scuttled the city's selection and cost it 30,000 visitors and
an estimated $137 million boost to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Los Angeles unity show lined up, even the weather
cooperated to an extent. A cooling breeze blew through the historic
Olvera Street Plaza, easing the high-90s temperatures just as Mayor
Richard Riordan, city, county, state and federal officials staged a
``Heritage of Welcome'' for the delegates and about 300 other
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Italics) Yo quiero (end italics) DNC,'' Riordan chanted at
one point. ``Los Angeles is a city that has what it takes to host
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find everything you need in L.A., the city of the
next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gloria Molina sought to counter the historical
arguments being made by cities such as Boston and Philadelphia by
citing California's history as well as its history of being active
in Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the election of John F. Kennedy (nominated at the 1960
convention in Los Angeles) that inspired so many of us to be a
Democrat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said they weren't bothered by the hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think this is hot? I'm from Louisiana and that's hot,''
committee member Ben Jeffers said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chair Yolanda Caraway said heat would not be a factor in
the final decision among the seven contending cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be in July and it will be hot everywhere,'' Caraway
said. ``What's more important is if it's the right city.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Kiki Moore said her concern is with how much
the city wants the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city really wants it, when problems come up, it means
they will be solved,'' Moore said. ``I want to see the city's
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a political aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has 54 electoral votes and everyone is aware of its
importance,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, officials from the Staples Center
sports arena said they have resolved any potential problems with
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 11. Union officials had
threatened to picket during the convention tour if the arena did
not sign a long-term contract to employ its members. The union
wanted an arena neutrality agreement, which would allow workers to
join a union and allow Local 11 to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an understanding with the union,'' said Tim Leiwecke,
who is in charge of overseeing the construction of the $300 million
facility. ``We recognize the importance of labor peace and are
going to have a longstanding agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Durazo, president of the union, did not return
telephone calls. But those close to the sides said a session is
planned this morning to resolve issues.
</P>
<P>
   Labor peace is important to Democrats, who have a policy that
prevents them from meeting in nonunion facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, one of the other six cities seeking the
convention, was forced to delay its meeting with the site selection
committee earlier this month because of a transit strike. Committee
members refused to leave an airport because it would mean crossing
picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   The real work for the city comes today, when officials make a
formal presentation in a morning session at the Convention Center.
Later in the day, subcommittees of the panel will meet privately
with local officials to discuss specifics regarding logistics,
facilities, hotel rooms, security, transportation and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   But, the parties for the committee will continue. Among the
events is a semi-private reception at Riordan's personal residence
as well as a tour of the Getty Center and a late-night party hosted
by actor Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   And some observers said such glitz could have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Los Angeles, after all,'' political analyst Susan
Estrich said. ``I'd have to say this is for Los Angeles to lose.
Most everyone feels it is Los Angeles' turn.''

GOLFERS SHARE LAUGHS DURING USOC FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Wash. _ Peter Jacobsen tees it up and yuks it up at the
same time. You might know him as the fun-loving PGA golfer from
Portland who has won six tournaments in his 22-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jacobsen was an instructor and an impersonator,
providing lessons and laughs during the Merrill Lynch Invitational
at Meridian Valley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Along with LPGA star Michelle McGann, Jacobsen headlined the
fund-raising event for the United States Olympic Committee. Joining
the two golfers were former Olympians Mark Spitz, Mike Eruzione and
Seattle's Debbie Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, who earned $35,000 for his appearance, and McGann
conducted a clinic on the driving range before playing in a charity
skins match. Jacobsen added levity to the proceedings, firing at
flagsticks and Canadians, the latter shots being playful ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya know the difference between a canoe and a Canuck?'' he
asked about 200 spectators in the bleachers. ``A canoe will tip.''
</P>
<P>
   When Eruzione, captain of the 1980 gold medal-winning U.S.
hockey team, stepped onto the driving range, Jacobsen checked him
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you an American?'' Jacobsen wondered as he inspected
Eruzione's mouth. ``Most Canadians have more toes than teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Jacobsen delivered his best material, imitating the quirky
characteristics of fellow golfers Johnny Miller, Lee Trevino, Gary
Player, Arnold Palmer and Craig Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler's ritual is his favorite. Jacobsen talks about Stadler's
rear end and says the Walrus actually looks more like ``the
refrigerator repair guy.'' McGann emptied a bucketful of range
balls into Jacobsen's shirt to better represent Stadler's lumpy
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's clinic and skins game raised $90,000 for the USOC. The
Invitational continues today with a junior golf clinic at 10 a.m.
followed by a nine-hole celebrity shootout featuring Curt Warner,
Jack Sikma, Don James, Spitz and Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   SAHALEE SPECTACLE: Jacobsen said next month's PGA Championship
at Sahalee Country Club will be well-received, in large part
because of Seattle's supposedly cooler weather. Other PGA
Championships have been held in pressure cookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you're sweating all the way down through your
underwear,'' said Jacobsen, who did not qualify to play at Sahalee
but picks Colin Montgomerie to win the tournament. ``It's not a
pleasurable feeling. Players love the Pacific Northwest. They are
going to push to come back and play more here.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship could be the start of an annual tradition.
The PGA Tour plans to return here next year with a tournament stop
at the Jack Nicklaus-designed Snoqualmie Ridge. Dates have been
awarded in July, the week after the British Open. A sponsor is now
needed.
</P>
<P>
   LATEST SENSATION: McGann, who is known for her long drives and
wide-brimmed hats, talked about another popular golfer, Se Ri Pak,
the 20-year-old South Korean who has won three of the last four
LPGA tournaments and is the favorite at this week's du Maurier
Classic in Windsor, Ontario. Pak will play at the Safeco Classic at
Meridian Valley in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her impact on tour has been awesome,'' McGann said. ``We're
all learning quite a bit from her. She doesn't seem to be bothered
by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING ALONG: Spitz, who won seven gold medals in swimming in
the '72 Olympics, looked fit at 48. His hair is graying and his
moustache is gone. He lives in L.A. and still swims in the UCLA
masters program. ``It's an organized workout,'' Spitz said. ``I
can't aimlessly swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitz and his wife of 25 years have two sons, 6 and 16. Neither
child swims competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Spitz stays busy now with his own business. He co-founded Smart
Talk Teleservices, a phone card company.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at his swing on the driving range, you could say
Spitz still has his best strokes in the pool.

and he can think of few things better than to enter the northern

simply disappear. For more than 15 years, Jennings has pursued an
obsessive, some might think odd, dream that has made his treasured

that the entire endeavor is so drenched in subjectivity as to be
close to silly. Still, the purpose of the exercise was to provoke
discussion, always a good thing. So, while the conversation swirls,
here's another question that emerged from a recent conversation
duly provoked by the Modern Library list. How many of the books on

beetles, biologists have been able to do little more than speculate
about how the 330,000 known species have come to dominate the
living world. Now a study in the latest issue of Science says that
the secret to the diversity of beetles lies in what they eat. Those
groups of beetles that long ago evolved to eat flowering plants
spun off thousands of species, many more than those beetles that
continued to eat more primitive and less diverse plants. By
feasting on flowering plants _ which widely diversified _ the
beetles were apparently able themselves to produce many species. By

ABORTION FOES KEEP GOAL, ADJUST STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a political climate of tightening restrictions on abortion
and violence against clinics, some abortion-rights supporters
foresee a day when abortion is legal but offered only by an
underground network of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics fear, will be that women will have fewer
choices and will turn increasingly to clinics with shoddy
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reminiscent of the back-alley abortions in the past,''
said Sen. Ann Day, R-Tucson, chairwoman of the state Senate Health
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of making abortion legal but unavailable seems to
be working, and critics worry that a death this year at a Phoenix
abortion clinic _ cited last week in Congress by lawmakers to help
override a presidential veto of a partial-birth abortion bill _
will contribute to still more calls for restrictions at the state
level and, ultimately, more back-room deaths. In the Phoenix
matter, a patient of Dr. John Biskind bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precedent for this type of activity is the minor consent
bills, the informed consent bills, the waiting periods, the other
restrictive bills that chip away at access and at the right to
safe, legal abortion without touching `Roe vs. Wade,' '' said
Joseph Feldman, director of education and counseling at Planned
Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an orchestrated . . . strategic attempt to limit American
women's access to abortion without running headlong into the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north central Phoenix, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the bills. There aren't any more to make abortion
illegal,'' Gerard said. ``Now it's informed consent, parental
consent, waiting periods. It's trying to make it more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes freely admit that they are concentrating on
tightening access to abortion. Rep. Karen Johnson, who entered
politics largely because of the abortion issue, said it's a way of
facing political reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're faced with a Supreme Court at the national level that is
not going to overturn `Roe vs. Wade' until some new judicial
appointments are made,'' said Johnson, R-Mesa. ``It's just
realistic that we look at the most egregious aspects of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathi Herod of the Center for Arizona Policy, a Scottsdale-based
conservative advocacy group, agreed. But she added that ``we will
always have the goal . . . to have abortion outlawed in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Herod said that the abortion laws in recent years that Arizona
and other states have enacted are reasonable, common-sense reforms.
The parental consent law makes sense, for example, because doctors
need permission before operating on minors for most medical
procedures, Herod said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the (abortion rights) lobby has opposed any law in
Arizona over the past 15 years that would have imposed reasonable
regulations on the abortion industry,'' Herod said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court declared abortion constitutional in 1973,
but subsequent court decisions allowed states to regulate it. In
Arizona, lawmakers enacted a parental consent law in 1996 and a
partial-birth abortion law in 1997, although both are now in court.
</P>
<P>
   An informed-consent bill that would require doctors to tell
women about the physical and emotional risks of an abortion at
least 24 hours before the procedure failed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering a Child Custody Protection Act, which
would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines for an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, these restrictions mean that fewer clinics are
willing to provide abortions and that when demand outstrips supply,
in competent doctors, or clinics with lax standards and procedures,
will be encouraged to remain in business, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without speaking to Dr. Biskind's competence, it's certainly
true that the smaller a pool of providers for any service, the more
in demand each one of them becomes,'' Planned Parenthood's Feldman
said. ``And certainly that means that some physicians who may
normally have trouble getting work will easily find work if they're
able and willing to perform abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes dismiss those arguments as groundless. They say
it's a cop-out for abortion-rights advocates to blame the abortion
foes for such occurrences as those at the Biskind clinic.
</P>
<P>
   If abortion is becoming increasingly dangerous, they say, it's
because abortion-rights supporters have fought every attempt at
clinic regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we come up with something that would offer some
protections for women in abortion clinics, they fight it,'' Johnson
said. ``They want it wide open so they can rake in the money.'' &QL;

ATTICA'S GHOST IN THE SHADOW OF PATAKI VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Leven did not wear a jacket to work on Monday,
partly because it was hot and partly because, he figured, why
bother when no clients would be showing up at his office near City
Hall. It has been very slow lately at Prisoners' Legal Services,
where he is executive director.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Gov. George Pataki decided that New York does
not need a program like Leven's, which for two decades has provided
legal counsel for inmates, past and present, who say they have been
ill treated in the state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, Pataki has sought to spiff up his
tough-on-crime image by vetoing $4.8 million that the State
Legislature approved to keep Prisoners' Legal Services going for a
23rd year. If inmates want to sue the state, the governor reasoned,
let them do it on their own time and on their own dime.
</P>
<P>
   Without state money, Leven was forced to shed more than his
jacket. Most of his 60 lawyers, paralegals and assistants had to be
let go, and those who stayed are on reduced salaries. His staff
cannot take on new cases. Basically, with $470,000 thus far in
foundation grants, his organization is trying to limp its way to
1999 in the hope that the political mood in Albany will be
different then.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unless we're able to raise another million, we're not
going to be able to keep our doors open past October,'' Leven said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, many New Yorkers would respond: Who cares? An awful
lot of them have no use for any program that remotely smacks of
coddling criminals, especially not on a day like Monday, when a
young ex-convict was accused of shooting Police Officer Gerard
Carter in the head on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at this gubernatorial veto raises questions
about whether Pataki has done New York taxpayers a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not even venture into loftier moral climes of the state's
obligations when inmates say they have been beaten by guards or
subjected to other indignities that violate rules of decency
separating U.S. prisons from, say, China's.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' Legal Services came into being as a direct result of
what is widely accepted to have been a gross abuse of state power:
the brutal suppression of a 1971 inmate uprising at the prison in
Attica, N.Y. State troopers poured into an inmate-occupied yard
with guns blazing, firing indiscriminately and killing 39 convicts
and guards who had been taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   That violence _ the bloodiest one-day encounter between
Americans since the Civil War _ was followed by brutal reprisals
against inmates that amounted to torture. They were so vicious that
a federal court jury in Buffalo last year awarded $4 million to a
former Attica prisoner, Frank Smith. Among other things, Smith had
been beaten with batons, burned with cigarettes, and made to lie
naked on a table for hours with a football tucked under his chin
and threatened with castration if the ball dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Attica's ghosts linger, in part because Albany will not let them
fade away. Just this month, state-paid lawyers went before federal
appellate judges seeking to overturn the award to Smith. Of course,
the taxpayer will get stuck with the legal bill, the same way that
he may have to absorb hidden costs of the Pataki veto.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Leven's staff does is weed out silly inmate
gripes, those of the ``they served melted ice cream'' variety. It
boasts of never having had a case tossed out as frivolous by a
judge, despite handling 12,000 prisoner complaints and 150 court
cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more litigation if we're gone,'' Leven said.
``We discourage cases that we feel don't have merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess who will pick up the tab for any flood of unfiltered cases
brought by inmates themselves? The same may hold true if Legal
Services is not around to see that inmates get full credit for jail
time served. Its vigilance frees up valuable cell space, saving the
state millions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who wants needlessly angry convicts? A place where they
can take legitimate grievances provides a safety valve that can
avert another (and, need it be added, costly) Attica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the state's obligation, and they ought to step up
to the plate and honor it,'' said Paul Curran, board chairman of
Prisoners' Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   Curran, it might be noted, is a Republican and a former U.S.
attorney in Manhattan. Not your run-of-the-mill bleeding heart.

GREEN CRITICIZES RIVAL D'AMATO'S ETHICS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Green, a Democratic candidate for the Senate,
attacked Sen. Alfonse D'Amato Monday as an ``election-year
opportunist and a shakedown artist,'' delivering the kind of
blistering assault on D'Amato's ethics that Green said his
Democratic opponents were unwilling to make.
</P>
<P>
   The speech by Green, the New York City public advocate, amounted
to a compendium of 12 years of accusations that Green and others
have directed at D'Amato's fund-raising practices and votes. The
attack made clear that Green would seek to distinguish himself in
the Democratic field by making the Republican senator the issue,
and with oratory that was harsh even by the standards of New York
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato is dangerous, not because of his principles but
because he is altogether unprincipled,'' Green asserted in a speech
to a small group of labor leaders. ``He has shown that he will do
and say anything to maintain his power and his incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   Green said D'Amato's ``career has always been framed not by
beliefs and principles but by contracts and deals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics,'' Green said, ``are invariably sacrificed on the altar
of expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's speech was, to a certain extent, a reprise of
accusations he has leveled since he first ran against D'Amato in
1986. At times Monday, Green even quoted himself, as is his habit.
His decision to attack D'Amato with such strong language was also
at least in part pragmatic: short on cash, Green needs to draw the
kind of news coverage that would give free publicity to his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who is known to have particular antipathy to Green
because of their history of hostility, declined comment Monday on
his opponent's remarks. Instead, a D'Amato spokesman, Harvey
Valentine, said: ``Mark Green obviously hasn't gotten over his
defeat of 1986. It's sad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Green's speech highlighted a debate among Democrats
contemplating the best way to unseat D'Amato: whether attacks on
D'Amato's ethics, many of which are familiar by now, have any
resonance with the electorate. Green said his opponents _ Rep.
Charles Schumer and Geraldine Ferraro, the former representative _
were making a fundamental mistake in not attacking D'Amato over
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats seeking to replace Al D'Amato must be able to show
the link between his bad ethics and bad votes,'' Green said,
referring to what he said was the connection between D'Amato's
legislative votes and campaign contributions. ``Any Democrats
unwilling or unable to make both the ethics and legislative cases
against D'Amato _ not one to the exclusion of the other, but both _
won't and shouldn't be the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he would raise questions about D'Amato's ethics but
that such attacks would ultimately have only a limited effect.
``Most people in New York State know that D'Amato is hardly a
paragon of ethics,'' he said. ``But most people do not know that he
has voted like Jesse Helms on choice, that he has voted against gun
control and that he has voted to cut Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Ferraro, Stephen Gaskill, also said such
attacks had only limited effect. ``We're talking about D'Amato's
record on the issues,'' Gaskill said. ``And that's the great
distinction between D'Amato and Gerry Ferraro, as well as the other
candidates in the race.''

SHORTAGE OF ABORTION DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By Vanessa DeRuyter  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Access to safe abortions is threatened by a shortage of doctors
qualified to perform the procedure, according to experts in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Even though national trends show the number of abortions has
been decreasing nationally _ from a record 1.43 million in 1990
down to 1.21 million in 1995 _ abortion advocates say there are not
enough doctors willing to perform the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is not taught in medical school, and physicians are not
required to learn how to perform it, even though the Arizona Board
of Medical Examiners, for example, requires that training in
abortion be offered to physicians in obstetrics and gynecology
residency programs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, fewer OB-GYN doctors have the training, and those
who are familiar with the procedure may not be willing to perform
it, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beth Weber, medical services director for Planned Parenthood
of Central and Northern Arizona, said that young physicians are
unwilling to take advantage of the training in part because of
historical ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the younger physicians are unaware of the pre-`Roe
(vs. Wade') days when women did seek illegal abortions,'' she said.
``They don't understand the repercussions when abortion is not
provided and not provided safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Finkel has performed abortions in the Valley since
1982 and fears for the future safety of women who seek them. He
said he has requested many times that Midwestern University in
Glendale send him students to train, but the school has
consistently declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem. You have administrators at medical schools
refusing to make available to students quality health-care
training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel alleges that the university and many others avoid
teaching abortion because it is controversial, and they are
overwhelmed by the fear of losing funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most of these bureaucrats in medical school have
backbone and gonad deficiencies,'' he said. ``They are more
interested in getting tax dollars than they are in doing the right
thing. They are afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern Associate Dean Thomas McWilliams denies that. ``It's
erroneous that it's the medical schools' fault,'' McWilliams said.
``It's not part of the curriculum, and I don't believe that it's
part of the curriculum in most schools.''
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams recognizes that the issue is politically and
emotionally charged, but he says that is not why abortion training
isn't part of the curriculum. He said students must cram a lot of
information into four years, and schools have to set priorities in
pre-doctoral instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our curriculum, training in termination of pregnancy is
not an objective. It's not that it's not important. It's not that I
don't recognize that there is a need for some people to do that,
but not at the pre-doctoral level,'' McWilliams said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Arizona hospital does not perform or teach
abortions, either. State legislators banned University Medical
Center in Tucson from performing abortions in 1974, except in cases
where the mother's life is in danger. The ban was clamped on as a
stipulation to a measure authorizing the university to sell bonds
for the expansion of the football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors deciding to learn the procedure during their residency
may become discouraged from practicing it by the stigma, said Dr.
Paula Nadell, who doesn't perform abortions but believes in
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors performing abortions are older men, veterans of the
political battle over ``Roe vs. Wade,'' said Berry Sweet, former
executive director of Right to Choose, a grass-roots
abortion-rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   These doctors have witnessed deaths from unsafe abortions and
lobbied nationally to have trained medical providers perform the
procedure, Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   But now many fear for their lives because of increased violence,
and some have been forced to remove their practices to more
discreet settings, Nadell said. &QL;

A'S FIND NO RAYS OF HOPE IN LOSS  
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The A's deserve far better than to have
one four-game series in a hellhole of a dome stand as the epitaph
for a season, but that's the fate that now hangs around their necks
like a cheap-plastic lei.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays swept the A's in four games,
and whether it is fair or not, that's so damning an indictment that
it may end up overshadowing many or most of the positives that have
characterized this season to date.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, it takes a bad team to lose four games in a
row to a team that entered the series with a 37-62 record. The A's
have been a good team at times this year, but right now they are
not, and that was painfully clear in an 11-5 defeat Monday that ran
their losing streak to seven games, their worst in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightmare, terrible, horrific, unbelievable _ those are the
terms that describe it perfectly,'' A's second baseman Bip Roberts
said. ``To lose every game on a road trip, that's tough, man.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Wade Boggs lined a single to center in the eighth to
start the rally that made it a rout, the A's had a dazed look, like
kids wishing Mom would call them home to dinner and say that the
game really didn't mean anything anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Streaks have a way of developing a momentum of their own, and
the A's current run looks more and more like a runaway train. The
hitting came around Monday, but only after Tampa Bay banged up
starter Blake Stein (4-6) and jumped out to a 7-1 lead by the
fifth, turning the remainder of the game into garbage time. The
defense was wobbly again, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were soundly beaten again,'' manager Art Howe said. ``We
didn't pitch and we didn't make plays. They won the series, hands
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the A's are a season-low 12 games under .500 and it's back
to the Coliseum for a potentially punishing 10-game homestand
against the Red Sox (60-43), Indians (59-45) and Yankees (73-26).
</P>
<P>
   But Howe and others in the clubhouse seemed to look forward to
the challenge of playing some good teams again, instead of going
against a team like Tampa Bay that had lost 16 of 18 going into the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play any worse,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone shudders at who is coming to town, just
like they don't take anyone for granted,'' general manager Billy
Beane said Monday. ``We've played Cleveland tougher than Kansas
City. We've had the lead in every game against the Yankees. We've
had the lead in every game but one against Boston and that was when
Pedro Martinez beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad last night that even Ben Grieve, the oasis of hope
in a whole desert of painful reality, had an ugly game. He's the
real thing, a lock to hit .300 season after season, but he's a work
in progress in the outfield and last night he made two bad plays.
</P>
<P>
   He fielded catcher Mike DiFelice's run-scoring double in the
second cleanly but looked confused about where he wanted to throw.
He ended up nonchalanting the ball to Roberts, and the throw
tailed. Roberts couldn't handle it, and a second run scored to make
it 2-1, putting the Devil Rays ahead to stay. Then in the seventh,
Mike Kelly hit what was scored a triple, but Grieve first misjudged
it badly, then let it bounce over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a triple bounce?'' wondered one irate teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters got out of that jam, but once the fans had gone
wild in the eighth when Boggs passed Babe Ruth on the career hit
chart, Tampa Bay was off and running for a four-run rally that left
the A's with that familiar kick-to-the-gut feeling. It only got
worse when fans pulled out the brooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw fans standing up with brooms, yelling `Sweep,''' A's
third baseman Mike Blowers said. ``If you're not embarrassed, you
don't have pride in what you do. I would hope everyone is
embarrassed.''

GIANTS GO ON ROAD IN TRADING MODE  
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The fickle finger of fate has deigned to give the
Giants a break. They will not have to face left-hander Carlos
Perez, the ace of the Montreal pitching staff, in a three-game
series beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perez suffered a broken nose in an auto accident Sunday night,
but his turn in the rotation would not have come up against San
Francisco anyway.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants visit Canada in search of victories, general
manager Brian Sabean will be itching to fire his not-so-fickle
trigger-finger on one or two more deals to bolster the Giants'
sagging chances of winning the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   How convenient it would be if the Giants could leave for
Philadelphia on Thursday night with Perez on their team plane,
ready to face the Phillies in the first of four games on Friday
night, assuming Perez is able to pitch with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen? Probably not. Is it out of the question? Not
necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's trading deadline looming, many of the dozen or so
teams still in the wild-card hunt will be searching for pitching
help, and Perez is the best catch out there. Forget his 7-10
record, a product of playing for the worst run-producing team in
the National League. He is a tough strikeout pitcher who could be
the No.1 starter on many staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The payroll-conscious Expos usually try to trade players who
figure to get a big raise the following season, in return for good
prospects. Perez is making $1.5 million this year and figures to
get a hefty raise this winter as an arbitration-eligible player.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos reportedly are looking for young outfielders, and the
Giants have several they could dangle, including Dante Powell.
</P>
<P>
   But some baseball people believe the Expos are not in their
usual hurry to deal. They have slashed their payroll so low, to $9
million, they could probably afford the bump in Perez's salary for
1999. Furthermore, the Expos are trying to gain public support for
a new ballpark, and trading their best pitcher could hurt the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Word is, the Expos are willing to trade Perez, but only if they
are bowled over by an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean will not go to Montreal. Rather, he will stay in San
Francisco and work the phones, no doubt talking to the Expos about
Perez, the Cardinals about Todd Stottlemyre and Brian Jordan, the
Royals about Tim Belcher, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But Sabean said the market is so full of buyers and short of
sellers, teams with pitchers to deal are seeking outrageous
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're shopping at Neiman Marcus,'' he said. ``Teams
are highbrow about what they want in return, or they're really not
sure what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, sources said, the Giants were interested in
Cincinnati right fielder Reggie Sanders before they dealt for Joe
Carter last week. But the Reds were asking for top pitching
prospects Jason Grilli and/or Scott Linebrink in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were not about to part with young pitchers on their
untouchables list for an injury-prone .260 hitter who has a $3.7
million contract for next season. They told the Reds to lower their
sights, the Reds refused, so the Giants dealt for Carter instead.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the market imbalance, Sabean predicts fewer impact
deals than usual before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a situation where you may see more action after
July 31,'' Sabean said. ``You may see, especially in our wild-card
race, there won't be five or six teams still in contention when
August 31 rolls around. Things may open up then.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, deals still can be made after Friday, but the players
must clear waivers first. August 31 becomes a second key deadline,
because players must be on a team's roster by then to be eligible
for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Trades or no trades, this is an important time for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   After their three games in Montreal, they play four at
Philadelphia and three at New York, two teams entwined in the
wild-card race with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're due for a good road trip, especially after the last
one,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ``We're due for one of those
monster road trips you have once or twice a season that set your
whole year up.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Giants will see the Phillies for the first time is one
of the more bizarre aspects of this year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird, this late in the season,'' Baker said. ``This is
something I haven't experienced before.''

PERRY EXPECTED TO LEAVE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rod Perry Jr., one of the most sought-after high
school football players two years ago, is expected to announce he
is transferring from USC this week to concentrate on a baseball
career.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Jr., the son of former Rams cornerback Rod Perry, has
already contacted Cal State Fullerton about enrolling and playing
baseball next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very concerned about his two knee surgeries,'' USC
baseball coach Mike Gillespie said. ``Rod has approached us about
his concern with continuing with football.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said he already spoke with Fullerton coach George
Horton and Perry has also been in contact with the school.
</P>
<P>
   Perry wanted to remain at USC, but Gillespie does not have any
available baseball scholarships for the coming school year.
</P>
<P>
   Perry met with USC football coach Paul Hackett on Monday, and
said he would make an announcement within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every indication is he will not be with us,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, a star wide receiver at Mater Dei High School, was a
unanimous prep All-American. He also played baseball and was
drafted in the 37th round by the Baltimore Orioles his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   But he has had two knee operations in the past three years, and
redshirted last season at USC after undergoing knee surgery for
torn ligaments. He also missed part of his junior year at Mater Dei
with a similar operation.
</P>
<P>
   Perry recovered from the surgery and was an occasional starter
on USC's national championship baseball team this spring. He batted
.250 and played center field.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves USC vulnerable at wide receiver: Windrell
Hayes, a JC transfer, is currently facing felony charges and his
status is uncertain while leading receiver R. Jay Soward has been
suspended for the season-opener against Purdue.

   John Dugdale lives on one of New York City's prettiest streets,
an avenue lined with lazy trees and hundred-year-old townhouses.
The Chelsea skyline is visible through the conservatory of his
top-floor apartment, where turn-of-the-century Americana sits next
to his collection of antique glass and porcelain. It's so
beautiful, it's a pity he can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale is almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him how much sight he has and he makes an eye shape with his
thumb and forefinger, poking through the bottom with the tip of his
pinky. ``Oh, about that much in one eye,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1993 and 1994 I lost more than three quarters of my
sight; I have a little bit out of the bottom of my left eye, but
it's very blurry,'' Dugdale adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale recently returned from two weeks in Britain, where he
completed almost 100 landscape and interior compositions. The
results will be a show called Nature and Spirit, opening in London
this fall before moving to New York's Wessel and O'Connor Gallery
in November.
</P>
<P>
   After also exhibiting this year in Rome and Sydney, Dugdale
reflects that losing his sight propelled him from being just
another commercial photographer for magazines like Vogue and Martha
Stewart Living to an internationally recognized artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tested HIV positive in 1985, but I was always very
healthy,'' says Dugdale. ``I thought it was the end of my
commercial career, but as a way to make my family feel better, I
said: 'Don't worry, I'll be a great, blind, art photographer.' They
were surprised that I said it and so was I, because it was the
first time I verbalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As his sight dwindled, Dugdale came to rely on the help of
assistants to focus his camera and set up shots. For composition he
uses intuition and memory of other artwork, often putting himself
in the pictures so he gets the right pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely have a full, clear visual picture of everything
that I photograph,'' he says. ``That really starts inside my head,
because eyesight and vision are completely different. I felt very
happy and safe when I realized my vision was totally intact. It's
just that my mechanical sight isn't working as well as it used
to,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Able to make out dim outlines of buildings or natural features
in strong daylight, Dugdale relies on touch to establish details
like texture. Once he has felt an object or studied part of it with
a magnifying glass, he explains, he sees it in his mind. ``I can
tell from the light and the objects shape and from the 100
questions that I ask people who are with me what is in front of me,
and then I compose the shot in a very geometric way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Describing things to people, when they're doing the framing
for me, I have to break it down to the utterly simplest kind of
composition, because that's what people understand,'' Dugdale says.
``You can't really communicate a photographic style or an eye to
people, but what happened was the simplicity of the photographs
turned into their style.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't stopped traveling, but the limitations of blindness
mean much of his work concentrates on immediately available
subjects, such as family, his upstate New York home and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic, almost timeless feel of his art which two
years ago attracted the attention of New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art. Associate Curator of Photography Malcolm Daniel was
involved with the decision to acquire a photograph of Dugdale's
house, shot outdoors and inverted through the lens of a
19th-century glass vase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photograph expresses something about photography itself,
and the way that the world that we've created is reflected through
art,'' says Daniel. ``What particularly appealed to us about this
was the element of self-referentiality it seemed to be about
photography, and about light and images, and the way the vase
itself acts as a lens to show the wider world that you don't
actually see in the camera itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel denies that Dugdale, as a blind photographer, is a
novelty act. ``It's not like the person who paints with their toes,
where you say, 'Isn't it remarkable for somebody who doesn't have
hands to be able to do that just with their feet?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His deteriorating eyesight makes Dugdale more conscious of
trying to capture certain effects of light and shadow which are
essential to his work.
</P>
<P>
   And he's clear on the meaning of that work. ``My pictures are so
accessible. They're about sadness, joy, beauty, death, life. All
perfectly straightforward, unfettered emotions,'' he says,
admitting to having run the gamut of those emotions himself.
</P>
<P>
   As AIDS began eroding his life, he admits, fear gave way to
depression. ``I've had the experience of being lost in my own front
</P>
<P>
   yard at my house in upstate New York. Most people have some
ambient vision,'' Dugdale says, ``they can pick up shapes in the
dark but as I lost my sight I would be plunged into total blackness
when the sun went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only found the house by throwing pebbles and listening to
where the sound came back from,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Lengthening Shadows Before Nightfall,'' was
published in 1994 and dealt with his feelings as doctors gave him
less than a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a specific message in the book but there was a
sense of calm and tranquillity, because after struggling with the
disease, I had to prepare to pass away,'' Dugdale says. ``Every
time my friends and family came I had to say goodbye to them. At
first I was hysterical, but then towards the end of it I realized
there wasn't anything I could do by being insane, so I relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's health improved with new therapies and the book was a
success, drawing attention for his use of techniques and equipment
more at home in a history book than the studio of a contemporary
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive blue of his work is the result of making
cyanotypes, a ferrous-metal developing process pioneered in 1842.
``I'd like to close out this century with the biggest body of
cyanotypes that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that process, Dugdale uses a 1912 camera in the field
and shoots studio work with a 250-pound, 63-year-old behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's method has been such a success that his work commands
up to $6,000 a print. As well as being in the permanent collection
of the Metropolitan, his patrons include Elton John, who hosted him
on his recent visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale used John's estate as a base during his visit. From
there he photographed English landmarks including Stonehenge.
Printing a self-portrait taken on Britain's south coast, near a
cliff called Beachy Head, Dugdale was struck by his unconscious
choice of composition, a new theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beachy Head picture is so much about the precipice, and
interestingly I didn't place myself on the edge of it,'' he says.
``I'm standing away, looking inland. Without getting too
psycho-interpretive, that's a telling thing. I'm feeling present
here and not on the edge anymore.''

itself acts as a lens to show the wider world that you don't
actually see in the camera itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel denies that Dugdale, as a blind photographer, is a
novelty act. ``It's not like the person who paints with their toes,
where you say, 'Isn't it remarkable for somebody who doesn't have
hands to be able to do that just with their feet?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His deteriorating eyesight makes Dugdale more conscious of
trying to capture certain effects of light and shadow which are
essential to his work.
</P>
<P>
   And he's clear on the meaning of that work. ``My pictures are so
accessible. They're about sadness, joy, beauty, death, life. All
perfectly straightforward, unfettered emotions,'' he says,
admitting to having run the gamut of those emotions himself.
</P>
<P>
   As AIDS began eroding his life, he admits, fear gave way to
depression. ``I've had the experience of being lost in my own front
</P>
<P>
   yard at my house in upstate New York. Most people have some
ambient vision,'' Dugdale says, ``they can pick up shapes in the
dark but as I lost my sight I would be plunged into total blackness
when the sun went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only found the house by throwing pebbles and listening to
where the sound came back from,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Lengthening Shadows Before Nightfall,'' was
published in 1994 and dealt with his feelings as doctors gave him
less than a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a specific message in the book but there was a
sense of calm and tranquillity, because after struggling with the
disease, I had to prepare to pass away,'' Dugdale says. ``Every
time my friends and family came I had to say goodbye to them. At
first I was hysterical, but then towards the end of it I realized
there wasn't anything I could do by being insane, so I relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's health improved with new therapies and the book was a
success, drawing attention for his use of techniques and equipment
more at home in a history book than the studio of a contemporary
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive blue of his work is the result of making
cyanotypes, a ferrous-metal developing process pioneered in 1842.
``I'd like to close out this century with the biggest body of
cyanotypes that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that process, Dugdale uses a 1912 camera in the field
and shoots studio work with a 250-pound, 63-year-old behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's method has been such a success that his work commands
up to $6,000 a print. As well as being in the permanent collection
of the Metropolitan, his patrons include Elton John, who hosted him
on his recent visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale used John's estate as a base during his visit. From
there he photographed English landmarks including Stonehenge.
Printing a self-portrait taken on Britain's south coast, near a
cliff called Beachy Head, Dugdale was struck by his unconscious
choice of composition, a new theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beachy Head picture is so much about the precipice, and
interestingly I didn't place myself on the edge of it,'' he says.
``I'm standing away, looking inland. Without getting too
psycho-interpretive, that's a telling thing. I'm feeling present
here and not on the edge anymore.''

 &HT;    Struggling African American booksellers are victims of their own
success
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A youthful woman quietly hands out square stickers
with penciled numbers to people arriving at the evening reading by
award-winning author Gloria Naylor at the Shrine of the Black
Madonna Bookstore and Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   Customers talk softly about Naylor's books, especially her first
one. ``The Women of Brewster Place,'' told in the voices of urban
African American women, earned Naylor literary acclaim, including
the National Book Award in 1984. Later, Naylor would tell her fans
that her new novel ``The Men of Brewster Place'' will be her final
words about the fictional street.
</P>
<P>
   It's Naylor's last night in Texas. A few hours earlier in a
hotel lobby, the tall, quiet author said the book signing and
reading would have been impossible 15 years ago. Then, there was no
thought of a book tour _ national, regional or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My publisher felt there wasn't an audience for the book,''
Naylor said about ``The Women of Brewster Place.'' These days,
Naylor's books are published by Hyperion.
</P>
<P>
   Houston marks the 11th stop on Naylor's 18-city book tour. Her
appearances have featured an array of bookstores, chain and
independent, niche-market and general-interest. Her readings in
Texas were exclusively at black bookstores, something that couldn't
have happened back in the early 1980s because most of them didn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, African American bookstores have
flourished and faltered. They've provided a valuable service to
their communities by providing an outlet for African American
writings that were hard to find at mainstream bookstores, by aiding
the fight against illiteracy, by buying books from small presses
and distributors and by giving once-emerging black authors, such as
Naylor and Terry McMillan, a chance by personally promoting their
early books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these niche-market bookstores must compete with the mammoth
chains that can offer money-making, brand-name authors at super
discount prices. Unfortunately, the stores are a victim of their
success; they helped turn obscure authors into popular mainstream
writers. If these stores disappear, it may be more difficult for
the next generation of writers to break into the market.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosalind Oliphant, owner of Folktales, opened her business
in February 1992, she said, ``it was real hard to come by an
African American book in Austin.'' She started with a cart in
Highland Mall. ``We broke records, every month. Austin was just
that hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   One competitor responded like this: ``They didn't even have a
pre-printed sign. They took a sheet of paper that said `black
literature' and put it in the plastic slot on the shelf,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliphant entered a market that Emma Rodgers of Dallas, the dean
of Texas African American booksellers, had been working for nearly
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s Rodgers went looking for party favors for her
son's birthday party. She wanted children's books that featured
positive images of African American children. She drove all over
Dallas, going from bookstore to bookstore, until she found them.
Her frustration eventually led to Black Images Book Bazaar. Its Web
site states that the business is ``the oldest black bookstore in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and a business partner started their enterprise in 1977,
as a home-based mail-order business. The retail store opened in
September 1986.
</P>
<P>
   As Black Images was expanding its retail space, bookstores in
Houston, Beaumont, Killeen and Arlington were opening their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Black Images' first big-name signing was acclaimed actress Ruby
Dee. There were times when authors demanded a bigger space and book
readings had to be held in neighborhood churches or public
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always bring in groups to help develop an audience,'' said
Rodgers, who recently held sold-out signings for singer Patti
LaBelle and BET host Tavis Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   These days Black Images is a must-stop for any African American
author on a book tour in the state. ``We're booked until
November,'' said Rodgers, who is on the board of directors of the
American Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with the chains
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers are in a David-and-Goliath battle with
national chains. At first the general interest stores watched their
profits decline; now it's the niche stores' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has finally crossed over into the black market,'' said
Manie Barron, associate editor at Random House and a specialist in
African American trade book sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally in the last year or so, many black bookstores have
closed, said Barron. If it's happening in America, it's happening
in Texas. Two stores have closed in Houston, another went under in
San Antonio and, in April, Austin's Just for Us closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted our life back,'' said Juanita Stephens, co-owner of
the former North Austin store. ``A small business is very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said she and her husband, Paul, plan to launch a
Web-based business they can operate from their home.
</P>
<P>
   The closings, Barron said, are coming at an ironic time. Sales
of books by black authors continue to go up; publishers are
releasing them in volume like never before and not just the
Naylors, Terry McMillans and Toni Morrisons.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly important player is the self-published author,
said Rodgers. ``They are vital to our business, next to the trade
(market) reps. They are our lifelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because successful self-published authors are working hard
to create a grass-roots buzz for their works, which in turn brings
customers through the doors and to the cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are books the mainstream bookstores are not going to
have. These are the books the distributors don't know exist.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rodgers, those self-published authors could be the future
brand-names that might sell out a book signing in a couple of
years. If you doubt her, she can tell you stories about the
then-unknown Terry McMillan, who wasn't self-published but who like
Naylor didn't have publisher-backed book tours with her early
books. Then there are the tales of New York Times best-selling
author E. Lynn Harris, Violet Crown winner Anita Richmond Bunkley
and Ella Patterson, a nonfiction author who landed a hefty book
deal. All three started their writing careers in self-publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black bookstore will always be here,'' said Rodgers. ``It
might not have the strong presence you have now, but it will be
there, serving the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding markets
</P>
<P>
   African American bookstores are moving outside the major Texas
cities. On West Jasper Road in Killeen is the 3,000 square-foot
bookstore Under One Roof. It's a rival in size to Black Images in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Babatunde went into the book business full-time after retiring
from the military. His main competition is the Fort Hood base
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry the crossover books, but I carry them all,'' he
said, noting that he offers a good-size selection of writings from
African authors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of the space is dedicated to books,
Babatunde said African artifacts and Afrocentric art keep the doors
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry all these other things to keep books on the shelf,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other booksellers intent on surviving say they are expanding
their markets, too. They're offering space for literacy classes,
writing workshops and book club meetings. They're cementing
relationships with schools. They're working conventions,
conferences and trade shows. They're working with the local prison
system so inmates can get books.
</P>
<P>
   In Texarkana, Alvester Gibson and his wife, Glenda, used to take
weekend road trips. They drove the 175-mile round trip to Dallas or
the 144-miles round trip to Little Rock or the 70-mile round trip
to Shreveport. All the excursions were for the same purpose: buying
African American books.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, these bibliophiles parked the car and opened
House of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw our customers from a 75-mile radius,'' said Gibson.
``We're providing a need for this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing Naylor's evening
</P>
<P>
   Naylor is a former missionary for the Jehovah's Witnesses. She
knows how to hold an audience, make her point and then become
silent. She doesn't waste words, not in speech or in print. ``The
Men of Brewster Place'' is a slim novel of less than 180 pages. Her
shortest book in some years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters had said enough and wanted to sit down,'' says
Naylor. Will she return to Brewster Place in the future? ``No,''
she says. ``There will be no children, no pets of Brewster Place.
We have closed that chapter on Brewster Place.'' As fans wait their
turn to talk with Naylor, they talk about black bookstores. ``It's
a nurturing center,'' says Alitash Tafui. ``We need more of them.
This place embraces our blackness; it fortifies you to go out into
the world.'' Nodding in agreement, DeAnn Collins says: ``It's the
smell. It's the music. It's the atmosphere.''

GRAZING BILL: NO PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With tiresome regularity, Congress drafts new grazing bills that
favor agricultural interests _ to the detriment of our public
lands. This year's giveaway applies to public lands managed by the
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Misleadingly entitled ``The Forage Improvement Act'' (HR 2493),
forage is the last thing that will be improved by the bill. It has
already passed the U.S. House and now faces Senate committee
action.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, although 270 million acres of public lands are
involved, there will be no hearings or public testimony in the
Senate. There were no legislative hearings in House committees,
either. Congress doesn't want to hear any comments from the public
about the public's land. The message is, ``Shut up. We'll give away
your rights on public lands, and you'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced in the House last year by Rep. Bob
Smith, R-Ore., who from 1995 through 1996 received $183,502 or 42
percent of his campaign contributions from agricultural interests.
It's clear that this legislation has been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Federal grazing fees under this forage bill formula remain well
below state and private grazing fees schedules. There is no minimum
fee in the new complex formula. Current grazing fees on federal
land do not cover the government's cost for managing the grazing
program. This bill makes the problem worse. Taxpayers will have to
pick up the tab _ to the tune of $500 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The forage bill will subsidize billionaire livestock owners like
William Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard and Oscar Wyatt, founder and CEO
of Coastal Corp., the nation's 12th largest oil company. It will
subsidize corporate cattle operations like those of Metropolitan
Life and Anheuser-Busch. Nine percent of the grazing permittees
control 60 percent of the forage on public lands. It's the rich who
are supported with taxpayer dollars in this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, HR 2493 prohibits members of the public
from monitoring their own public lands _ if those lands are leased
for grazing. If a hunter or sportsman sees the destruction of
riparian or wetlands areas, and he or she reports it, that
information cannot be used by the federal agency that is supposed
to oversee the public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service and the BLM do not have the personnel to
monitor the millions of acres used for grazing. These agencies
depend upon information provided by hikers, hunters, anglers,
university researchers, and environmental groups. HR 2493 only
allows federal agencies, lessees and permittees, and their paid
consultants to provide monitoring information to the federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpaying public subsidizes those who have grazing leases
and permits on the public lands, but the taxpaying public isn't
allowed to monitor those lands.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the forage bill restrict who can monitor the
public lands used for grazing, it requires the federal agencies to
``provide reasonable notice of the monitoring to affected
permittees or lessees ... of not less than 48 hours.'' No other
public land user gets such notice _ not mining companies, not oil
companies, not those who hunt or fish or camp on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Any bank robber would love to have 48-hour notice before police
monitored his activities. Most ranchers take care of their grazing
leases, but for those who don't, the 48-hour rule is an opportunity
to temporarily suspend or alter practices that harm fish and
wildlife or the land itself.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring section of HR 2493 prohibits federal agencies
from taking action even when there are severe problems or threats
to fish and wildlife unless the agencies have multiple years of
data collected over time that show poor management practices by a
permittee or lessee.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the bill calls for ``an allotment management
plan'' on public lands on which grazing permits or grazing leases
have been granted. ``Allotment'' is a share or portion given out of
a common holding, according to ``Black's Law Dictionary.'' The
language of the bill nudges a permit or lease into ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle way, the forage bill creates a grazing right where
there should only be a privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The allotment management plan would allow livestock to graze
unsupervised and uncontrolled _ even if public lands were seriously
damaged by overgrazing.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear why Congress has not held public hearings on
HR 2493.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Wald, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, calls this bill ``an attempt to turn back the clock to the
days when the livestock operators and permittees were calling the
shots on the public lands and the public was totally out of the
loop.''
</P>
<P>
   This grazing bill, if passed, will only lead to more acrimony
and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt sent a letter to Rep.
Smith in February saying that the Department of the Interior would
recommend that the president veto the House version of the grazing
bill. Since the Senate bill is exactly the same, the threat of veto
remains.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better for everyone if this bill died quietly in the
Senate.

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Checking quality of your phone line a matter of a
call
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As expected, I got a number of e-mails after the
column in which I tried to help a correspondent with his concerns
over whether his telephone line would be acceptable for 56k bps
modems.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, most of them corrected me on several points, the
simplest thing being that I got an acronym wrong. It should be
ADSL. Not ASDL.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful info came in messages informing me there is
indeed a way Bob Wildaus can check the quality of his telephone
line. I'm going to give primary credit to Jerry A. Smith of Smyrna,
because his message had the most details.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, now the parent company of U.S. Robotics, has a telephone
number you can call to check your phone line's acceptability for
56K operations. You can find out a lot about X2 technology and v.90
at 3Com's Web site at http://www.3com.com. However, I had to do a
lot of poking around to find details on the line checker, so to
save other folks the necessity of all that, I'm going to repeat the
routine here.
</P>
<P>
   First off, you don't get to this function through the Internet.
You'll need to use an ordinary communications program (remember
them?) to accomplish the task. HyperTerminal, the program built
into Windows 95's accessory package, will work fine.
</P>
<P>
   The number to call is 847-262-6000. This is not toll-free.
</P>
<P>
   This will connect you to a bulletin-board type of system. It
will ask you if your system supports graphics. I made the mistake
of answering yes, and the result was not pretty. Just hit enter,
which conveys a ``no'' to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will ask you for your first name. Type: line and press
enter.
</P>
<P>
   Logically enough, it will then ask for your last name, which
should be: test and press enter. Got it? If you want a line test,
your name is line test. I have no idea what will happen if you give
it your right name.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, that's all you need to do. Some invisible
diagnostics will be run, and a report will come back. If your line
is adequate, it will say so, and if you want to see a lot of
statistics about your line, press enter. When you're done, press g
for goodbye and hit enter.
</P>
<P>
   If you get ``Your line does not support 56k technology,'' hit g
and enter. 3Com recommends making several calls over a period of
time to be sure of an accurate report.
</P>
<P>
   If the report is ``Cannot determine 56k capability, test must
run in v.34 mode,'' this indicates noise or static on the line, a
good reason to complain to the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible responses, but these are the ones that
would appear to pertain to home telephone lines. For more
information on using the test, point your Web browser to http://
</P>
<P>
   www.3com.com/56k/need4_56k
</P>
<P>
   /linetest.html.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for another persistent query, this from folks trying to
make calls within the Atlanta area's overburdened phone system. I
think I've answered this before, but here goes again:
</P>
<P>
   To set up your fax calling, or whatever kind of calling, to dial
within an area code such as 404 or 770 without the software
insisting on sticking a ``1'' in front of it, simply enter all the
digits in the space for the number, like this: 4045551212.
Disregard the space for the area code; leave it blank.
</P>
<P>
   This works on every system I've tried.

 &HT;    Pope's visit to Cuba inspiration for other religions
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The synagogue has an aerobics instructor, but no rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Temple dues _ which can run $1,000 a year in South Florida _ are
five cents a month.
</P>
<P>
   As with most everything else in Cuba, Judaism survives on this
tropical island by sacrifice and invention. The Sephardic Hebrew
Center uses its community room for aerobics, dance classes and
weight training, earning a few dollars for the upkeep of the
44-year-old building.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis left Cuba along with 90 percent of the Jewish
population after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro. While
visiting rabbis come several times a year for bar mitzvahs,
weddings and conversions, weekly services are performed by lay
members, said Jose Levy, synagogue president.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Jewish community's long isolation may be nearing an
end, thanks in part to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a delegation of 32 Jews from South Florida, including
Cuban Americans, will travel to Cuba on a six-day reconciliation
mission with their Jewish brethren. The visit is the first trip to
Cuba organized by the Greater Miami Jewish Federation in nearly
four decades, according to an official with the American Jewish
Joint Distribution Committee in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul's visit to Cuba in January broke down barriers
for all religions, said Will Recant, the committee's special
projects director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's visit played a large role in enabling these
relationships to be renewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is paying for a $250,000 restoration of Havana's
main synagogue, the crumbling Temple Beth Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   The project won approval four months ago from the U.S. Treasury
Department, which enforces the U.S. embargo against Cuba, Recant
said. Donations for the restoration came primarily from South
Florida Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews in Havana welcome the support.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-based Jewish Solidarity Inc. reports that it has been
delivering medicines and food to Cuba for the last five years, but
receives only limited support from people in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, of the Sephardic Hebrew Center, said Miami Cubans have for
years turned their backs on Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the Cuban Jewish community in Miami thinks we
are in bed with Castro,'' said Levy, 59.
</P>
<P>
   While the temples have not been as outspoken against the Castro
government as other religious groups, Levy said Jews have won new
freedoms over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Levy's temple sued the Cuban government to evict
a state-operated cultural office from the temple. The Cuban courts
sided with the temple, freeing space for the congregation's
community room.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Cuban Jews won the right to comply with Aliyah,
the Israeli law that grants citizenship to Jews in the diaspora. So
far, about 160 Jews have emigrated to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, whose parents came to Cuba from Turkey in the 1920s, said
he has no plans to emigrate, because his 90-year-old mother and
nine-year-old daughter live in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried once before to leave, in 1980. Since he worked
for 20 years as a chief officer in the Cuban merchant marine, the
Cuban government denied him permission to leave Cuba, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's synagogue is one of three in Havana, a city of 2.2
million. Levy said only 1,050 Jews are left in the capital and only
a third go to temple regularly. Nationwide, about 1,500 Jews remain
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's trip to Havana will be led by Jacob Solomon,
executive vice president of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation,
who is making his first trip to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His delegation's mission is to provide spiritual, material and
``moral support for our brothers and sisters in Cuba,'' Solomon
said. The group plans to take religious and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Those invited to be part of the delegation are major
contributors to federation fund-raising programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going with independent agendas,'' said Solomon. No
meetings are planned with Cuban government officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit signals changing attitudes in Miami's exile community,
said John Fischer, a Boca Raton businessman who has delivered
supplies to the temple being restored. Fischer, who spent his early
childhood in Havana, said the temple's broken windows and bird
nests in the rafters disturbed his memories of the once elegant
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' Fischer said of the visit. ``We
are finally seeing the Cuban hardline in Miami starting to bend a
little bit.''

 &HT;    Tabloids spoon believers weekly dose of paranormal
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some results of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Southern
Focus Poll may bring smiles of recognition to readers of
supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable minority of respondents believe in UFOs, ghosts,
extraterrestrials and psychic healing. An even greater number place
credence in devil possession, superstitions and ESP.
</P>
<P>
   These topics, mostly ignored or ridiculed in the mainstream
media, have long been staples in the weeklies sold near checkout
lines. These papers' content combines a high CQ -- cosmic quotient
-- with grocery store gospel -- news of weeping Madonnas and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Sun, for example, predicted a great flood in a cover
spread labeled ``Bible Prophecies Come True.'' In other stories, it
asserted that ``demonic possessions have risen to plaguelike
proportions'' and that there is ``a frightening rash of UFO
sightings throughout North America.'' It linked Mother Teresa to a
bleeding crucifix in Calcutta, India, and ran an ad for a prayer
with an ``ironclad guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The AJC poll suggests that such topics do resonate with large
numbers. History suggests this has long been the case. Supermarket
tabloids' content can be traced at least as far back as English
``broadside ballads,'' published in the 16th to 19th centuries.
These were rhymed compositions, often about crimes, public hangings
or cosmic phenomenons, printed on a single sheet, to be sung and
sold in the street. The broadsides were often illustrated with
woodcut prints of their subjects: a pigheaded woman, ghosts
walking, a woman possessed.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys categorized broadside
themes in 10 categories, which have endured through the centuries
to our tabloid era. These include devotion and morality; ``history
-- true and fabulous''; tragedy, including judgments of God; and
``love fortunate'' and ``love unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, supermarket tabloids' CQ seems to be
declining. Not too many years ago, stories about hauntings, UFO
sightings and miracles were common in The National Enquirer, the
nation's best-selling and best-known tab. Recently, however, the
Enquirer has tended more toward Hollywood phenoms than heavenly
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is not likely to be filled by the mainstream daily
press, despite the recent surge in coverage of religion, faith and
values. These pages and sections are more apt to cite ordained
ministers than doomsday specialists.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the archetypal news of cosmic mystery will
go unreported. The void, one suspects, will largely be filled by
the Internet, home of niche interests. UFO Web sites feature photos
and videos of sightings, interviews with abductees, reports,
articles and much more, including 52 indicators of UFO encounters
or alien abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Exclamation-point headlines being the staple of supermarket
tabloids, let me predict this one: World Wide Web to Go Cosmic!!!
That prognostication, be warned, does not come with an ironclad
guarantee.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Some people always fret about the wrong things
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I take after my namesake, my Great Uncle
Bill, a man who had only a nodding acquaintance with reality and
who delighted in worrying about improbable things.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he worried himself sick about meteorites and
avoided going outside during the peak of meteor showers. On the
other hand, he spent most of his working life in the logging fields
of the Pacific Northwest, during a place and a time when the term
``widow maker'' was coined for cutting a tree down in a careless
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're like me and my Uncle Bill when it comes to
computers and the Internet, spending more time worrying about the
meteorites of computing and not enough time about the widow makers.
Let's talk today about what's worth worrying about and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with some things that lots of people worry about but
probably shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Topping my list are viruses. I don't mean that viruses are a
myth. They're real. But unless you spend a great deal of time
exchanging software with friends and downloading programs from the
Internet, viruses don't present a great threat. And, even for folks
in these high-risk categories, an up-to-date anti-virus program
will usually catch the infected programs that come your way.
</P>
<P>
   Next on my list are folks who avoid buying something over the
Internet because they fear a hacker will steal their credit card
information. Many of these are the same folks who feel perfectly
comfortable handing their credit card to the perfect _ and
sometimes not-so-perfect _ strangers who wait on them at the store
and in restaurants. It's the same with e-mail. Sure, it's possible
to break into an e-mail account (we'll talk about ways to protect
yourself in a bit), but most of us have outdoor unlocked mailboxes
for the checks and personal letters that arrive every day.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Internet grows and as computers become more popular,
there are things that you should worry about. Let's talk some about
what those legitimate worries are and how to protect yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At the very top of my list of things to worry about is the pure
certainty that _ sooner or later _ your hard disk will die. It's a
mechanical device and, if it had a tattoo, the tattoo would say:
``Born to die.'' Since the hard disk probably contains important
e-mail and e-mail addresses, and data about family finances and
business projects, you should learn how to back up your data.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when hard disks were smaller, floppy disks
could be used to make copies of your critical information. But as
hard disks have grown, most of us need a tape backup system (you'll
find plenty of them for $200 or less) or a Zip drive (even
cheaper). You needn't worry about backing up Windows or most of
your programs. You can simply reinstall them using the original
disks (CDs in most cases). But you should regularly back up the
data you create.
</P>
<P>
   Next on my list of potential problems is the way most people
treat passwords. Many of us have to juggle three or four passwords
nowadays _ we're logging on to an Internet service at home, to the
computer system at work, and perhaps to three or four
password-protected Web sites. Being human, we like to keep things
simple. So many people make passwords easy by using the name of a
child, or a spouse, or their own telephone number. I strongly
encourage you to use a password that contains both letters and
numbers. Then avoid telling anyone _ in person or online _ what
that password is.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and this is the best advice you'll ever get about
computers and computing: Avoid following the advice of untried
experts. Nowadays, there are dozens of computer experts at work, at
your church and among your closest friends. Mostly these are nice
people who mean well but who feel compelled to either tell you how
to adjust your computer for maximum performance or fix it when it
is broken. Many of the saddest stories I hear are from people who
decided to tune up their computer based on help from this kind of
expert.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, they ended up with a computer that was fixed so
completely that it didn't work at all.

 &HT;    Tech Report: A new VCR for non-techies
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe you have gotten used to that blinking 12:00 on
your videocassette recorder, but you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you could be getting a lot more out of a VCR. You could
have something easy to use, easy to program and chock-full of neat
features. Of course, you may have to buy a new one to replace the
one that's blinking.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, we were so relieved to have a machine that could play
movies at home we didn't much care whether we could ever figure out
how to program it to record television shows. And for those
persistent souls _ or Georgia Tech engineers _ who actually figured
out how to program VCRs, well, everything else was gravy.
</P>
<P>
   But, finally, the manufacturers are coming around.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the makers of VCRs are offering easy-to-use
features aimed at non-techies, while packing more technology into
the box. For example, the Zenith VRA423, which retails for $240,
comes with four heads. The one blinking in your living room may
have just two. Double the heads should mean better audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   Like most current VCRs, the VRA423 comes with a feature that
sets your machine to record using the code that runs with most
television listings. The VRA423 also has automatic tracking, an
automatic head cleaner and a feature for letting you skip
commercials on playback. You can view recordings in slow motion.
Want to see that Chipper Jones homer again? How about Uncle Peter's
wedding?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps best of all for the technologically challenged, the
machine comes with a feature called SpeakEZTM _ voice-directed,
on-screen instructions for programming, adjusting the picture and
searching a tape.
</P>
<P>
   It will even explain how to set the clock so it doesn't blink.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out the Zenith site on the Web
(http://www.zenith
</P>
<P>
   .com).
</P>
<P>
   Portable Net music
</P>
<P>
   It's like the Sony Walkman, a palm-size device you can use to
amuse or entertain yourself, listening to the pounding beat or the
classical strings or maybe Toni Morrison reading. It can also plug
in to your home or car stereo. But it does not play a compact disc
or cassette.
</P>
<P>
   And it would like to be the future of portable music.
</P>
<P>
   It's called MPMan. The device, made by NullSoft, is designed to
handle the audio increasingly available off the Internet. You
transfer the files from your personal computer to MPMan.
</P>
<P>
   MPMan uses the MPEG 3 form of compression for handling audio off
the Internet, a technique capable of compressing data up to a dozen
times. The machine uses a built-in 32- or 64-megabyte flash card.
The device costs between $250 and $500 and comes with a docking bay
that connects to your PC, a carrying case, rechargeable batteries,
and the appropriate software for transferring PC to MPMan and for
playing MP3 files on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, MPEC compression is also good for making illegal copies of
music, something that ``is making the recording industry soil
itself with fear,'' as Wired magazine so indelicately put it.
``Still some legal MP3 music is floating around the Web; in time,
this may become the indie-rock distribution channel of choice.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Fishing reels go high-tech
</P>
<P>
   A technologist looks at everything and wonders: How can this be
better?
</P>
<P>
   Even the devices that symbolize a life apart from flashing
lights and beeping gizmos, and time spent far from the rush of a
high-tech world. Yes, even fishing reels. For proof, see that even
a fishing reel is high-tech enough for Wired magazine's July issue.
The new Model 8500 fly-fishing reel from Charlton Outdoor
Technologies is designed to take fishing to new levels.
Technologically speaking, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Engineered by Jack Charlton _ who worked for three decades in
the aerospace industry _ the reel's drag system is made of carbon
fiber, the same material used in B-2 bomber brakes, says Wired. The
result is a line tension that is stunningly smooth. At $3,600, it
isn't for the casual fisherman. But fishing is about something much
more elevated than mere economics, anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, visit the Web site
(http://www.fishdoc.com).
</P>
<P>
   Fingers do the talking
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer has recently unveiled a fingerprint
identification technology meant to protect computers from unwanted
use. The product, meant primarily for small businesses, will cost
about $100 and be available in August. Only the right set of
fingerprints would be able to log on to the computer. For more
information, call Compaq (1-800-OK-COMPAQ) or visit the company Web
site (http://www.compaq.com).
</P>
<P>
   Speak no evil
</P>
<P>
   Talking is an important part of the job for a lot of
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A certain breed _ especially doctors and lawyers _ spend a lot
of time talking to tape recorders, making tapes that must later be
transcribed. Turning the tapes into briefs, reports and letters is
a time-consuming and costly process.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon Systems suggests a shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of voice recognition software has continually
improved. But voice recognition from companies like upstart Dragon
and mighty IBM has mostly been built for personal computers. The
systems allow a user to sit at the desktop and talk into a PC. But
what about the wandering professional _ the lawyer dictating
letters in his car, the doctor making notes while on her rounds?
</P>
<P>
   Dragon will market a hand-held digital system for speech
recognition that uses the minidisc player-recorder from Sony. A
user creates the text by speaking into the minidisc recorder.
Later, the recording can be transcribed by Dragon software.
Dragon's mobile system will be on the market in August, with a
price tag of about $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Dragon Systems or visit the company
Web site (http://www.naturalspeech.com). For IBM products, start at
the company Web site (http://www.ibm.com).
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Wired magazine suggests a word to describe the
mistakes that a voice recognition system makes. You can't say typo,
because it involves no typing. So what is a mis-transcribed word?
</P>
<P>
   A speako.

 &HT;    Drip by drip, Austin's water slips away
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Patty Thomas thought she was conservative with water,
maybe even frugal, until the phone rang and she got news she never
imagined she'd hear about her West Lynn Street house.
</P>
<P>
   The home was the 10th-largest residential water user in all of
Austin last year, a City of Austin utility employee told Thomas.
Her jaw dropped, a reaction shared by others who heard they were
among the largest water consumers in the nation's 22nd-largest city
_ now under voluntary water restrictions thanks to this summer's
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not flagrantly pouring water all over the place,''
Thomas said. She said a leaky underground sprinkler system on their
1-acre lot in West Austin is the reason they used 1,246,200 gallons
last year _ more than four times as much water a month as the
average family of four. The Thomases limit their teen-age son to
10-minute showers, run sprinklers just 15 minutes and try to save
water to the extent that ``I don't even flush the toilet every time
I go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's top water users, both residential and commercial, say
they try to conserve. But though they cut back, they still use
enough water to fill at least 15 swimming pools a month.
</P>
<P>
   Several top users said they conserve by watering only twice a
week. But that's still more than Austin's 150,000 water customers
are allowed under the city's voluntary water conservation measures.
The city asks that residents water only once every five days.
</P>
<P>
   The list of top water users was provided by the City of Austin
utilities department under state open records laws.
</P>
<P>
   Thirsty chips
</P>
<P>
   At Motorola, where water is crucial to the chip-making process,
technicians are working on a $1.5 million project to recycle 60
percent of the water the company uses. Motorola currently recycles
20 percent of the water it uses to rinse electronic parts between
each of the 120 steps it takes to build a chip. If it can recycle
more, the company can cut overall water use by 50 percent within
three years, said Asanga Weerakoon, Motorola's director of
environmental safety and industrial hygiene. Motorola was Austin's
top commercial water user in 1996-97, draining 1.9 billion gallons.
</P>
<P>
   A parched Austin is 5.63 inches below normal rainfall for the
year. After recording only 1.56 inches of rain in June, Austin has
seen just .9 inches this month.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the drought, Motorola has been using rainwater
collected in its retention pond to water the grass and turning up
office thermostats to use less water in cooling towers that power
the air conditioning. Other big users are trying somewhat similar
methods to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas, which ranked third-highest among
commercial water users in 1996-97, collects water used in
professors' laboratories and classrooms and uses it in cooling
towers for air conditioning, said Miles Abernathy, an engineer in
the utilities and energy management department. The towers need
more water than the university can recycle, so Abernathy's
department is exploring whether it can afford to buy reclaimed
water _ wastewater that has been treated but isn't drinkable _from
the city to use in the cooling towers. If so, UT will cut down its
water consumption from the current 825 million gallons a year.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the No. 4 commercial water user last year, reuses 60
percent to 70 percent of its water, said Lynn Denton, a spokesman.
This year, IBM has had to buy extra water from Austin to irrigate
its grounds for construction projects, but the company usually
relies on nine wells it keeps on site, Denton said. Because water
conservation methods are built in to the company's operations, IBM
hasn't changed its routine for the drought, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies, however, have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cut watering 20 percent,'' said Rick Crawford, executive
director of the State Preservation Board, which maintains the St.
Augustine grass around the Capitol. They could've used a
less-thirsty type of grass, but picked St. Augustine because of its
beauty and lushness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, the Capitol grounds have been watered four days a
week, instead of five, with timed sprinklers soaking the grass 15
to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, the rest of Austin is asked to water
lawns only once every five days. Austin's current voluntary
restrictions become mandatory only if the city's 150,000 water
customers use 210 million gallons a day for three straight days or
215 million gallons on a single day. Usage hit record levels
Saturday, with 202 million gallons, and Sunday, with 205 million
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol also uses low-flow toilets and sink faucets that
activate only when someone's hands are directly under the nozzle,
so water can't be wasted, Crawford said. Across the street, the
Governor's Mansion grounds get water every day, but by zones, so
the same area isn't watered more than three times a week, said
administrator Anne DeBois.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford didn't know how much water it takes to keep the Capitol
grounds lush, because the water bill lists everything from grass
maintenance to toilets and water fountains inside the building. A
$7.9 million renovation project that included redoing the grounds
was completed in 1997, so keeping the grass healthy is as much an
investment as source of pride for the symbol of Texas government,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lush lawns
</P>
<P>
   Roy A. Butler, a former Austin mayor, understands pride in a
yard. His Niles Road estate is a paradise of lushness, with green
St. Augustine grass covering most of his two-acre lot. The Butlers
were Austin's second-highest residential water users last year,
using 201,000 gallons a month _ nearly as much as the average
family of four uses in a year. Across the street, Frank P.
Krasovec's Niles Road home was No. 6 last year. Their neighbor, the
Pease Mansion, now owned by the General Services Commission but
owned by the Shivers family in 1996-97, was the top residential
user. The Pease mansion is following Austin's voluntary watering
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said his family has cut back watering this summer,
running sprinklers only at midnight when they figure demand is at a
low and only twice a week. So far, that level has kept the yard
thriving, he said. If water restrictions kick in, the Butlers will
have to follow the schedule other Austinites already use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still sort of experimenting, frankly, in cutting back
and seeing if everything lives,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homeowners listed as top water users quibble with
the figures, saying they can't believe it's possible to use that
much water at their homes. Like Thomas, several said leaky
sprinkler systems are to blame and they are hiring contractors to
fix the problems. Several also said they did not pay their monthly
bills themselves, giving that chore to accountants, for example,
and therefore had no idea their use was that high until city
utility employees called them after the Austin American-Statesman
requested the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to us, needless to say,'' said Duane Albrecht,
a UT physiology professor whose Newning Drive home in South Austin
was the No. 3 residential water user last year. `` It just doesn't
seem physically possible somehow.''

 &HT;    With credibility at stake, news media goes soul-searching
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Embarrassing retractions and admitted
fabrications have caused media credibility to come under fire this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of CNN's apology for an erroneous report alleging
that the U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors and civilians
during the Vietnam War, a recent Newsweek opinion poll found that a
majority of Americans believe news reports are often inaccurate.
Even more, 63 percent, say recent inaccuracies have made them less
likely to believe news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Recent journalistic scandals have prompted news organizations to
engage in some serious soul-searching in the past few months. How
can a CNN-level disaster be prevented, and how can the public be
convinced that truth is more important than hype and profit? Since
an overwhelming majority of Americans depend on TV as their primary
source for news, credibility is a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are broader problems in our industry than just these
crash-and-burn incidents,'' said Arthur Kent, a former reporter for
the Canadian Broadcasting Co. and NBC who now free-lances foreign
news from London. ``Real reporters need to help management see the
need to re-establish credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased competition has caused some journalists to relax their
standards,experts say. CNN's egregious error came about in a report
by veteran journalist Peter Arnett on the debut telecast of
``NewsStand,'' a newsmagazine that airs every night. Going up
against nearly a dozen other newsmagazines, the program wanted to
premiere with a big story that would make news. That goal was
accomplished, but not in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seasoned journalists have never had less influence in setting
the news agenda,'' Kent said. ``We need to point out that if we
abandon traditions of balance, perspective and reason, credibility
will be blown and profits from softer news will fritter away. The
public will lose confidence in broadcast news, as they're beginning
to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN fiasco is certainly not the first humiliating blow to TV
news. In 1993, NBC admitted it staged an explosion in a ``Dateline
NBC'' report on truck safety. In '95, ABC apologized (as part of a
lawsuit settlement) for alleging that tobacco companies manipulated
the level of nicotine in cigarettes. ABC also was forced to settle
a lawsuit brought by a grocery store chain that said the network
practiced deceitful reporting when an undercover reporter lied to
gain employment in one of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   And TV news isn't alone in suffering credibility problems. Time
magazine, which ran the CNN story, also ran a retraction and an
apology to its readers. Before that, the Boston Globe fired
columnist Patricia Smith for making up quotes and characters in
several columns; the New Republic fired reporter Stephen Glass for
making up all or part of 27 magazine articles; and the Cincinnati
Enquirer retracted a report on Chiquita Banana that was based on
information stolen from voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sensational stories
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the news media was strong during the Vietnam War
and Watergate, according to polls at the time, but has eroded
steadily since the advent of so-called tabloid news. Many consumers
see little difference between network news stories, such as the
frenzied coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial and President
Clinton's alleged womanizing, and reports on gruesome murders and
Hollywood sex scandals covered by shows such as ``Hard Copy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a Catch-22 for TV news executives, since the Simpson trial
reports sent ratings soaring. Newsmagazines, newscasts and news
specials attracted record numbers of viewers during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we deliver top ratings but undermine our credibility, we
have failed,'' said David Westin, president of ABC News. ``Ratings
shouldn't be the be-all for the news divisions. Success should be
judged on the quality of reporting, integrity and a sense of
responsibility. Are we explaining or just pulling something off a
wire and putting on a pretty face?''
</P>
<P>
   With so many places for people to turn for news, news
organizations are clamoring for attention with sensational stories
that are easy to promote. The Lewinsky story took on a life of its
own, with breathless reports from the White House lawn about new
revelations _ or rumors about revelations _ every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn anything into a daily soap opera, and people will
watch,'' Kent said. ``People are willing to be entertained by all
that stuff, but they probably don't believe a word of it. President
Clinton is still popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the credibility problem is the focus on sensational
stories to the exclusion of serious, issue-oriented coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 50 crews in D.C. following Monica Lewinsky, but the
networks had no reporters in India when the nuclear bomb was set
off,'' Kent lamented. ``Balance used to be the hallmark of network
news, but now I think we've lost perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Concurring with him is Ted Turner, who founded CNN and nurtured
it from its early days as the ridiculed ``Chicken Noodle Network''
to the serious, worldwide news organization it is today .
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure for profits is so great,'' he said in an
apology-filled appearance in front of the Television Critics
Association in Los Angeles recently. ``We're all trying to cut
expenses and increase profits. And there are so many other sources
available to people. . . . We're working on hundreds of stories at
any given moment. We've made mistakes and near-mistakes before, but
nothing this big has ever happened. Maybe we tried to take on too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which will add another newsmagazine to its lineup this
fall, has long prided itself on in-depth reporting of domestic and
foreign news. But in the past two years, ``World News Tonight'' has
fallen behind NBC's flashier, more feature-oriented ``Nightly
News'' in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pivotal time for TV news,'' Westin said. ``Because
there's been a dramatic increase in competition, there's been a
tendency to try to be noticed or be quicker on the trigger. All of
us have seen some risk-taking. . . . It's always more important to
be right than to be first. We all have a competitive zeal, but we
have to have checks and balances. We continually ask ourselves,
'Are we sure about that story?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek opinion poll found that 77 percent of those
surveyed felt that journalists were more likely to be influenced by
pressure for higher ratings and profits than in the past, and 71
percent believed journalists were too concerned with becoming
celebrities or getting rich.
</P>
<P>
   Who's behind the news?
</P>
<P>
   The CNN incident may have seemed more shocking than other
incidents because the on-camera reporter acknowledged that he had
little to do with the broadcast. Arnett, who helped establish CNN
with his sharp reporting from Baghdad during the Persian Gulf War,
admitted he came late to the story, which had been reported
primarily by two producers, April Oliver and Jack Smith. Arnett,
who earned a Pulitzer Prize covering the Vietnam War for the
Associated Press in 1966, was the face on the screen, but he was
merely responsible for supplying the voice-over and conducting a
couple of interviews using questions from the producers.
</P>
<P>
   What many viewers may not realize is that TV news producers are
reporters, too. They're just not presenters. That task is usually
performed by the ``news stars'' whom viewers have come to know and
trust. After the CNN retraction, CNN President Tom Johnson fired
the two producers but only reprimanded Arnett. CNN has said it will
no longer allow its reporters to ``front'' a story without being
involved in fact-gathering and reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice of on-camera reporters functioning as
presenters rather than investigators and fact-gatherers is not
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participation of reporters runs the gamut,'' Kent said.
``Sometimes we research, write, edit and present. You do run into
situations where you're asked just to present. It's not unusual.
You trust your producers with your credibility, but you have to be
confident in the material you bring to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC reporter Jack Smith (not the same Jack Smith who was fired
from CNN) said he has done voice-overs, too, although he prefers to
report and write everything he puts on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's very difficult to do absolutely everything,'' said
Smith, a Vietnam veteran and the son of legendary TV reporter
Howard K. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Although reluctant to criticize Arnett, Smith said the nerve gas
story ``didn't pass even the most elementary journalistic smell
test. ... Serious reporters I know haven't bought into these kinds
of Rambo stories. (The CNN producers) really believed the story at
the outset, and that's always a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said when a story seems suspicious, on-camera reporters
should check the facts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Westin, ABC News president, said his reporters ultimately are
responsible for stories they present on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never, never do a serious investigative piece and
have a correspondent come in at the last minute to do a
voice-over,'' Westin said. ``Producers do a lot of reporting, but
our correspondents wouldn't want to just be a face on the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisis management
</P>
<P>
   CNN's faulty reporting prompted heated criticism, but the way
the cable network handled the aftermath has earned almost universal
praise. CNN's Johnson quickly hired media attorney Floyd Abrams to
investigate the accuracy of the reporting, and when Abrams
concluded that the evidence did not support the conclusions, an
on-air apology was made.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also took steps to prevent future problems. On-air
reporters at CNN are now responsible for all stories they present,
and CNN executive Rick Davis will review all significant reporting
for accuracy and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way this situation has been handled by Tom Johnson
and his management team has been striking and most effective,''
Kent said. ``They let the journalists themselves explain their role
in this controversy. They've thrown open their books, their
archives, their outtakes. . . . That was almost unprecedented, and
I think that has helped work toward a constructive solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The mea culpas and corrective actions must have worked because
the Newsweek poll found that CNN remains the most believable news
organization, followed by newspapers and network news.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson learned from this summer's disaster, media insiders
say, is that news organizations need to be ever-vigilant in
maintaining high standards. Putting a story on the air without
complete evidence and balanced reporting will backfire, ultimately
undermining credibility and driving viewers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't guarantee anything,'' Turner said. ``This was a very
poor journalistic decision, and we're doing all we can to make sure
it never happens again. Everybody makes mistakes, and this was a
really big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Media watchdog groups suggest that TV news should follow the
lead of the print medium and set aside regular spots for
corrections and clarifications. The last few minutes of the Friday
evening newscast would be a logical place. Broadcast news rarely
runs corrections, unless the goof is major and/or involves legal
action. Some media experts think a corrections segment would show
viewers that accuracy is a major concern and inspire reporters to
be more careful.

 &HT;    Tips on RV travel
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get a brochure from Cruise America (800-327-7799), one of the
largest RV rental companies with 100 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Get a free video on RV cruising from the Recreational Vehicle
Industry Association (888-467-8464).
</P>
<P>
   Before booking a trip, go to an RV dealership in your area to
get an idea of their size and type. Check the Yellow Pages under
``Recreational Vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The RV America Web site (www.rvamerica.com) has a list of
dealers, clubs and RV resources.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO PREPARE
</P>
<P>
   When you pick up your RV, you'll get a short orientation. Take
notes. Ask plenty of questions. Make sure you're clear on how to
hook up electricity, sewer and water at a campground. Don't leave
any doubts about operating the appliances. Ask where the fuse panel
is located. Then, read the manual that explains all the functions
of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Before you leave for your trip, you may want to go to a local
dealer to get a practice run of setting up at a campground. They
are glad to help.
</P>
<P>
   The RV rental outlet will try to sell you extra kits (bedding,
utensils, flashlight, etc.). If you take it with you, the savings
are significant.
</P>
<P>
   Bring tools (a flat screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver, an
adjustable wrench, pliers).
</P>
<P>
   Make reservations at all campgrounds, even state parks. KOA's
Web site is www.koakampgrounds.com. Call that state's tourism
department for RV parking at state parks which can be cheaper than
private camps.
</P>
<P>
   ONCE YOU'RE THERE
</P>
<P>
   When parking, have someone get out and guide you.
</P>
<P>
   Plan your trip so that you get to your camping sites in the
daylight. There is nothing worse than a first timer pulling into
into a camp at 10 p.m. and trying to hook up hoses. Always ask for
a full hookup site because this enables you to use their water and
sewer disposal instead of your vehicle's tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Most rental agencies have a toll-free number to call for
problems you encounter on the road. Use it often.
</P>
<P>
   Renting a motor home is not like renting a car. You have to
maintain the RV. If it's trashed out, it can cost $50; $100 for a
sewer tank that's not empty.
</P>
<P>
   Using RV toilet paper and chemicals to keep your sewer lines
flowing will save you nasty maintenance.

 &HT;    A wheel family vacation
 &HT;    By Ricardo Ga(accent)ndara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Entry in my travel journal:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can lose myself on this road through the old growth forest
of lacy ferns, towering Douglas fir and even taller Sitka spruce. A
herd of Olympic elk cautiously watches me as I bring my rig to a
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta get a picture. Just ahead is the Hoh Rain Forest with
its Hall of Moss walking trail. There's an alert about possible
encounters with a cougar and a black bear and her cub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel is great in a motor home. Susan can grab me a Coke from
the fridge. And when the kids need to potty, I pull off to the
shoulder so they can use the on-board toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hassle-free traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   This was real adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Logging 1,000 miles in a rented 29-foot motor home in the
Pacific Northwest was a vacation we had only imagined. We always
fly to point A, rent a car and drive to tourist sites B, C and D.
This was different, pleasantly different. If my family of five,
plus mother-in-law, can survive each other in tight quarters for a
week, anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   Our excursion gave new meaning to travel. Sure, we could have
rented a sport utility vehicle and a cabin near a lake. This,
however, provided more independence and self-sufficiency. On
conventional vacations, we often are at the mercy of other people's
schedules and rules. This time, we could do what we wanted, when we
wanted, and everything we needed _ clothes, food, a hot shower _
was on board.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder RV rentals were up 30 percent last year, according to
the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association. More than 10 million
recreational ational vehicles _ everything from folding camping
trailers to conversion vehicles to motor homes _ are on the road
today with more than 16,000 public and private campgrounds
nationwide to park them.
</P>
<P>
   Why an RV vacation? Think this was a guy thing?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   My wife Susan decided this would be our big getaway for the
year. I always had been curious when I passed a majestic Winnebago
on the road, and we were crammed in our SUV. What did they look
like inside? Were they as luxurious as we imagined?
</P>
<P>
   I always thought of them as too big, slow and out of my price
range. But, like more and more families each year, I learned that
vacationing in an RV is not only affordable but has great family
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kids love them.
</P>
<P>
   My girls _ 6-year-old Alexandra, 4-year-old Victoria and
22-month-old Isabella _ had a ball. The older girls loved sleeping
in the bed over the cab of our Class C motor home, which is the
preferred family setup that sleeps four to six people.
</P>
<P>
   The girls enjoyed the scenic drives in Oregon, Washington and
British Columbia, Canada, through the RV's sightseeing-friendly
large windows. And they enjoyed the antics of Austin author Joanne
King Holtzman's ``The Fat Rat and This and That'' audiocassette, a
treasure of children's songs that encouraged them to dance and
move, and kept them occupied on some of the longer stretches of
highway.
</P>
<P>
   RV vacations are comparable to conventional getaways. They can
cost less, especially if six or more people are in your party ($600
to $1,200, plus gas, food and campground fees). Our seven-day
package (picking up and returning the motor home in Portland) cost
$866 plus $130 in gas. The first 1,000 miles were free, then we
were charged 29 cents a mile. The Kampgrounds of America sites
where we stayed were $28 to $32 a night for a full hookup of
electricity, water and sewer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``California Flyer'' on a Chevy van chassis we rented had a
queen bed, a restroom complete with shower, a fridge and freezer, a
stove and microwave and plenty of storage space for souvenirs.
Larger and more luxurious motor homes we saw at campgrounds had
washers and dryers and televisions with satellite dishes to pick up
300 channels _ basically the amenities of a home on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Mealtimes were a snap. Susan cooked hot breakfasts for the
adults, and the kids ate cold cereal. We stopped at delis for
sandwich meat. The fridge and pantry were stocked with kids'
snacks, juice and milk. In the morning, I always had fresh coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of the outdoors is the biggest draw. You can take an RV
to the mountains, beaches, on ferries to parts of Canada, just
about anywhere. We rented our rig in Portland, drove northwest into
Washington and camped at Monte and Frances Decker's KOA in Port
Angeles. This was more than a campground. It offered miniature
golf, horseshoes, basketball, volleyball, pool, video arcade,
billiards, cable TV, hot tub, showers, cabins and a laundry. Tours
to Victoria, B.C., were available with transportation provided from
the campground.
</P>
<P>
   A motor home is not a total party. You have to dump your black
water (sewage) at campgrounds. It's a snap and not messy if you
wear plastic gloves and pay close attention during the 15-minute
orientation when you rent the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   You may feel uneasy the first day, but RVs are pretty easy to
drive and it gets easier each day.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the road
</P>
<P>
   Our first full day of exploration was the diverse and beautiful
world of the Olympic National Forest where, if a rain forest
doesn't capture your attention, a glacier will. We pulled over
several times along winding U.S. 101 to take photos of calm and
sparkling Lake Crescent. The Sul Doc Hot Springs were elbow to
elbow with bathers, so we walked the easily accessible
three-quarter-mile trek to Sol Duc Falls. On to the Hoh Rain
Forest, where you are in another spectacular world of ferns
carpeting the ground and moss draped from Sitka spruce trees.
</P>
<P>
   We could have stayed at Olympic National Park an entire week and
taken in other sites like Hurricane Ridge, but the Butchart Gardens
and the old world charm of Victoria, B.C., awaited us. The ferry
from Port Angeles, Wash., accommodated RVs ($60 one way). A
comfortable night's stay at John and Kathy Erickson's KOA
Kcampground tucked into a forest north of Victoria was just what we
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to be overwhelmed by 50-acre Butchart Gardens, where
rare and exotic plants share space with native varieties. If
wildlife is your thing, marine safaris to see killer whales,
porpoises, seals and marine birds are plentiful. Or take in the
historic and magnificent Empress Hotel for pricey ($32 in Canadian
dollars) high tea.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was Seattle, where during breakfast at the revolving,
520-foot Space Needle restaurant downtown _ built for the 1962
World's Fair _ we saw an unobstructed view of mammoth 14,410-foot,
snow-covered Mount Rainier. We had no trouble parking in public
lots but paid for two spots.
</P>
<P>
   Pike's Market on the water is a gem. Come hungry to enjoy food
from around the world. Seattle's, with 54 Starbucks, has an obvious
love affair with coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The monstrous motor home did not hamper us. In fact, it provided
us with flexibility. We met people on the road who towed a car or
rented one to get around cities while their RV was at a campground.
</P>
<P>
   Totally satisfied
</P>
<P>
   Usually, as I get close to the end of my vacation, I want my own
bed. Home starts sounding good. We did not feel that way. The kids
were sad their ``camping'' trip was over. Their comfy bed over the
cab had become home.

 &HT;    Southern Comfort, RV-Style
 &HT;    By Melissa Segrest
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I am not an RV kinda gal.
</P>
<P>
   When my friends learned that I would be traversing the South in
a rented 27-foot recreational vehicle, they snickered. What had
overcome their Vogue-readin', Pinot grigio-sippin', Volvo-drivin'
buddy, they asked. Heretofore, they reminded me, my idea of a
recreational vehicle has been a Mercedes with tinted windows on a
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   So you might find it surprising to learn that somewhere on a
desolate stretch of Interstate 10, between Biloxi, Miss., and
Vinton, La., I began to understand the RV allure. I believe my
enlightenment struck as I lay atop the king-size bed, reading old
New York Times Magazines and munching Cheez-Doodles _ all while
hurtling down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   That, my friends, is a strange and wondrous sensation.
</P>
<P>
   It started with my 7-year-old daughter's obsession with RVs _ a
more costly fascination than Beanie Babies and Barbies.
</P>
<P>
   And it's my old boss's fault, too. When you get a new job, she
advised, it's important to drive to one's new home, to feel the
country under your wheels, to cross the miles and put your old home
behind you.
</P>
<P>
   So when a new job in Austin materialized, it seemed that the
time was right to give the RV thing a try.
</P>
<P>
   Getting one was simple enough. A call to (800) 334-4110
connected me to the nearest RV rental outlet: Cruise America in
Miami, a mere 80 miles from our Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., home.
After some telephone negotiations, and a $300 deposit, our RV was
reserved. The total cost would be a little more than $1,500; we had
to pay an extra $375 for the one-way rental.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before our departure, my husband and I drove to Miami to
make the pickup. After a wait in line, we watched a 20-minute
instructional video featuring a portly and disturbingly friendly
fellow who told us of propane monitor panels and gray water holding
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   I hoped my husband was listening. Taking a Flyer
</P>
<P>
   We signed some papers and were escorted to the parking lot
where, with a flourish, we stepped aboard our vehicle _ a
glistening white, new ``California Flyer.'' I was stunned. This was
nice. There were two beds _ one king and one queen, a bathroom with
a shower, a kitchen complete with four-burner stove, double sink,
refrigerator/freezer and kitchen-area table with bench seats on
either side. There were little closets beside the master bed, with
little rods with little hangers where I could hang my clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I could see myself living here for a while. After a few more
instructions, we were on our way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Fred was on his way. The idea of my getting behind the
wheel of any vehicle that beeps when it is backing up is too far
from my frame of reference, so my husband gallantly offered to
drive our home-on-wheels home.
</P>
<P>
   He also had gallantly plotted our plodding course across the
South, allotting not too much and not too little time on the road
each day. We would stay in a few of the many RV parks and
Kampgrounds of America sites along the way. We would see the
country. We would bond as a family.
</P>
<P>
   On the road
</P>
<P>
   Day 1's journey ended a mere five hours north on Florida's
Turnpike, in a wide spot in the road called Wildwood. We decamped
and plugged in, as they say in RV-speak, and then took in the
sights of the KOA campground: a grizzled mini-golf course, a clean
swimming pool and plenty of room for our two standard poodles to
stretch out. After Fred went through the 10-minute process of
connecting us to electricity, water and sewer lines, we were set.
</P>
<P>
   And we were alone. This park, desolate in the Florida heat, was
pocketed behind a truck stop and a Steak &AMP; Shake. No frills. And
not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a quick exit was in order, and it was on to
Panama City Beach at the crook of Florida's Panhandle. Our bustling
KOA campground was near the heart of the tourist area and a stone's
throw from the Gulf of Mexico. Now this was more fun. Lots of
families here, enjoying the beachy scene from the luxury of their
lavish RVs. The ``Flyer'' was dwarfed by Winnebagos with living
room ``slide-outs'' and 60-foot bus conversions complete with
satellite dishes and Surround Sound systems.
</P>
<P>
   We began to feel inferior.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll to nearby restaurants and kitschy shops _ along with
another round of mini-golf _ put a lovely capper on the evening.
Heck, we even had a cable hookup for the tiny TV we brought along.
(No, I cannot function without TV.)
</P>
<P>
   Biloxi or bust
</P>
<P>
   Day 3 began with the now-traditional Waffle House breakfast, and
it was off for the drive to Biloxi, Miss. Beautiful Gulf vistas and
impressive houses raced by the picture windows. We talked. We
walked around. We napped. We played cards and laughed. We ate
lunch. We yelled at the dogs _ all within the comfort of our RV.
Lots of forced quality family time. We were getting closer. I could
just feel it (or was that just fleas?)
</P>
<P>
   We were virtually singing ``Kum-ba-yah'' by the time we pulled
in to our RV park for the day. The good mood ended abruptly when we
were told that all of the campground's sites were taken for the
night. Why, I asked, would an RV park in the middle of Biloxi,
Miss., be full in the middle of the summer? My answer lay right
across U.S. 90: a sprawling casino. The last time I had been in
Biloxi, a decade earlier, the city had been serene and sedate. Now
it was neon-pocked and buzzing with the hubbub of dozens of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down the Gulf Coast highway in search of another RV
park, we noticed the beaches were oddly deserted at midday. But the
casino parking lots were jammed. Who wants to swim when the slot
machines are calling?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we found the Cajun RV Park _ tucked behind an adult
bookstore and a motel. Despite the seedy setting, the place looked
clean and serviceable, so we paid our $25, hooked up and settled
in. My husband and daughter headed off for the pool, and I hunkered
down in the cool darkness of the RV. Outside, the temperatures
hovered around 100 degrees. Dozens of lavish RVs were there, but
not a soul was moving around outside. Everyone was hiding from the
heat in their luxury vehicles. It seemed odd that someone would
spend tens of thousands of dollars on a recreational vehicle only
to come to a place like Biloxi, park behind a dirty bookstore and
hide from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. It was too hot for such deep thoughts. We asked for a
good restaurant and were told that the only decent food was _
surprise _ at the casinos. Conveniently, a shuttle made regular
stops at the RV park, so we boarded one and headed for the Grand
Casino. Inside, the bright lights and bells and whistles of the
glistening, bustling casino seemed like a fantasy wonderland to our
7-year-old. We tried to explain the wages of sin and gluttony to
her as we waited in line for a lavish and reasonably priced buffet
of Cajun dishes and fresh seafood. My warnings about the dangerous
lure of gambling must have seemed empty after I wandered off to
drop $10 in the slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Before I surrendered to the urge to don a halter top and start
playing craps, we escaped from Biloxi _ stopping only for another
hearty Waffle House breakfast. We abandoned the picturesque road
that hugged the Gulf coast to join the speeders on Interstate 10,
lunched at _ guess where _ a casino in Baton Rouge and sped through
southwest Louisiana to Vinton, La., about 120 miles east of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Et tu, etouffee?
</P>
<P>
   We pulled into a crowded Vinton/Lake Charles KOA by late
afternoon, plugged in and hit the mini-golf course and pool. We
eagerly looked forward to a dinner of etouffee , boudin and
jambalaya at some down-home diner here in the heart of Cajun
country. Imagine our disappointment to learn that all the down-home
Cajun eateries had been run out of business by _ you guessed it _
casinos. Now this was getting irritating. Whole stretches of the
South, it appeared, had been swallowed up by the gluttonous
gambling industry. Mom and Pop diners were gone, replaced by Golden
Nugget casinos where all the food was fried and all the patrons had
the glassy-eyed stares of people who had just gambled away that
month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   So we went to the horse races.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the track was a stone's throw from the RV park,
and I had never seen a horse race before and Emily loves horses and
. . . oh, forget it. We had lost any semblance of propriety. We
were taking our child to gambling establishments and eating fried
food, and I had stopped putting on any makeup somewhere around
Sulphur, La.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the heat, or the laid-back RV culture, or perhaps
it was the fact that we had been staying in close quarters with a
couple of poodles for too many days _ something had messed with our
well-ordered sensibilities. We were losing our sense of self. I
yearned for a walk-in closet.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some relief that we pulled into the Elk Rental
and Leasing lot on U.S. 290 to return the Flyer to the good folks
at Cruise America. I was back in my home state of Texas, behind the
wheel of the Volvo. All was right with the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the RV experience wasn't fun. It's a great way to
see the country, and it's far superior to actual camping out of
doors. But given my druthers, I'd rather spend the money on a
massage at a beachfront Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and child, however, are already planning our next
trip, talking about the relative merit of Class A vs. Class C RVs
we pass on the road and longing for the day when we might own a
recreational vehicle of our own.
</P>
<P>
   That will be nice.
</P>
<P>
   I hope they send me postcards.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Subtle victories mark grandma's early feminism
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. Feminism was not a word in my Grandmother
Parker's vocabulary. She lived and died too soon, long before Betty
and Gloria
</P>
<P>
   showed up and much too long before I was of an age where we
might have talked woman-to-woman. And that is too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker (I was encouraged to call her that to avoid what she
referred to as ``simpering sobriquet'') was, without doubt, a woman
ahead
</P>
<P>
   of her time. She fought no visible battles for equality nor did
she burn a bra on the courthouse steps (in fact, rumor has it, she
never wore
</P>
<P>
   one). Her skirmishes were more personal, more subtle, her
victories unproclaimed but no less sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmother Parker didn't like me - but that's okay. She didn't
like her daughter either. ``I love you dammit Doris,'' I remember
her
</P>
<P>
   admonishing my mother on more than one occasion, ``but that
doesn't mean you don't irritate the hell out of me. Now, quit
whining.'' Mother would
</P>
<P>
   bug out to her old bedroom room to pout. I'd cadge a ``Co-Cola
over ice, please'' from the kitchen and disappear onto the shady
screened porch to
</P>
<P>
   play with Granddaddy's poker chips and watch for bugs.
</P>
<P>
   My fear of Florida's creepy-crawlers exasperated Grandmother. It
made no difference to her that I had not grown up with flying
cockroaches the
</P>
<P>
   size of pterodactyls or house spiders larger than saucers. With
her it was a matter of principle. ``Who's going to kill bugs for
you when your
</P>
<P>
   daddy isn't around?'' I told her I had no idea. She told me not
to count on a husband.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker had gone her own way long before women were
encouraged to bob their hair and roll down their stockings. Oh, she
still participated
</P>
<P>
   in the ``lady things'' as she referred to her afternoon teas,
bridge parties, and Red Cross drills, but it was not unheard of for
her to drop
</P>
<P>
   a handful of cards (or teacakes) and race out the door when she
heard a fire engine's blare on nearby Osceola Street - one of the
main drags in
</P>
<P>
   the Riverside section of Jacksonville. Day or night, she never
resisted the siren's call
</P>
<P>
   Granddaddy suggested she get a job at the newspaper so she could
have a press card to snap onto the sun visor; that way he said,
it'd look
</P>
<P>
   like she was a working person instead of a nosy old lady.
Grandmother's standard reply to advice like that was: ``Anyone who
has the time to
</P>
<P>
   worry about what I'm doing has nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Grandmother did worry about other folks' business -
usually for all of the right reasons. Frequently, she would offer
her
</P>
<P>
   time and resources to some ``poor old soul'' who might be living
down the street in suddenly reduced circumstances or whose husband
was suspected
</P>
<P>
   of having taken to hard liquor and even harder women. In her own
odd way, she always tried to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of this century when Mrs. Parker was a young
mother (very young with three babies), pretty much everything
needed in the
</P>
<P>
   running of a house was delivered to the back door. Grandmother
saw that as imprisonment and began preaching the virtues of
mobility. It was her
</P>
<P>
   solemn belief that a woman who couldn't drive was doomed to live
a life in bondage. Her solution: she taught her entire Sunday
School class to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday mornings when she should have been recounting meaningful
parables to six young matrons, she could be found leading them out
the
</P>
<P>
   back door of the First Baptist Church and into her husband's
Packard for a practice run to Riverside Park. Everybody got a turn.
Grandmother was
</P>
<P>
   meticulously fair.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before the word was out and Mrs. Parker's driving
school was scandalizing the town. Irate husbands called Granddaddy,
</P>
<P>
   worried about their wives skidding down the highway to
degradation or worse - independence. ``I'll speak with Mrs.
Parker,'' was always his
</P>
<P>
   response. And he did. My mother loved to recount one of these
sessions that occurred over a family breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edna,'' Granddaddy began with his pince-nez glasses firmly
clamped onto the bridge of his nose, ``you're upsetting a lot of
folks with this
</P>
<P>
   driving thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good, Ernest,'' was his diminutive wife's reply as she
concentrated on buttering her toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shall you stop it then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very well.'' There was no discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Parker picked up his newspaper and resumed reading. Mrs.
Parker finished her toast and the ad hoc driving school remained in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   No signs. No banners. No marches. Just one lady determined to
make a difference.

   Great surplus giveaway
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   It must be a joke. Congressman John Kasich poses before the
National Debt Clock on the ``Kasich 2000'' web page that touts him
as presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers on that clock _ $5.36 trillion as of Monday, $20,490
per person _ are supposed to alarm us all to action.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of action? Gut-wrenching patriotic sacrifice?
Visionary tough decisions? You must be joking.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Republican might as well be posing before a gumball
machine with a screw driver plunged into its bowels. Step right up
and have a gumball. Have three. We've got 'em coming out our ears.
</P>
<P>
   Step right up. Come get your tax break. We have a ``surplus'' of
funds based on one year's budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. What's more, projections for a decade's
accumulated annual surpluses now amount to $1.6 trillion. Now, the
Debt Clock be damned, visionaries like Kasich and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich are thinking of ways to fritter that away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to take a trillion dollars from the
American people that the government doesn't need?'' said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mind the Debt Clock and the money it says our government
owes. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Gingrich
are talking about cutting taxes by $700 billion over the next 10
years. Roll out the barrel, by gum.
</P>
<P>
   You are excused for seeming dense when you ask the question,
``We've been trying desperately to reduce debt, or so we assumed.
Now that we're in a position to actually carve into the national
debt, why do this?''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that lots of Americans are scratching their
heads. The better news is that among them are Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Senate Budget Committee
chairman Pete Domenici and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm all have distanced
themselves from talk by Republicans in the House about such
monumental tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On this subject the GOP Senate leaders sound _ hari-kari,
anyone? _more like President Clinton. Although he supports measured
and targeted tax cuts, he says that Social Security should get the
lion's share of attention and savings.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, for his part, would divide the $1.6 trillion in half _
half going to tax cuts, half going to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   You can't talk about the federal debt _ at least you can't
honestly _ and not mention Social Security. The surplus of the
Social Security trust fund is borrowed to mask the deficit, with
$600 billion owed back.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of the $1.6 trillion Gingrich and Kasich are talking
about having as surplus revenue, all but $169 billion would come
from surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. That means that
not only is the deficit masked, so is the ``surplus.'' It is owed
back to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   True-believer supply-side conservatives tout the economic boost
that comes with tax cuts. But that's nothing new. Anytime the
government spends money, someone gets an economic boost. One of the
great deceits of Reaganomics was the supposed distinction made
between deficit spending and tax cuts in a deficit situation. When
the books don't balance, tax cuts are deficit spending and nothing
but.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has to pay back what we've borrowed. What about that
federal debt, Congressman Gumball?
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeting about ``money government doesn't need'' is
repudiated by every tick of the clock behind you.

 &HT;    Book Review: Sloppy mistakes taint earnest look at Zanuck's
career
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TWENTIETH CENTURY'S FOX: Darryl F. Zanuck and the Culture of
Hollywood, by George F. Custen. Basic; 435 pages; $27.50.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Zanuck is the forgotten mogul. He lacked the flamboyance
of Selznick, the endearing accent and malapropisms of Goldwyn, the
crummy jokes of Warner, the thuggish brutality of Harry Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   He was short, homely, had a nasty gap between his front teeth.
He was also a hellacious filmmaker who made 20th Century Fox
studios as close to a writer's studio as the classic period of
Hollywood could offer.
</P>
<P>
   Because Zanuck was low on stars _ after Tyrone Power and Betty
Grable, things got very thin very fast _ he concentrated on story.
Fox films were not the best-photographed or the best-directed, but
they were usually the strongest in narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Because Zanuck was an ex-writer himself _ not a good one, but a
writer nonetheless _ he had more respect for the breed than the
producers did, and he treated the aces of his staff, Nunnally
Johnson and Lamar Trotti, far more gently than was the general rule
around town.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to directors, the ace of his staff was John Ford,
with whom Zanuck had a professional relationship that was usually
idyllic but occasionally abrasive. The rule was simple: Zanuck left
Ford alone to shoot his picture as he saw fit, but Zanuck edited
the footage. The collaboration resulted in such evergreens as ``How
Green Was My Valley,`` ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``My Darling
Clementine,'' so they must have been doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   George Custen's ``Twentieth Century's Fox'' _ does the title
irritate anybody besides me? _ is a serious attempt at examining
Zanuck the filmmaker; Custen pays little attention to the man, a
hard-driving workaholic with little time for family, and the usual
weaknesses of his breed _ women and high living.
</P>
<P>
   Custen chooses primary films from all phases of Zanuck's career,
from his early days at Warner Bros. through his last hurrah, ``The
Longest Day,'' using letters, production notes, scripts and the
very occasional interview to illuminate Zanuck's working methods
and aims.
</P>
<P>
   Custen wisely devotes a good deal of space to the largely
ignored early days of the struggling young writer.
</P>
<P>
   He digs up copies of Zanuck's short stories and an early book,
as well as the first attempts at screenplays. He then segues to
Zanuck's time at Warner Bros., where he worked his way up from
junior writer to production chief, and then formed an independent
outfit called 20th Century productions, which Zanuck later merged
with the moribund Fox organization.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th Century period that proved to the industry at
large that Zanuck was the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures he made there aren't terribly interesting today _
``House of Rothschild,'' ``Call of the Wild,'' ``The Bowery,''
``Clive of India'' _ but they were all ambitious, well-reviewed and
they made money.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox, of course, Zanuck walked into two lifesavers named
Shirley Temple and Will Rogers. But Rogers died in a plane crash in
1935, which meant Zanuck had to further develop a focus on story.
</P>
<P>
   I could quibble about some of Custen's conclusions; I think he
makes larger claims for Zanuck's influence on the 1927 ``The Jazz
Singer'' than are entirely warranted, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   What mars _ no, nearly destroys _ Custen's book are some of the
more ridiculous factual lapses I've ever encountered in a
putatively serious work of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The Douglas Fairbanks Sr. film ``Reaching for the Moon'' is
characterized as ``a science-fiction musical.'' It has no science
fiction element whatever (it's a typical Fairbanksian
lift-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps story about a tycoon that was
disastrously released shortly after the stock market crashed);
writer/director Richard Brooks gets a name change to Peter Brooks;
Helen Hayes' name is misspelled ``Hays.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more: The actor Edward Woods is called James Woods. The
leading man of ``The Broadway Melody'' is identified as Harry
Richman, when Charles King played the part. I could go on, but you
get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The first error simply indicates that Custen hasn't seen the
films he's writing about _ a bad idea; the rest are just sloppy
mistakes that call into question the writer's attention to detail
and overall seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   If a historian can't be trusted to get well-known names right,
why should he be trusted about anything else?
</P>
<P>
   Scott Eyman's column appears in the Palm Beach Post, West Palm
Beach, Fla.

dog. From the very first, Sandy was, shall we say, uncoordinated.
She would sit, and her back legs would splay out haphazardly, her

seemed to be well beyond her ability. We always felt like we needed
to prop up her backside when she tried to sit. ``What's wrong with
her back legs?'' we asked a friend who knows a thing or two about
dogs. ``Are they weak?'' ``Nope. She's just clumsy,'' we were told.

Grandmother Parker's vocabulary. She lived and died too soon, long
before Betty and Gloria showed up and much too long before I was of
an age where we might have talked woman-to-woman. And that is too
bad. Mrs. Parker (I was encouraged to call her that to avoid what
she referred to as ``simpering sobriquet'') was, without doubt, a
woman ahead of her time. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

alleging that the U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors and

   CUBAN-JEWS _ HAVANA _ The synagogue has an aerobics instructor,
but no rabbi. Temple dues _ which can run $1,000 a year in South
Florida _ are five cents a month. As with most everything else in
Cuba, Judaism survives on this tropical island by sacrifice and
invention. The Sephardic Hebrew Center uses its community room for
aerobics, dance classes and weight training, earning a few dollars
for the upkeep of the 44-year-old building. The rabbis left Cuba
along with 90 percent of the Jewish population after the 1959
revolution led by Fidel Castro. While visiting rabbis come several
times a year for bar mitzvahs, weddings and conversions, weekly
services are performed by lay members, said Jose Levy, synagogue
president. (Douthat, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Commentary: Clumsy is our dog's middle name
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It pains me to say this, but we have a clumsy dog.
</P>
<P>
   We got Sandy as a pup from the animal shelter about two years
ago. She was so tiny she fit neatly into the palm of my hand.
</P>
<P>
   We carefully examined the size of her paws, relying on our
knowledge that puppies grow into their paws. Her paws were tiny.
Her paws grew.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first, Sandy was, shall we say, uncoordinated.
</P>
<P>
   She would sit, and her back legs would splay out haphazardly,
her rear skittering across the floor. Sitting, much less sitting
up, seemed to be well beyond her ability. We always felt like we
needed to prop up her backside when she tried to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with her back legs?'' we asked a friend who knows
a thing or two about dogs. ``Are they weak?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. She's just clumsy,'' we were told.
</P>
<P>
   Great. A certified clumsy dog.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she may be clumsy, but she loves to play. Sandy runs and
fetches and jumps and scampers with the best of them. She just
can't control the back part of her body very well. She reminds you
of those old comedies when the driver falls asleep at the rear end
of the fire engine as it goes careening down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her to give you her paw for a shake and, as she dutifully
lifts it, she often rolls backward, initiating an impromptu belly
rub.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's not clumsy at all. Maybe she's just smart.
</P>
<P>
   Although she can't sit very gracefully, she does manage to jump
on her hind legs like a kangaroo. Put her outside and she comes to
the back door and does a hind-footed tango that would make Carmen
Miranda proud. Her vertical jump is right up there with Michael
Jordan's. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   She once came down our linoleum-floored hallway to our bedroom
during the night to sleep beside our bed. But when we rose that
morning to let her outside, she got so excited that she lost
traction when she hit the slick flooring and wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Legs and tail went flailing in all directions as she slid
halfway down the hall. Think Bambi on the frozen pond. Yelping and
crying, she struggled to the carpeting and sat there (sort of)
shaking and whining.
</P>
<P>
   From that day forward, she has not stepped into the hallway. She
stands at the threshold, tentatively places one paw on the linoleum
and then resignedly sits down (sort of).
</P>
<P>
   We've tried to help her overcome her linoleum phobia. My husband
has eased her along the floor slowly, patting and stroking her as
he speaks comforting words. In her anxiety, though, she begins
digging in her nails, finds nothing, and goes skittering. Both man
and dog end up in a tangle of fur, skin, legs, feet and paws
against the hallway wall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clumsiness, or perhaps because of it, my husband
really loves this dog. He has much more patience with her than I
do. In fact, he came home from the store one day with a new
tootbrush and toothpaste ... yes, for Sandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding!'' I exclaimed. ``You're not going to actually
brush this dog's teeth, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vet said she has plaque,'' he said. ``Her breath stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course her breath stinks,'' I answered. ``She's a dog!''
</P>
<P>
   Farm girls typically aren't sensitive to the need for canine
hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed her teeth _ or at least tried to. The problem, other
than the distraction of my loud guffawing, was that Sandy wouldn't
sit for the Doggydent toothpaste experience.
</P>
<P>
   She tried, but down she went. My husband bent over her prone
body, vigorously scrubbing her teeth with meat-flavored toothpaste.
I wonder _ if I made my boys use it, could I cut down on the meat
bill at the grocery?
</P>
<P>
   After much gnashing of teeth, my husband accomplished his task.
Sandy arose smacking her chops, looking for dessert. She was so
excited, she sat up and begged for more.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.

   UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH (Albany, N.Y.) _ Federal research grants to
colleges and universities in New York have plummeted, school
officials say. What's happening in New York is part of a national
trend. In 1996 and 1997, the federal government doled out about 10
percent less in research grants _ adjusted for inflation _ than it
did at its high point in 1994. By HARVY LIPMAN.
</P>
<P>
   SF-HOUSING (San Francisco) _ At the rate this city is adding
affordable housing aimed at low- and moderate-income residents, the
need will be met in about 50 years, if everything goes well. But
housing activists acknowledge that the housing crisis is close to
intractable and that San Francisco is never going to build its way
out of it. By ERIC BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   VETS-RYAN (San Francisco) _ To steel himself for questions from
veterans in his therapy group, Dr. Nick Kanas went to see ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' He's glad he did. A Vietnam-era vet who meets with
men in their 60s and up, Kanas says that after seeing the film, ``I
can understand better why it's so hard for them to explain their
experiences to those who haven't been there.'' By EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   ARK (Port Aransas, Texas) _ Tony Amos resembles the biblical
Noah, although the ``ark'' under Amos' care is a group of
land-bound tanks and cages rather than a seaworthy craft. Every
morning, the white-haired and bearded Amos scours 7.5 miles of
beach for creatures native to this area and returns to the Animal
Rehabilitation Keep at the University of Texas Marine Science
Institute here. By RALPH WININGHAM.

   AREA-CODE-BLUES (Washington) _ Houston will soon become the
latest city in the nation with an area code overlay _ an area code
that is not geographically distinct. It's part of a national trend
that's leading to a patchwork or dialing rules where you'll dial 10
digits in Baltimore, 11 in Chicago and 7 in Austin, Texas. By DAVID
IVANOVICH.
</P>
<P>
   SF-UNIONSQUARE (San Francisco) _ A fight among merchants vying
for coveted space in Union Square here has made real estate near
this tiny plot of land more expensive than it has been in decades,
elevating San Francisco's retail center into one of the world's
most desirable. Neiman Marcus, the Texas retailer, will spend $50
million to purchase a 50,000-square-foot building, demolish it and
put up what will be the 30-store chain's largest outlet. By
VICTORIA COLLIVER.

   KITCHENS (Albany, N.Y.) _ As our homes and lifestyles evolve
into the next millennium, kitchens will still be the hub of
activity and heart of the home but with a new mindset. Now
designers are working to adapt kitchens to meet the multiple-use
needs of ever-busy families, including working couples, children
and longer-living grandparents. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.

<P>
   DOGHOUSES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Summer is the time to consider that
doghouse you've been wanting to get for Fido to sleep in at night.
It's a good time to shop around or have one custom designed for
your pooch, and will give your dog time to get acclimated to its
new digs before chilly temperatures set in. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS-CLASS (Albany, N.Y.) _ It's the big Albany political
novel William Kennedy has always intended to write. He spent the
last four decades assiduously avoiding it, while publishing seven
novels and two books of nonfiction. Now, at age 70, Kennedy is
wrestling with the beast. He unveiled the results recently at the
New York State Summer Writers Institute. By PAUL GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   TV-70`S (undated) _ Even though Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' received a
slew of Emmy nominations last week, including best comedy, it's
been a long time since the network developed a hit half-hour
sitcom. The wait may be over. Based on the pilot for its latest,
``That 70's Show,'' this could be the funniest new program of the
year. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>

   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-FAME (Albany, N.Y.) _ Immortality finally has gotten
around to settling up with George Davis. The baseball Hall of Fame
is dusting off a cozy place for Davis, one of the best all-around
players of the turn of the century who last appeared in a
major-league game in 1909. Davis didn't make it easy for
immortality to find him. He has spent nearly six decades in an
unmarked grave in Philadelphia. By STEVE CAMPBELL.

to drastically reduce the flow of cocaine and heroin into the

   SAN ANTONIO _ For many in the nation's capital, the drug war has
become little more than tough-sounding rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The latest hot air comes from two Republican lawmakers, who have
unveiled a plan to reduce the flow of cocaine and heroin into the
United States by 80 percent in the next three years through more
interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-drug efforts, they argue, are out of whack. Sen. Mike
DeWine of Ohio and Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida are at odds with
the White House over federal funds for interdiction, which the
lawmakers claim dropped from 33 percent to 12 percent between 1987
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers shouldn't point fingers. Neglect of interdiction
or, stopping the flow of drugs at the source, began long before
President Clinton arrived in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Flor Murcia. She and her husband, Saul, well know how
drug trafficking has affected their beloved Colombia. This nation's
insatiable hunger for illegal narcotics long ago pierced Colombia's
heart.

</P>
<P>
   Just ask Flor Murcia. She and her husband, Saul, well know how
drug trafficking has affected their beloved Colombia. This nation's
insatiable hunger for illegal narcotics long ago pierced Colombia's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   I met the Murcias recently while they were visiting family
members in the United States. Ironically, their first stop was in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly couple live on a lush mountainside about two hours
south of Bogota. Their farm is so remote, it only can be reached by
pack animal. I frequently have heard the Murcias' son and
daughter-in-law, my friends Becky and Saul Murcia, talk about the
place. The tales often are accompanied by photos, so I easily can
picture the farm in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Murcias make good use of their plot, growing such things as
yuca and coffee beans. But their principal money maker is sugar
cane. They process the cane into brown blocks of raw sugar that is
sold in area markets, as are the other foodstuffs they harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Flor, a tiny woman with a fierce spirit, thanks God for their
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, she is thankful that their farm and the nearby villages
remain untouched by the narcoterrorism that has scarred their
nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a blessing, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is mounting that coca growers and guerrilla outfits are
working together. A recent New York Times report describes the web
that is threatening to entangle Colombia's rickety democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Times doesn't have to tell Flor the two are in cahoots.
While narcoguerrillas have not defaced the souls of nearby
villages, they have affected trade, Flor says, thus threatening
their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have much confidence that Colombia will see less
violence, even with the June 21 election of Andres Pastrana as the
nation's new president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No va cambiar nada.'' Nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, at least he isn't former President Ernesto Samper,
Flor muses. Samper was accused of having links to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Flor and Saul now are in Canada, where they will visit other
family before returning to Colombia. They pray they are able to
return soon for another visit.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, look forward to their speedy return. I only hope Flor
has better news.

DOG DAYS OF SUMMER GOOD TIME TO PLAN YOUR PET'S HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Summer is the time to consider that doghouse
you've been wanting to get for Fido.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good time to shop around or have one custom designed for
your pooch, and will give your dog time to get acclimated to the
new digs before chilly temperatures set in.
</P>
<P>
   Doghouses date back to the mid-1800s. The most common building
material is still wood, although molded plastic doghouses are
available. While the latter need no waterproofing, they can become
very hot in summer.
</P>
<P>
   A doghouse should be large enough to accommodate your dog so
that it can stand, stretch and turn around in, but not so large
that its body heat won't keep the inside warm in cooler weather.
</P>
<P>
   All doghouses should be set at least two inches off the ground
on bricks, a platform or cinder blocks and built of sturdy wood and
insulation to protect the animal from wind, snow and rain.
</P>
<P>
   The roof should be waterproof and flat to help keep the dog's
body heat in and serve as a secure roost or vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   Provide a slight overhang to protect the entrance. A hinged roof
will make it easier to clean the shelter or treat it with flea
spray.
</P>
<P>
   Ready-made doghouses of cedar or Dogloos, made from molded
plastic, can be found at most fencing and feed stores. They cost
between $60 for a mid-sized dog to $150 for a very large dog.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs may feel confined inside today's smaller individual
doghouses, so consider a structure where each end is hinged to
open. This can also aid air circulation on a summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans call for an interior wall that creates an entry hall,
which protects the sleeping area from direct wind. The divider wall
can be removed in warm weather. If there is no hall to create
protection, the entrance opening should be offset and cut to one
side instead of the center; that should keep wind from blowing
directly on your pet.
</P>
<P>
   A protective canvas or plastic (the heavy-duty kind used in meat
freezers) strip flap will help to keep the elements out.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, the location of the doghouse should be changed with
each season to keep your dog comfortable. In winter, the doghouse
should be placed on the southeast or east side of your house to get
the winter sun.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more pampered pet options you might consider for a
custom-built doghouse are skylights, an astroturf patio, window
boxes, a heat source, air conditioning and picture window of
shatterproof glass or thick scratch-proof plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying a doghouse, make sure that it's appropriate for
your animal. Doghouses are not recommended for older dogs, dogs
that are small or thin-coated, and puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs shouldn't be left in a doghouse if the temperature dips
below 20 degrees, according to the Humane Society of the United
States. At these temperatures, dogs can experience hypothermia or
frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   Bedding material is important to keep your pet snug and warm.
Cedar shavings or straw (not hay) are best and should be changed or
freshened up on a regular basis to keep the house clean. Shy away
from fabric bedding in the doghouse, as it will hold moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Never tie your dog to his house, and always keep a fresh water
source nearby. To maintain the dog's body heat, its normal amount
of food should be increased by 25 percent or more in very cold
weather, according to the Humane Society.

TOMORROW'S KITCHENS WILL BE WARMER, FAMILY-FRIENDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As our homes and lifestyles evolve into the next
millennium, kitchens will still be the hub of activity and heart of
the home but with a new mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1990s have worn out the family,'' said Wolfgang Hafele,
president of Hafele America, a leading manufacturer of furniture,
cabinets and design hardware. ``Their workdays are longer and their
family time is shorter, so they are creating a room in their house
that gives them back what the world has taken family time and a
feeling of relaxation. That room is the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafele (pronounced hay-fa-la) America is a 75-year-old company
headquartered in Germany, with offices in seven North American
cities. In May, Hafele sponsored a symposium in San Francisco on
trends, titled ``The Kitchen of the 21st Century,'' which brought
together kitchen designers from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The designers' challenge? To readapt kitchens to meet the
multiple-use needs of ever-busy families, including working
couples, children and longer-living grandparents. Their emphasis?
To make the kitchen practical, versatile and aesthetically
pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   Appliances will be rearranged, walls knocked down and the shapes
of traditional cabinets and counters will change, according to
Wolfgang Hafele. This new kitchen will be more user-friendly and a
more enjoyable place in which to spend time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen will be smarter and more room-like, rather than a
sterile, cold kitchen setting. It will feature more gizmos for
cooking and storing groceries, dishes and so-on,'' said Philip
Martin, product marketing manager for Hafele in Archdale, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes forecast for in early 21st century kitchens:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kitchens will have smaller, auxiliary features and appliances
to accommodate shared cooking duties and reduce congestion.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stove, range and ovens will be spaced out around the
kitchen, instead of being clumped together, for easier
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   _ There will be double sinks, with the second in a central work
island. Soap dispensers will also be built into the sink, as well
as a water-filtration system incorporated into the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appliances, such as the dishwasher and stove, will be raised
for greater accessibility, and may also be hidden behind decorative
wood cabinet panels.
</P>
<P>
   _ An extra table that can be placed in the room if there is
enough space, or in the pantry, will be commonplace for preparation
or paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   _ Space will be concealed in cabinets under counters that can
easily slide out when needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A computer also will play an important role in the efficiency
of the kitchen, from making grocery lists and organizing staples
and recipes to serving as a message center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kitchens also will feature more sophisticated lighting, with
multiple lighting fixtures and dimmers, to provide adjustable mood
or function lighting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pull-down and pull-out cabinets will make things easier to
reach and get to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Counter tops will come in multiple levels to accommodate
people of different ages and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``pet center'' will store pet foods, with dispensers serving
up the animal's dry kibble.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Peterson, a certified kitchen designer and educator in
Brookfield, Conn., noted the walls will be the first thing to go
from yesterday's kitchen. There will be window views, lots of
natural light and open space into the family room to provide for
more family interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the appliances in the kitchen of the not-too-distant
future will also be commercial (restaurant) grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovens will be more customized, so they can handle roasting and
convection cooking all in one unit,'' said Sarah Reep, director of
design for StarMark in Sioux Falls, S.D., and a member of the Color
Marketing Group, a national not-for-profit association in
Alexandria, Va., that predicts color trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the commercial ranges may even be programmed to inject
a burst of steam at intervals, like professional bake ovens,'' Reep
said. ``You may even see rotisserie units. You'll also see pizza
ovens for making restaurant-style pizzas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Zarrillo, kitchen designer with Custom Design Kitchens in
Schenectady, N.Y., said she's finding that many of her customers
are asking for some of these features when remodeling their
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing a lot of unfitted work, where cabinets are all
different heights to look more like standing furniture,'' Zarrillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also adding armoires to give the kitchen a more
room-like appearance and storage space to look like an old butler's
pantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appliances are all high-end stainless steel and when they are
not high end, clients want them concealed behind wood cabinets.
Hood vents over cooking surfaces have become more architecturally
distinctive, with paneling and hand-carved moldings, to give the
kitchen a more friendly feeling,'' Zarrillo said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ellen Cheever, vice president of dealer development for Heritage
Custom Cabinets in New Holland, Pa., predicts the style of kitchens
in the new millennium will be eclectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's family will surround themselves with their
treasures and very personal items,'' Cheever said. ``There will be
a great mix of antique pieces, artwork, photographs, solid wood
cabinets and stainless-steel appliances. Incorporate family history
into a functional part of the kitchen. For example, use grandma's
broken china, to create a custom mosaic backsplash.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever believes the contemporary style will prevail, but
interpreted in natural materials that include granite, concrete and
marble.
</P>
<P>
   An element that will tie the kitchen together is color, Reep
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot cool color for the kitchen of the (early) 21st century
will be blue, such as cobalt and cornflower,'' she said. ``Blues
have a calming effect and are ideal for the kitchen at the end of
the day. Color stains for cabinetry will also be popular, such as
those in soft orange values, like pumpkin or honey. Color will play
a bolder part and be used throughout the kitchen from appliances to
paint and wallpaper to cabinetry.''

FOX TACKLES THE '70S, WARTS AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Even though Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' has
received a slew of Emmy nominations, including best comedy, it's
been a long time since the network developed a hit half-hour
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The wait may be over. Based on the pilot for its latest, ``That
70's Show,'' this could be the funniest new show of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's politically and grammatically incorrect, but the
history and the humor is right on. It helps that the show (which
debuts Sunday, Aug. 23, check local listings) takes place in 1976,
the year of the Bicentennial, with lots of loud colors, and very
cool music. The bad news is, if this show lasts it will have to
revisit disco.
</P>
<P>
   Six teens come of age in a small fictitious Wisconsin town. They
do the normal right-of-passage things for that or even this era:
hang out, listen to music, date, go out of town against their
father's wishes, to a concert, and, yes, smoke pot.
</P>
<P>
   There's been plenty of buzz among critics ever since the pilot
came out (it started out as ``Feelin' Alright'' and has gone
through at least five name changes; there will be a sixth when they
correctly move the apostrophe from ``70's'' to ``'70s.''). While
the buzz about the series is justly deserved, much of the talk has
centered on the ``buzz'' some of the characters get on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, four of the teens are hanging in a
basement, obviously stoned (although the actual smoking is never
shown). They even wave their arms frantically to clear the air when
Eric's (Topher Grace) father calls downstairs for one of the kids.
Eric heads upstairs to talk to Dad; his vision is fine but the
walls are moving. It's funny. It's accurate. But what about ... the
message?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we feel we've written ... is portrayed the '70s, that
era, 1976, in a very honest form,'' said co-executive producer
Bonnie Turner, who with husband and writing partner Terry Turner
created ``3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we would have been criticized if we ignored it,
you know, and criticized if we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   This show has and will come under attack, mainly for showing pot
use in a manner where every kid who takes a hit does not end up in
a hospital, asylum or morgue. And although drug use is portrayed in
the pilot, the producers say it will not be seen in every episode.
</P>
<P>
   How many times did Lou Grant reach into his desk and pull out a
bottle? How many times did Hawkeye and Trapper and B.J. sip
homemade hooch before heading off to the operating room?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a sitcom, this is funny, isn't that its
obligation?
</P>
<P>
   The young actors who play the teens said that they weren't
freaked out playing characters from the flamboyant era. Well, for
the most part anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the fact my parents were alive (and young) then was
creepy,'' said Ashton Kutcher (Michael Kelso), who grew up in a
tiny town in Iowa. But with '70s styles and music having a
mini-renaissance, the whole scene is not too weird for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s are in,'' said Danny Masterson (Steve Hyde). ``I'm
just scared when the '80s come back.''

WILLIAM KENNEDY TACKLES NEW YORK POLITICS IN NEW NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for WRITERS-CLASS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's the big Albany political novel William
Kennedy has always intended to write.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the last four decades assiduously avoiding it, while
publishing seven novels and two books of nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much, too intimidating when I started to write it
in the '60s,'' he said. ``I've collected boxes of research material
since then. I've really been working on it for 40 years, but I'm
just beginning to digest it in a way that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 70, Kennedy is wrestling with the beast.
</P>
<P>
   He unveiled the results of his early grapplings recently before
a capacity crowd of about 150 people at the New York State Summer
Writers Institute on the campus of Skidmore College in Saratoga
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kennedy's first public reading of his novel-in-progress,
a manuscript tentatively titled ``Roscoe.'' He hasn't yet shown any
of it to his publisher, Viking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about sending it to the publisher before
another six months, maybe a year, working on it. Unless I really
need the money,'' he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The group of aspiring authors in residence at the monthlong
writing seminar and Kennedy partisans up from Albany laughed at the
Irish humor, audibly cringed at the macabre descriptions and
marveled at the fabulist imaginings.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the mythic Democratic machine, the novel opens
at a hospital with a Catholic nun who gets drunk on gin proffered
from a patient's flask.
</P>
<P>
   A one-armed man named Specky keeps lopping off the regenerative
stump with a knife and needs to be put away.
</P>
<P>
   The dead speak from the far side of the grave. Memory is itself
a character, generally painful and unresolved, resembling ``a
fireplace full of ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character is Roscoe Conway, a lawyer and bon vivant
operative and one-time actor who's had money and lost it more times
than he cares to remember. Roscoe is one of several protagonists in
the book, which is told through multiple perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy abandoned about 100 pages of an earlier draft that
employed a third-person narrator. ``I didn't like it because I
couldn't hear the voices,'' Kennedy said. ``The focus was all wrong
for the beginning of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The central scene of the opening is the mysterious death of
Elisha Fitzgibbon at age 54. The scion of Fitzgibbon Steel _ a
former lieutenant governor and adviser to FDR, renowned
thoroughbred horse owner, Albany aristocrat and Episcopalian who
befriended the working-class with his common touch _ Kennedy's
fictional creation bears a resemblance to real-life Edwin Corning,
father of Albany Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd.
</P>
<P>
   Upon being sworn in as lieutenant governor in 1933, Elisha
Fitzgibbon said: ``This is a great job for a man with misguided
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   As a novelist, Kennedy can reconstitute personal ambition or the
lack thereof any way he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This novel is strongly based on real people. Dan O'Connell
will be significant and Erastus Corning will be somewhat,'' Kennedy
said. ``But they are characters I've invented out of knowing Dan
and Erastus, out of all the research I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Death, described here as ``a black muse descending,'' is part of
the landscape in Kennedy's fiction. The second chapter of
``Roscoe'' focuses on Elisha Fitzgibbon's wake at the family manse
and orchid conservatory, a device for introducing characters and
the labyrinthine history of Kennedy's Albany cycle of novels.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy McCall, the political boss based on Dan O'Connell and the
central character in Kennedy's play ``Grand View,'' is a central
character. So, too, is Patsy's police chief stooge, O.B., who is
never called by his full name of Oswald Brian Conway.
</P>
<P>
   At the wake, old bums needing some hooch try to put the touch on
Patsy for a fiver.
</P>
<P>
   Beer and politics, the domain of the O'Connells, flows at every
turn of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain is better, but the gin is gone,'' Roscoe tells the
nun in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told the audience he rewrites constantly on his novels
and likes to surprise himself with narrative twists, ``even though
I pretty much know how it's going to end at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the research process is ongoing. But he wants to
use historical material only as a sparkplug and has learned to
avoid the over-researching that caused him to feel like a flooded
engine while writing the novel ``Legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much I try to stay with the real world, it
vanishes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he just finished a screenplay for ``The Flaming
Corsage'' and plans to write another play, no form compares to the
novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel is the biggest challenge,'' he said. ``It's a
killer. Any other kind of writing is easier. The novel is so big
and daunting; you have to know everything about your characters
before you start.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 40-year learning curve on ``Roscoe,'' Kennedy has
finally taken the plunge into his big political novel. We'll be
hearing more of what he's discovered at the core of all those boxes
of notes.

SINKING AND SALVAGE TALES PROVE STORMY ORDEAL FOR SEATTLE WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Author's acknowledgments are often as dry as sand,
that section of a book that is mainly a list of people and places
owed thanks of one kind or another _ supportive friends, helpful
editors, knowledgeable librarians, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   But the author's acknowledgment in the new best seller by
Seattle author Gary Kinder eloquently sets out what it takes to
persevere with a book project that consumes an entire decade, the
sacrifices required, the price extracted in the most personal
terms.
</P>
<P>
   These include the father who joked about not living long enough
to see the book ever published and, in fact, died three years
before it happened. These include two young daughters who grew to
be 11 and 14 during the period of the book's gestation, a time when
they, as Kinder writes,``have hardly known me.'' And these include
a spouse who was closest witness to a writer's obsession, a spouse
who, as Kinder also writes, ``was waiting the whole time, with
dreams of her own. She deserves to have them fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   It is little wonder then that when Kinder's ``Ship of Gold in
the Deep Blue Sea'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 507 pages, $27.50)
recently muscled its way to a high spot on best-seller lists, the
message that conveyed to the writer himself was more spiritual than
monetary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is comforting and reaffirming to know that I didn't waste
all that time,'' Kinder emphasizes. ``My greatest fear when I was
working on the book was that I would finish and it would come out
and people would say, `It's a great story if only Norman Mailer or
some writer like that had gotten there first.' In other words,
they'd be saying, `You blew it!' Because, as a writer, you just
don't know if it's going to turn out well. Even when you've
finished the book, you don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Kinder knows that now. His stirring,
page-turning true tale of the sea was so often a lead title in the
Atlantic Monthly catalog _ only to be postponed again _ that it
became a source of some embarrassment for the publisher. Now,
``Ship of Gold'' has finally been launched and is sailing out of
bookstores, a successful book that, by a strange quirk of fate,
seems perfectly timed in what has increasingly become a marketing
driven industry.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of ``Titanic'' underscored the public's
fascination with stories of tragedy on the high seas. So did the
unexpected best seller ``The Perfect Storm'' by Sebastian Junger.
Now in their wake comes Kinder's book, which melds the best
elements of both those stories, without resorting to either an
imaginary love story or speculative disaster scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the SS Central America in 1857 was the greatest
American sea tragedy of that time, a tale of terror and heroism
widely covered in the newspapers of the day, since more than 400 of
the 600 people on board were lost (but there were still many
survivors with harrowing stories to recount). Also lost was a huge
cargo of gold on its way to New York City from the California gold
fields, a shipment so sizable the financial markets shuddered from
the sinking.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of undamaged artifacts and gold from the Central
America in 1989 _ 200 hundred miles off the Carolina coast and from
the depth of 8,000 feet _ was the greatest feat of underwater
recovery ever, accomplished by an Ohio-based team of
techo-mavericks who had done what all undersea experts advised them
was impossible. And Kinder, after receiving exclusive book access
to the team and their story, was aboard their recovery ship when it
sailed into a Virginia port with gold bars and gold coins that may
be worth $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But combining the two stories of the sinking of the Central
America in a hurricane and the salvage of its precious cargo soon
swamped Kinder. A lawyer turned writer, he had done two non-fiction
books previously _ ``Victim,'' a highly praised and triumphantly
humane account of a monstrous Utah crime and its aftermath, and
``Light Years,'' a much more pedestrian look at UFO investigations.
Neither had really prepared him for what he faced with the Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much information that it was just overwhelming,''
Kinder recalls. ``There was the sinking and all the historical
accounts of it; that research had to be done. Then I had to
research maritime law and, even being a lawyer, maritime law has a
lot of funny little rules and I had to learn all those. Then I had
to research the California Gold Rush. I realized early on that my
biggest problem was going to be how to structure this story and how
much history to use.''
</P>
<P>
   This mother lode of golden material was so strong that Kinder
could easily have written two books, one on the sinking, one on the
salvage. He had great characters from both, including William
Herndon, the heroic captain of the Central America who had been the
first American to explore the Amazon, and Ansel and Adaline Mills
Easton, who had been married in California just before departure
for New York, their bags packed with newlywed dreams and presents
for their life ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Tommy Thompson, the brilliant, yet eccentric Ohio
scientist who masterminded the salvage efforts, an intense
iconoclast who despised being called a ``treasure hunter'' since he
believed he was an original thinker pursuing a higher scientific
calling. As Kinder writes, ``Working on the bottom of the deep
ocean wasn't impossible, it was only considered impossible, and
that was the distinction Tommy had learned: Other people labeled
things impossible not because they couldn't be done, but because no
one was doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of Kinder's own writing mission, in some ways,
paralleled Thompson's task. What seems obvious now _ that the
stories of the sinking and the salvage needed to be woven together
in alternating chapters _ proved elusive. So Morgan Entrekin, the
publisher and editor at Atlantic Monthly, flew from New York a
dozen times to huddle with Kinder in a Seattle hotel room, trying
to solve the various dilemmas with the manuscript through rewrite
after rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   There were times the two colleagues and friends, who had worked
together on Kinder's two previous books, could barely stand the
sight of each other. There were times, too, when Kinder felt he had
``hit the writer's wall and couldn't write any more.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Kinder's advance of more than $100,000 for the
much-postponed book had all been spent and he and his family were
living instead on the money he makes from teaching writing seminars
for lawyers across the country. That income proved a lifesaver for
the book-battered writer and his family, although the seminars did
take time away from the writing.
</P>
<P>
   But the manuscript was finally wrestled into a publishable
shape, to everyone's great relief. But that proved short-lived
indeed when Thompson demanded postponement because of the
unresolved legal battles with insurance companies over the rights
to the recovered treasure. Thompson wanted a four-year delay before
publication; Entrekin and Kinder reluctantly agreed to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really devastating,'' Kinder remembers. ``We had
spent so much time and we thought we had a book then.''
</P>
<P>
   The book no doubt benefited from the revisions that continued
during that period, but the waiting and wondering extracted a toll
that may never quite be overcome by how much the book earns or how
much is paid in the current bidding for movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   As Kinder relates, ``The toughest part on a marriage when you
write a book is that you can spend three, four, five years of your
life _ or, in this case, 10 _ and then at the end of it, they hand
you a lottery ticket. If you're lucky, your number comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so many things can go wrong and you have to navigate
through so many difficulties, what could be project-killing
difficulties. So this is definitely not something I would advise
other people to do.''

WHEN FOOD WATCHDOGS GO TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It being summer, my wife and I snuck a few days to
go hit golf balls and hang with my saintly mother-in-law. For some
reason, visiting her is about the only time I eat potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   This year, like a phenomenal number of weight-conscious
consumers, this delightful Mississippian had switched brands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of her usual fare, she had switched to one of the new
kinds containing the fat substitute called Olestra, from Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co., that has taken off like no other new product in the
'90s off its claims that with no change in taste you can snack
moderately with a lot less fat and considerably fewer calories.
What has started in some potato chips and a cracker could
eventually spread very far.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to see for myself, having just witnessed the latest
round in a decade-long fight against the additive by the Center for
Science in the Public Interest _ a Ralph Nader spinoff of long
standing around here.
</P>
<P>
   From casual acquaintaince with this dispute, I was on notice
that the watchdogs were raising the kinds of digestive consequences
that all fastidious Americans fear _ cramps, etc.
</P>
<P>
   So each day, I had a couple of ounces of my mother-in-law's
potato chips and waited to see if Vesuvius would remain quiet. And,
of course, it did _ as has been the case for nearly everyone who
snacks with at least some restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This was basically what a Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee concluded last month in calling the Center for Science's
widely disseminated fears baseless, but continuing to recommend a
label cautioning consumers about digestive problems in the context
of immoderate use.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than good enough for me, as it should be for
everyone. But the battle is certain to go on, which ought to be an
occasion for some critical thinking about the condition of
watchdoggery in general these days.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Naderite contribution to our culture for the
last 30 years (huge and overwhelmingly positive) has been the
exposure of products where scientific evidence about causation
shows clear and actual or potentially widespread danger. From cars
to bad meat, this function has been performed in the face of
industry and governmental timidity and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently the watchdog function has become polluted with
concepts not of danger put of more preachy notions of what one
group of activists thinks is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, for example, the Center and its indefatiguable,
ever-quotable director, Michael Jacobson, has railed against ethnic
food _ especially Chinese, Italian, and Mexican. The campaign
against Olestra did not come out of the blue, but it is
illustrative in its blurring of scientific evidence of real danger
and broader concepts of nutrition philosophy. The problem with this
is that it dilutes the meaning of warnings when they truly need to
be serious.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Olestra, Jacobson calls it ``crazy'' to permit
the use of an additive with no nutritional value, and he is trying
to get the FDA to revoke its approval. Now he wants to petition the
Federal Trade Commission to halt the major advertising campaign
behind the product.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign doesn't come out of thin air. Olestra, a synthetic
fat, is the combination of various vegetable oils and table sugar.
The phony fat molecule is made so large that it cannot be
metabolized and leaves the body intact. That's why it's called
no-fat, that's why there are much fewer calories, but that's also
why (in laymen's terms) it can go right through you and why you
should eat it in moderation to avoid stomach problems. For
analogous reasons, I wouldn't recommend eating an entire package of
apricots, either.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's Center offered anecdotal evidence off its Web site of
consumer complaints not otherwise examined, but it confined itself
before the FDA panel to criticizing Procter &AMP; Gamble's actual
studies. The FDA group was not impressed, and even its decision to
leave the mild caution intact can be criticized as self-protecting
rather than consumer-protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, however, the battle was escalated to include
the ``C'' word. It is a fact that Olestra will take with it four
fat-soluble vitamins if it encounters them (A, D, E, and K) along
with carotenoids that may or may not protect the body from cancer
(science remains unclear).
</P>
<P>
   That was a cheap shot. In the normal course of regulatory
events, the Olestra makers have already fortified their product
with the four vitamins. As for carotenoids, not only is the cancer
protection unverified, the center's late hit ignored a simple fact:
Olestra sweeps these substances out only if they are in the system.
It wouldn't hurt those who, for example, gobble beta-carotene pills
every morning to wait before eating potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if we're not careful, does consumer protection and policy
advocacy degenerate toward farce.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Olestra's potential to help an overweight
society lighten up dwarfs potential problems almost entirely
associated with excessive consumption. The fact also is that
wolf-crying endangers the credibility advocacy groups need when
real dangers are at hand. And the fact is I have another reason to
look forward to my next visit to my mother-in-law's.

CELLUCCI KEEPS QUIET ON SOFT MONEY GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing a loophole in campaign finance laws, Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci has declined to reveal the source of
hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations he
solicited recently from a host of Massachusetts corporations and
wealthy Republican donors.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, through his aides, declined Monday to divulge the
names and the amounts of each of the special interest donations
that his fund-raising operation collected as part of an event on
June 26 during the Republican Governors' Association meeting in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The money was raised for a national Republican Party account
that is governed by federal campaign finance law. Neither state nor
federal law requires Cellucci, who in the past has called for
campaign finance reform and a ban on so-called soft money
donations, to disclose where the contributions came from or the
amount of the individual donations.
</P>
<P>
   The national party will distribute the money to state party
organizations, which then will decide how much to allocate to each
candidate in the general election. How much Cellucci's campaign for
governor will benefit for his fund-raising efforts for the national
party if he becomes the Republican nominee is not known. Republican
Party sources estimate that Cellucci, using his chief fund-raiser
James Connolly, GOP national Republican committeeman Ron Kaufman,
and Boston businessman Herbert Collins, raised about $300,000 at
the event from corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Massachusetts state law, which limits the amount of
donations to the state parties at $5,000 per person, there is no
restriction on contributions to the national party organizations.
In addition, unlike state law, there is no restriction on corporate
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Such donations are called ``soft money'' because they can skirt
state laws and be hidden from public examination. Cellucci in the
past has sharply attacked the use of soft money by political
parties, but defended his raising it, saying he and other GOP
officeholders need the funds so long as Democrats finance their
attacks on him and others with soft money.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton visited Massachusetts earlier this year to
raise money for the Democratic National Committee. Some of that
money will be spent for the benefit of Massachusetts Democrats in
the general election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, state elected officials of both parties, particularly
governors, have taken to raising money for national political
committees, money that is often then returned to help finance state
and local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the federal loophole, Cellucci is taking advantage of
a state law that does not require office-holders to disclose
contributions raised for out-of-state candidates. Although a 1994
state campaign finance reform bill contained a special provision
calling for disclosure for money raised for out-of-state
candidates, the section applies only to money raised for
individuals. National political committees and other organizations
that distribute money to candidates are not covered, leaving
Cellucci free to refuse a Globe request for the list of donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a legitimate interest in knowing where these
donations come from,'' said Joshua Friedes, executive director of
Common Cause of Massachusetts. ``I think we need to ask ourselves
whose interest is being served by the acting governor's refusal to
provide this information. Certainly it's not the public's
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedes and other campaign finance reform advocates have
referred to such soft-money donations as ``money laundering''
because it allows politicians to skirt local campaign finance
regulations and raise huge amounts of money from special interests
that have business pending before the state.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's campaign manager, Rob Gray, Monday referred all
inquiries to the Republican Governors' Association. He said it
would be improper for the acting governor to release contributions
made to the Republican Governors' Association, even those solicited
by Cellucci and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped raise money for this event so the Republicans would
not be at a disadvantage when Democrats pour millions of dollars in
soft money into Massachusetts in the fall,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cellucci's opponent, Joe Malone, would benefit from
the donations Cellucci helped raise if he upsets the acting
governor in the September primary.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Republican Governors' Association said the
group could not provide a breakdown for the contributions Cellucci
and his supporters raised for the national Republican Party. But a
press aide, Kirsten Fedeway, said the association was ``pleasantly
surprised'' at the total, saying it was above original estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly because Massachusetts is seen as such a
Democratic state where Republicans are not as strong,'' Fedeway
said. She also said other governors in the Northeast had helped to
raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Governors' Association's federal disclosure
reports do not list which donations were solicited by Cellucci and
his fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, as he pushed his legislation to ban soft money from
state campaigns, Cellucci said: ``The bottom line is that special
interest groups are able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity and
the voters are left in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 26 fund-raiser was set up as a cruise around Boston
Harbor during the weekend that the Republican Governors'
Association and 31 other GOP governors met in Boston. Contributions
ranged from $5,000 for an annual membership in the Republican
Governors' Club to $40,000 for a seat on the association's board
and access to national GOP affairs.

THE NEW, CONFIDENT IRISH-AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE NEW IRISH AMERICANS 
By Ray O'Hanlon 
Roberts Rinehart, 246 pp., Illustrated, $15.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you haven't noticed, the Irish are on something of a
roll, both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If some people were surprised that ``The Beauty Queen of
Lenane'' won four Tony awards, the Irish weren't. In fact, they
thought it should have gotten best play, too. There is an
unprecedented confidence in Ireland, where the booming economy is
considered Europe's most robust, a confidence that helped to
produce, finally, an agreement on how to share the island. It is a
confidence manifesting itself among the natives and the hyphenated,
i.e., Irish-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few voices as perceptive in chronicling that
confidence and the changes among Irish-Americans as Ray O'Hanlon,
who has used his perch as senior editor at the Irish Echo in New
York to chart the rising political and economic clout of an ethnic
group that most people assumed had already made it. In his new
book, O'Hanlon's portraits of 1980s immigrants and 1990s political
activists show how the Irish have reinvented themselves to make it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Irish famine of 150 years ago, the relationship
between the United States and Ireland has been interdependent.
America supplied the economic sustenance that Ireland could not.
Ireland supplied the bodies who dug the canals, built the railways,
wrote the newspapers, and, after a few generations, ran the banks
and multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, however, the vast majority of those 40 million or
so who list themselves on the US census as being of Irish ancestry
became assimilated to a point that their ancestry had little to do
with the land of their forebears. O'Hanlon argues that the new
Irish-Americans are those who over the past 15 years have brought a
level of sophistication to political, business, and social life
that is more reflective of modern Ireland, an increasingly secular,
pluralistic, and affluent poster child of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon shows how pragmatism has replaced dogma. The activists
who got more visas for young Irish did not rely on mere
sentimentality, he explains, but used empirical evidence to show
that the young Irish were putting more into the system than they
were taking out.
</P>
<P>
   His account of the dispute over whether a gay group should be
allowed to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade perfectly
frames his argument that there are at least two types of
Irish-Americans: the ``Irish Irish,'' who are old-fashioned and
close-minded about what being Irish constitutes, and the ``New
Irish,'' who are more open-minded and less dogmatic about religion,
politics, and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Conor O'Clery's fascinating book, ``Daring
Diplomacy,'' which, when published in Ireland was called ``The
Greening of the White House,'' gave an intricate explanation of how
the Clinton administration became deeply involved in the Northern
Ireland peace process. O'Hanlon paints a broader picture,
explaining how and why Irish-Americans were in a position to exert
such pressure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon describes how the Irish government was able to get the
White House to consider Dublin's view on equal footing with London,
America's staunchest military ally and its biggest foreign
investor. He focuses a spotlight on some of the lesser-known
figures who contributed to the greening of America. One of them was
Dermot Brangan, who through much of the 1990s was the Irish
government's press officer in New York. With the persistence of a
salesman, Brangan kept knocking on doors and making phone calls,
getting in to see influential editorial writers at the biggest
newspapers. His persistence was rewarded by a greening of American
editorial pages, a process O'Hanlon demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, O'Hanlon has some nice
things to say about this newspaper, but he balances them by
leveling criticism also. That is a strength of the book. The Irish
are notorious for kissing their allies and beating up their
enemies, especially the British, in print. O'Hanlon is scrupulously
fair, though just how objective an Irishman can be when the British
enter the equation is a subject worthy of a book in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the late William Shannon gave an overview of the Irish
in America has anyone provided as worthwhile and readable an
account of how the Irish arrived, again. During this Year of the
Irish, it is a welcome addition.

SUMMER NIGHT'S A NO-GLOW WITHOUT FIREFLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no fireflies in Seattle because they get turned on and
burn out too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Local beetles belonging to the firefly family don't demonstrate
that characteristic bioluminescence their cousin beetles use east
of the Rocky Mountains. But why they don't seem to flash west of
the Rockies has been a puzzlement to us former flatlanders who
associate fireflies with deep-summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   Known also in the flat Midwestern vernacular as ``lightnin'
bugs,'' these silent sentinels of summer evening are as much a sign
of true summer in the nation's midsection as popping Scotch broom
seed pods are here in Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   We transplants truly miss those back-home beetles as much as we
don't miss Midwest mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   I wince now to recall how we mistreated those thousands, nay,
millions and gazillions of fireflies that punctuated our childhood
summer evenings with pale yellow twinkles at about bellybutton
level.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did we incarcerate jillions of them in Mason jars,
making ersatz lanterns, but we also commonly made ``firefly
rings.'' That is, we caught a firefly and ripped off the flashing
lower abdomen, pasting the pulp onto our fingers to create little
glowing jewels. Children who wouldn't think of ripping the wings
off butterflies would dash into the summer evening, prepared to rip
apart the fragile little bodies of 10 fireflies, one for each
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I miss them. After the sun has plopped behind the
Olympics or into the Pacific Ocean or just behind the apartment
building across the street, and the sky turns gold and pink and
blue, and then lavender and dark blue ... this is when fireflies
should start twinkling in cadence with cricket chirps.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, I thought the answer was bats. Never before,
certainly not back in the Midwest, have I ever seen as many bats as
I do around my Woodinville digs once the sun goes down. And that's
just fine with me, because as summer wears on, I figure the bats
will gorge on the summer swarms of termites that pose real threats.
</P>
<P>
   But I attributed the lack of fireflies, as well, to those zippy
little bats aiming their radar-guided stomachs at the thousands of
flying insects. It was a trade-off, I figured, for the relative
scarcity of mosquitoes here in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds semiscientific, but hardly sexy. And sex, I suggest, is
what the Great Firefly Shortage really is all about, hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally thought that most adult fireflies west of the
Rocky Mountains do not light up. Some firefly eggs and wormlike
larvae display a modicum of bioluminescence, hence the term
``glowworm.'' But adults _ we're talking fireflies here _ in this
area just don't get turned on like they do back East.
</P>
<P>
   I postulate that they don't light up because our Puget Sound
fireflies are oversexed, and that firefly foreplay leads to their
speedy elimination. Thus, the perceived lack of fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Stay with me on this: It is generally accepted that fireflies _
seeking to do in the summer evening the same thing many of us are
seeking, if not doing _ signal their availability. But they flash
their message in a firefly code that you and I cannot see or
decipher.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, female fireflies shamelessly flash phony codes to attract
male fireflies under false pretenses. When they have the males in
their cold coleopteran grasp, they murder them. Talk about sting
operations gone bad!
</P>
<P>
   And even before the hapless male can literally turn on, his
lights get punched out. She eats him!
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this overaggressiveness of the female Puget Sound firefly
eventually made most of the male fireflies retreat back over the
Rocky Mountains. On their way, they commissioned a huge billboard
some of you may remember:
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the last firefly leaving Seattle please turn out his
light!''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, would I lie to you?

`PARENT TRAP' CAPTURES CHARM OF EARLIER FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the Disney Co. has become such a
purveyor of junked-up, low-humor comedies (``RocketMan,''
``Krippendorf's Tribe'') that critics shudder every time one of its
various logos appear on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of this insensitive bunch remaking one of
Walt's better live-action movies from a more innocent era _ the
1961 Hayley Mills hit, ``The Parent Trap'' _ is further cause for
alarm. It seems a particularly plum opportunity for cultural
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   But surprise! A few too many Nickelodeon-style slime jokes
aside, this remake assiduously avoids the new-Disney low-humor
route. It's not high art but it's uniformly well-cast, reasonably
funny and finally a charming little family heartwarmer.
</P>
<P>
   The story, you may recall, is about two young look-alike girls
(both played by Lindsay Lohan) who meet cute one summer at a posh
Maine girls' camp and gradually discover, after much animosity,
that they're twins separated at birth by divorced parents.
</P>
<P>
   Twin One, Hallie, went to live with her American father (Dennis
Quaid) on his Napa Valley winery; Twin Two, Annie, went to live
with her British clothes designer mother (Natasha Richardson) in
her Mayfair townhouse. Neither twin previously knew of the other's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, the twins decide to switch identities so they can
get to know the parent they've never officially met, and maybe even
bring the estranged couple back together romantically. A
conspiracy, as it were, to trap their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The original benefited greatly from Mills' tomboyish charm and
remains her best-remembered role. It was also one of Disney's most
popular live-action movies of the '60s, and had TV-movie sequels in
1986 and '89 (with a grown-up Mills being trapped by kids of her
own).
</P>
<P>
   This new script by the writer-director-producer team of Nancy
Meyers and Charles Shyer (``Baby Boom,'' ``Father of the Bride'')
credits David Swift's original (which was, in turn, based on a 1954
British movie, ``Twice Upon a Time'') and follows it so closely
that both movies have ended up being exactly 124 minutes long!
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Meyers and Shyer also had the backbone to resist the
pressures to ``modernize'' (that is, junk up) the proceedings with
the flatulence jokes and other vulgar elements new-Disney has come
to institutionally believe are absolutely essential to connect with
young audiences of our crasser time.
</P>
<P>
   The casting works. The 10-year-old, exquisitely freckled-faced
Lindsay Lohan may not have Mills' unique star appeal, but she's
quite endearing as each of the twins; and Quaid and Richardson seem
even more likable _ and destined for a reunion _ than their
predecessors, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   In other roles, Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter do well as the
girls' respective housekeepers and surrogate parents. And Elaine
Hendrix is splendidly hateful as the biggest threat to family
unity: a scheming publicist out to trap Dad herself. (Joanna
Barnes, who played this part in the original, does a cameo as the
character's mother).
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the new ``Parent Trap'' seems to have put a great
deal of its budget into its visuals, and the production was _
rather unlikely _ designed by Hollywood's top art director, Dean
Tavoularis, who usually finds employment in the biggest Oscar-class
epics and star vehicles (``Apocalypse Now,'' ``The Godfather,''
``Bonnie and Clyde'').
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely possible, of course, that the film's attention to
travelogue beauty has more to do with the new Hollywood's strategy
of defraying costs with internal ``product placement'' _ and the
British Air logo is very prominently displayed. But, commercial or
no, London and the California wine country have rarely looked quite
so gorgeous on film.
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap. Directed by Nancy Meyers. Written by Meyers and
Charles Shyer from David Swift's 1954 version. Cast: Dennis Quaid,
Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan. Walt Disney Pictures. 124
minutes. Rated PG.

   WASHINGTON _ Last week's shooting at the US Capitol that left
two police officers dead and a woman injured has shaken many
Republicans who favor the right of law-abiding citizens to bear
arms. But few predict it will soften their opposition to gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should cower to the fear imposed on us
Friday,'' said Representative Howard Coble, a Republican from North
Carolina. ``If you are opposed to gun-control laws, you should
still be opposed to gun-control laws, what happened Friday
notwithstanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither side of the debate seems to have shifted
position since Russell Eugene Weston Jr., who authorities said has
a history of mental illness, allegedly stormed into the Capitol,
killing Detective John M. Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut, and
wounding tourist Angela Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was assigned to protect House majority whip Tom DeLay,
and a colleague of the Texas congressman said DeLay has grieved for
Gibson as he would a brother. But DeLay continues to oppose gun
control, said John Feehery, DeLay's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has ``just magnified differences in the debate. Some
people say if more people had guns, we could have defended
ourselves better against this kind of crazy gunman,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control opponents on Capitol Hill acknowledge that the
tragedy is likely to reopen the issue, but they are determined not
to allow the other side to capitalize on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even through the mourning period yet,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate majority leader Trent Lott. ``If
people on the one side or the other want to use this as sort of a
gun-control debate, I don't think there's much appetite right now
to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Coble, argue that the District of Columbia bans
handguns but has a crime problem nonetheless. ``The guy who is
going to violate the law, he is going to find a way to get his hand
on the guns,'' Coble said.
</P>
<P>
   One irony of the shooting is that it has temporarily stopped the
House Judiciary Committee from considering, for the first time, a
bill that would create a national standard for carrying a concealed
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, postponed
Tuesday's meeting ``out of respect to the memory of the slain
officers,'' said his spokesman, Sam Stratman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, any person with a permit to carry a
firearm in one state would be allowed to use that same permit in
the 29 other states that allow concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Representative Randy Cunningham, a
Republican from California, would also allow any qualified current
or former law enforcement officer to carry a concealed handgun. The
provision on the portability of permits was introduced by
Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican who is
chairman of the subcommittee on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat from Lowell and
member of the crime subcommittee, opposes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there will be politics involved in what legislation
we deal with between now and Aug. 7, and what legislation we don't
deal with,'' said Meehan, referring to the date the House is
scheduled to begin its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc., a gun-control
lobbying group, said about the bill, ``It doesn't matter if it is
considered three days or three years after such a shooting, it
still poses a risk to public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose
husband was killed and son seriously wounded in the Long Island
Rail Road shooting five years ago, is hopeful some of her
colleagues will rethink the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just watching a number of members of Congress who are
certainly pro-guns and seeing their heartfelt sadness, maybe it
came a little closer to home,'' she said. ``We lost two wonderful
men here on the Capitol. I always believe that sometimes things
happen for a reason. Maybe this happened to put some focus on it.''

`NEGOTIATOR' DOES FRESH TWIST ON THE COP MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood has cranked out so many hundreds of cop movies since
``The French Connection'' began the modern incarnation of the genre
more than 25 years ago that it's almost impossible for one to seem
fresh and original anymore. Yet, for all its flaws, ``The
Negotiator'' does just that.
</P>
<P>
   Its hero is Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson), an ace Chicago
police department hostage negotiator: a man skilled in reading the
subtle signs of various hostile psychological types, and
manipulating them into vulnerable situations or into giving up
their hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But Danny has a big problem. When his partner is murdered
shortly after telling him about a huge internal conspiracy within
the department to skim from their pension fund, Danny is framed to
take the fall for both the murder and the embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   What does he do? He bursts into the office of the crooked
internal affairs officer (the late J.T. Walsh) and takes the man,
his secretary and a bystander hostage. So the tables are turned.
The negotiator is the hostage-taker, and another negotiator (Kevin
Spacey) has to come in to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good premise, and the solid script (by James DeMonaco and
Kevin Fox) and nail-biting direction (by F. Gary Gray) make the
most of it, for at least three-fourths of the running time. The
portion of the film set within the confined space of the besieged
office is simply first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has rarely been better, and he seems more like a movie
star here than in possibly any film he's ever made. With his aura
of street smarts and his gift of gab, he's totally convincing as a
negotiator, and he also makes us believe his character's Kafkaesque
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the movie doesn't know when to let well enough
alone and ultimately wears out its welcome. Almost as if it doesn't
know how effective it is as a psychological drama, the script
finally disintegrates into a series of unlikely action scenes and
contrived plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   And why does the movie have to be so darn long _ an exhausting
two hours and 21 minutes? Obviously, a lot of that extra time is to
give co-star Spacey _ who doesn't make his entrance until 40
minutes into the movie _ some big scenes in the last act.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that, as engaging a movie presence as Spacey
undeniably is, his character is basically irrelevant to the
dramatic arc of this story. He's there entirely for his marquee
value, and the bulk of his hefty but supporting role just seems
like unnecessary padding.
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator. Directed by F. Gary Gray. Written by James
DeMonaco and Kevin Fox. Cast: Samuel L. Jackson, Kvin Spacey,
David Morse, J.T. Walsh. Warner Bros. 141 minutes. Rated R for
violence.
</P>

   Grade: B

LOST IN A LEXICAL LABYRINTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Constant reader Bill Thoen e-mailed not long ago to question a
Globe editorial on labyrinth walking. A labyrinth, the writer had
declared, is not the same as a maze; while a maze is purposely
confusing, with dead ends and confusing turns, a labyrinth is flat
on the ground and entirely visible, with one continuous path to the
center and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did the Globe get those unique definitions?'' asked
Thoen. His Bulfinch's told him that the Minotaur of Greek myth had
been imprisoned in a labyrinth, and the bull-headed monster could
hardly have been penned in by a path marked on the ground. Nor
would Theseus, who finally slew the Minotaur, have needed Ariadne's
ball of string to find his way out of such a structure. And Thoen's
dictionaries assured him that a labyrinth was a maze, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, most of the time, a labyrinth is indeed a maze.
But there is a difference between unicursal mazes _ those with only
one path to the center _ and multicursal mazes, with their wrong
turnings and dead ends. The unicursal maze, or labyrinth, may be a
long and winding road, but it offers no choices. Multicursal mazes
_ like the pencil puzzles in newspapers and the hedge maze that
baffled Jack Nicholson in ``The Shining'' _ are made for getting
lost in.
</P>
<P>
   Both labyrinth and maze have been in the language since the 14th
century, and most often we use them figuratively, and
interchangeably, to describe any confusing territory: the plot of
``The Big Sleep,'' the federal tax code, the streets of Boston. But
the revival of labyrinth walking has brought back the long-dormant
distinction between the words. People who walk the path of a
labyrinth as a meditative exercise _ and over the past decade,
thousands of people have taken up the practice _ want it understood
that their course is not a confusion of choices but a simple route
to clarity.
</P>
<P>
   This push for precision has come upon us very suddenly; as
recently as 1992, a New York Times story about labyrinth walking
treated labyrinth and maze as synonyms. In the years since,
newspaper stories on the practice have begun to include a paragraph
explaining the difference _ often in a tone of offhand authority
that implies you ought to know it already. But the issue isn't
quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring on the Internet _ a wonderful maze of labyrinth lore _
I found that puzzle mazes of the wrong-turn, dead-end variety seem
to be quite recent inventions, unknown till the late 17th century.
(Labyrinths, by contrast, are ancient designs, starting with the
Minotaur's holding pen in Crete and reproduced in Roman mosaics, in
Christian churches, in British and Finnish fields.) If that's so,
the words maze and labyrinth were truly synonymous in English for
more than three centuries, since they both described the only kind
of maze around before the late 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   This history also suggests that the Minotaur's labyrinth was a
unicursal maze, though presumably one with high walls to confine
both the monster and his sacrificial victims. That makes it sound
simple, but as one Web wizard points out, a high-walled, one-path
labyrinth could be just as confusing to a first-time explorer as
the most devious maze; Theseus had no way of knowing he didn't need
his ball of string. And even an open labyrinth is a puzzlement in
its way, leading the walker first near the goal, then unexpectedly
away once more. Today's labyrinths may look superficial, but the
word retains its freight of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with reviving the distinction between the
two words, now that labyrinth has a special meaning for a
particular (and growing) band of devotees. In fact, any word fan
who has ever bemoaned the loss of a nice semantic distinction is
bound to applaud this development. But let's not get rigid about
it: For everyday figurative use, to describe a baffling
bureaucratic or geographic thicket, either maze or labyrinth _ as
taste and rhythm dictate _ will continue to be just fine.

Jumbotron hawking wares with the logo of the All-Star game coming
to Boston next summer. It wasn't the hustling he minded, but the
news that 1999 All-Star ``souvenirs'' were ``on sale now.'' A
souvenir, of course, is a reminder, a token of something you've
experienced (from the French for remember). Unless those $15
baseball caps have very special powers, they aren't likely to evoke
memories of next year's game.

HOUSE RACE SHOWS LABOR'S WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saying that ``labor creates all wealth'' may apply to the
8th Massachusetts Congressional District, where labor is wealthy in
the number of candidates who are strong supporters of unions,
organized labor, and working families.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 8th congressional race has so many such candidates
that the Massachusetts AFL-CIO decided not to endorse any of them,
making it the only one of the nine congressional races that
received no endorsement from the 400,000-member organization.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong, politically pragmatic reasons why the
executive council decided not to give an endorsement in the
most-publicized congressional race in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rogers, field director for the state AFL-CIO, said one
reason was the fact that all but possibly two of the 10 candidates
support the state AFL-CIO's agenda and it is virtually a certainty
that one of the pro-labor candidates will be elected to succeed US
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, who decided earlier this year
to not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it made no sense for us to try to pick one
candidate from a field packed with proven allies,'' Rogers said.
Rather, he added, ``our resources are being allocated to the Third
and Sixth congressional districts, where the outcome could have
enormous national significance.``
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was referring to the congressional re-election bids of
Representative John F. Tierney of Salem (6th District), who will be
again facing former GOP Representative Peter G. Torkildsen of
Danvers, whom Tierney narrowly defeated in 1996 by a slim margin;
and Representative James P. McGovern of Worcester (3d District),
who will be facing the GOP challenger, state Senator Matthew J.
Amorello of Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the state's congressional races, in which some Democrats
are unopposed, Tierney's and McGovern's apparently are the only
races where there are serious GOP bids to unseat the two Democrats.
The state AFL-CIO as well as the candidates themselves expect the
national GOP to help Amorello and Torkildsen.
</P>
<P>
   If one or both of two Democrats are defeated, it would further
erode the Democrats' chances of retaking control of the US House of
Representatives this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 8th district race, the AFL-CIO and other labor
activists apparently view it as one that is virtually assured to be
in the ``win'' column this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 candidates, including Raymond L. Flynn, former
Boston Mayor and former US ambassador to the Vatican; Majorie
Clapprood, former Sharon state representative and talk show host;
Mike Capuano, mayor of Somerville; Susan Tracy, former state
representative from Allston-Brighton; George Bachrach, former state
senator from Watertown; Charles Yancey, Boston City Councilor; John
O'Connor, businessman and environmental activist; and Alex
Rodgriguez, former state and federal government official.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidates who might not have the least chance of
winning an AFL-CIO endorsement, had there been one, would have been
Boston City Councilor Thomas Keane, who opposed the labor-supporter
living wage ordinance in Boston; and venture capitalist Christoper
Gabrieli, whose support for charter schools runs counter to the
Boston Teachers Union stance on these schools.
</P>
<P>
   While some unions are quietly watching this 8th congressional
race from the sidelines, other unions have been quietly lending
their support this year to some of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, who is considered by political pundits to be the
frontrunner at this stage of the election, has been actively
seeking, and receiving, the backing of some labor unions. Others
also receiving labor support include Tracy, Capuano, and Clapprood,
based largely on their current and past alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor groups are also looking at O'Connor, who is viewed by
some political analysts as the candidate who sounds more like
Kennedy in his ads and his campaign visits.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if one of the eight candidates who supports labor's
agenda wins in Novemer -- as most political assessments suggest --
the state AFL-CIO, the umbrella group for organized labor in
Massachusetts, also wins. That is what these endorsements, and even
the lack thereof, are all about.

BELL ATLANTIC-GET MERGER WOULD CREATE LARGEST LOCAL PHONE FIRM

<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., which already has been angling to provide
long-distance service on its home turf of New York, could catapult
into the $70 billion-a-year long-distance market nationwide if its
merger takes place with GTE Corp., an independent phone company
with two million long-distance customers.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bell operating company, which has a virtual
monopoly on local phone service from Maine to Virginia, is
reportedly in merger negotiations with GTE, which has far-flung
local phone operations in 28 states, with a strong presence in
parts of Florida, Texas and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Initial estimates are that a Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would be
valued at about $55 billion. That price would be less than GTE's
recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   GTE Monday closed at 55, down 2 3/16, while Bell Atlantic was
off 3/16, ending at 45.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would be the nation's largest local
telephone company in revenue, with $53 billion in yearly sales and
62 million local telephone lines in 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic-GTE combination would continue the breakneck
pace of telecommunications industry consolidation this year as
phone companies merge to take advantage of newly deregulated
markets and new technology.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic and the other Baby Bells that have monopolies
on local service, long-distance has been their most sought-after
prize in the last decade. The possibility of getting into
long-distance became even more tantalizing after passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. While the act allowed the Baby
Bells to enter new markets, it bars them from offering
long-distance until they open their own local phone markets to
competition. So far, none of the regional Bells have met the act's
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic hopes to be the first local phone company to offer
long-distance. In New York, it has reached an agreement with state
regulators and the United States Justice Department to allow some
competitors to tie into its phone switches. If the New York
proposal is carried out to the satisfaction of the Federal
Communications Commission, Bell Atlantic would become the first
Baby Bell to offer long-distance on its home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's potential union with GTE would be the second leg
of its grand strategy to become a nationwide long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic will have a two-pronged long-distance strategy
if this deal goes through _ one for its backyard and the other for
the rest of the country, or otherwise the Federal Communications
Commission would not be happy,'' said Ford D. Cavallari, &UR;  &LR; vice
president at Renaissance Worldwide, a Newton-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   GTE, in theory, would let Bell Atlantic offer long-distance over
much of the country. Unlike the regional Bell companies, GTE, an
independent phone company offering long-distance service in 50
states, isn't bound by the same restrictions of the telecom act.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bell Atlantic-GTE would still have to comply with
the act in the 13 states that Bell Atlantic currently serves, the
merger would give Bell Atlantic clear sailing with long-distance
customers in much of the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts maintained that Bell Atlantic's use of
GTE as a launching pad for long-distance might not pass antitrust
scrutiny. A Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would be examined with a fine
tooth comb, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said one sticking point may be that Bell Atlantic
may not be allowed under the telcommunications act to pick up GTE's
long-distance customers in the 13 Eastern states. Analysts
speculated that GTE could be required to shed some of its
long-distance customers in the east as a condition for regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect regulators to have a heyday with this one,'' said
Jeffrey Kagan, president of Kagan Telecom  &UR;  &LR; Associates, an Atlanta
telecommunications market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts noted that GTE's long-distance capabilities _
plus its other services such as Internet access and wireless
technology _ could help Bell Atlantic compete against other Baby
Bells. GTE offers Bell Atlantic ``a perfect position from which to
launch a competitive attack from within another Bell's region,''
said Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that GTE is the local phone company in the
Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, while BellSouth controls the
rest of the state. Bell Atlantic could use Raleigh-Durham to attack
BellSouth's dominance in North Carolina. Bell Atlantic could then
claim that its merger with GTE increases competition, Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic and GTE can demonstrate to regulators that they
will vigorously compete in long-distance against other regional
Bell companies, Kagan maintained, the merger will be in the
public's interest and should win approval. ``Without this promise,
the deal will be self-serving and have a really rough ride on the
regulatory roller coaster,'' said Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   GTE has had a checkered career in long-distance service.
Initially, it created Sprint and later sold it. In 1997, it tried
unsuccessully to acquire MCI Communications Corp. But it succeeded
last year in acquiring BBN Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., a leading
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it offers its predominantly suburban customers local and
long-distance phone service, Internet access, wireless and paging
services.

ANGELO A GOOD BET AT SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Saratoga meeting begins Wednesday and the many fans who will
head to The Spa, which will be open through Labor Day, are looking
for handicapping tips that will make a day at the most charming of
racetracks even more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, better to ask than John Angelo, an expert of the
Saratoga races, who will be there every day of the meet? Angelo's
credentials are impressive. He published ``Saratoga Scorecard,'' a
bettor's handbook, from 1988-92, when it was bought by the Daily
Racing Form, which published it for two years before it was
discontinued. He currently is the racing writer for the Glens Falls
Post-Star, which takes its coverage of Saratoga very seriously, and
collaborates with Jim Mazur on ``The Saratoga Handicapper,'' a
gambler's guide packed with statistics, which is updated twice
during the 36-day stand. Both of Angelo's parents grew up in Glens
Falls and John, when he was 14, saw Damascus win the Travers in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   So, starting with the always interesting subject of track bias,
here are some of Angelo's observations:
</P>
<P>
   ``When the main track gets hot and dry, it becomes more speed
favoring, so I look to the weather. Plus, there is always the
chance that, right off the bat, there will be a speed bias. The
Saratoga track can be exactly the opposite of the Belmont Park
surface, where you want to make that sweeping move off the turn
about four-wide. You need to lay up close on the main track at
Saratoga. I key off Jerry Bailey the way I used to key off Angel
Cordero when he rode. If Cordero gunned his mounts, you knew the
track was speed-favoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for slop, horses either like the Saratoga slop or they
don't. Don't confuse their Belmont slop form with what they can do
at Saratoga. A horse might well like the Belmont slop but hate the
Saratoga slop. When it's sloppy, closers tend to do well in the
route races.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the turf?
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass course was so firm last year that a lot of records
were set. In general, you have to save ground and stay within sight
of the leaders. In the old days, you tended to get a ton of closers
winning, but in recent years you better stay within 5 lengths of
the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo believes the key to success at The Spa is to follow the
trainers, more so than the jockeys or horses. ``Saratoga lends
itself to trainer patterns,'' he said. ``What you need to know is
who starts quickly and who comes along.'' On Angelo's list of fast
starters are Mark Hennig, Elliott Walden, John Kimmel, and Shug
McGaughey. On his list of closers are Gasper Moschera, Todd
Pletcher, Leo O'Brien, and Rusty Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   As for betting strategies, Angelo thinks Bill Mott's horses are
overplayed. ``It's probably best to try to beat Mott because he's
so overbet,'' Angelo said. ``There are a whole slew of guys you can
do better with. The name folks get overbet because Saratoga draws a
casual crowd. When they hop on somebody, they really hop on him. If
your going to spot play a trainer try Angel Penna Jr., Mohammed
Moubarak or Jonathan Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheppard is known for training jumpers but every year he puts
over a flat winner. He gives them a prep at Atlantic City or Penn
National or Delaware, so they always look outclassed on paper, but
they always run well at a pretty generous price.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the true highlights of the Saratoga meeting is the
2-year-old racing. And, once again, Angelo says look for a price.
``Mott's not great with first-time starters,'' he said. ``He's 3
for 24 over the last three meetings. D. Wayne Lukas is another
trainer whose firsters are generally overbet. He's 3 for 22 over
the last three years. The idea is to toss those two guys out and
take a stand against them. One to watch is Linda Rice, she's very
good with 2-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Post position is always a consideration. How does the post
affect a horse's chances at The Spa? ``Post is important in the
7-furlong races,'' Angelo said. ``At 7 furlongs, it's a real
disadvantage to be in the 1 hole. Also, it's really hard to go
wire-to-wire at 7 furlongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some stats of interest before you make that trip to
upstate New York:
</P>
<P>
   ``The favorites ruled last year, winning at a 42 percent clip
(the average is 30),'' said Angelo. ``Of the favorites who won, 19
percent were odds-on. Still, you would have made a 30 percent
profit if you placed a two-dollar wager on the longest shot in
every race. It was certainly a strange year.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for perfection, trainer Guadalupe
Preciado, who is based at Philadelphia Park, is your man. Angelo
points out that Preciado started one horse at Saratoga in 1996,
which won at 9-1, and then came back with one more last year, which
scored at 23-1. Take that Mott and Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
First time for everything
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trainer  &UR; Bob Baffert  &LR; described himself as ``sort of baffled''
after Silver Charm finished last, beaten 27 lengths, in the
$250,000 San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Saturday. It was the first
time that Silver Charm, who went off at odds of 3-10, has finished
worse than second in 15 career starts (8-6-0). Following the race,
rider  &UR; Gary Stevens &LR;  thought Silver Charm had ``probably bled
significantly,'' but that turned out not to be the case. ``He bled
very slightly, but not enough to stop him,'' said Baffert Sunday.
``His legs are fine. We just don't know what happened. We'll just
see how he is in the next few days. We're going to take him back to
the track this week and we'll do some tests. We'll know better in a
week what we're going to do with him.''

REVOLUTION MUST TAKE IT FROM THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Revolution appear to be allowing an unworkable situation to
degenerate into absurdity. The team has failed in almost every
sense, falling into last place in the Eastern Conference with a 2-1
defeat to Miami Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Management apparently does not want to scapegoat coach Thomas
Rongen. But by leaving Rongen in command the Revolution are risking
turning a bad situation into something much worse.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a matter of assigning blame, though most of Rongen's
player selections have been poor. Most of the team's personalities
have been eliminated. Rongen has tried nearly everything to solve
the problems and now has resorted to desperate tactics.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence the situation will improve.
</P>
<P>
   By stubbornly supporting Rongen, the Revolution are failing to
manage the situation. The tension is bound to increase, sides are
being taken, and no winners are likely to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's record and uninspired performances indicate
Rongen is drowning and he is taking the team with him. Neither
Rongen nor management wants to admit failure. But it is unhealthy
to ignore reality.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had won only three times in regulation before replacing
coach Cacho Cordoba with Ivo Wortmann. At least the Fusion had a
contingency plan and have been able to confront a desperate
situation with a dramatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if the Fusion's plan will work. But this is how
professional sports function: if a team is floundering, a change
must be made at the top, almost always the coach. It is not a
matter of fault. To defy this axiom calls into question the
credibility of an organization.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Net gains
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Major League Soccer officials have a much more
demanding set of circumstances than those in other US sports
because they are measured against international standards. They
have few assets worthy of consideration on the worldwide market and
are often managing those assets from a position of weakness. They
do, however, have strong sponsorships and solid ownership, plus the
advantage of being a league with great growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   MLS made a profit on Frankie Hejduk, who will join Bayer
Leverkusen after Tampa Bay's season ends. The price was low _ about
$200,000 _ but this will be an excellent deal for Hejduk, who was
earning only $27,000 from MLS and would become a free agent after
his contract expires in December.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger gain is about to be realized from the sale of Sean
Bartlett, who played for Colorado and the MetroStars then was
loaned to a South African club and scored twice for the Bafana
Bafana in the World Cup. A European club has offered $1 million for
Bartlett, and most of that would go to MLS.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest potential earning is from D.C. United defender
Eddie Pope, who seems reluctant to depart. The league got a bargain
by signing Pope for seven years at about $236,000 per. Sources said
Pope's value on the open market is between $1.5 and $2 million but
MLS deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati said he has been offered $3
million for Pope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Arena's arena?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Arena is emerging as the most viable candidate to succeed
Steve Sampson as US national team coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Queiroz has been dropped from consideration after signing
a multimillion-dollar contract as technical director for the United
Arab Emirates. Queiroz is bringing a team of coaches to the UAE,
including Toni, who guided Benfica to its last two Portuguese
League titles.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, who has guided D.C. United to two successive MLS titles,
will meet with US Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg
before Sunday's MLS All-Star Game in Orlando. Arena would have to
be allowed the freedom to experiment with new players and also to
express himself. In the past USSF officials have been too sensitive
to Arena's remarks. Rather than censor the coach the USSF should
confront the issues Arena raises and capitalize on the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't work out, Queiroz will become available before
long. He has a one-year contract with a one-year option in the UAE.
And if the UAE fails to defeat Saudi Arabia in the Gulf Cup,
Queiroz certainly will be out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nakata controversial
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kazu Miura was a trailblazer for Japanese soccer, performing for
teams in Brazil and Italy. But he had not made much of an impact at
Santos or Genoa, where he scored once in 21 games before returning
to Japan in 1996. In fact, Genoa would not likely have given Miura
a chance except a Japanese corporation paid his contract. Miura was
an excellent vehicle for marketing; his girlfriend was a glamorous
actress, he was the subject of Herb Ritts's artwork. But he simply
was not fast or clever enough to excel outside Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Hidetoshi Nakata is a different story. Nakata, 21, is expected
to start in midfield for Perugia, newly promoted to Italy's Serie
A. Miura projected a positive image. Nakata is controversial,
though he has removed the yellow dye from his hair.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nakata virtually had to escape Japan after refusing to
sing the national anthem during World Cup matches, then receiving
death threats after saying in a magazine interview, ``I will never
sing. Because I refute the lyrics, which are profoundly
imperialistic, an anthem to the war of domination and expansion
that doesn't enter into my concept of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perugia president Luciano Gaucci is willing to gamble on Nakata
in an attempt to stay in Serie A. He has added several players on
loan: Pietro Strada, Brazilian Ze Maria, and, possibly, Luigi
Apolloni from Parma; goalkeeper Angelo Pagotto from Milan. But
coach Ilario Castagner is not so sure, especially since Nakata will
require an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among other things, Nakata put in his contract that he doesn't
want a roommate, I don't know why,'' Castagner said. ``Being close
to an Italian could help increase his rapport with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Change of signals
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is sending signals that it will pull out of its
cohost role with Japan for the 2002 World Cup. Chung Mong Joon, the
Hyundai heir and South Korean federation president, proposed
delaying the tournament's start until late September to avoid the
rainy season. Since the Europeans never will agree to such a
change, this could allow the Koreans to save face ... Nigeria
departed the World Cup in disarray after a 4-1 loss to Denmark last
month in Paris. Now, midfielder Nwankwo Kanu and defender Taribo
West have fallen out of favor by reporting late to training camp
with Inter. West, a fan favorite and an important player last year,
likely will be sold. He had similar troubles with Auxerre in
France, according to coach Guy Roux. ``He always has a relative who
died when he returns to Nigeria, so that delays his return,'' Roux
said. ``One of his cousins has already died three times.'' ...
Johan Cruyff was among those critical of France's World Cup
championship team. ``Attack was the Achilles' heel of Les Bleus,''
Cruyff wrote in L'Equipe magazine. ``It is rare to make it to the
final without an attacker or midfielder scoring in three successive
matches.'' Basically, France would unleash Zinedine Zidane for the
first half of the first half of games. But with only one striker,
and with seven field players concentrating on defense, it was
almost impossible to create an attack. Opponents would soon contain
Zidane, who would continue with his pyrotechnics but without
offensive support. Cruyff and Germany's Franz Beckenbauer bridged
the ``King of Soccer'' gap between Pele and Diego Maradona. The
throne remains empty now, and those who might qualify for it
(Zidane, Roberto Baggio) have been throttled by conservative
coaching mentalities.

LIKE BASEBALL? AVOID FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston owns an undeserved reputation as a city _ a region,
actually _ that has the most knowledgeable and sophisticated
baseball fans in America. This accolade may have been accurate
until the fall of 1986 when one man's human error created a deep
wave of self-pity that has unfairly remained a threat to true
appreciation of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it wasn't just the ball between Buckner's legs that altered
things. The fact that the sport today is actually dominated by
arrogant union leaders and greedy player agents rather than
athletic ability or individual achievement sure hasn't made
baseball more popular; and the increasingly negative, cynical tone
of daily life hasn't helped either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's disappointing to see and hear so many supposedly
sophisticated spectators appear like absolute morons gathered in a
convention of foolishness at Fenway. They assembled this past
weekend to boo Maurice Vaughn, the Boston first baseman, who has
simply gone out of his way to articulate a fact that is quite
obvious to even the most hideously ignorant among us: The game is a
business, has been a business for some time, and will,
unfortunately, remain a business forever. This does not mean Mo is
a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Money dominates. Profits take precedence over RBIs and earned
run statistics. Loyalty and sentiment went out the locker room door
long ago. Today's player is more likely to discuss deferred
payments than a pennant race or the pursuit of Roger Maris's
record. They live and play a child's game in a catered existence
where the average salary exceeds a million dollars, making it
possible for them to exist from April through October as guaranteed
winners no matter what happens between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think New Englanders would have figured this out. You'd
think more of us would know that Mo Vaughn and the Olde Towne Team
are just in the eighth inning of the same inevitable end game that
has seen a Clemens, a Molitor, a Piazza, and hundreds of others
change uniforms. It's a business.
</P>
<P>
   To witness baseball performed on the big stage as it was and as
it will never be again, you have to get up early on a Sunday and go
to a place like Danehy Field in Cambridge to watch Little Leaguers
try to outrun their dreams. There, you would have seen a family
from Reading arrive with a handicapped child, strapped into a chair
and wheeled into the shade alongside the aluminum bleachers so
other parents, and players, too, could talk to her about the
unchanging pleasure of an activity not yet ruined by cash.
</P>
<P>
   Then, you could have crossed the river to view Pedro Martinez
dominate the Blue Jays. He is a smart, wealthy young man with a
huge heart, great talent, and a rapidly growing aversion to the
absurd stupidity increasingly displayed by local fans.
</P>
<P>
   And if your affection for the game was old enough you could have
concluded a Sunday watching Hyannis play Wareham beneath a sweet
sunset in the Cape League. There, running sprints in the mellow
evening, Greg Montalbano worked up a sweat before he and his
teammates boarded a bus for the trip back across the canal
following a victory for his first-place club.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano is a 20-year-old left-hander from Westborough who
attends Northeastern where he's majoring in civil engineering. He
is a big, handsome kid with blue eyes and dark hair and this summer
he is 1 and 1 for ``The Gatemen,'' appearing in 24 innings in
between visits to MRI facilities and doctor's offices where he is
treated for a cancer that has caused him to have five operations
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 18 when I found out I had it,'' Montalbano was saying
Sunday night. ``I had just started at Northeastern. All I was
thinking about was baseball and how to take care of the cancer, how
to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking now about tumors that have moved to his hip and
his lungs, how they would be treated, how he had to go in for blood
work and another MRI, talking about all this in a calm, understated
voice that contained the indefatigable confidence of youth. He is
only 20, playing a game that is the love of his life, and he is
living proof that, today, baseball is more enjoyable far from
foolish fans and meaningless amounts of money.

RIGHTS OF MENTALLY ILL, JUSTICE TRAVERSE A FINE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite a nationwide trend toward monitoring
psychiatric patients, and legislation in at least 20 states
allowing judges to mandate care, mentally ill patients in
Massachusetts cannot be forced to undergo therapy _ or see their
doctors or take their medication. It doesn't matter if they have
gone through the court system or if their behavior may soon
deteriorate without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of two high-profile violent crimes
connected to psychiatric patients, some state officials are
renewing their call to close such gaps in care _ urging, at the
very least, medical checks on mental patients who have committed
brutal crimes and been released later.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the arrest of Steven B. Gordon, a
convicted felon who said he raped three women after failing to take
medication for manic depression, state Senator William R. Keating
continued his push for legislation that would let judges mandate
psychiatric medication as part of parole.
</P>
<P>
   And three days after the arrest of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., a
paranoid schizophrenic accused of fatally shooting two guards in
the Capitol, mental health specialists urged the state to consider
outpatient civil commitments. These commitments are already in
place in nearly half of all other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way, currently under the law, to continue
supervising the mentally ill, no matter what kind of violent crime
might have resulted in their being there in the first place,'' said
Keating, a Sharon Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years in this state, we have had a problem with the
dividing line between mental health and criminal justice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a line that zigzags across the nation, each state drawing
the boundary between individual rights and public safety in a
different place.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, sex offenders can be required to undergo counseling
as one of their parole conditions, according to Ron Homberg,
director of legal affairs for the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill. In Vermont, judges can order schizophrenics into
outpatient civil commitment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, psychiatric patients can be civilly committed
_ institutionalized and held for a period without a court hearing
if they are determined to be a threat to themselves or others. But
they cannot be kept under court supervision once released from an
institution, according to Department of Mental Health spokesman
John Widdison. Even sex offenders cannot be forced to accept
treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they're discharged, they're gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials have urged several pieces of legislation in
recent years. Not one has made its way into law.
</P>
<P>
   The conditional-release bill, stalled in the Senate Ways and
Means Committee for more than a year, would let judges order
psychiatric suspects into care after they are released, and dangle
the threat of a return to the state hospital system if patients do
not comply.
</P>
<P>
   The lifetime-parole bill for sex offenders has a similar
provision, allowing courts to send convicted rapists into
counseling as part of the conditions of parole. It, too, has
stalled. So has a proposal to create a ``guilty but insane''
conviction category, which essentially would allow juries to
acknowledge a suspect's insanity and still send the suspect to
prison for committing a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong consumer lobby,'' said state Senator
Therese Murray, a Plymouth Democrat, referring to mental patients
who do not believe they can be required to take medication.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health advocates raise other objections to the stalled
proposals. Steven Schwartz, director of the Center for Public
Representation in Northampton, argued there is little documented
evidence that tightened restrictions on psychiatric patients
actually improve public safety or patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just a civil liberties issue,'' said Schwartz. ``The
long and short of it is that it has not worked in a meaningful way
in the states that have tried it, primarily because of the
limitations in enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Appelbaum, chairman of psychiatry at University of
Massachusetts Medical School, said that in states where sufficient
resources were devoted to monitoring psychiatric patients, the
results can be positive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Appelbaum warned that even a network of guardians cannot
predict whether a psychiatric patient will snap, as the Capitol
Hill shooting and New Hampshire rape suspects allegedly did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the system we set up, there will always be
circumstances in which people are released and, in retrospect,
questions are asked about why it was impossible to determine that
they would commit a violent act,'' he said. ``Which is why each
time something like this happens, the question is asked: `Why
couldn't we predict this? Why couldn't we prevent it?'''

RED SOX SHOULDN'T TRIP UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Three time zones and a continent away, Red Sox
progress over the next two weeks will best be charted by night
crawlers and insomniacs, those who close the bars and open the
doughnut shops, the cabbie picking up his last fare, and the
deliveryman dropping off his first crate of orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the reason, this collective anxiety that stems from
having to wait until morning to find out whether their team won or
lost, that causes Red Sox fans to look upon West Coast trips with
such foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Bad things tend to happen in the middle of the night, which is
when, on Atlantic clocks, most Red Sox activity takes place when
they're on the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams was ejected for the first time as Red Sox manager
in Anaheim last August. That same night, Darren Bragg was beaned.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in broad daylight, but it was here in Oakland that
Roger Clemens got himself thrown out of a playoff game eight years
ago, when he showed up on the mound wearing eye black and an
attitude and was expelled by umpire Terry Cooney.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the New England bias toward the Left Coast, which
in the provincial view offers little but earthquakes, mudslides,
and O.J. in a place inhabited solely by hedonists, weirdos, and
assorted other nut cases.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Anaheim, after all, the Sox fan will tell you with a
knowing nod, that Wade Boggs met Margo Adams.
</P>
<P>
   So, it is with some trepidation that Red Sox fans watched their
team embark Monday on a 14-day, 12-game trip that begins Tuesday
night with the first of three games in Oakland, is followed by a
three-game set in Anaheim, continues with a pair in Seattle, then
has the added bonus of four games tacked on in Texas, where
sometime before the end of the millennium the temperature is
expected to drop below 100 degrees again.
</P>
<P>
   Total air miles: 7,300.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, their longest of the season, begins with the Red Sox
holding a 4 1/2-game lead over the Rangers in the American League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   When it is over, the Red Sox will stray only infrequently from
Boston. Of their last 47 games, 31 are scheduled to be played at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   So this odyssey is looked upon as a potentially dangerous detour
from a hoped-for appointment with the playoffs in October. If the
Red Sox survive this forced march, the smart money says, they
should be in great shape for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the heart of the matter: Just how
perilous is this journey likely to be?
</P>
<P>
   The record, especially in the '90s, suggests it's not as bad as
the worriers would like to think.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a winning record this decade on the Coast
(81-69), and have yet to finish any season in the '90s with a
losing record in games played here. But there's an asterisk
attached: That record does not include games played in Texas, where
the Sox came into this season with a record of 13-28 and this May
were soundly beaten in their only two games there.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that the Sox opened the season here, and
after beating the A's twice, won once in their last six games
against the Mariners (1 of 3) and Angels (three straight losses).
The Sox managed just one run in each of the three games in Edison
International Field.
</P>
<P>
   What awaits the Sox on this go-round? Well, two of the four
teams they're playing, the Angels and Rangers, are battling each
other for the AL West division lead, with the eventual runner-up
figuring to be Boston's stiffest competition for the wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, meanwhile, were 16 games out of first place in the
West July 1, but they're 14-7 so far this month and begin the day
just 8 1/2 games out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get to .500 first before we can start thinking
about the playoffs,'' said manager Lou Piniella, but it was just
three years ago the Mariners overtook the Angels with a late-season
push, and they've been in the playoffs every season since.
</P>
<P>
   A city-by-city look at what the Red Sox are facing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oakland:  &LR; While the Red Sox left Boston Monday morning and had
all day to adjust to their jet lag, the A's were still back in
Florida Monday night, closing out a series with the expansion Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, and didn't figure to arrive home until 4 a.m.
They've lost seven in a row and been outscored, 48-23. The A's not
only have yet to beat the Red Sox in five meetings this season,
they have yet to score a run off Sox closer Tom Gordon, who has a
win and three saves to go along with his 0.00 ERA. Always a
potential headache for the Red Sox, however, is Rickey Henderson,
who has 43 stolen bases and is bidding to become baseball's oldest
stolen base champ. Ex-Sox Kevin Mitchell, the jumbo-sized
outfielder, is tied with Sox DH Midre Cummings for most pinch hits
in the league, seven.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anaheim:  &LR; The Angels, who went a franchise-record 22-6 in June,
have not been able to keep up that pace, partly because in the last
11 days, their players have gone to the hospital six times. That
includes lefthander Chuck Finley, who in an April duel against
Pedro Martinez held the Red Sox to four hits and a run while
striking out 10 in nine innings in a game won by the Halos in extra
innings. Finley went to the hospital three times: He sustained a
gash in his right knee that required eight stitches, he bruised his
right forearm when struck by a foul ball while sitting in the
dugout, which caused his start to be pushed back, and then when he
finally did pitch, he was hit in the left elbow by another line
drive and forced to leave the game. Finley is scheduled to pitch
Thursday against the Yankees and thus is unlikely to face the Sox
this go-round. Also a possibility to miss the series is Dave
Hollins, who played briefly for the Sox in '95 and whose intensity
marks him as the team's spiritual leader. Hollins injured his right
shoulder sliding into first base and may not be back until after
the weekend. There is concern, too, about closer Troy Percival, who
has complained of dizziness for three straight days and was
undergoing neurological tests to determine what is causing the
condition. Both Jim Edmonds and Darin Erstad have been slumping,
but outfielder Garret Anderson has a 24-game hitting streak, tying
Nomar Garciaparra for the longest in the majors this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seattle:  &LR; The Mariners hit nine home runs in three games
against the Red Sox in April and lead the majors with 161 home
runs. Junior Griffey is chasing Roger Maris, of course, and Alex
Rodriguez, who just turned 23 Sunday, needs just two stolen bases
to become the sixth player in AL history with at least 30 home runs
and 30 stolen bases in a season. The 40-40 plateau achieved
previously by only Jose Canseco and Barry Bonds is within reach.
The Mariners have scored 58 runs in their last eight games, an
average of better than seven a game, and when Griffey isn't hitting
home runs, he's stealing bags. He had three Sunday, and he and
A-Rod will be a handful for Sox catchers Scott Hatteberg and Jason
Varitek. The good news here is that the Sox will not face the Big
Unit, Randy Johnson, who goes Tuesday night against the Indians and
may be pitching for either Cleveland or New York by the time the
Sox arrive in town.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Texas:  &LR; The Rangers are just 8-9 since the break, their
fortunes fading alongside their staff ace, former Sox righthander
Aaron Sele, who has gone from 13-3 to 12-7 and faces Roger Clemens
Tuesday night. The Sox will see Sele in Arlington, where the big
story remains the big bats of outfielder Juan Gonzalez and catcher
Ivan Rodriguez. Gonzalez leads the majors in RBIs and has driven in
15 runs in his last six games after being held without an RBI in
back-to-back games. Gonzalez's 116 RBIs in 104 games is six more
than Hack Wilson had in the same number of games in 1930, when he
set a major league rec-ord with 190 RBIs. The Rangers are
desperately seeking another starting pitcher and figure to have one
by the time the Sox arrive. But Rangers GM Doug Melvin conceded
Sunday that it won't be Clemens, whom he had hoped the Blue Jays
would be willing to move after the Red Sox took three of four from
Toronto last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So there are pitfalls aplenty facing the Sox. But none, it would
seem, worth losing too much sleep over.

WHEN FOOD WATCHDOGS GO TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It being summer, my wife and I snuck a few days to
go hit golf balls and hang with my saintly mother-in-law. For some
reason, visiting her is about the only time I eat potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   This year, like a phenomenal number of weight-conscious
consumers, this delightful Mississippian had switched brands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of her usual fare, she had switched to one of the new
kinds containing the fat substitute called Olestra, from Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co., that has taken off like no other new product in the
'90s off its claims that with no change in taste you can snack
moderately with a lot less fat and considerably fewer calories.
What has started in some potato chips and a cracker could
eventually spread very far.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to see for myself, having just witnessed the latest
round in a decade-long fight against the additive by the Center for
Science in the Public Interest _ a Ralph Nader spinoff of long
standing around here.
</P>
<P>
   From casual acquaintaince with this dispute, I was on notice
that the watchdogs were raising the kinds of digestive consequences
that all fastidious Americans fear _ cramps, etc.
</P>
<P>
   So each day, I had a couple of ounces of my mother-in-law's
potato chips and waited to see if Vesuvius would remain quiet. And,
of course, it did _ as has been the case for nearly everyone who
snacks with at least some restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This was basically what a Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee concluded last month in calling the Center for Science's
widely disseminated fears baseless, but continuing to recommend a
label cautioning consumers about digestive problems in the context
of immoderate use.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than good enough for me, as it should be for
everyone. But the battle is certain to go on, which ought to be an
occasion for some critical thinking about the condition of
watchdoggery in general these days.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Naderite contribution to our culture for the
last 30 years (huge and overwhelmingly positive) has been the
exposure of products where scientific evidence about causation
shows clear and actual or potentially widespread danger. From cars
to bad meat, this function has been performed in the face of
industry and governmental timidity and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently the watchdog function has become polluted with
concepts not of danger put of more preachy notions of what one
group of activists thinks is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, for example, the Center and its indefatiguable,
ever-quotable director, Michael Jacobson, has railed against ethnic
food _ especially Chinese, Italian, and Mexican. The campaign
against Olestra did not come out of the blue, but it is
illustrative in its blurring of scientific evidence of real danger
and broader concepts of nutrition philosophy. The problem with this
is that it dilutes the meaning of warnings when they truly need to
be serious.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Olestra, Jacobson calls it ``crazy'' to permit
the use of an additive with no nutritional value, and he is trying
to get the FDA to revoke its approval. Now he wants to petition the
Federal Trade Commission to halt the major advertising campaign
behind the product.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign doesn't come out of thin air. Olestra, a synthetic
fat, is the combination of various vegetable oils and table sugar.
The phony fat molecule is made so large that it cannot be
metabolized and leaves the body intact. That's why it's called
no-fat, that's why there are much fewer calories, but that's also
why (in laymen's terms) it can go right through you and why you
should eat it in moderation to avoid stomach problems. For
analogous reasons, I wouldn't recommend eating an entire package of
apricots, either.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's Center offered anecdotal evidence off its Web site of
consumer complaints not otherwise examined, but it confined itself
before the FDA panel to criticizing Procter &AMP; Gamble's actual
studies. The FDA group was not impressed, and even its decision to
leave the mild caution intact can be criticized as self-protecting
rather than consumer-protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, however, the battle was escalated to include
the ``C'' word. It is a fact that Olestra will take with it four
fat-soluble vitamins if it encounters them (A, D, E, and K) along
with carotenoids that may or may not protect the body from cancer
(science remains unclear).
</P>
<P>
   That was a cheap shot. In the normal course of regulatory
events, the Olestra makers have already fortified their product
with the four vitamins. As for carotenoids, not only is the cancer
protection unverified, the center's late hit ignored a simple fact:
Olestra sweeps these substances out only if they are in the system.
It wouldn't hurt those who, for example, gobble beta-carotene pills
every morning to wait before eating potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if we're not careful, does consumer protection and policy
advocacy degenerate toward farce.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Olestra's potential to help an overweight
society lighten up dwarfs potential problems almost entirely
associated with excessive consumption. The fact also is that
wolf-crying endangers the credibility advocacy groups need when
real dangers are at hand. And the fact is I have another reason to
look forward to my next visit to my mother-in-law's.

IN FIRST YEAR, FEW LEGISLATIVE WINS FOR CELLUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first thing Paul Cellucci did after taking the
reins of state government one year ago this Wednesday was to file a
bill to roll back the state's personal income tax rate to 5 percent
from 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His first official act was orchestrated to show off his
credentials as a fiscal conservative and aggressive tax cutter who,
after serving 6 1/2 years as lieutenant governor and 14 years as a
legislator, knew how to get things done on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, the tax-cut bill does indeed stand as a
testament to the Cellucci administration, though not in the way the
acting governor intended. Like most of the 86 other bills Cellucci
filed over the last year, the tax-cut legislation is mired in
committee with no chance of winning passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to point to one significant legislative victory, Cellucci,
during an interview with the Globe on Friday, said it is the $770
million tax cut _ authored by Democratic leaders _ passed by House
and Senate as state coffers were overflowing because of the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about credit, I'm concerned about
whether we're getting things done to benefit the people of this
state,'' Cellucci said. ``I signed the largest tax cut in history a
few days ago. It wasn't everything I wanted, but it was a big down
payment on what I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cellucci's first year in office can be used as an indicator
of the type of governor he would be if elected in November, some
political analysts conclude it would be low-key, uninspiring, and
tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything he pushed and got signed into law,''
said Michael Cudahy, an independent media consultant who left the
Republican party. ``He is clearly banking on the strength of the
economy and everybody being lulled into just a wonderful, calm
frame of mind because everything's going so well. I think that's a
dangerous strategy. He hasn't pushed any major legislation for fear
of upsetting the apple cart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Domke, a Republican media consultant in Holliston, says
it's unfair to measure Cellucci's performance solely on the number
of bills he introduced and signed. Republican leaders, by
definition, would rather do less with government, not more. And
Cellucci, of course, must work with a Legislature controlled by
Democrats who have no interest in handing him legislative victories
during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty there is with a Republican governor who wants
to limit government and a Democratic Legislature that generally
wants to expand government,'' Domke said. ``Progress has to be
measured as things not happening, and that's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a list things that didn't happen has to include such
legislative priorities as reinstating the death penalty, returning
the income tax rate to 5 percent, and testing all state teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci takes the long view, however, when it comes to his
accomplishments. He said that ideas often take years to become law,
and he will keep pushing until his own are adopted. Despite the
disappointments, Cellucci said he is proud of his first 12 months
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I'm sitting in this office for 18 months or for six
years or for 10 years, I want to be able to look back and know that
I got some things done that helped the people of Massachusetts,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's chief of staff, Virginia Buckingham, contends many of
the administration's losses are actually wins because the acting
governor can promise to continue fighting for them on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say Cellucci didn't deliver and he's not an
`effective governor,''' Buckingham said. But, she said, voters will
have to decide if they want someone who will continue fighting for
these issues or someone for whom they are not a priority at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's failure to win passage of a death penalty bill last
fall was perhaps the first sign that his legislative intiatives
were in trouble despite furious lobbying on their behalf by the
acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard when the bill failed on a tie vote in the House
last October, Cellucci lashed out at Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and
accused him of dirty tricks. A lone state representative, John P.
Slattery, a Peabody Democrat, had changed his mind and opposed the
bill, saying he worried that there were not enough safeguards for
juveniles and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, few issues have both captured the public's attention
and put Cellucci at the center of the action. Most recently,
Cellucci appeared hesitant to take charge when 59 percent of
would-be teachers in Massachusetts failed a state certification
exam and the Board of Education then voted to lower the standards
and increase the number of those who passed.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said at the time that there was nothing he could do
about the board's vote to lower standards. Three days later, he
stepped into the fray, calling on the board to take another vote
and raise the bar back up on the teachers' exam. The board then
reversed itself. He also filed a bill to require testing of current
teachers, and the firing of those who fail the test. The
legislation has been left for dead by the Legislature, but has
handed Cellucci an issue to talk about in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he seems tentative and more modest than an elected
governor,'' Domke said. ``It's a question of how much of that is
strategy, in terms of avoiding risks, or second nature after 20
years in elective office.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Cellucci's work in the legislative arena over the last
year has been to stake out political positions, rather than making
a concerted effort to move bills through the Legislature to become
law.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cellucci switched his stance on the minimum wage in
May, filing a bill to raise the hourly rate from $5.25 to $6.15
over the next two years. After that, he rarely mentioned the
subject, except to make a pitch for the wage hike at a hearing by
US Senator Edward M. Kennedy and US House Minority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cellucci's support for the minimum wage bill, it has
been hung up in the House due to objections by Finneran. Lawmakers
say it is not clear whether the bill will clear the final hurdles
before the end of the session July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to get to this point in the legislative
session when the clock is ticking,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major legislation Cellucci filed over the last year, only
four bills became law, while the rest have sat in House and Senate
committees. But Cellucci also claims credit for bills filed by his
predecessor, William F. Weld, that Cellucci later signed. Those
include measures to deregulate electricity rates and reduce
unemployment insurance rates for businesses by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bills Cellucci has proposed on his own have ranged from the
fiscal, such as returning the income tax rate to 5 percent, to the
social, such as combating drug-induced rape and kidnapping. He said
he hopes he will also be given the opportunity to sign legislation
he proposed to impose life sentences on all second-time sex
offenders and allow civil commitments even after the offender has
already served a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant measure Cellucci proposed and
signed was actually the brainchild of Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Congress passed a $30 billion measure to provide grants to states
to expand publicly assisted health care to children. Massachusetts
_ and every other state _ was required to pass its own legislation
to put the program into place.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci did initiate, and eventually signed, a bill to
improve the state's child support enforcement. A new law makes
timely support payments a condition of parole and probation,and it
also broadens employer reporting requirements to include
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has also signed numerous bills that were conceived and
written by Democratic members of the House and Senate, but reflect
a socially liberal approach to government. Highlights include: a
prohibition of smoking in certain state office buildings; a
requirement to divest tobacco stocks and securities from public
pension funds; a bill of rights for mental patients; and an
employee leave measure.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders credit Cellucci with salvaging a $194
million cut in businesses' unemployment insurance tax bills. A
stalemate between the House and Senate over reducing the tax rate
prompted Cellucci to step in and point out that the unemployment
insurance trust fund had hit $1.25 billion, enough to pay out
benefits for almost two years without new contributions. That broke
the logjam and Cellucci signed the bill last September.
</P>
<P>
   While he has signed 354 bills during his one year as acting
governor, Cellucci has only used his veto 10 times, and six of
those were overridden. For example, herejected a Cape Cod land bank
bill designed to fund preservation with state aid and an assessment
on local property tax bills. And he vetoed a convention center
bill, saying tax increases should not be included in the
legislation without voter approval. Those vetoes were overridden.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Cellucci apparently has been banking on a strong
economy and voter apathy to cruise into his first elected term as
governor. He has been reticent to take positions on controversial
issues, such as pay raises for legislators and bonuses for top toll
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has translated into a legislative record with few
accomplishments worth bragging about but also few major blunders,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that will matter if Cellucci is elected governor,
said Kevin Sowyrda, a GOP consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the Republicans taking back the corner office (in
1990) was economic malaise,'' Sowyrda said. ``Now, we will probably
hold onto power because of economic prosperity.''

US SAYS 50,000 PEOPLE CHARACTERIZED AS THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Secret Service maintains a database of
50,000 people considered ``possible threats'' to the president,
including the alleged gunman who killed two Capitol Police
officers, only about 100 are under regular surveillance, according
to people familiar with the system.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged gunman, Russell Eugene Weston Jr., was considered
the lowest-level threat and was not being watched. Like many on the
list, Weston had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   For the Secret Service, the issue of whether to monitor people
diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenics more closely has long been
studied, but deemed impractical. The agency has compiled many
studies that conclude that most schizophrenics are not prone to
violence. The reports also say it is difficult or impossible to
predict if any particular schizophrenic will turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot more important to know whether there has been a
prior arrest for a violent crime'' than if a person is
schizophrenic, said David Shore, associate director for clinical
research for National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Shore, who has studied hundreds of people who came to Washington
and demanded to see the president, said most of them had some form
of schizophrenia. But that did not mean they would become violent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have a right to buy a gun, refuse treatment, enter
a building,'' Shore said. ``Therefore, it is extremely hard to
prevent the kind of things that went on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the shooting Friday at the Capitol has prmpted the
Secret Service, which has no direct role in protecting the Capitol
or members of Congress, to review whether the number of closely
watched individuals should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service, which has about 2,200 agents, adds about
3,000 names a year to its database of 50,000 people who have made
threats against the president. Other names are regularly dropped
from the list.
</P>
<P>
   The list has three categories, with 100 people considered the
most serious threat, and the remaining individuals divided between
the next two levels. While people in the first two categories
usually are interviewed by the Secret Service and are ``read the
riot act,'' those in the third and lowest category are typically
interviewed by local law enforcement officers, according to Ronald
Kessler, author of ``Inside the White House.'' Kessler's book
focuses in part on how the the Secret Service does its job.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, in the course of his research, found himself impressed
by the way the Secret Service goes about finding and tracking
people who are threats to the president. Although he does not know
of a case when a potential assassin turned out to be on a watch
list, he said the work done during the investigation of potential
threats probably prevents some incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the threats are based on hearsay information, sometimes
as vague as one person overhearing another at a bar saying
something threatening about the president. The Secret Service also
tracks people who have written letters or e-mail to the president
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, for example, the Secret Service investigated two
18-year-olds in Scarborough, Maine, who allegedly sent a
threatening e-mail to Hillary Rodham Clinton. The teenagers, whose
names were not released, were pulled out of class by Secret Service
agents but were not arrested, according to local news reports. A
person convicted of threatening to harm the president's family
faces a maximum penalty of three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Secret Service were to turn into a Soviet-style
security agency, it would be impossible to track all of the people
who are considered threats, former agents have said. The agency
also must balance an individual's freedom of speech against whether
a real threat has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials declined Monday to discuss on the
record how they track people who are possible threats to the
president. But former top officials of the agency have said the
president is the subject of thousands of threats a year, with about
1,200 annually considered very serious.
</P>
<P>
   People who are considered the highest threats are watched more
closely when the president, vice president, or first lady is
visiting localities where those who made the threats live. But the
Secret Service has no way of knowing whether a person on the watch
list has shown up at one of the president's public events except to
try to find such an individual by watching the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At most public events, the people who can get closest to the
president are known by name and are checked out in various
databases. But the audience is not screened by name. Instead, the
audience must pass through a metal detector, which the Secret
Service hopes will prevent someone with a gun or other weapon from
getting near the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of reports that Weston was a paranoid schizophrenic,
some specialists on mental illness said they hope the Weston case
will focus attention on the lack of follow-up treatment for
paranoid schizophrenics. Weston reportedly did not take medication
that had been prescribed. Some specialists said that while it would
be impossible for the Secret Service to track everyone who is a
threat to the president, it would be more beneficial if there were
a national health policy that required follow-up care for people
with schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, based in Arlington,
Va., reported that more than half of the more than 2 million people
diagnosed with schizophrenia have substandard care. Valerie
Rheinstein, a spokeswoman for the alliance, said Monday that
Weston's case ``begs the question of why there is not more
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving I. Gottesman, professor of psychology at the University
of Virginia and the author of ``Schizophrenia Genesis,'' said the
Secret Service probably ``had no way of knowing'' that Weston would
turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   Gottesman said that if people with schizophrenia were required
to have the equivalent of a mental-health parole officer to monitor
their condition, then it might have been discovered that Weston was
not taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have mental illness and are treated for it have
a high probability of recovering,'' he said, whereas criminals are
more likely to remain lawbreakers.

NAVAL GAZING: A FORECAST OF SEAGOING BOOK BATTLES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a naval engagement looming this summer, a ship-to-ship
duel straight from the days of fighting sail. But it will be fought
out in bookstores, rather than on the high seas, and the combatants
will be flinging sagas at one another rather than cannonballs.
</P>
<P>
   Up to windward there's publisher W.W. Norton with author Patrick
O'Brian on the quarterdeck, ready for the late-summer publication
of ``The Hundred Days,'' the 19th title in his series featuring
Captain Jack Aubrey and seagoing companion Stephen Maturin.
</P>
<P>
   But sailing on a course to intercept is publisher Little, Brown,
which is relaunching author C.S. Forester's classic 11-volume naval
adventure series with hero Horatio Hornblower.
</P>
<P>
   Below decks, in the publishers' magazines, publicists and
marketing directors are putting press kits together, placing
advertising orders, and pitching booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   But other than that both series are written by Englishmen and
involve fictional British naval commanders during the Napoleonic
Wars _ and are vastly popular _ there's a lot of sea room between
the two. The plotting and the style of the two series are as
different as a 19th-century frigate from a nuclear submarine; the
personalities of the two commanders are such that it is hard to
imagine them enjoying each other's company. And, by and large, the
readership is different.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornblowers, said William Fowler, president of the
Massachusetts Historical Society and an authority on the naval
history of the period, ``are boys' books,'' adding, ``And boys come
in all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   And while there are men who read the O'Brian books, said
Starling Lawrence, his editor at Norton, ``they get fidgety when
he's not banging away with great guns.''
</P>
<P>
   To a far larger extent than with the Hornblowers, the O'Brians
have attracted women readers _ for the same reason, Lawrence said,
``that they read Jane Austen.'' There is the same interest in the
social customs and conventions of the day, and it's not surprising
that O'Brian considers Austen the greatest English writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we had to worry about'' when Norton began
publishing the O'Brians in 1990, said Lawrence, was how to capture
readers who had grown up on Hornblower (Forester's books were
published between 1937 and 1967) ``without portraying them
inaccurately as son-of-Hornblowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornblowers (unlike the O'Brians, they are almost never
referred to by the author's name) invariably begin with Hornblower
aboard his latest command, or impatiently waiting to head there.
(Once, he is in a French prison, plotting an escape.) But O'Brian
is often a third of the way into the story before Aubrey and
Maturin even climb aboard, having spent 100 or so pages in various
intrigues, romantic and political _ although in the forthcoming
``The Hundred Days'' Aubrey is in action against Moroccan pirates
by Page 57.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're frustrating as hell, because there's so little
action,'' said retired commander Tyrone G. Martin, former captain
of the USS Constitution. ``They're much more literate, but they're
not good navy stories.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hornblower takes his ship into action, cannons belch, masts
topple, and men are killed and wounded _ often horribly so.
Forester's battle scenes are so vivid, said Fowler, a former
professor at Northeastern University, that he used them in his
naval history courses.
</P>
<P>
   But in an O'Brian, said editor Lawrence, ``you think you're
leading up to a great battle, but it doesn't happen, because
Maturin is down in the orlop tending to the wounded. He's hearing
the thumps and crashes on deck, but it's only 20 or so pages later,
when they're having dinner in Aubrey's cabin, that you learn what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the books' focus differ markedly, so do the literary
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a destroyer commander who served during both the Korean
and Vietnam wars, says he'd much rather have served under
Hornblower than Aubrey. ``There's a certain slovenliness'' to
Aubrey, he said, ``a greed, a lust, a venality, a ragged edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hornblower, he said, would be ``a role model'' for young
officers. And, agreed Fowler, ``I can't imagine a midshipman being
told to be like Aubrey.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said Fowler, the worldly Aubrey ``is the kind of guy
you'd like to have lunch with,'' rather than the ``taciturn and
rigid'' Hornblower, whose occasional wardroom dinners were
best-behavior experiences for his junior officers.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, both series have been tremendously
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Norton editor in chief Lawrence says the O'Brians have sold
between 2.3 and 3 million copies in hardcover and paperback since
the first book was published in late 1990. (They began appearing in
Britain in 1969.) Little, Brown associate editor Amanda Murray,
citing the fact that the Hornblowers go back some 50 years before
sales records were computerized, said there is ``no way to tell''
how many copies are in print.
</P>
<P>
   For the Hornblower relaunch, Little, Brown has commissioned
fresh covers from illustrator Douglas Smith, who was so much of a
Hornblower fan, Murray said, that he already ``had a Hornblower
illustration in his portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye to the traditional Hornblower audience, the relaunch
was kicked off with a half-page Father's Day advertisement in the
New York Times Book Review, and there will be a $2 price cut for
the reissued paperback editions to match the $12.95 of the O'Brian
paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Norton plans some electronic promotion through its on-line
O'Brian Newsletter for the latest book, which is expected to be the
next-to-last in the series.
</P>
<P>
   In the publishing wardrooms where the grand strategies are
mapped out, the success of the O'Brians is credited with
heightening interest in the genre _ even by editors and publishers
of O'Brian rivals like Murray, who is steering the Hornblower
relaunch at Little, Brown, and Alexander Skutt, who is republishing
yet another series.
</P>
<P>
   Skutt suggested that the success of Tom Clancy's ``naval
techno-thrillers'' could be prompting interest in books with ``the
same excitement of battles, but with more humor and wit and richer
in sea lore.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the publishing horizon, Holt/Owl is promoting its new
Hearts of Oak paperback reprints of classic sea adventures, both
fiction and nonfiction. Alexander Kent's series featuring the
Hornblower-esque Richard Bolitho has a new American publisher,
McBooks, Skutt's small upstate New York house, which is branching
out _ quite far out, in fact _ from vegetarian cookbooks. O'Brian,
said Skutt, ``is reviving interest in the genre,'' and he is seeing
``a really good response'' to McBook's reprintings of 19th-century
sea classics.
</P>
<P>
   Two American authors of recent naval adventure series are also
acquiring a following.
</P>
<P>
   Out this summer from Pocket Books is ``The Continental Risque,''
by James L. Nelson of Harpswell, Maine, the third book in the only
series to feature an American hero. Many readers, however,consider
Forester's ``Captain from Connecticut,'' his only book with an
American hero, among his best, though it is long out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nelson considers his books ``more in the Hornblower
tradition,'' he did secure a cover blurb from O'Brianthat reads:
``Nelson writes with the eagerness of a young man sailing his first
command.'' Two more books are scheduled in Nelson's series, which
is set during the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Alan Lewrie, hero of Dewey Lambdin's series
published by Fawcett. ``The King's Coat,'' the first of the series
and scheduled for a September reprinting, is also set during the
Revolution, though viewed from the Royal Navy's side.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's Lawrence thinks each series is ``complementary to each
other.'' Or, as Little, Brown marketing director Carl Lennertz
quipped, ``A rising tide lifts all boats.''

WHEN SUMMER GOES TO BLAZES, TEXAS PUNDITS GET FIRED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas is hot, blistering hot. The kind of
hot that once irked Gen. Phil Sheridan enough for him to claim,
``If I owned Texas and all hell, I would rent out Texas and live in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else would unrelenting heat and withering drought be
cause for humor. But in Texas, politicians and pundits, ranchers
and writers historically have poked fun at their own sun-baked
misery, turning scorching summers into part of the state's lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to come out of a drought is a dry sense of
humor,'' said Austin humorist Cactus Pryor. ``People keep laughing
about it, because it's supposed to be dry; that's Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so dry the trees are whistlin' for the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want wet, you go to Seattle. If you want cool, go
somewhere in the Northeast. If you want heat, you come to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said historian Walter Prescott Webb once wrote that a lot
of the Texas bravado came not from having, but from lacking certain
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that would apply to good weather, too,'' Pryor said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' imperfections have been visible before. The late U.S.
Sen. Ben ``Pitchfork'' Tillman of South Carolina once said, ``Texas
has more trees and less timber; more rivers and less water; more
resources and less cash; more itinerant preachers and less
religion; more cows and less milk, and you can see farther and see
less than any damn country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Civil War, Gen. Sheridan came to Galveston and
offered his infamous opinion. Nearly 20 years later, he explained
that he had been asked his opinion of Texas by a reporter just
after an exhaustive, dusty trip from San Antonio to Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan was mad, he said, and blurted out his well-known
statement. ``Now I want to assure you,'' he said later, ``that by
that expression I only meant to convey how much I was disgusted
with that newspaper man. It did not represent my opinion of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Texans didn't hold Sheridan's statement against
him. In fact, one man who heard the general's explanation
commented: ``I have never understood that there was any feeling of
bitterness towards General Sheridan on account of his having made
that remark. The only reason people thought hard of him, at all,
was on account of his failing to kill that reporter,'' according to
a Galveston Daily News account.
</P>
<P>
   Texans, particularly West Texans, have always recognized the
shortcomings of the land and managed to find their own humor in the
hot, arid climate. It should be noted, however, that folklorist J.
Frank Dobie said that Texas didn't have a climate, just weather.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Kelton wrote in ``The Time It Never Rained,'' his
descriptive novel about the 1950s drought: ``During the long Texas
drought of the 1950s a joke _ probably already as old as the state
_ was told again and again about a man who bet several of his
friends that it never would rain again, and collected from two of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Men like humorist Boyce House and writers Alex Sweet, Wallace O.
Chariton, Dobie and others have kept alive the humor of a hot, dry,
unforgiving Texas. They have repeated hundreds of stories in their
writings. No one knows any longer where most of them originated,
but they live on.
</P>
<P>
   There was the one about a drought so severe that the preacher
suggested a meeting be held to pray for rain. An old-timer
cautioned, ``Go ahead if you want to, but prayin' ain't gonna do
you a bit o' good unless the wind's outa the east.''
</P>
<P>
   Another relates how a motorist was traveling through West Texas
one day and stopped for gas. ``Nice town you have here,'' he told
the man at the gas station. The man fired back, ``It's hotter than
blazes in the summer and liable to drop 40 degrees in a couple of
hours in the winter. And the wind blows all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The motorist, a bit flustered, said, ``Well, I guess the people
are all right, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' answered the man, ``They're the orneriest, triflin'est
folks you can find anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the exasperated motorist said, ``except for the
climate and the people, I guess you could say the town is all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The man looked up and said, ``Yes, and you could say the same
thing about hell.''
</P>
<P>
   And during a particularly dry spell, legend has it, a sad Texan
once prayed, ``I wish it would rain _ not so much for me, I've seen
it _ but for my 7-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   So how hot and dry can it get?
</P>
<P>
   Some responses gleaned from Texas folklore:
</P>
<P>
   _It was so dry, the cows were giving evaporated milk.
</P>
<P>
   _It was so hot, we had to feed the chickens cracked ice to keep
them from laying hard-boiled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   _It was so hot the birds had to use potholders to pull the worms
out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _It gets so dry is some parts of West Texas that citizens have
to fasten stamps to letters with safety pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought in Texas is so intense,'' a Kentucky newspaper
wrote in 1886, ``that potatoes are cooked in the ground, and all
the people have to do is dig them up and eat them. Workmen carry
salt in their pockets and don't have to go home to dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a visitor to Texas once asked, ``Does it ever rain
out here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does,'' a rancher quickly answered. ``Do you remember
that part in the Bible when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm familiar with Noah's flood,'' the visitor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the rancher puffed up, ``we got 2 1/2 inches during
that spell.''
</P>

<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ To be a 15-year-old girl and to be HIV positive
is to live a life like no other.
</P>
<P>
   It is to consult with the doctor before kissing your boyfriend.
It is to take eight pills a day probably for the rest of your life.
It is to believe you will never have sex or children. It is to be
plunged into panic when your sister cuts herself with a razor that
might be yours. It is to get a call after a party from someone
worried that they drank from your glass of Diet Pepsi. It is to
wonder how long you will live.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Kaplan has more reason to wonder than most. At 15 months,
she developed a fierce form of cancer. At 3, it was discovered that
during treatment, she had received a blood transfusion infected
with HIV. Twenty-five other people received blood from that donor
and Kaplan is one of only two who survived. Kaplan knew none of
this, not even that she was HIV positive, until her parents told
her after her bat mitzvah, a coming-of-age ritual Jewish youths
undergo at age 13. Born at a time when AIDS was no more than a
whisper, a horror as yet with no name, and having come of age as
the virus appears loosely corralled, her life had spanned its
rampage without her knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   A sage young woman in baggy jeans and white T-shirt, Kaplan
regards the warring forces in her life with Zen-like aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as lucky and unlucky,'' explains Kaplan, twirling
a lock of her straight brown hair in her fingers. ``I was unlucky
to get cancer. I was lucky to survive. Obviously, it was unlucky to
get HIV, but it is lucky that if you are in a house with 25 other
people your name is drawn. And then you think, why me out of 25
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctors would like very much to know the answer to that as
well. The virus in Kaplan's system is barely detectable. It has
been that way her entire life except for a brief period, after she
learned she was HIV positive, when her immune system cells, called
T cells, dropped precipitously. Doctors are fascinated that the
virus has remained inconspicuous for so long, significantly longer
than the median 10-year incubation period. But they are
particularly interested because she was infected when her immune
system was already weakened by cancer and chemotherapy. Generally,
when people are infected at such a vulnerable time, the virus's
pace is accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liz is completely unique,'' said Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS
researcher at Harvard Medical School who has supervised Kaplan's
case since she was an infant. ``She has been doubly unfortunate,
doubly fortunate. Why she has remained so healthy, I don't know. It
could be something innate about her genetics or that she received a
weakened form of the virus. We have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kaplan's parents sat Liz down in the kitchen on that
December night and told her she was HIV positive, she was
catapulted down a shadowy emotional road. She was angry. Afraid.
Shocked. Resentful. But as the months passed, Kaplan also found she
was profoundly lonely. Who, really, could she talk to? Not her two
sisters, then only 8 and 11. Not her parents, who were, after all,
pretty OK but still her parents. Not her boyfriend, who, honestly,
didn't quite seem to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan does not know anyone who is HIV positive. She is, she
says, ``not into the support group thing.'' She has found some
solace from a friend in her sophomore class at Newton North High
School, a girl who is epileptic and can understand the infuriating
rigors of doctors and medicine. Kaplan met a gay man with AIDS in
an on-line chat room and spent several months talking with him
about medicine and men before the conversation faded. Over the past
two years, she's told about 20 friends.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, she threw the net wider. On a bitter cold morning
in January, she stepped before her classmates during the school's
Martin Luther King Day celebration and, in a speech, announced that
she was HIV positive. Friends and even neighbors have rallied to
her. The phone rings. The notes are still coming. But to this day,
not a single person who has the virus has stepped forward, as
Kaplan had secretly hoped. Now, it feels lonelier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this personal philosophy that I can't really know how
anyone else is feeling. I can't because it's not my situation,''
declared Kaplan. ``My friends are warm and compassionate and they
try to put themselves in my shoes but they can't be totally in my
shoes. It's a very unique experience to be faced with your own
mortality like this, you know?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It started with a stomach ache.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1983 and baby Liz had spent the morning playing peekaboo
with her father, but by midday she pulled at her stomach in
distress. Her mother drove her to the pediatrician and listened
incredulously as the doctor told her the impossible. Her baby had
cancer. She had a massive tumor called neuroblastoma attached to
her pelvis, its vascular tenticles already routed through her
groin. Her tiny body was laid on the operating table the following
night. She was 15 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Kaplan endured a five-hour operation, six months of
chemotherapy, fevers, infections, transfusions, emergency hospital
visits, more surgery, and perennial tests. By the end she could
neither walk nor talk. But she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   By the time their daughter was 3, the Kaplans had rediscovered
hope. Liz, it seemed, was going to live a normal life. The terror
was over.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall of 1985 the phone rang; the doctor relayed the
news that Liz had been infected with HIV through a transfusion and
horror began again.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kaplans, both of whom are lawyers, the news was
particularly enraging. By early 1983, scientists had discovered
AIDS was transmitted via blood, although a test for the virus
wasn't formulated until 1985. The Kaplans asked Children's Hospital
to allow them to use blood donations from people known to the
family. But like many hospitals, Children's refused, saying that to
do so would be discriminatory and possibly put pressure on family
members unfit to donate. The hospital vowed to use only blood
platelets from the esteemed Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and only
those obtained from a process that generally drew regular donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bunch of malarkey,'' declared Kaplan's mother, Fern
Frolin, 50. ``The reason they didn't want designated donors was
because it was a pain in the butt. You've got to store it. Get the
right amount. They just didn't want to be bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber did obtain blood from a regular donor, who gave 14
times in 17 months. However, he was HIV positive. After it was
discovered, the hospital barred the donor from giving more blood
but, citing confidentiality, has refused to identify him or say
what happened to him. As to why Liz Kaplan, who was just then
relearning how to play and at last beginning to talk again, should
have been given his blood on that March day in 1984, is a question
her parents have raised often to the black night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed this was too much,'' sighed Mitch Kaplan, 48,
Kaplan's father. ``It was too much to deal with. It was hugely
unfair, unfair personally to me, unfair to my family. It was just
unfair. I concluded it was fate. Things happen and whether you are
a good person or a bad one does not act as a shield.''
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by memories of Ryan White, the 13-year-old hemophiliac
who that year had been kicked out of school and ostracized after it
was learned he had AIDS, the Kaplans moved slowly. They told a few
family members, even fewer friends. They also told Janice Golden,
owner of the Golden Days Childrens Center now in Newton, the
nursery school Kaplan had attended for a year. Golden said Kaplan
could come back. But only for one day. To say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, in fairness to the other families, say she could
stay. If the worst possible scenario happened and someone else
became (HIV) positive, I could not live with myself,'' said Golden.
``And it has haunted me since the day she left. It has been a
really, really hard thing for me. I could not serve her. But at the
time, I felt I had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplans did not talk to Golden for years. They also decided
to tell as few people as possible, including their daughter.
Despite the opposition of several professional counselors, they
decided not to tell her until after her bat mitzvah. That way, they
reasoned, she could enjoy a period of childhood innocence. The day
would come soon enough.

 BOSTON: ... the recommendation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an HIV test became available in March 1985, and Dana-Farber
discovered that the donor was positive, he was barred from further
donations. As the hospital began to search its records to see who
had received his blood, the word moved like a wave along the
corridor of the pediatric oncology unit on the eighth floor of the
old Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Blackledge, the slender young man with a knack for
motors and a love of slam dancing, the same young man who seemed to
have beaten the leukemia that brought him into the hospital in the
first place, had been infected with HIV. So had Melanie
Fitzpatrick, the boisterous 3-year-old who had battled cancer for
nearly a year and was still confined to a sealed room undergoing
bone marrow transplant. And Liz Kaplan, the 3-year-old who had
survived a five-hour operation to remove her tumor and six months
of chemotherapy. And so had two other children on the ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a bomb had dropped on me,'' said Debbie
Fitzpatrick of Quincy, Melanie's mother. ``We were fighting every
day to survive, and then this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick marched off the unit and headed to the office of Dr.
Kenneth Anderson, medical director of the blood component
laboratory. ``I was so upset, I stormed into his office. I was
beside myself,'' recalled Fitzpatrick. ``I said, `How can you let
people like that come in here and give blood? How did this happen?'
He told me the donor himself probably didn't know. You could see
that he was devastated. He had babies himself.''
</P>
<P>
   James Blackledge, Matthew's father, was on a break from his
bread delivery route in Fall River when his son told him the news
on the phone. ``I went through the ground 10 feet,'' he said. ``It
was horrifying. You realize you cannot save your kid. That's what
it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth-floor staff, the realization that they probably
could not save their patients was also horrifying. But for some it
was made profoundly more complicated by the realization that it was
their employer, in a bizarre way the staff themselves, who had
infected the five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not even know what words to say that you could write
which would describe what it felt like,'' declared Deborah Hirsch,
a former social worker at Dana-Farber and now director of social
work services at Wentworth Douglass Hospital, in Dover, N.H.
``Terrible is an understatement. It was horrifying, devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Added one staff member, who declined to be identified: ``There
was a feeling of horror. It was a time of real fear of AIDS and
contamination, and no one knew quite what to do or say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. James M. Croop, a pediatric hematologist-oncologist
formerly at Dana-Farber and now at the James Whitcomb Riley
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, says that staff members were
upset but did not blame the hospital. ``We all knew that at the
time there was no sure way to eliminate HIV from the blood supply.
It was just very precarious going. Everyone knew there were risks,
but we were sort of stuck because we had to give transfusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, a group of social workers and psychologists
involved in the incident published a paper in the Journal of
Psychosocial Oncology describing the impact of the tragedy in hopes
that others could learn from it. The 1990 article says that four of
the five children infected with HIV died, three from AIDS, one from
complications including pneumonia. Kaplan, the fifth child, remains
healthy: The level of virus in her system is barely detectable, and
her cancer is in remission.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, they wrote, ``humbled us. We have been humbled
by the effects of causing, albeit unknowingly, a fatal disease in
the process of trying to cure children of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few found themselves questioning their loyalties. Hirsch was
working with another family whose child needed a transfusion and
was desperate to use a known donor. ``I was an employee of the
hospital, but I was also a social worker whose job was to advocate
for my client,'' Hirsch said. ``Should I tell them to go to another
hospital, or the media, or to take legal action? Who should I align
myself with?''
</P>
<P>
   As red-alert notices warning of the need to take special
precautions went up on the eighth floor, medical workers also
grappled with their own fear of the virus. Some nurses, according
to the Journal paper, ``suffered from insomnia, nightmares, and
loss of appetite and described friends' and roommates' fears of
contagion.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the question of how much information to release
and to whom. Information was guarded carefully, not just to ensure
the confidentiality of the five infected children, but also to
prevent panic among other patients. Clearly, some were not told the
scope of the incident. Although Fitzpatrick's and Blackledge's
parents shared their news with one another, they all say they were
never told that other patients had been infected by the same donor,
not to mention 24 others, and news of Kaplan's January speech at
Newton North came as a stunning surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kaplan, a lawyer who works for Choate Hall &AMP; Stewart, the
same law firm that represents Dana-Farber, and his wife, Fern
Frolin, also a lawyer, were given different information. Hospital
staff, said Frolin, told them the victims totaled 12 children and
13 adults. When Frolin periodically asked how the others were
doing, she said doctors told her, ``Not good. Not as good as Liz.
Liz is very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber, said several sources, was anxious about releasing
any information. ``The hospital wanted to have a meeting with the
parents, but it was unclear how to advertise it,'' explained
Hirsch. ``We didn't want people to get hysterical. We certainly
didn't want media coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't get much. In the end, the only coverage was two
stories in the Globe, a brief one describing the Annals paper in
1986 and another following Kaplan's speech. Although the hospital
was not identified in the first story, Brenda Darling suspected
instantly that it was Dana-Farber. Six months earlier, Darling's
only son had died of AIDS, unable to walk or care for himself, his
brain ravaged by the virus. His cancer was in remission. Darling
picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my lawyer,'' Darling, 59, a retired Internal Revenue
Service adjuster living in Fall River, said as tears filled her
eyes. ``The hospital never told us anything, just that we were the
only one. But when I saw that article, I said, `That's our guy.
That's our donor.' I wanted to know what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But to this day, only Dana-Farber knows for sure. Even some
physicians who treated the patients were not told any details about
the donor. Asked whether the hospital should have been able to rule
the donor out, Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS researcher at Harvard
Medical School who treated three of the infected children, said he
did not know ``enough about the screening to comment. ... I just
thought it was a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning now of the incident, several public health officials
said that while the event was uniquely tragic, Dana-Farber appeared
to have acted appropriately, presuming they told all the patients
they had received infected blood. None would comment on details of
the incident because they were not familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital was using state-of-the-art techniques and
processes at the time,'' said Nancy Ridley, assistant commissioner
of health quality management for the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health. ``They couldn't have known the donor was positive
because there was no test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick did not know about the others who were infected
until a Globe reporter contacted her for this story. Her daughter,
Melanie, died of pneumonia and other complications in January 1986,
14 months after she received a transfusion from the infected donor.
Although medical staff were uncertain whether her pneumonia stemmed
from the transplant or the virus, according to the Journal paper,
her mother is sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HIV didn't have anything to do with her death. Nothing
whatsoever. There is no shame of dying of HIV here,'' declared
Fitzpatrick, a nurse at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who has donated blood to Dana-Farber ever since her
daughter got sick, thinks of her little girl every day. But she
does not think badly of the hospital that cared for her. ``I really
don't blame anyone there for this, not anyone,'' she said. ``They
told me they screened the best they could. They don't owe me a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Kaplan is fresh back from summer camp in Maine. She thinks
sometimes during these long, hot days about the children who died
from the same blood that was pumped into her veins. She does not
know any of their names. She has never met their families. Nor does
she want to, at least not now. But she thinks about them. And
probably will for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sad that they all died,'' said Kaplan. ``It's very
strange to feel I am connected to all these dead babies, but I am.
So maybe part of them is in me.''

SWITZERLAND'S TICINO _ AN A-TO-Z APPRAISAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUIS A. DIIORIO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUGANO, Switzerland _ I needed a cup of good strong coffee ...
something to get me going after the four-hour bus ride from St.
Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   So, with friends at the Golf, our favorite coffee bar (near
Parco Ciani), we sipped cappuccino and planned an itinerary for the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Switzerland, the atmosphere here is mainly
Mediterranean. Trust me when I say that the Ticino, Switzerland's
only Italian-speaking canton, is where the country comes alive.
It's Italian lifestyle with Swiss efficiency ... the best of both
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   And as we sat with our second cups of coffee, the warm lake
breezes _ sweetened by a blend of mimosa, oleander, magnolias,
figs, lemons, persimmons, and even palms _ came wafting through the
arcade. It was good to be back. I was alert to the conversation,
taking notes, and sipping cappuccino, yet my mind kept wandering
back to St. Moritz and to a discussion I had a few nights earlier
with two US travel agents. Actually, it was a one-sided discussion:
me trying to convince them that Lugano, Locarno, Ascona, et al.
were not in Italy, but part of the only Swiss canton on the south
side of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, I hope, will help them and anyone else visting
here for the first or 10th time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``Ticino: from A to Z''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;   &UR; Airolo &LR;   &UR; ... &LR;  Traveling south from Zurich, via train or car,
Airolo is the first Ticino town to greet you when you emerge from
the 10-mile long Gotthard Tunnel or come off the spectacular
Gotthard Pass. Ringed by mountain scenery, it is an important
winter and summer resort, and a starting point for excursions,
particularly high-pass walks and ski tours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bellinzona &LR;   &UR; ... &LR;  History lovers will find it difficult to
leave this canton capital, a fortress city set in a valley of lush
mountains. Three picturesque castles confirm its medieval
importance as the key to the St. Gotthard, Lukmanier, and San
Bernardino Passes, but all too often travelers hurrying to Lakes
Lugano, Como, or Maggiore _ or to nearby Italy _ bypass this
ancient city. Saturday morning's open-air market is one of the
country's best.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cuisine ...  &LR; Ticino gastronomy is greatly influenced by the
cuisine of Lombardy, Piemonte, Tuscany, and the Alps. But, quite
simply, it is pasta, polenta, risotto con funghi, sausages, osso
bucco, crusty bread, and formaggini (the local goat cheese topped
with coarse black pepper and olive oil). They taste best when
washed down with a boccalino of merlot or a bit of grappa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cento &LR;   &UR; Valley and Domodossola ...  &LR; Centovalli (literally ``one
hundred valleys'') heading west is the hour-and-45-minute train
route to Domodossola in Italy. A spectacular narrow-gauge railway
runs from downtown Locarno into a landscape of gorges and
waterfalls. At Re, on the Italian side, a procession of pilgrims
takes to the streets April 30 each year, a tradition that
originated after a painting of the Madonna was reported to start
bleeding after being struck by a ball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Excursions ...  &LR; Day trips; overnight stays; short and long
hikes; cable cars; chair lifts; cog railways; boat, bus, train and
bike trips ... there are many options. Your best bet: Write to
Ticino Turismo, Via Lugano, Casella postale 1441, CH-6501
Bellinzona, Switzerland. Or e-mail ett(AT)www.tourism-ticino.ch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Festivals and Fishing &LR;   &UR; ...  &LR; The Ticino is a yearlong festival
and like excursions, it's best to check with the tourist offices
for a list of celebrations in the region you plan to visit. Fishing
is possible year round in lakes Lugano and Maggiore. In the
mountain lakes, rivers, and streams, the fishing season is June to
September. For a moderate charge, you can pick up a 10-day fishing
permit at either a municipal or local tourist office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grotti ... &LR;  Anyone wishing to find authentic local cooking will
do well to seek out a little trattoria or grotto, typical popular
meeting places usually set in the cool shade of leafy chestnut
trees. Sometimes they consist of little more than a few stone
tables, a bocce court, a kitchen, and a garden.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ... and Gandria ...  &LR; Gandria is a former fishing village
clinging to cliffs alongside Lake Lugano. Dotted with quaint
restaurants and pensions, it can be reached either by boat or
footpath from downtown Lugano. Elda Pacchin's Locanda Gandriese is
our favorite. It has ambience, a view to remember, and the best of
food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hiking and biking ...  &LR; Summer and autumn are ideal for a biking
along the cantonal road from Airolo down to Biasca (at the junction
of the Leventina and Blenio valleys). As for hiking the famous
``Strada Alta,'' check with the Upper Ticino tourist office at
Biasca.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; International Film Festival ... &LR;  Locarno's celebrated annual
movie festival _ nearing its fourth decade _ attracts thousands of
filmgoers every August (5th to the 15th) in the Piazza Grande. The
piazza, surrounded by mansions and arcades, is also the site of
concerts.

 LUGANO, Switzerland: ... of concerts.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Jazz festival ...  &LR; Lugano's ``biggest little jazz festival in
Europe'' is usually held in July at Piazza Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kino ...  &LR; This may be a German word but throughout Switzerland
and most of Europe it means cinema or movie house. Opposite the
Hotel Admiral in the Paradiso section of Lugano, there actually is
a Cinema Paradiso!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lugano and the lakes ...  &LR; Lugano is for anyone who wants to be
spoiled: fine food, shopping (especially on Via Nassa), hotels, and
camaraderie. It's a marvelous walking city dotted with palm trees,
flowers, parks, and museums. You can stream across its sun-streaked
lake or stroll for hours through gardens that border it, sit high
above the lake on the terrace of a restaurant, sip an espresso or
cappuccino at an outdoor cafe, or take a funicular to the tops of
Monte Bre or Monte San Salvatore. As part of the Italian lake
region (Lakes Maggiore and Como are close by), Lugano offers a
multitude of excursions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morcote ...  &LR; Seven miles south of Lugano, this pictureque
lakeside village is easy to reach by boat or bus. At the end of the
peninsula stretching south from Monte San Salvatore, arcaded
restaurants, boutiques, and the landmark medieval belltower of the
Madonna del Sasso church make for magnificent wide-angle photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nature ...  &LR; Well-marked trails provide enchanting local and
Alpine flora and fauna. Take an excursion in the regions of Monte
San Giorgio, Piora, Lucomagno, and Malcantone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Origlio Paese ... &LR;  The Val Capriasca area and this village with
its rustic homes, loggias, and inner courtyards are worth seeing.
From there, it's only a five-minute walk to Lake Origlio surrounded
by reeds and chestnut trees and a breeding place for rare birds. It
can be reached from Lugano by post bus (Lines 633.28). Get off at
the village stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Palm Express or Pendolino ... &LR;  There are two special ways to
reach the Ticino. The former, a four-hour bus ride from the
Engadine (St. Moritz) to Lugano takes you down the Maloja Pass
through Italy to Lake Como and the lakeside resort of Mennagio. The
border, Gandria, and Lugano are close by. The ``Pendolino,'' part
of Italy's fast train system, runs twice a day between Zurich and
Milan with brief stops in Bellinzona and Lugano. Zurich to Lugano
takes about 3 hours 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quinto ... &LR;  Just off N2 south of Airolo in the Leventina
Valley, this village is home to the church of Sts. Peter and Paul.
The six-story Romanesque campanile is from the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Riva San Vitale ... &LR;  This lakeside village, a half-mile west of
Capolago at the base of Monte Genroso, is home to Switzerland's
oldest ecclesiastical building, an early Christian baptistery
(circa AD 500) The parish church and Church of Santa Croce, a
16th-century building with an impressive dome, are also well worth
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Swissminiatur ... &LR;  At Melide, ``Switzerland in Miniature''
consists of small-scale replicas of scenes from all parts of the
country, including working models of trains and cable cars. It can
be reached by bus, train, or lake steamer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tenero ...  &LR; This, a village of about 2,000, is just a short hop
from Locarno on Lake Maggiore. &UR;  &LR; Reportedly, it has the mildest
climate in Switzerland, what with the mountains of Val Verzasca
protecting it from northerly winds. Its setting, surrounded by
hills with flowering trees and vineyards, blue lake, and an
abundance of Mediterranean vegetation, contributes to Tenero's
ever-increasing popularity as a year-round vacation and camping
destination.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Uomonatura ... &LR;  The environmental center in Acquacalda (at the
foot of Lucomagno) has reopened with a series of events and trips
helping to guide people toward a deeper knowledge of nature and the
enivronment. For more information: Centro Uomonatura, CH-6718
Acqucalda, Switzerland. Telephone 41 91 872 26 10; fax: 872 26 20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Villa Favorita ... &LR;  This museum in the Castagnola section of
Lugano, houses the world famous art collection of Baron von
Thyssen-Bornemisza. In 1992, the Old Masters of the collection were
transferred to Spain, but what's left behind is well worth the
10-franc admission price. It's an easy walk from downtown Lugano,
or you can take a boat or No. 1 bus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine ...  &LR; The most popular varieties here are merlot, produced
with grapes from vines imported from Bordeaux at the turn of the
century, and nostrano, a red obtained from different types of
grapes. The locals drink from small bowls called boccalinos. Grappa
and Ratafia (a walnut liqueur) are usually sipped at the end of a
meal. Lugano's annual ``Wine Harvest Festival'' is scheduled for
Oct. 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; X ... &LR;  Xtreme sports bring the Swiss to the edge, whether it be
racing motorcycles, rock climbing, white-water kayaking,
para-gliding, etc., but they all pale in comparison to bungee
jumping from the Centovallina Bridge at Intragna or from the dam on
the Verzasca River near Vogorno where it takes 7.5 seconds to
plunge 220 meters for 255 francs (roughly $200). James Bond fans
will remember the Verzasca jump in the opening scene of
``Goldeneye.'' Believe it or not, it is necessary to book in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Youth hostels ...  &LR; To check on this low-cost lodging check with
any Swiss National Tourist Office in the United States or the local
offices here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zoo ...  &LR; The Ticino's only zoo, at Magliaso in the Malcantone
district, has more than 100 animals: lions, tigers, panthers,
pumas, bears, et al. Open daily.

   BOSTON _ Liz Kaplan should not be alive.
</P>
<P>
   As an infant she developed a rare cancerous tumor that swelled
within her pelvis like a summer melon. She survived surgery,
chemotherapy, and more surgery only to discover in 1985 that she
had been transfused with HIV-infected blood. Twenty-five patients
received the same blood, and today all but two of them are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, a very much alive 15-year-old with a leather thong
around her neck and quizzical green glasses perched on her nose, is
one of the survivors. In January, she stood before a packed
auditorium at Newton North High School and revealed that she was
HIV positive. In doing so she lifted the veil not only on a
profound personal secret, but on a medical disaster that has
remained largely out of sight of both the public and at least some
of the families of the dead. It is a tale not only of a sweeping
loss of life, but one that offers a rare glimpse back to the onset
of one of the most deadly plagues in modern medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where
the blood originated, point out that the tragedy occurred in the
early 1980s, before there was a test for the blood-borne human
immunodeficiency virus. Although they say they informed each of the
patients' families that they had received HIV-infected blood, some
families say that they were told little and that their questions
remain unanswered to this day. Even some hospital workers, who
found their faith in their profession shaken at the time of the
incident, remain haunted by shadows of the 23 dead patients, four
of whom were children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor took us aside and said our son had been infected
with the AIDS virus through a transfusion,'' recalled Brenda
Darling of Fall River, whose 20-year-old son died of AIDS in 1986,
two years after he received a transfusion. ``I was devastated. I
said, `Is he the only one?' The doctor said, `Yes. He is the only
one.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was far from it. Nor was Dana-Farber the only institution
grappling with the virus's resolute march forward. By the time a
test for the virus became available, in March 1985, an estimated
12,000 people nationwide were infected through blood transfusions,
as were an additional 8,000 hemophiliacs, according to the National
Academy of Sciences. Because many did not develop symptoms until
years after infection, the scope of the virus's spread in its early
years was not grasped until much later. Today, health officials say
the blood supply is virtually free of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the swath of death left in the virus's wake,
however, the Dana-Farber tragedy stands alone. In no other case did
a single donor infect so many people with so deadly an outcome, at
least in no case that was reported in scientific literature or that
is recalled by public health officials or those at Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tragedy from any perspective. There were 25 patients in
all, ranging in age from 17 months to 75 years old. Each of them
had cancer. Each of them had undergone treatment requiring blood
transfusions. And each of them was given new blood from a donor who
gave 14 times in the 17 months before a test for HIV became
available. Although the male donor had tested positive for a virus
then associated with homosexuality, doctors did not pursue the
issue to determine if he had been exposed to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   He had.
</P>
<P>
   The virus moved fast. By the time doctors discovered that the
blood was tainted, 15 of the patients were already dead, all but
two of them felled by their original cancers, according to one of
the medical papers, a clinical study published in 1986 in the
Annals of Internal Medicine. Frozen bodily fluids of two of the
dead patients tested HIV positive, but fluids from the other dead
patients were not available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 10 living patients tested positive for HIV.
So, too, did the wife of one of the patients. Of the 10 patients
alive at the time the study began, five died of cancer and three
died of complications stemming from HIV, according to Dana-Farber
officials. Citing confidentiality, the hospital refused to provide
information about the donor or about the two patients who remain
alive. Nor would the hospital allow staff members to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David G. Nathan, Dana-Farber president, said in a letter to
the Globe that the hospital has experienced no other case of HIV
infection through its blood products and currently uses three tests
to ensure that its blood is HIV-free. The hospital, he added, ``has
always adhered to the most rigorous clinical guidelines available
for blood products. ... As an institution dedicated to caring and
healing, we were deeply saddened by this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed in 1988 on behalf of Darling's son, Matthew
Blackledge, generated a $500,000 settlement from Dana-Farber but no
information about the other patients. Suspecting that other
patients had been infected, Darling's lawyers requested names, but
the hospital refused to release them and the court agreed. The
hospital also paid a settlement to at least one other patient who
sued, and both sides agreed to keep the matter confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dana-Farber was not required to report the incident to
any state or local government body, it went largely unnoticed until
Kap-lan addressed her classmates earlier this year. The hospital
says that all of the patients were notified that they had received
infected blood within days of the hospital's discovery that the
donor was HIV positive. But Andrew C. Meyer, a Boston lawyer who
represented Darling, questions not only how much they were told but
whether some patients were told they had received tainted blood at
all.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the families of the already dead ``would have been to
open the door wide to lawsuits, and that was something the hospital
did not want,'' declared Meyer. ``They did not want information
about this to get out because they wanted to keep beds filled. They
wanted to instill public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kaplan was feeling immensely confident in the hospital,
bullish really, back in the summer of 1985. His then-3-year-old
daughter, Liz, had come through a chilling bout with cancer. Her
tumor was gone. Chemotherapy appeared to have eliminated her
illness. At last, she was beginning to walk and talk again.
</P>
<P>
   And then one evening Kaplan was in the kitchen of his Newton
home when the phone rang. It was Liz's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get five words out, and I knew where he was going,''
recalled Kaplan, a lawyer. ``I read the newspapers, and everybody
knew that the blood supply was tainted. The possibility of HIV
infection had always been in the back of our minds. Now, it had
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplans had tried to take precautions, asking Children's
Hospital to allow them to use known donors rather than the blood of
strangers. Like many hospitals at the time, Children's refused but
assured the Kaplans that it would use blood only from the
world-renowned Dana-Farber, blood taken through a process that
generally drew long-term donors. The blood, they assured, would be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   They were hollow promises at best. By early 1983, it seemed
highly likely that HIV was blood-borne, but it would take two more
agonizing years before there was a way to test blood for the virus.
In the meantime, blood banks asked donors a set of questions
designed to ferret out those at high risk. The process was
problematic in part because no one wanted to ask donors if they
were homosexual, but mostly it was a problem of not knowing what to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to turn away donors unnecessarily, many blood banks
simply asked those in apparent high-risk groups, such as IV drug
users and Haitian immigrants, to screen themselves out, but did not
summarily reject them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had no idea what donors were risky,'' said Peter Page,
former medical director of the Red Cross regional blood service in
Boston and now based in Arlington, Va. ``It was a moving target, an
evolving system. We never thought HIV was as prevalent as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, Darling's lawyer, argued that Dana-Farber should have
identified the donor as high risk and rejected him, or at least
screened him more thoroughly, because he tested positive for
cytomegalovirus, which was prevalent among gay men. He also argued
that the hospital failed to test the donor for Hepatitis B, as the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested, although
most blood collection agencies also ignored the recommendation.

 NEWTON, Mass.: ... soon enough.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And come it did on that December evening two years ago. Liz's
two sisters were at sleepovers. A team of professionals, including
a psychiatrist and social worker, were on alert should Liz need
them. She walked into her brick home in Newton and her parents told
her to sit down. Mitch Kaplan will not talk about what happened
next. Neither will Frolin. ``It was the most difficult day of my
life,'' said Frolin, ``except for the day of finding out she had
cancer.'' Liz listened to her parents and when they were done she
asked what had happened to the other children. When she was told
they all had died, she got up and ran for the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went upstairs and cried,'' she said quietly. ``I refused to
eat dinner, which is very unusual for me. I was afraid. I was in
the eighth grade, so I was not uneducated. I knew this was not a
death sentence. But it seemed I would be more likely to die sooner
than most of my classmates and that seemed very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also angry. ``I was really, really angry with my
parents. Why hadn't they told me sooner?'' Kaplan said. ``I
deserved to know. On the other hand, I was kind of like, do I
really want to hear about this at all? I don't want to deal with
it. I don't want to die. That was kind of a big issue, really not
wanting to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she think she would die? ``Yes,'' she says, staring at the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her anger had to do with the sense that she'd been
deceived. All those blood tests she'd had every six months, which
she had been told were for cancer, had often been to measure the
HIV in her blood. All those times when one of her classmates had
gotten chicken pox and she'd been given a temporary vaccine, she'd
been told it was related to her cancer, but it had really been to
bolster her immune system. All those people who'd known, when she
had not. She felt, she said, ``completely lied to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was she sure her parents had told her everything. Although
they'd said she was healthy, her T-cell count dropped dramatically
just months after she learned she was HIV positive. First, she had
an allergic reaction to an antibiotic that landed her in the
hospital. Second, her doctors put her on a three-drug ``cocktail''
regimen including a protease inhibitor, AZT, and a similar
medication to shore up her immune system that she continues to
take. Finally, she underwent a preventive inhalant treatment to
ward off an HIV-related pneumonia that required her to be in a
sealed cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, she was introduced to Groopman, the AIDS
specialist who had supervised her case since she was an infant. He
explained her condition to both school and camp officials. But by
that time her feet were dug deep in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want see a doctor; and she particularly did not want
to see Groopman. ``It weirded me out that this guy had been so
behind the scenes. It was just weird,'' said Kaplan. ``My first
impression was, here's a guy who's pretty high on himself. I felt
like he was trying to be my rabbi, like he was playing God. I made
it clear that I did not like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this guy said he wasn't going to give me any bullshit
and an hour later he said I had a choice about medicine and all
that. Well, the way I see it, it's like you're running towards a
cliff and the choice is you can keep running and fall off or you
can stop. Like, where is the choice?''
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors were concerned that the drop in Kaplan's T
cells meant the virus was becoming active, her count returned to
normal and has remained steady. Kaplan, meanwhile, packed her pills
into her knapsack and headed back to school. While her life had
changed radically, she found her condition didn't interfere with
her regular activities, like acting, skating, and editing the arts
page of her school paper.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she began to want to tell some people about her disease,
but knowing who was not always clear. She called Melissa Simon, one
of her closest friends, that first night. And it was Simon with
whom she often consulted before telling others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acceptance was really important to her,'' said Simon, 16, now
living in Mill Valley, Calif. ``She would be worried, wondering how
it would affect a relationship. Sometimes it would and sometimes it
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she addressed her school, she had told nearly two dozen
friends, ``mostly when I got to the point when I was so close to
them I felt like I was lying almost if I didn't tell them. It was,
like, this is the biggest secret I have and I would like to trust
you with it.'' Virtually all of them have reacted positively,
although there have been a couple of ``weird reactions,'' like the
friend who called her after an afternoon they spent together
because she had discovered a scratch on her skin beneath her watch.
She wanted to know if Kaplan, too, had a scratch, and whether she
should have an AIDS test. And then there was the girl who called
her after a party because she was afraid she had drunken from
Kaplan's glass. She said she didn't want to get Kaplan's cold.
</P>
<P>
   Although her parents have left virtually all decisions about who
to tell up to Kaplan, her father advised her not to tell her
friends at her summer camp in Maine. It was, after all, a small
world in which word could travel fast. . Kaplan agreed at first and
attributed her pill regimen to stomach problems, pointing to the
long, jagged surgical scar running down her stomach. But by the end
of the month she told two more friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen her huge collection of medicine, so it was
surprising, but not too much,'' recalled Paul Heckler, 15, of Cross
River, N.Y. ``It certainly didn't change my thoughts about her. I'd
rather think about who she is now than who she'll be in 10 years or
what will happen to her.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a boyfriend to tell. ``I'd learned from
countless, stupid health classes that HIV isn't communicable like
the common cold,'' said the boyfriend, who didn't want to be
identified for reasons unrelated to her condition. ``She'd asked
her doctor if it was OK to kiss, and that was good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ended this year for reasons both say had
nothing to do with Kaplan's health. But Kaplan thinks a lot about
future relationships. Unless there is a vaccine or cure for AIDS,
she does not expect sex or children to be in her future. Although
only about 25 percent of women with the virus pass it on to their
babies (and that rate drops to about 8 percent with the use of
anti-viral drugs), Kaplan's vision of married life in a Maine
cottage includes two adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't guarantee that a kid will be born without HIV,
why not give a home to one that is already born,'' she said. ``Like
right now, I'm pretty cool about that.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is somewhat less cool about is not knowing anyone who
has the virus. It was that, in part, that led her to tell her
classmates about her condition. It also was ``at a pretty confident
time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided last fall she would share her secret with her school
and community through the sophomore English writing contest. The
assignment was to write about someone who embodied the spirit of
Martin Luther King. The winners would read their essays to the
school assembly marking the holiday. Kaplan reasoned that, if her
essay won, she would know her essay was an eloquent way to make her
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan settled on Mary Fisher, the AIDS activist who spoke at
the 1992 Republican convention. The more she worked on the piece,
the more it seemed like a good idea. Not only might it prompt other
teens to take precautions, but it was ``lending a purpose to
something which is utterly purposeless, my having HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   The adults were not so sure. Her English teacher reminded her
pointedly she would have to read her essay in public if she won.
The principal asked her if she was absolutely sure it was what she
wanted to do. Her father asked the same. As the contest deadline
approached, even Kaplan grew nervous, she said, because ``the
adults were rubbing off on me.'' And then her essay won. By the
time she stepped to the podium in January, her hands were shaking
but she knew her speech by heart. She still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Mary Fisher, you would probably never expect me to have
the virus. I am not gay or a drug addict,'' she said to a hushed
auditorium. ``It just happened, the way people who are black are
born black. ... You only have to be human to be part of a minority
_ you only have to be human to get AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a long time now. The thunderous applause. The
swarming of supporters. The outpouring from the community and
invitations to speak. But in a way, telling her secret has let her
put the whole thing away for a while. She thinks about it at
certain times, like when she goes to the doctor or takes her pills.
But there's a lot of other things to think about, like packing her
trunk for another year of camp. And school. And that guy she's
going to visit next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I talk about my social life more than
I do HIV,'' said Kaplan. ``I have a lot of other things to do. I
mean, I'm only 15.''

   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism

NEW ENGLAND KEEPS TABS ON ITS BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While ocean pollution remains a serious problem among many
coastal communities, and public health standards vary widely in the
region, New England's beaches generally rank among the best in the
nation when it comes to knowing when pollution makes ocean
recreation a genuine health risk, according to the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council notes that disease-causing microorganisms in
contaminated waters can cause a wide range of diseases, including
gastroenteritis; dysentery; hepatitis; ear, nose, and throat
problems; and respiratory illness. The consequences of these
swimming-associated illnesses can be greater for children, elderly
people, and those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   When beaches are closed, most of the problems are caused by
sewage overflows and stormwater.
</P>
<P>
   The NRDC singled out the beaches at Wellfleet on the Cape as
among the best vacation beaches in the nation in terms of its
regular monitoring for pollution and public notification of the
presence of pathogens that can cause health problems. Others rated
highly are beaches at Half Moon Bay, Calif.; Rehoboth Beach, Del.;
Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Ind.; Cape May, N.J.; Cape
Hatteras, N.C.; and Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there were at least 140 days of beach closing
and advisories last year, according to the council's report
``Testing the Waters: Has Your Vacation Beach Cleaned Up Its
Act?,'' an annual survey covering 29 coastal and Great Lakes states
and three US territories.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that Boston area beaches have benefited from an
aggressive monitoring program by the Metropolitan District
Commission and that in New Hampshire and Rhode Island there were no
beach closings or advisories for the sixth consecutive year,
although Rhode Island requires that pollution levels be detected
repeatedly above the standards before closing a beach or notifying
the public. In Maine, there were at least 20 closings or
advisories, as well as three permanent closings. Connecticut led
the pack with 263 days of closings or advisories, although almost
50 were caused by a New York City sewer line break.
</P>
<P>
   Because beaches are a significant vacation and recreation
resource for millions of residents, ``Massachusetts communities
seem to clearly understand the important link between a clean
environment and a healthy economy,'' said Peter Lehner, an NRDC
clean-water specialist. Unfortunately, the report noted that
Barnstable County on Cape Cod does not always close beaches when
the standards are violated. The report said that the beaches are
closed only after a second sample of water is taken.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Testing the Waters'' report is available through NRDC's
Web site at www.nrdc.org.

Assisi. Now those photographs, along with ones taken immediately
after the earthquake, are captured in ``The Basilica of St. Francis
of Assisi: Glory and Destruction'' (Abrams, $24.95). A description

THANKS TO NEW TOOLS LIKE `THE WAND,' DENTAL PATIENTS FEELING LESS
PAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   You know the drill: It vibrates, whines, hisses, whirs, grinds
and smells like it's on fire.
</P>
<P>
   And as if the drill weren't bad enough, it's preceded by those
painful lidocaine injections to deaden the nerves and make the
drilling more tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The syringe is the most fear-provoking device in dentistry. Why,
just the sight of the gleaming needle could cause more sweat than a
peck of pickled habaneros _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   A new computerized anesthetic delivery system, called ``The
Wand,'' has some patients proclaiming lidocaine injections
``pain-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And other changes in dentistry are further reducing the ouch
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Air abrasion is doing away with the drill and needle altogether
in filling some superficial cavities, and lidocaine patches and a
powerful new anesthetic rinse are being used to numb the pain of
injections and sometimes eliminate the need for them.
</P>
<P>
   These days it's no pain, no ... really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had cleanings that were more painful than this,''
proclaimed Blake Estes, 43, immediately after undergoing more than
two hours of periodontal surgery. ``You don't feel anything but a
little bit of pressure on your gums, and then you can feel the
sensation of numbness moving out to the edges of your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes said if he had shut his eyes while Dr. William DuBois
anesthetized his mouth for the extensive gum surgery, he would not
have known the dentist was doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rinse and patches and the wand, we can really almost
guarantee painless dentistry. We've only been able to say that for
the last couple of years,'' said DuBois, a periodontist in Grand
Prairie, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 percent of Americans who seldom or never go to the
dentist, 60 percent say fear of pain is the reason, DuBois said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the research in the last year or so positively
linking gum disease to blood clots that cause heart attacks and
strokes, it is especially important that consumers know there are
things out there to make their dental work pain-free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He helped field-test the new lidocaine dental patches and uses
them for less extensive dental work. The anesthetic-laden
bioadhesive patches are applied directly to the mucous membrane
lining the jaw and take about 10 minutes to numb the area for minor
procedures or pain-free injections.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dyclone rinse, a mouthwash, achieves the same objective.
It is also used to suppress the gag reflex in the positioning of
X-ray films and making prosthetic impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wand,'' a computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery
system, debuted at the American Dental Association's annual
scientific meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the newest thing we have going,'' said Jann Ingmire,
public relations director for the ADA. ``It still involves a
syringe, but the drug goes in at such a slow, steady rate, most
people say it doesn't hurt at all. Some think it doesn't use a
needle, but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a very fine needle, and the anesthetic moves out
just ahead of the needle point so that it numbs as it goes into the
gum.
</P>
<P>
   Air abrasive dental devices, usually found in general dentistry
offices, are not new. They were first used in the 1950s, before the
introduction of the high-speed drill, said Chris Smith, a spokesman
for the Chicago Dental Society.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Borden Air Rotor'' drill was so far superior to anything
else available that it put the old belt-driven drills, as well as
air-abrasive units and other cavity-preparation tools, out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   But air abrasion, sometimes called ``dental sandblasting,'' is
making a comeback, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The current technology uses microparticles of aluminum oxide, an
abrasive substance used in some dentifrices, blown through a
pointerlike hand piece at a very high speed. The hand piece is
directed at tooth decay, which is blasted away in a matter of
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Discomfort due to vibration and heat is eliminated, so the
process can usually be performed without anesthesia, Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Dental sandblasting is used most often to clean out small
cavities without taking any healthy tissue. The cavity is then
filled with a liquid porcelain material that seeps into all the
cavity's nooks and crannies and quickly hardens.
</P>
<P>
   The process is much quicker than traditional drilling and
filling, and the filler matches the tooth color.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this year the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs
favorably reviewed data on the first laser system for treating
tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers have long been used in dentistry for soft tissue work,
such as gum surgery, and recently were approved for one-step
bleaching. A laser also is being used instead of a drill to clean
out cavities.

THE NEW GRAND PRINCESS: ONE BIG BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ From Istanbul to Barcelona, we would be visiting some
of the world's most fascinating cities. But what fascinated me
right now was this city at sea.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, the world's largest and most expensive cruise ship
_ the new Grand Princess, from Princess Cruise Lines. And it didn't
take long after coming aboard to learn that ``Grand'' is no
exaggeration. This 109,000-ton, $450 million ship-on-steroids is
201 feet high, 159 feet wide, and 951 feet long. That, the cruise
line notes, makes it four times longer than Grand Central Station,
28 feet taller than Niagara Falls, 53 feet wider than the Panama
Canal, and 49 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, although the Grand Princess carries 2,600 passengers
and 1,100 crew members, its combination of space and design left me
never feeling crowded.
</P>
<P>
   There was no scrambling for a lounge on deck. After all, there
are three acres of open deck space.
</P>
<P>
   There was no looking in vain for a seat in the theater. After
all, there are three main show lounges, as well as 12 other lounges
for entertainment, dancing, and refreshments.
</P>
<P>
   There never was a feeling that we were dining with a mob. After
all, there are three main dining rooms and three smaller
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   There were no long lines for embarking or disembarking. After
all, there are two gangways.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in fact, I found myself wondering where all the
people had gone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Size and style &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So intriguing was the Grand Princess that my wife, Linda, and I
delayed our exploration of Istanbul _ our first port on a 12-day
Mediterranean cruise _ to explore the 18-deck ship, which,
incidentally, had become the tallest ``building'' in the city. And
there was a lot to see. As one cruise staffer quipped, ``It's just
five minutes from one side of the ship to the other ... by cab.''
</P>
<P>
   It became apparent that a big ship can be tasteful. The decor of
the Grand Princess is, if anything, understated, with sea greens,
ocean blues, russets, tans, and a lot of wood predominating. The
walls have plenty of art attached, some of it reflecting the dream
ports we would be visiting: Istanbul and Kusadasi/Ephesus, Turkey;
Athens; Venice, Naples/Capri, and Livorno/Florence/Pisa, Italy;
Monte Carlo, Monaco; and Barcelona, Spain. (In fall, winter, and
spring, the ship switches to a seven-day Caribbean itinerary, and
will return to the Mediterranean in late spring.)
</P>
<P>
   Our stateroom was on Dolphin Deck, which was easy for me to
remember because it sounds like Donald Duck. Even before entering,
we knew that there would be room for everything because cabins on
modern cruise ships are marvels of efficiency, filled with nooks,
crannies, and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess has 1,300 cabins. Of these, 1,092 are the
so-called standard staterooms featuring twin beds that can make up
into a queen-size bed; color TV with good movies, CNN, the BBC, and
a variety of other channels; a music system; a refrigerator; a
big-enough closet; turndown service (with chocolates left on the
pillows); terrycloth robes; hairdryers; a private safe; a
multifunction telephone; and a bath with shower. I wish I could
have brought that shower home because it had a separate,
set-and-forget control for water temperature. And my wife and I
both wish we could have brought our cabin steward, Narciso, home
because he quietly kept the room ultra-neat.
</P>
<P>
   On 710 outside cabins, there are private balconies _ the most of
any ship afloat _ for relaxing, sunning, sightseeing, and watching
sunsets. That's something anyone should enjoy, but for those with
the inclination (and the budget), there are also 180 minisuites, 24
suites, two grand suites, and two family suites that add space,
televisions, sofa beds, and other amenities, including the service
of a butler, complete with black tie, tails, and (often) a British
accent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ship of ``firsts'' and ``largests,'' some of which we
would check out immediately and others that would wait for the two
days during the voyage that we would be completely at sea, so to
speak. Among the firsts and biggests:
</P>
<P>
   _The largest casino afloat, with 13,500 square feet of space in
which to lose money. Instead of blinding you with neon, the
Neptune's Lair casino features walls with holographic images of sea
creatures, and during my first visit I would have sworn a sea horse
was swimming out to greet me.
</P>
<P>
   _The first wedding and renewal-of-vows chapel at sea, called
Hearts and Minds. (This, after all, is the fleet that calls itself
the Love Boat.) On the Grand Princess's maiden voyage, Captain
Michael Moulin performed the first wedding at sea in modern times.
And that led marine historian John Maxtone-Graham, who delivered
engrossing lectures aboard, to nickname the veteran captain
``Marryin' Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   _The first virtual reality center at sea, with a motion
simulator ride and interactive games. I confess to enjoying the
simulator ride, which is shaped like a giant squid, while the
smattering of youngsters aboard appeared to relish the shoot-em-up
and drive-till-you-drop games. (Whether this room will become
crowded when there are more youngsters aboard remains to be seen.
There is a charge for the games.) The ship also has a digital photo
studio, in which passengers can place themselves into a wide array
of wild photographic scenes, such as skydiving.
</P>
<P>
   _The first ship with a swim-against-the-current lap pool _ one
of five pools aboard. You can even adjust the strength of the
current.
</P>
<P>
   _The launch of a telemedicine program, SeaMed, which can link
the Grand Princess medical staff with the emergency department at
Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. I was fortunate not to
need medical care during the cruise, but did peek at the facilities
and found them impressive. Only one thing: The magazines in the
waiting room were far too recent for a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Dining &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most important features of any cruise are the dining
and the entertainment, and jet-lagged and flight-fatigued though we
might have been, we skipped neither during our first night aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The three main dining rooms are the Da Vinci, the Michelangelo,
and the Botticelli, featuring murals paying homage to the works of
the artists. We were assigned to the Da Vinci, and thus Mona Lisa
smiled upon us from across the room at every meal. There are two
seatings in each of these dining rooms, which are sectioned to give
a feeling of coziness. Well, semi-coziness, perhaps.

   TAKE-BOS  
 ISTANBUL: ... semi-cizoness, perhaps.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Grand Princess has a $10 million kitchen _ two kitchens
actually, both the length of two football fields and employing a
total of 208 workers. Under executive chef Antonio Cereda,
everything is made from scratch, using food from Italy, France,
Holland, the United States, and elsewhere. The result is six-course
meals that include such dishes as filet of dover sole florentine,
boneless chicken kiev, young tom turkey with all the trimmings,
grilled black angus sirloin steak, broiled lobster tail, and royal
pheasant in pan juices. There are always a healthy-choice offering
and a vegetarian menu. And certain popular dishes are available any
night. There also always is a pasta course, and I found Princess
pasta, from fettucini nicotera to ravioli con salsa di funghi
porcini, to be as delicious as any I had ashore in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But the eating doesn't stop there. There is also the Painted
Desert, the first Southwestern-themed restaurant aboard a cruise
ship (ho-hum, another Grand Princess ``first''), and the Sabatini
Trattoria for casual Italian dining. (Reservations are needed at
these restaurants, and there is a service charge of $3.50 a
person.) In addition, there are breakfast and lunch buffets, a
24-hour cafe called the Horizon Court, a poolside pizzeria, a
patisserie/caviar bar, a hamburger-and-hot-dog grill, and the Ice
Scream sundae bar, where concoctions such as a Chocolate Obsession
and a Shaken Jamaican are made with Haagen-Dazs ice cream (but,
unlike almost all other food on the ship, cost extra). And there is
24-hour room service. With 24-hour dining, there is no need for a
midnight buffet. One certainly isn't needed, but I missed one
staple of such buffets: the displays in which ordinary food items
have been sculpted objets d'art, although examples of this art can
still be found aboard ship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Entertainment &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are three main show lounges, the two-level Princess
Theater, with its 36-foot proscenium arch stage; the Vista
Showlounge; and the Explorers Lounge, where the waitstaff dresses
in safari costumes, a la Disney World. All feature the kind of
dazzling Broadway, Las Vegas, and cabaret shows that cruise ships
are known for. ``Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,'' for instance, features
hits from more than two dozen Broadway shows. But a new production,
``Glamour,'' features what is believed to be the largest (there's
that word again) cast of any cruise-ship production _ four singers
and 18 dancers _ and contains some surprising scenes. Audience
reaction appeared mixed at the performance I attended, but it
certainly grabbed everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess will always have celebrity entertainers
aboard, too _ two on the Mediterranean cruises and one on the
Caribbean sailings. Celebrities have included, or will include,
Rita Moreno, Red Buttons, Alan King, David Brenner, and Lorna Luft.
In addition, there are comedians, musicians, acrobats, and special
performers like Bob Anderson, who gives outstanding singing
impressions of everyone from Sinatra to Neil Diamond, and the
Macaggi Duo, a husband and wife who balance their bodies in ways I
haven't seen since I surreptitiously leafed through an illustrated
copy of ``The Kama Sutra'' when I was 14. What's more, the shows
are sequenced so that you can see two and sometimes three a night
if you have the stamina.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to a formal show, though: Entertainment is
sprinkled throughout the Grand Princess. A Hungarian quintet plays
in the three-level atrium. There are singers and entertainers in
several of the lounges. The Skywalkers Disco &AMP; Observation Lounge,
a unique aluminum structure 150 feet above the water, is a lively
star-spangled club by night and an observation lounge by day. (You
can get to it only via a glass-enclosed traveling ``skywalk.'') The
Snookers Sports Bar has the big games via satellite TV (and, on the
lounge walls, memorabilia such as jerseys autographed by Ted
Williams, Dan Marino, Troy Aikman, and Michael Jordan, as well as
Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves.. The in-cabin TVs show feature films
such as ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Anastasia,'' and ``Out to Sea,'' which I
thought was damned big of Princess to run, considering that it was
filmed on a Holland America ship.
</P>
<P>
   There, too, are cruise-ship staples such as trivia games, the
Newlywed and Not So Newlywed Game, ``horse racing,'' and that
perennial favorite, bingo. And there occasionally is entertainment
linked to the ports being visited, such as a folkloric show in
Barcelona and a classical concert in Venice, complete with jugglers
and clowns all doing tricks for us. There is simulated golf, where
you play at the world's greatest courses, and a nine-hole putting
green. Also aboard: table tennis, volleyball, basketball, and a
giant chess board with huge chess pieces, and, yes, shuffleboard.
But, as ship historian Maxtone-Graham noted, there are also
unadvertised ``activities'' like reading in a deck chair until you
fall into a refreshing sleep.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Other features
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess also has a gym and health spa, beauty salon,
teenage center, child-care centers that the youngsters (and their
parents) really seemed to enjoy, a library, a fine arts gallery
(there is $3 million worth of art aboard), a writing room, a card
room, and four duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
   So how hard was it to get around on a ship this size? Not very,
since most public areas fan out logically from the atrium and there
is a plethora of elevators and signs telling where everything is.
</P>
<P>
   As a directionally-impaired person who takes stairs for exercise
to counterbalance the many dining opportunities aboard, I found it
a bit confusing that the stairway amidships does not reach all
decks. But I finally figured things out and usually remembered to
climb the stairs fore and aft. Meanwhile, my only wait during the
voyage was at the two purser's desks, where some passengers seem to
turn buying stamps or cashing travelers' checks into an operation
more complex than a corporate merger.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ship was completed slightly behind schedule, the
first planned cruise was canceled and the Grand Princess went into
service after only a brief no-passenger sail. As a result, in the
first days of sailing there were occasional glitches and gremlins _
a hyperactive air conditioner here, a drippy faucet there. But, as
one mother tells her 5-year-old, ``Spit happens,'' and virtuallyall
those problems should be gone by now.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was smooth sailing, literally as well as
figuratively, because much of the time I would forget the ship was
in motion. You might say it was grand.

MEMORIES OF MARVELOUS PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ The Grand Princess's Mediterranean cruise boasts one
of the best European sailing itinerary I've encountered. But when
you visit eight ports in a dozen days, you naturally don't get an
in-depth look at those destinations. What you do get, though, are
marvelous random memories. Here are some of mine:
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul _ It's the only city that straddles two continents _
Europe and Asia _ and it's always abuzz with activity. It has a
universal language, too: that of the car horn. ... The Grand Bazaar
is a seemingly endless enclave, with 4,000 shops and stalls crammed
with rugs, jewelry, leather goods, and nearly everything else. But
you don't have to go there to find salespeople. Wherever there's a
shop or a tourist, there's a cheerfully aggressive salesman
lurching out of nowhere and willing to bargain. ``They're on you
like a duck on a June bug,'' says an exasperated tourist from
Texas. But she's smiling. ... Just $4 of our money equals a million
Turkish lira, so we're all millionaires here. ... The Blue Mosque
and Hagia Sophia, with their domes and minarets and tumbling roofs,
are merely magnificent, conjuring up the wonder and mystery of this
ancient crossroads city. The same goes for Topkapi Palace, which
has much more than its most famous item: that jewel-encrusted
sword. ... Schoolchildren greet us wherever we go by saying in
English, ``Hello! What's your name?'' And aren't they good-looking
kids!
</P>
<P>
   Kusadasi and Ephesus _ We're now on the other side of the
Bosporus and thus in Asia. ... Pedicabs greet us at the port, but
we join a Princess shore excursion with a great Turkish guide who
says to call him Jack. ... We pass olive, fig, and mulberry trees
to visit the home where the Virgin Mary lived after the death of
Jesus. ... The ruins of the ancient city of Ephesus are one of the
most amazing sights anywhere. ... Instead of a pile of rocks where
you must imagine what once existed, here are mostly marble
structures from 1,800 years ago that speak of a city that once was:
homes that had running water, a small theater, an ad for a brothel,
public toilets, and _ most impressive of all _ the two-story
Library of Celsus. Do not miss visiting Ephesus. ... Nearby is a
moving sight: the Basilica of St. John, where Jesus' apostle is
buried. ... Back in Kusadasi, there is another big bazaar.
``Come,'' a jewelry salesmen says. ``Just look. Have some Turkish
apple tea.'' My wife ends up buying a ring that may or may not have
been a bargain but is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Athens _ This isn't the pretty city it was three or so decades
ago because there are more people, more buildings, and more cars,
but it's a vibrant place, and its ancient sites continue to
enthrall. ... Looking at the Parthenon and other structures at the
Acropolis, I try to envision them as they once were: painted, blue,
terra-cotta, black, and white. ... Later, I salute as we ride by a
statue of Harry Truman, a hero to the Greek people, too. ... At the
Olympic Stadium, we are reminded that Athens, and not Atlanta,
should have been the setting for the 100th modern Olympics. ...
Wandering through the Plaka shopping district, I see Leonardo
DiCaprio T-shirts everywhere. But the T-shirt that impresses me
says simply, ``Michael Jordan.'' Why? Because it is worn not by a
tourist but a Greek schoolboy. ... Must my wife snap a picture of
every cat in Athens (and everywhere else, for that matter)? ... A
scenic ride of an hour or so to Cape Sounion brings us to the
ancient Temple of Poseidon, perched high on a cliff with the Aegean
Sea churning below. Just call it our Poseidon adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Venice _ With the exception of being born, coming into Venice by
sea on a big ship has to be the most breathtaking arrival possible.
The size of the Grand Princess allows passengers to look down on
the red-tiled roofs of this fabled city of 177 canals, 117 islands,
and 401 bridges. ``Worth the price of admission alone,'' says one
pleased passenger out on deck. On land, a Venetian praises the deft
maneuvering needed to get our big ship into port: ``If the ship
couldn't stop, no more Venice!'' ... Riding a gondola is fun but
not overly romantic because we're in a canal traffic jam caused by
tourists in gondolas. One gondolier amuses his captive audience by
singing in a rich, operatic voice, ``Spag-HET-ti, mac-a-RO-ni,
tor-tel-LIN-i.'' ... The blown glass at a factory on the tiny
island of Murano is exquisite but pricey. ... Because we are
staying in port overnight, we visit St. Mark's Square in the
evening, when there are fewer people and fewer pigeons, and all
couples are holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   Naples/Capri/Rome _ The port is Naples, and the area is filled
with worthy sites, from the ruins of Pompeii to the beauty of the
Amalfi Coast to the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum to the Isle
of Capri, celebrated in song. But we are off on an optional
overland tour and will meet up with the ship the next day in
Livorno, near Pisa. On the overland trip, there is little time for
shopping or leisure, but oh the sights we see. ... When you gaze at
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or, through a glass barrier, at
the Pieta in St. Peter's Cathedral, or at the Cathedral itself, the
heat and the crowds and the sellers of schlocky souvenirs all fade
into insignificance. I find myself thinking that nothing of this
grandeur will ever be created by humankind again. ... The Colosseum
does not disappoint, either, even with the young fellows dressed as
Roman centurions who pose for pictures for a price. ... At the
evening's Roman dinner, two opera singers are taking requests. I
try to ask in Italian for ``La Ci Darem La Mano'' from ``Don
Giovanni.'' But I mangle the language and end up telling the duo
that I want to sing it. That would have emptied the restaurant. ...
When in Rome, do as the tourists do. So at the Trevi Fountain _
sparkling at night _ I toss in a coin and hope that really does
mean I'll be back one day.
</P>
<P>
   Livorno/Florence/Pisa _ With the ship docking in nearby Livorno,
passengers are free to explore these sites and book tours for them.
But they are also part of our overland tour, and we travel via the
Umbrian and Tuscan countryside. We stop occasionally for cappuccino
or gelato, which is really Paradise in a cup. ... In Florence, the
beauty and intricacy of the Duomo, the Campanile, the Baptistery,
and the Palazzo Vecchio leave me almost speechless. But speech is
on my mind at the Church of Santa Croce, where Michelangelo,
Machiavelli, Galileo, and other great artists and thinkers are
buried. I imagine their spirits emerging at night and conducting
the most stimulating conversations. ... Artists are selling
sketches in the Plaza Della Signoria, including one of Leonardo. Da
Vinci? No, DiCaprio. ... The Tower of Pisa leans all right _ 14
feet out of its perpendicular. Never have I seen so many sellers of
souvenirs in one spot than in Pisa, offering, among other things,
leaning towers in your choice of size and materials. But,
fortunately, the sales-people don't lean on you.
</P>
<P>
   Monte Carlo _ Extravagant yachts are our first sight as we
travel by the ship's tenders (small boats) to visit the
principality of Monaco, a mere 3/4-mile in size but what riches it
holds (and I don't mean the cash lost in its famous casino). ... We
make our way through the twisting streets and vaulted passages of
Old Monaco, where the Royal Palace of the Grimaldi family glistens
in the sun. ... Someone spots Prince Rainier leaving in a dark blue
luxury car, but I'm not upset that I missed him. After all, I saw
Elvis once. ... The portion of the palace that is open to the
public is filled with ornate decor, and reminds me of how the
builders of the Newport, R.I., mansions slavishly mimicked such
European style. ... At St. Nicholas Cathedral, there are always
flowers on the grave of the princess once known as Grace Kelly. ...
The sea has turned rough, and we have a rocky, splashy tender ride
back to the Grand Princess. It's the scariest thing that happens on
this trip, with the possible exception of watching me eat pasta
with marinara sauce while wearing a white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona _ We are greeted at the dock by costumed musicians on
white horses. ... From 700-foot Montjuic Mountain, the view of this
lively city and its harbor is great, but my wife and I equally
enjoy watching youngsters at play in the nearby parks. ... There
are so many sights on that amazing stretch called Las Ramblas:
living statues (that is, motionless performers) in silver, living
statues in bronze, a dog wearing wings, people shopping, eating,
drinking, laughing, kissing. ... No other building looks like an
Antoni Gaudi building _ for instance, La Pedrera, with its curving,
smooth stone exterior and elaborate iron balconies. ... Gaudi's
most memorable building, of course, is the La Sagrada Familia
church, more than 100 years in the making with perhaps a century to
go before completion by his disciples. We take an elevator to the
top of the structure but somehow end up walking down a narrow,
turning, seemingly endless stairway to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere _ The Grand Princess is an attraction wherever we go.
In Istanbul, they stand on rooftops and wave. In Venice, where
boating is a way of life, they gather on balconies and bridges to
look. In Barcelona, a radio announcer speaks about ``el gran
barco'' _ the grand ship. Whenever we come into a port, big and
little boats come as close as they can for a better view. Even
passengers on other cruise ships head for their decks to look. It's
kind of nice being an object of attention and affection!

UNIVERSITIES CRITICIZE FEDERAL CUTS IN RESEARCH SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARVY LIPMAN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Federal research grants to public colleges and
universities in New York, which make up more than half of the
schools' research money, last year fell to the lowest level since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Private universities statewide also saw their federal funding
drop, reaching its second-lowest level of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening in New York is part of a national trend. In
1996 and 1997, the federal government doled out about 10 percent
less in research grants _ adjusted for inflation _ than it did at
its high point in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of those cuts reverberate far beyond the walls of
university labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should any of us care about that?'' said Jack Wilson,
acting provost at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Rensselaer,
N.Y. ``Because in the last 15, maybe 20 years, we've seen the
conversion of the U.S. economy away from heavier manufacturing
toward the information industries ... What comes out of research
labs is the next industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to attract grants _ or more specifically, the faculty
who can win grants _ also affects students. For one thing, much of
the federal money is used to pay graduate assistants to work on
research projects. But researchers and university administrators
also argue that there are benefits for undergraduates, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are getting grants by definition have to be on the
cutting edge of their fields,'' said Stewart Tolnay, director of
the Center for Social and Demographic Analysis at the State
University of New York University at Albany. ``If your faculty are
successfully writing grants, that means they're well-informed and
up-to-date in their fields, and having well-informed professors
benefits undergraduates.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts are the result of Congress' efforts to balance the
budget. With the exception of the National Institutes of Health,
virtually every federal agency that funds research has been forced
to reduce its support for such work over the past few years. The
National Science Foundation, the Defense Department and the
Department of Energy have all reduced by about 10 percent the
amount of research money they've put into universities in New York
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the budget is a virtue and makes good sense,'' said
Jerry Roschwalb, director of governmental relations for the
Washington-based National Association of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges. ``But we are a cheap date. We're only about
$16 billion from the whole federal government, which is not a lot
of money when you're talking about a $1.7 trillion federal
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Roschwalb argues that research grants are among the best
investments the federal government makes _ returning about $20 in
economic growth for every $1 spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could offer you the return on a business investment that
we can offer Congress as a return on research, you would steal the
money to invest. And nobody argues with us about that,'' he added.
``We had a study done on high-tech patents this year, and 80
percent of them referred to university basic research. If it wasn't
for university research, this stuff wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But basic research _ the kind of work that may solve a
fundamental scientific puzzle without leading directly to some new
device _ is what's suffering the most because of federal cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter? ``Because that's where the Nobel prizes
come from,'' Roschwalb said. ``You've got two or three young guys
in a lab who want to do something a little bit different, who want
to gamble on something a little off the main track, a little more
innovative. That's what's lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Another result is that universities are in fierce competition
with one another for faculty who can bring in the grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recruit faculty of the highest quality,'' said
Daniel Wulff, interim vice president for research at the State
University of New York at Albany. That can mean the university has
to come up with other money to spruce up its labs and equipment, so
top-notch researchers will want to join the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many states are trying to hold down costs, that
can make things tough for state universities.

BASEBALL GREAT FINALLY GETS THE HONOR HE DESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _20Immortality is running late only by human
standards _ slowed, no doubt, by rubber-neck traffic. Immortality
doesn't answer to clocks or calendars. Immortality tends to matters
on its own terms, in its own good timelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality finally has gotten around to settling up with
Gorgeous George Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday provided a cozy and
comfortable place for Davis, a native of Cohoes, N.Y., who last
appeared in a major-league game in 1909. Davis didn't make it easy
for immortality to find him. He has spent nearly six decades in an
unmarked grave in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: One of the best all-around players of the turn of
the century gets a plaque in his honor in baseball's shrine before
he gets a headstone on his grave. If the juxtaposition seems out of
kilter, then you're starting to get a flavor of the paradoxical
life Davis either created for himself or had thrust upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Davis performed acts of heroism that had nothing to do with his
ability to catch or throw or hit a baseball, yet he spent his final
years in a mental hospital enveloped in a syphilis haze.
Contemporaries lauded Davis for his gentlemanly behavior on the
field, yet his attempt to break a contract nearly caused a war
between the American and National leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent the bulk of his 20 years in the major leagues in New
York and Chicago, playing a key role on two championship teams, yet
baseball quickly carried on as if he never existed.
</P>
<P>
   Even a seemingly cut-and-dry matter like marriage is a mystery
where Davis is involved. Or not involved. Some researchers say
Davis remained a bachelor until 1918, when he was nearly 50. Some
point to testimony from a 1909 court case that indicates Davis was
married during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, nobody has found evidence that Davis left behind
any children. No relatives have come forward on Davis' behalf for
the induction ceremonies _ a strict departure from the Hall of Fame
norm.
</P>
<P>
   George Stacey Davis was born at 32 Sargent St. in Cohoes on Aug.
23, 1870. He was the fifth of seven children of immigrant parents.
Abram Davis was from Wales, Sarah Healy Davis from England. They
met as neighbors on Sargent Street and married in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohoes of George Davis' boyhood was full of possibilities.
Sitting just off the Hudson River, Cohoes had location, location,
location in its favor when it came to emerging as a hub of
industry. Abram Davis was a machinist. One of his boys went to work
in the textile mill at age 11, but George Davis had a different
kind of life in mind.
</P>
<P>
   He played outfield for a semi-pro Albany baseball team in 1889.
When the National League got raided by a rival league the next
year, Albany manager Tom York directed the Cleveland Spiders'
attention to a 5-foot-9 young man who could run, throw, catch and
switch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   The winter after the 1892 season, John Montgomery Ward left the
Brooklyn team to manage the New York Giants. One of Ward's first
moves was to trade one of the biggest stars of the 19th century,
catcher Buck Ewing, out of New York for Davis. It was a colossal
show of faith in Davis, because he was 22 and coming off a season
when he batted only .241 while shuttling between the outfield and
third base.
</P>
<P>
   Davis clearly took a liking to his new surroundings, as well as
the new rule that moved back the pitcher's mound from 50 feet to
its current distance of 60-feet-six-inches. He finished fourth in
the 1893 batting race (.355) and second in slugging percentage
(.554). He scored 112 runs and drove in 119. He whacked 27 triples
and finished in a fifth-place tie with 11 home runs. That began a
streak of nine consecutive seasons of hitting above .300.
</P>
<P>
   The streak ended in 1902. Davis slipped to .299.
</P>
<P>
   During that 10-year reign of terror at the plate, in the field
and on the basepaths, Davis batted .329 while averaging 91 runs
batted in, 91 runs scored and 39 stolen bases. He helped the Giants
upset the Baltimore Orioles in the 1894 equivalent of the World
Series. He had emerged as the best all-around shortstop in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took the chance to become a full-time shortstop in 1897 as
his cue to act as if he had been born to play the position. He led
the league in putouts and double plays. He finished 10th in the
league in batting (.353), fifth in slugging (.509) and was one home
run short of tying for the league lead of 11. The modern-day record
for RBI in a season by a switch-hitter is 130, set by Mickey Mantle
during his Triple Crown and Most Valuable Player season of 1956 and
matched by Ken Caminiti during his 1996 MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, Davis drove in 136 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was a regular shortstop for 10 seasons. No shortstop
handled more chances per game or had a higher fielder percentage
during that time. Gorgeous George, they called him. The exhaustive
encyclopedia, Total Baseball, ranked Davis as the No. 3 player in
the league 1893, No. 2 in 1897, No.1 in 1899, No. 2 in 1900, No. 4
in 1901, No. 1 in 1905 (at age 35) and No. 5 in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of player should Gorgeous George be compared to in
modern-day terms?
</P>
<P>
   Think Robin Yount, a member in good standing of the hallowed
3,000 Hit Club. A switch-hitting Yount, give or take a plus or
minus. Like Davis, Yount broke into the majors as a teen-ager. Like
Davis, Yount was one of the cornerstone offensive players on his
team. Like Davis, Yount, who will be eligible for the next Hall of
Fame vote, spent a chunk of a 20-year career (1974 to 1993) playing
somewhere other than shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Yount loses some ground to Davis on defense. While Yount ranked
fourth among the 1950-1993 shortstops in successful chances per
game (4.99), he was 33rd in fielding percentage (.964). Yount won
one Gold Glove before shoulder injuries forced him to move to the
outfield for his final nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, for his part, ranked fourth in fielding percentage (.940)
while handling more chances per game than anybody (5.84) in an age
of bumpy fields and gloves the size of, well, gloves. Winter
gloves, as opposed to modern-day monstrosities that just barely fit
into a Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 seasons as a regular shortstop, Davis led the
league in chances per game four times and finished second three
times. He led the league in double plays four times and finished
second three times. He led in fielding percentage four times and
was second there seems to be a pattern here _ three times.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In time, another pattern would emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous George Davis didn't have even a shred of a clue how to
promote himself. The flashiest thing about him was his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1898, the Giants manager resigned. The manager was
Ewing, whom the Giants had traded seven years earlier to acquire
Davis. His successor: Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing didn't go quietly, 22-41 record or not, accusing Davis of
undermining the efforts of the manager.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ewing, players resented teammates he'd brought in
from Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Ewing accused Davis of using a knee
injury as an excuse to miss a road trip and curry favor with the
owner. Why, Ewing knew for a fact that Davis had been out scouting
minor leaguers and ``has secured Taylor, a deaf-mute pitcher from
the Albany Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther ``Dummy'' Taylor joined the team that season and would
win 116 major-league games. His teammates eventually learned sign
language to communicate with Taylor, developing the basis for the
coaching signs used today.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continued to brew during the offseason, when first
baseman Jack Doyle said, ``The New York team will never be
successful as long as George Davis is at the head of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants went 52-85 the next season under Davis. The only
bright light in that dark season was the emergence of a
20-year-old, 20-game winner named Christy Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chicago White Sox offered a two-year deal that would
make Davis the highest-paid infielder in baseball, he jumped at the
chance to leave behind his troubles in New York. Davis made $4,000
with the White Sox in 1902 before attempting to break that is
accepted the Giants' offer of $6,300 to fill the hole he had left
at shortstop _ in the process violating a peace treaty the two
leagues recently had forged.
</P>
<P>
   Order was restored only after National League President Harry
Pulliam ordered Davis back to the White Sox after only four games
with the Giants. Davis sat out the rest of that season before
returning to the White Sox, and he was worth the wait. He still was
going strong in 1906, when he was the cleanup hitter on a
pennant-winning team.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Davis batted .277, stole 27 bases and finished third in
the league with 80 RBI. ``Hitless Wonders'' that the White Sox
were, .230 team batting average and all, they entered the World
Series with the look of sacrificial lambs being led into slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-town rival Cubs had won a record 116 games, and an
ailing Davis would miss the start of the series. He returned to the
lineup with the White Sox trailing, two games to one. He delivered
four hits, including three doubles, in 13 at-bats over the next
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Will Hitless Wonders never cease? The White Sox won all three
games to take the series. Though Davis had missed half the series,
he led both teams with six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis had gone out then, on top, maybe the Hall of Fame
couldn't have missed him and his .303 career average. Instead,
Davis hung around long enough for his average to fall to .295. More
than two and a half decades passed between the time Davis played
his final game and the Hall of Fame opened.
</P>
<P>
   By then, George Stacey Davis was out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   And probably out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His death, on Oct. 17, 1940, didn't even rate a newspaper
obituary. Davis had been admitted to Philadelphia General Hospital
six years earlier suffering generalized paralysis and mental
impairment. Doctors diagnosed him with paresis, a disease of the
brain caused by advanced syphilis. The disease is marked by
progressive dementia, with patients frequently experiencing
dramatic mood swings and delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gorgeous George Davis spent the last six years of his
life. Within three weeks of his admission into the hospital, he was
transferred to a psychiatric facility. His wife, Jane Holden Davis,
had him buried at Fernwood Cemetery in a pine box the day after he
died. There were no pallbearers. The cost: $41.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous George Davis is in a better place now, a place where
people can remember him as one of the greatest baseball players
ever to wear spikes. He's even getting a headstone on his grave.
The Century Monument Co. in Rensselaer, N.Y., is donating a stone
at no cost, to be unveiled in September.

   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PLANTAINS (New York) _ To many Americans raised on eating sweet,
mushy bananas, it is difficult to imagine one that does not taste
sweet and needs to be cooked. But the plantain, a tropical fruit of
near miraculous variability, is spilling over from bodegas and
flooding into supermarkets and restaurants all over New York. It is
becoming so pervasive that it seems poised to join the list of
mainstream ingredients that were exotic not so long ago, like
cilantro, jalapenos and lemon grass. By Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   NY-MENUS (New York) _ Anyone who's been dining out at some of
the newest New York restaurants recently might have noticed that
the menu has become a rather puzzling document. Buttons of
milkweed? Mint love letters? Hot Eel Dice? Huh? The newest rage
about town is a menu so special, so exclusive, that even you, the
special, exclusive diner who is paying for the privilege, has no
idea what you are about to eat. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   EAST-GERMANY-RESTAURANTS (Dresden) _ In Dresden, which is
rapidly repairing the physical damage from the hideous allied
fire-bombing of 1945, if not the psychological damage of the dismal
decades that followed, the dining room of the Bulow Residenz, a
small hotel in a stunning canary-and-white Baroque mansion, has won
a richly deserved Michelin star for cooking that would pass muster
in Paris. Gun-toting cops are long gone, replaced by shining
crystal and fresh flowers. In eastern Berlin, one is spoiled for
choice; indeed, many knowing visitors turn their backs on the
fading glamour of the Kurfurstendamm in the western part of town to
stay and eat in Mitte, the heart of the east. There, too, is a
Michelin-starred restaurant, called Vau, a handsome room with a
modern barrel-vault ceiling, sharp service, and fresh, light German
cooking. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   PLANTAINS (New York) _ To many Americans raised on eating sweet,
mushy bananas, it is difficult to imagine one that does not taste
sweet and needs to be cooked. But the plantain, a tropical fruit of
near miraculous variability, is spilling over from bodegas and
flooding into supermarkets and restaurants all over New York. It is
becoming so pervasive that it seems poised to join the list of
mainstream ingredients that were exotic not so long ago, like
cilantro, jalapenos and lemon grass. By Amanda Hesser.

   NY-MENUS (New York) _ Anyone who's been dining out at some of
the newest New York restaurants recently might have noticed that
the menu has become a rather puzzling document. Buttons of
milkweed? Mint love letters? Hot Eel Dice? Huh? The newest rage
about town is a menu so special, so exclusive, that even you, the
special, exclusive diner who is paying for the privilege, has no
idea what you are about to eat. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   EAST-GERMANY-RESTAURANTS (Dresden) _ In Dresden, which is
rapidly repairing the physical damage from the hideous allied
fire-bombing of 1945, if not the psychological damage of the dismal
decades that followed, the dining room of the Bulow Residenz, a
small hotel in a stunning canary-and-white Baroque mansion, has won
a richly deserved Michelin star for cooking that would pass muster
in Paris. Gun-toting cops are long gone, replaced by shining
crystal and fresh flowers. In eastern Berlin, one is spoiled for
choice; indeed, many knowing visitors turn their backs on the
fading glamour of the Kurfurstendamm in the western part of town to
stay and eat in Mitte, the heart of the east. There, too, is a
Michelin-starred restaurant, called Vau, a handsome room with a
modern barrel-vault ceiling, sharp service, and fresh, light German
cooking. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   LIVERPOOL, England _ Paul McCartney's yesterday is here today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, visitors will be allowed to explore the
modest government housing unit where the former Beatle spent his
years as a teenager and began life as a rock 'n roll icon.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney and John Lennon often slipped away from school to idle
away their afternoons in the tiny front parlor picking at their
guitars by the coal-fueled heater. Here they scratched out early
tunes such as ``I Saw Her Standing There'' and ``Love Me Do,'' the
song that launched the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still living in the house when the Beatles found
worldwide fame,'' McCartney wrote in a guidebook prepared for the
house. ``My memories of the house are closely connected with those
times.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney was 13 when his family moved into the 3-year-old house
at 20 Forthlin Road, not far from the shops and stores of Penny
Lane. It was 1955 -- the year before McCartney's mother Mary died
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He remained there with his father Jim and brother Michael until
1964, the year of the group's American debut, when
Beatlemania-crazed fans forced the McCartneys to flee in the middle
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Trust bought the two-story council house
for $91,000 from the woman who moved in after the McCartneys left.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting furniture, decorations and other artifacts, the
Trust sought to recreate the aura of living in a government-owned
council house during the 1950s and early 1960s. There are period
furniture pieces and appliances -- including a small TV bought in
the '50s from future Beatles manager Brian Epstein's music store.
</P>
<P>
   The painting scheme -- a buttery ``corporation cream'' and deep
maroon -- is authentic. Even the flowers bordering the rectangle of
grass in front of the house were selected to match what the
McCartneys had planted.
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white photographs taken by Paul's brother Michael
connect the rooms to his family's daily life there. Among these is
a famous photo of McCartney climbing up a drainpipe to the back
restroom window.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's tiny linoleum-floored bedroom, where he slept until
the Beatles made it big, overlooks the front garden and quiet
street. It is in this spare room that he listened to American
rhythm and blues greats Fats Domino and Little Richard on a
Phillips radio that Jim McCartney rigged for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are familiar things for many people; perhaps reminding
them of somewhere they had been, maybe their grandmothers' homes,''
said Sarah Collins, a spokeswoman for the National Trust. ``It's
meant to be an evocation of what went on here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the judgment of the National trust, what went on in these
cramped quarters was important. This marks the first time that the
trust, which is most often associated with palaces and castles,
acquired a house connected to a living person, and it is the most
modern property in the organization's inventory. ``I don't think
anybody could argue about the impact of the Beatles to popular
culture in the 20th century,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   And people in Liverpool, a faded port city of 500,000, aren't
arguing with the impact, or at least the potential impact, of the
Beatles on the local economy. Of the 800,000 tourists who visit
Liverpool each year, about 500,000 come because of the Beatles,
according to the Merseyside Tourism and Conference Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's house is only the latest addition to the collection
of Beatles attractions that have sprung up here in recent years.
The city seems to be shedding its ambivalence about its most famous
sons who left at the first opportunity, and in the minds of some
failed to look back often enough.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, there was little evidence that the Beatles had
ever existed here. Now, signs of the Fab Four are here, there and
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of years ago, the city began to recognize the tourism
potential and began to develop an infrastructure to support it,''
said Keith Davis of the Tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool officials are eager to bring people here with the
sizzle of the Beatles and then hook them on the city's history,
fine collection of architecturally interesting buildings and
attractions such as the nearby walled city of Chester. ``Liverpool
is a brand name across the world because of the Beatles, and we
need to find ways to leverage that,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The leveraging is well under way. For a sample -- a big sample
-- take a Magical Mystery Tour bus to 59 Beatles sites, including
the Strawberry Field orphanage and the early homes of all four --
such as No. 9 Newcastle Road, where Lennon lived with his mother,
Julia.
</P>
<P>
   On Mathew Street, where the Beatles debuted in the Cavern
nightclub, you can buy a pint at the Abbey Road bar or get a
``Lennon Burger,'' with fried onions and tomatoes for about $2.50.
The Cavern, the cellar of an old fruit warehouse that was nearly
demolished in the 1970s, has recently reopened. Around the old
nightclub, the city has developed Cavern Walks shopping arcade.
There's the Cavern Pub and Cavern Wall of Fame, which bears the
names of 1,801 acts that appeared there between 1957 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Beatles' Story at the Albert Docks, which
for an admission charge of about $7.50 per adult offers an
underground walking tour that progresses through the stages in the
careers of the four Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While it is expected to bring only 11,000 paid visitors a year,
the McCartney house will lend an air of dignity to the legacy here.
Moreover, it is creating a nice spate of publicity, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the neighbors on Forthlin Road, the prospect of a fresh
wave of Beatlemania is a bit unnerving. On Tuesday, a number of
cars and vans bearing what appeared to be peering tourists stopped
in at the house and began video-taping people standing outside. A
mother holding her pigtailed daughters' hand complained to a
National Trust official about the danger of the traffic to the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gledhill, who lives next door, already is annoyed. ``It's
already like living in a fishbowl,'' he said. ``This is hyped up
out of all proportion. I feel like packing up.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCartney's part, he expressed some pride at the house's
recognition. ``My dear mother Mary had great aspirations for our
family and was very proud and pleased when we moved in,'' he wrote
in a good-luck letter to the Trust. ``Because of its modern design,
it was a house that attracted the admiration of visitors, as I hope
it will now.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ To steel himself for what he thought would be a
round of questions from veterans in his therapy group, Dr. Nick
Kanas went to see the new World War II film ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' He is glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand better, emotionally, what it was like. Watching
it, things came together for me emotionally that I had already come
to accept intellectually,'' said Kanas, a psychiatrist who holds
talk sessions with World War II and Korean War veterans at the
Veterans Administration hospital at Fort Miley.
</P>
<P>
   Kanas, a veteran of the Vietnam War, meets regularly with a
group of men in their 60s, 70s and 80s at the San Francisco
hospital. After seeing ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he said, ``I can
understand better why it's so hard for them to explain their
experiences to those who haven't been there. I've been to Normandy,
I've seen those beaches, but this, especially, drove it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Schoenfeld, director of the Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder department at Fort Miley, expects veterans seeing ``Saving
Private Ryan'' to have a hard time over the next few weeks as they
try to separate the present day from 50-year-old memories.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 post traumatic stress disorder cases at
Fort Miley, Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever an explicit film like `Platoon' or `Full Metal
Jacket' comes out, a film with any sense of accuracy to it, vets
will react strongly to the combat scenes,'' Schoenfeld said. ``I'm
expecting the same this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a story about a unit, headed by Capt.
Miller (Tom Hanks), who survives the Normandy D-Day invasion only
to be assigned the task of locating a young private (Matt Damon)
who is the only surviving brother of four. The film begins with a
stirring, brutal take on the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Administration is setting up a hot line to deal
with anticipated response to ``Saving Private Ryan,'' and
Schoenfeld said, ``It will be interesting to see if we get any new
patients because of this _ people coming to us after going to the
film, people who say, `I'm having trouble. I didn't think I was
having any trouble with things like this, but ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of post-traumatic stress disorder usually centers on
Vietnam veterans, Schoenfeld said, but veterans from World War II
and Korea are just as susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any meaningful event can trigger a change,'' he said. ``An
argument with the boss, anything ... the symptoms of stress
disorder are remarkably tenacious. How strong it is depends a lot
on how things are going in one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanas agreed, saying, ``Some event comes up _ retiring, a
medical procedure, flashbacks _ and it starts all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the dozen veterans in the group session Monday
had seen ``Saving Private Ryan,'' they found themselves talking
about it, about the spasms of gore, about the unrelenting scenes at
Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very vivid,'' Kanas said. ``I can't imagine it not
bringing back memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the film, Steven Spielberg, has said he would
consider ``Saving Private Ryan'' successful when ``people walking
past veterans' cemeteries ... spend a second thinking about who's
buried there.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenes that open and close the film _ an aging veteran
breaking down at a U.S. graveyard above Omaha Beach _ was actually
taken from Spielberg's memory of a trip to Normandy in 1972, when
he watched a veteran collapse before rows of graves in a cemetery
on the bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped in his tracks and his body began to shake,''
Spielberg, 51, said. ``He fell to his knees and began to sob. His
entire family surrounded him and began to comfort him.''

MANY FIRMS WELCOME LITTLE, STEADY INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - With a teacher's salary and a chunk of credit card
debt, Heather Baxter doesn't have much money to invest.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28-year-old Mesa, Ariz., woman wanted to begin saving
for retirement. She's afraid the State Retirement Plan won't be
enough to pay for travel and other retirement dreams.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to see a financial planner to discuss her options,
she didn't expect much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really afraid they'd say the minimum was $200 a paycheck
and I'd say, `Well then, I'm out of here,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter was thrilled to learn she could get started for just $15
every other week. For the past year, the money has been deducted
from her paycheck and invested in mutual funds in a tax-sheltered
annuity, an insurance product for retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A bare-bones budget doesn't mean no Wall Street in your diet.
Mutual funds, brokerages, publicly traded companies and others
offer programs ideal for investors on a shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are seeking them out as they get the bug
after watching the stock market's spectacular run the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get in on the bandwagon,'' said Joanne Schwartz,
a certified financial planner and owner of JS Financial Concepts in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz and other planners advocate starting as early as
possible, even if it's on a small scale, to take advantage of
compounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working out _ anything you do is beneficial,'' said
Christopher McCrossan, a senior financial adviser with American
Express Financial Advisors in Mesa, the planner Baxter went to see.
</P>
<P>
   Before you pull out your checkbook, however, there are a few
things to keep in mind. First, it's foolish to commit to regular
monthly investments if you're loaded up on debt and barely have
enough money to pay the bills. (Baxter has about $7,000 in credit
card debt, but is paying it off aggressively and has some savings
so she can afford the $15 investments.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had one or two clients who basically had so much credit
card debt that they couldn't afford $5 a year to invest,'' Schwartz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz turns such clients' attention to budgeting, credit card
consolidation and other moves to get their financial house in
order.
</P>
<P>
   McCrossan said he looks for ways to help clients free up enough
money to invest, such as paying their car insurance twice a year
instead of monthly, which usually comes with a convenience charge.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also like to see people have savings equal to three to
six months' living expenses for emergencies before they start
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they suggest taking full advantage of 401(k) programs
and other employer-sponsored retirement savings plans before
branching out into other investments. The money comes right of your
paycheck and there's usually a company match based on your
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put in as little as 1 percent of your salary,'' said
Chuck Carlson, a do-it-yourself investing expert who edits a
newsletter on buying stocks without a broker. ``That really is the
first place someone with limited money ought to be looking.''
</P>
<P>
   With those caveats, here's a sampling of some of the most
popular low-minimum investing options out there, for investors on
their own or with the help of a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   _Low minimum mutual funds. Many mutual funds let you get started
for as little as $50, provided you agree to invest that much on a
monthly basis. Strong Funds (800-359-3379; www.strong-funds.com),
for example, has an Automatic Investment Plan with a $50 monthly
minimum. The money is deducted from your bank account or, where
available, pay. It covers about 40 funds, from money market funds
to international growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   Strong introduced a program this year for beginning investors.
The centerpiece is the Strong Step 1 Money Fund, a money-market
fund. The minimum is $1,000 but that's waived if you commit to
invest $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building up their savings, investors get
educational materials to help them learn about investing, including
recommendations on how your investments should be divvied among
different categories based on your age, risk tolerance and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum balance in the account is $20,000 to encourage
people to start diversifying into different types of investments.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund families that let you get started for $250 or less
include Invesco (800-525-8085), Neuberger &AMP; Berman (800-877-9700),
Pioneer (800-225-6292) and Franklin Templeton (800-342-5236).
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz likes the American Funds family (800-421-0180, Ext. 23;
www.americanfunds.com), which offers 28 funds through financial
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorites are American's Washington Mutual Investors fund, a
conservative growth-and-income fund, and New Perspective fund, an
international growth fund. They allow a minimum investment of $50,
sometimes $25, if you agree to invest regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer mutual funds to (individual stocks) because you're
spreading your risk in a mutual fund,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. recently began
offering an educational program for new investors in its four
Phoenix area offices. Investors should ask for a copy of Beginning
Investor _ Schwab Solutions. If you decide to open a Schwab
account, the minimum is $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   _Direct stock purchase plans and dividend reinvestment plans. If
there's stock-picking in your blood, you can start investing in
companies without a broker for as little as $50, according to Chuck
Carlson, editor of ``No-Load Stock Insider'' and ``DRIP Investor''
(219-852-3220; www.dripinvestor.com).
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 companies offer direct purchase plans, or no-load
stocks, as Carlson calls them. They include such household names as
Disney, McDonald's and Exxon. Not all have ultra-low minimums,
however. McDonald's requires $1,000 to start.
</P>
<P>
   For those with limited funds, Carlson likes Johnson Controls, a
building controls company (NYSE:JCI; $50 minimum, no fees); Becton,
Dickinson, a health care company (NYSE: BDX; $50 minimum if you
agree to invest regularly; 3 cent per share purchase fee); and oil
giant Exxon ($250 minimum, no fees).
</P>
<P>
   ``For $350 you can get started in three companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends beginning with three or four companies, adding
more after you've accumulated 25 to 50 shares in each company.
</P>
<P>
   _Low-cost investment plans. The National Association of
Investors Corp. (888-780-8400; www.betterinvesting.org), a
non-profit educational group that helps investment clubs and
individual investors, has a new stock service for members that
allows investments of as little as $10 excluding fees. Temper of
the Times Communications, which publishes the ``Moneypaper''
newsletter (914-381-5400; www.moneypaper.com) has a plan called the
Temper Enrollment Service, featuring more than 900 companies. &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO'S UNION SQUARE BECOMES HOT RETAIL AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER and WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An increase in activity among merchants
competing for coveted space in Union Square has made real estate
near this tiny plot of land more expensive than it has been in
decades, elevating San Francisco's retail center into a
sought-after address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Square has got to be the hottest retail shopping center
today,'' said Helen Bulwik, director of global retailing for Arthur
Andersen Consulting in San Francisco. ``The rental rates now are
extremely high, and the only retailers that can really afford to
take that kind of space ... are those comfortable with their
financial future.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of retailers _ including Neiman Marcus, Niketown,
Rockport, the Body Shop, Ultimo and Diesel _ have expanded into
nearby streets, making the area worthy of comparisons to Tokyo's
Ginza district or New York's Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Union Square rents aren't quite what they are in Tokyo or
New York, where rental costs are $500 to $700 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Rents for small shop fronts on Union Square _ measuring 1,000 to
2,000 square feet _ are about $300 per square foot, according to
Jill Paul, a broker with CB Richard Ellis. Spaces of 10,000 to
20,000 square feet on and near Union Square are going for about
$150 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents on the square are the highest in the city on a
per-square-foot basis,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question the high cost of doing business is changing
the face of Union Square, but making space there even more of a
premium and pushing up rents in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are looking at Union Square, but there's just
not a lot of space,'' said Ken Brownell, president of Blatteis
Realty Co. He described the market in the square as the tightest he
has seen in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who specializes in downtown properties, says competition
is great, especially for small spaces because retailers are
clamoring for a presence in Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the square itself _ an elevated park bounded by Geary,
Powell, Post and Stockton streets _ improvements are in the works.
A $15 million face lift is in the works for a park that many say
has gone to seed and has become a hangout for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Union Square proprietors and civic groups contend the renovated
park _ which may end up looking like a low-rise Egyptian pyramid _
will be more attractive and safe.

7,000 MILES NO BARRIER TO CHIEF LEADING TRIBE IN GHANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NALERIGU, GHANA _ Sule Issifu, a prince of the Mamprusi Tribe,
had hoped to return to his West African birthplace and abdicate his
position as chief while his life back in America was on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But as in many royal families, politics intervened.
</P>
<P>
   What had seemed so simple a notion in Higley, a suburb in the
Phoenix area, was causing turmoil 7,000 miles away in this village
of mud and thatched-roof houses where Issifu was born 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   As the eldest son of Mamprusi Chief Issifu Tampuri, Sule Issifu
had inherited the title of chief after his father's death last year
at 89. By this tradition, the younger Issifu was expected to rule
the Mamprusis as his beloved father had for more than half a
century. No one else would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said they wanted me,'' Sule Issifu (EEE-see-foo)
says with a sigh. ``Everybody likes me.`'
</P>
<P>
   Love had become an unfortunate burden. Family members agonized
over his intention to relinquish the title, highest rank in the
tribe except for the paramount chief, known as the Nayiri. Village
elders warned that abdication would send the line of succession to
another family. Outsiders waited to contest the title and buy the
privilege for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pride was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Issifu would have to demonstrate the wisdom and diplomacy his
father had taught him since birth. The next weeks would be a test
of how well he had learned those lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Not until he finally held the red cap and spear that signify
Mamprusi authority would it become clear he had mastered his
lessons. That day was still many months away.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Living in 2 worlds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Ghana 25 years ago for college in Portland, Ore.,
Issifu has been a man living comfortably in two worlds. His
birthright is the heritage of a village with a simple lifestyle and
citizens whose hands and kind faces eagerly welcome strangers of
all colors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mamprusis who inhabited this territory for centuries as
warriors are today a peace-loving tribe. The tender-hearted Issifu
has no wish to abandon his people.
</P>
<P>
   But the land of his birth is farther away now than it was when
he enrolled at Lewis &AMP; Clark College in 1973, farther both
geographically and culturally. Issifu has an American-born wife and
two daughters born and reared in the United States who explore the
world on their home computer and have unlimited opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tradition that called him back to Africa in January,
he could not ask his children to trade the life he and his wife,
Lydia, have made in America for life in a town just now entering
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In Nalerigu, there are no telephones, no running water, no
Internet. There are power poles but no power. Electrical lines
stretch across the village, waiting to be connected. Someday.
</P>
<P>
   Goats, sheep, chickens and pigs run along the dirt roads of the
village in the innocent days before they become the next night's
stew. Barefoot children chase after them, kicking rubber balls and
playing with such unconventional toys as used auto parts, bicycle
handlebars and discarded tuna cans.
</P>
<P>
   Their laughter is musical as they circle a towering kapok tree
outside the Issifu family compound. The majestic old tree serves as
a kind of community center where villagers stretch out on the
protruding roots to share news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real Africa,'' says Alhaji Alhussein Mahama,
Sule's best friend since high school.
</P>
<P>
   The men of Nalerigu farm one season a year, forced to idle their
fields during the dry spring because there is no irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Women keep house, cooking over wood fires outside their homes,
stirring huge pots of rice, mutton, beef, beans, yams and plantains
with wooden spoons as long as their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Water is toted from a reservoir a mile away. Making countless
trips each day, women ferry pots of water for cooking, bathing and
cleaning. They nurture large families while keeping immaculate
homes, constantly sweeping away debris from the dirt floors.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy rules. Men have as many wives as they can afford.
Sule's father had five wives and 22 children. Mothers bear as many
as eight to 10 children. Child rearing demands the lion's share of
their time and sometimes saps their health.
</P>
<P>
   But with time has come progress. A bus depot in town connects
residents of Nalerigu (Nah-LAIR-ee-goo) with neighboring villages
and, ultimately, to the capital city of Accra on the Atlantic
coast. A beauty salon has opened.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, the local watering hole, offers the coldest beers
and soft drinks in town _ slightly cooler than room temperature,
thanks to a generator-powered refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   There are promises that electricity will be connected next
month, though even Accra still suffers frequent blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   As pleasant and uncluttered as life is in Nalerigu, Sule and
Lydia want more for their daughters, Seiba, 11, and Aza, 8. The
girls are honor roll students who view a visit to Ghana like a
camping trip, bathing under buckets of water and trying out the
packed-earth latrine that their father, whom they affectionately
call Baba, has just had built.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia could be content living without amenities. It's the
children's future that concerns her. In Nalerigu, they would attend
school only through junior high. High school would mean boarding
school in Accra, more than a day away by car.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sacrifice neither she nor her husband is willing to make,
no matter how much they are pressed by tribal custom, family pride
and the entreaties of village elders. Seiba and Aza come first. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Being Americanized &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Married for 14 years now, Sule and Lydia met in college and fell
in love over his talent for making peanut butter soup.
</P>
<P>
   They had always known that one day Sule would be expected to
take his father's place among the quarter-million Mamprusis. But
the couple put thoughts of royalty out of mind as they made a home
and started a family.
</P>
<P>
   Sule has become Americanized. Though he finds peace and comfort
in the familiar surroundings of Nalerigu _ ``I feel at home; I feel
safer'' _ Western civilization has transformed him.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his birthplace, his role has changed. When he goes home
now, he no longer walks easily with boyhood friends. In his
presence, they bow or squat and address him as chief. He does not
spend leisurely hours at Christie's. Instead, he holds court while
someone fetches him a cool beer.
</P>
<P>
   His day begins with a bowl of oatmeal, a cup of Nescafe and the
sweet bread baked in town. Villagers with business to conduct begin
arriving early in the morning, squatting and whispering the
traditional greeting, ``Naaa, naaa.'' They clap their hands softly
and avert their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, Sule makes his rounds, meeting with elders and
greeting his people as he walks with an entourage. He might stop at
one of the schools in the village or drop by the police station.
</P>
<P>
   If his uncle, chief of a neighboring village, is visiting
Nalerigu, he will pay his respects. Guabligrana, 78, was a
decorated World War II soldier with the British army. He is adamant
that Sule must be chief.
</P>
<P>
   Family honor is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for this house,'' Guabligrana said, declaring that his
nephew has the attributes to be a good chief, as his father had
before him. ``It is God who makes him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Sule negotiated with his family to resolve the
dilemma of succession. His intention had been to accept the title
of Masu, or chief, then abdicate in favor of his uncle or a younger
brother. But when he arrived late in January to begin executing the
plan, his announcement was met with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Family meetings ended in tears. Only Sule could be chief! His
brothers and sisters begged him not to abdicate, fearing loss of
the title from their clan. Their big brother must comply, even if
it meant ruling from across an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Sule and his wife despaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our plan would work,'' Lydia says. ``We never
thought it would come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid rumors that she was encouraging her husband to abandon his
commitment, Lydia was dispatched to reassure the family that the
decision would be Sule's alone. She was supportive. But his nervous
siblings wanted to hear only one thing: Their brother would be
Masu.
</P>
<P>
   At last, bowing to pressure and bound by duty, Sule conceded,
agreeing to become chief, appoint a subchief and return to his home
in America to conduct a long-distance reign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the coronation could take place. In a ceremony called an
inskinment, Sule, holding the temporary title of Gbangrana, would
don a dried goat skin, taken from an animal slaughtered days
earlier, to receive the spears and red cap that symbolize power.
</P>
<P>
   Coronation day would be celebrated with song and dance. Talking
drums would echo across the village.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution of Sule's predicament would not come so
easily. Even in a small African village, bureaucracy rears its
head. Superstition plays a hand. Day after day, elders delayed
setting a date for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, inskinment can be held only on Saturdays and
Wednesdays, and never at the end of the month. By now, it was
nearly the end of February. The Council of Elders favored waiting
until another moon rose. The ceremony scheduled for Saturday was
postponed until Wednesday. Wednesday dawned, morning wore on. But
no word came that this would be Sule Issifu's coronation day.
</P>
<P>
   The spears had been prepared. the Gbangrana waited to don his
royal raiments. And still the council delayed. The Nayiri, the one
Mamprusi who rules above the Masu, was in failing health and
reluctant to appear weak before his people or to tempt fate by
rushing a ceremony before God willed it.
</P>
<P>
   Haste is an American attribute. Patience is the Mamprusi way.
</P>
<P>
   This was the dry season. The Harmattan, a dusty wind that blows
south from the Sahara, had filled the air over Nalerigu with a
choking sand ground to fine powder. It gave the sky the look of
haze and made waiting under the hot sun with temperatures
approaching 100 even more uncomfortable. It aggravated the
Gbangrana's allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the family compound, the gnarled roots of the kapok tree
cradled the citizens of Nalerigu waiting for word that the
ceremonial drums would soon begin. But late on the last Wednesday
of the month, as sunset streamed through the old tree's leafy
branches, Sule Issifu was still not Masu.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back to Arizona &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Issifus returned to Arizona in March with little resolved in
the matter of Masu vs. the Elders. Though disappointed, Sule
accepted the sensibilities of his people. His temper, which had
flared under the frustration of family politics, had cooled. He
shed his traditional Ghanaian garb, billowing cotton smock and
loose trousers, for his American T-shirts and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   While Sule returned to work in the human resources division of
the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Lydia went back to
running the family dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Sule's thoughts remained 7,000 miles away in Nalerigu.
Despite the turmoil he left behind, he knew that his decision to
return to America was the right one. He and Lydia could do more for
his people here than in a village where his only income would be
from livestock and where he would lack the business contacts that
could help raise Nalerigu's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Through their Mamprusi Development Fund, a tax-deductible,
non-profit organization, they plan to court American business and
industry. Donations will finance the cleanup of the water supply,
expedite the connection of power lines, fund paving of dirt roads
and establish scholarships for promising students who can't afford
to pay for high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we have to bring in some selected
development,'' Sule said, referring to light industry, craft work,
assembly of small products. ``You need capital and someone who can
go there. . . . Americans have always been generous. That helpful
spirit is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although optimistic, he sometimes feels overwhelmed by his
responsibilities. Nalerigu is not connected to Phoenix by phone or
fax. The nearest telephone is a village away.
</P>
<P>
   Saddened by the turmoil he left behind, he recognized that his
frustration was a product of his Americanization.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Western influence is taking over me,'' he said. ``I'm not
patient. That's what I'm losing more and more the longer I'm in the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters was the Nayiri's failing health, which left
the octogenarian bedridden. Eager to be viewed as a strong leader,
he feared alarming his people with hints of mortality. Sule felt
sympathy for the man who holds such an esteemed position among the
Mamprusis.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the elders had postponed the
ceremony to assert their independence against pressure to hold
events on a fast-track Western timetable. They were said to be
disturbed by the invasion of a television film crew, reporters and
friends of the Issifu family from Eugene, Ore., and were
stonewalling in order to conduct their traditions their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Sule dismissed such talk. Although admitting he ``felt rotten
and tired and fed up with the whole thing,'' he also respects the
leaders of his village and said that there was nothing unusual
about the way events proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how they do it,'' he said of the system of installing
a new chief. ``They've had people stay there for months. . . . I
pushed as hard as I could, and then I remembered tradition.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coronation day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In June, the letter came.
</P>
<P>
   The Nayiri's personal message invited Sule to return to Nalerigu
to be installed as Masu. Coronation would take place July 1 or July
4. On June 24, Sule was on a British Airways flight bound for
Accra.
</P>
<P>
   Busy with several projects at DES, he said, ``I had no business
going to Ghana.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Nayiri had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew I had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather in Nalerigu was cool, the savannah green and
beautiful. It was the beginning of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   His health improved, the Nayiri appeared hale and eager to
conduct the ceremony. Sule hoped it would take place July 1, a
Wednesday, but there was too much to be done. Prominent members of
the village had to be personally notified. Saturday would be
coronation day.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m, the talking drums began pounding. At noon, the Nayiri
emerged from his palace, welcoming Sule to the center of the
compound where hundreds of villagers had gathered to bear witness.
Sule's assistant, the Wudana, carried the ceremonial spears.
</P>
<P>
   Sule and his brothers removed mourning caps they had worn since
their father's death and placed them in a basket. The period of
mourning was over.
</P>
<P>
   Once, twice, three times Sule squatted and rose as he donned the
royal smock and cap. The third time provoked an outburst of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sule Issifu was Masu.
</P>
<P>
   Riding back to the family compound, exuberant family members
waved white ribbons tied to their wrists. Villagers dusted
themselves with white powder to demonstrate their happiness.
Talking drums bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sule, too, was excited, but maintained the composure expected of
a Mamprusi chief.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited dancing erupted at the compound, celebrating not only
the coronation of a chief but the Damba Festival, the Mamprusi new
year. For 10 days, there would be dancing from 8 p.m. to midnight.
On the 10th night, it would last till dawn.
</P>
<P>
   When the Masu was persuaded to dance, a hard rain followed, and
the people took it as a good omen. &QL; 
Long-distance rule
</P>
<P>
   Sule is home again, recovering from another bout of the malaria
that plagues him every time he visits Ghana. During the rainy
season, the air is thick with disease-bearing mosquitoes. But he is
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   In Nalerigu, his brother, Tampuri, is ruling as the Masu's
representative. Tampuri will telephone Sule once a week, trading
news for advice.
</P>
<P>
   If Sule's family ever doubted he would remain loyal and a vital
part of their lives, their fears were unfounded. He is a man who
lives in two worlds and loves both. His dedication is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after his father's death, Sule Issifu has
fulfilled his obligation to the citizens of Nalerigu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me as Masu and no one else, and that's how it
turned out'' he says. ``It worked out well.'' &QL;

7,000 MILES NO BARRIER TO CHIEF LEADING TRIBE IN GHANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NALERIGU, GHANA _ Sule Issifu, a prince of the Mamprusi Tribe,
had hoped to return to his West African birthplace and abdicate his
position as chief while his life back in America was on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But as in many royal families, politics intervened.
</P>
<P>
   What had seemed so simple a notion in Higley, a suburb in the
Phoenix area, was causing turmoil 7,000 miles away in this village
of mud and thatched-roof houses where Issifu was born 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   As the eldest son of Mamprusi Chief Issifu Tampuri, Sule Issifu
had inherited the title of chief after his father's death last year
at 89. By this tradition, the younger Issifu was expected to rule
the Mamprusis as his beloved father had for more than half a
century. No one else would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said they wanted me,'' Sule Issifu (EEE-see-foo)
says with a sigh. ``Everybody likes me.`'
</P>
<P>
   Love had become an unfortunate burden. Family members agonized
over his intention to relinquish the title, highest rank in the
tribe except for the paramount chief, known as the Nayiri. Village
elders warned that abdication would send the line of succession to
another family. Outsiders waited to contest the title and buy the
privilege for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pride was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Issifu would have to demonstrate the wisdom and diplomacy his
father had taught him since birth. The next weeks would be a test
of how well he had learned those lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Not until he finally held the red cap and spear that signify
Mamprusi authority would it become clear he had mastered his
lessons. That day was still many months away.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Living in 2 worlds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Ghana 25 years ago for college in Portland, Ore.,
Issifu has been a man living comfortably in two worlds. His
birthright is the heritage of a village with a simple lifestyle and
citizens whose hands and kind faces eagerly welcome strangers of
all colors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mamprusis who inhabited this territory for centuries as
warriors are today a peace-loving tribe. The tender-hearted Issifu
has no wish to abandon his people.
</P>
<P>
   But the land of his birth is farther away now than it was when
he enrolled at Lewis &AMP; Clark College in 1973, farther both
geographically and culturally. Issifu has an American-born wife and
two daughters born and reared in the United States who explore the
world on their home computer and have unlimited opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tradition that called him back to Africa in January,
he could not ask his children to trade the life he and his wife,
Lydia, have made in America for life in a town just now entering
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In Nalerigu, there are no telephones, no running water, no
Internet. There are power poles but no power. Electrical lines
stretch across the village, waiting to be connected. Someday.
</P>
<P>
   Goats, sheep, chickens and pigs run along the dirt roads of the
village in the innocent days before they become the next night's
stew. Barefoot children chase after them, kicking rubber balls and
playing with such unconventional toys as used auto parts, bicycle
handlebars and discarded tuna cans.
</P>
<P>
   Their laughter is musical as they circle a towering kapok tree
outside the Issifu family compound. The majestic old tree serves as
a kind of community center where villagers stretch out on the
protruding roots to share news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real Africa,'' says Alhaji Alhussein Mahama,
Sule's best friend since high school.
</P>
<P>
   The men of Nalerigu farm one season a year, forced to idle their
fields during the dry spring because there is no irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Women keep house, cooking over wood fires outside their homes,
stirring huge pots of rice, mutton, beef, beans, yams and plantains
with wooden spoons as long as their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Water is toted from a reservoir a mile away. Making countless
trips each day, women ferry pots of water for cooking, bathing and
cleaning. They nurture large families while keeping immaculate
homes, constantly sweeping away debris from the dirt floors.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy rules. Men have as many wives as they can afford.
Sule's father had five wives and 22 children. Mothers bear as many
as eight to 10 children. Child rearing demands the lion's share of
their time and sometimes saps their health.
</P>
<P>
   But with time has come progress. A bus depot in town connects
residents of Nalerigu (Nah-LAIR-ee-goo) with neighboring villages
and, ultimately, to the capital city of Accra on the Atlantic
coast. A beauty salon has opened.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, the local watering hole, offers the coldest beers
and soft drinks in town _ slightly cooler than room temperature,
thanks to a generator-powered refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   There are promises that electricity will be connected next
month, though even Accra still suffers frequent blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   As pleasant and uncluttered as life is in Nalerigu, Sule and
Lydia want more for their daughters, Seiba, 11, and Aza, 8. The
girls are honor roll students who view a visit to Ghana like a
camping trip, bathing under buckets of water and trying out the
packed-earth latrine that their father, whom they affectionately
call Baba, has just had built.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia could be content living without amenities. It's the
children's future that concerns her. In Nalerigu, they would attend
school only through junior high. High school would mean boarding
school in Accra, more than a day away by car.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sacrifice neither she nor her husband is willing to make,
no matter how much they are pressed by tribal custom, family pride
and the entreaties of village elders. Seiba and Aza come first. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Being Americanized &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Married for 14 years now, Sule and Lydia met in college and fell
in love over his talent for making peanut butter soup.
</P>
<P>
   They had always known that one day Sule would be expected to
take his father's place among the quarter-million Mamprusis. But
the couple put thoughts of royalty out of mind as they made a home
and started a family.
</P>
<P>
   Sule has become Americanized. Though he finds peace and comfort
in the familiar surroundings of Nalerigu _ ``I feel at home; I feel
safer'' _ Western civilization has transformed him.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his birthplace, his role has changed. When he goes home
now, he no longer walks easily with boyhood friends. In his
presence, they bow or squat and address him as chief. He does not
spend leisurely hours at Christie's. Instead, he holds court while
someone fetches him a cool beer.
</P>
<P>
   His day begins with a bowl of oatmeal, a cup of Nescafe and the
sweet bread baked in town. Villagers with business to conduct begin
arriving early in the morning, squatting and whispering the
traditional greeting, ``Naaa, naaa.'' They clap their hands softly
and avert their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, Sule makes his rounds, meeting with elders and
greeting his people as he walks with an entourage. He might stop at
one of the schools in the village or drop by the police station.
</P>
<P>
   If his uncle, chief of a neighboring village, is visiting
Nalerigu, he will pay his respects. Guabligrana, 78, was a
decorated World War II soldier with the British army. He is adamant
that Sule must be chief.
</P>
<P>
   Family honor is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for this house,'' Guabligrana said, declaring that his
nephew has the attributes to be a good chief, as his father had
before him. ``It is God who makes him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Sule negotiated with his family to resolve the
dilemma of succession. His intention had been to accept the title
of Masu, or chief, then abdicate in favor of his uncle or a younger
brother. But when he arrived late in January to begin executing the
plan, his announcement was met with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Family meetings ended in tears. Only Sule could be chief! His
brothers and sisters begged him not to abdicate, fearing loss of
the title from their clan. Their big brother must comply, even if
it meant ruling from across an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Sule and his wife despaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our plan would work,'' Lydia says. ``We never
thought it would come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid rumors that she was encouraging her husband to abandon his
commitment, Lydia was dispatched to reassure the family that the
decision would be Sule's alone. She was supportive. But his nervous
siblings wanted to hear only one thing: Their brother would be
Masu.
</P>
<P>
   At last, bowing to pressure and bound by duty, Sule conceded,
agreeing to become chief, appoint a subchief and return to his home
in America to conduct a long-distance reign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the coronation could take place. In a ceremony called an
inskinment, Sule, holding the temporary title of Gbangrana, would
don a dried goat skin, taken from an animal slaughtered days
earlier, to receive the spears and red cap that symbolize power.
</P>
<P>
   Coronation day would be celebrated with song and dance. Talking
drums would echo across the village.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution of Sule's predicament would not come so
easily. Even in a small African village, bureaucracy rears its
head. Superstition plays a hand. Day after day, elders delayed
setting a date for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, inskinment can be held only on Saturdays and
Wednesdays, and never at the end of the month. By now, it was
nearly the end of February. The Council of Elders favored waiting
until another moon rose. The ceremony scheduled for Saturday was
postponed until Wednesday. Wednesday dawned, morning wore on. But
no word came that this would be Sule Issifu's coronation day.
</P>
<P>
   The spears had been prepared. the Gbangrana waited to don his
royal raiments. And still the council delayed. The Nayiri, the one
Mamprusi who rules above the Masu, was in failing health and
reluctant to appear weak before his people or to tempt fate by
rushing a ceremony before God willed it.
</P>
<P>
   Haste is an American attribute. Patience is the Mamprusi way.
</P>
<P>
   This was the dry season. The Harmattan, a dusty wind that blows
south from the Sahara, had filled the air over Nalerigu with a
choking sand ground to fine powder. It gave the sky the look of
haze and made waiting under the hot sun with temperatures
approaching 100 even more uncomfortable. It aggravated the
Gbangrana's allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the family compound, the gnarled roots of the kapok tree
cradled the citizens of Nalerigu waiting for word that the
ceremonial drums would soon begin. But late on the last Wednesday
of the month, as sunset streamed through the old tree's leafy
branches, Sule Issifu was still not Masu.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back to Arizona &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Issifus returned to Arizona in March with little resolved in
the matter of Masu vs. the Elders. Though disappointed, Sule
accepted the sensibilities of his people. His temper, which had
flared under the frustration of family politics, had cooled. He
shed his traditional Ghanaian garb, billowing cotton smock and
loose trousers, for his American T-shirts and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   While Sule returned to work in the human resources division of
the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Lydia went back to
running the family dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Sule's thoughts remained 7,000 miles away in Nalerigu.
Despite the turmoil he left behind, he knew that his decision to
return to America was the right one. He and Lydia could do more for
his people here than in a village where his only income would be

non-profit organization, they plan to court American business and

expedite the connection of power lines, fund paving of dirt roads
and establish scholarships for promising students who can't afford
to pay for high school.

assembly of small products. ``You need capital and someone who can
go there. . . . Americans have always been generous. That helpful
spirit is still there.''

CHIEF'S WIFE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING LIVES OF GHANAIAN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GHANA, WEST AFRICA _ In the village of Nalerigu, women's work is
never done.
</P>
<P>
   Like most American wives and mothers, these women cook, clean
and rear a brood of children. But they do it without microwave
ovens, vacuum cleaners or day care.
</P>
<P>
   In a community where electricity and running water are only
promises, women's work means fetching drinking and bathing water
from a reservoir a mile away and cooking in huge pots outside their
front doors.
</P>
<P>
   Families are large. Abortion is illegal in Ghana, and
contraception is something that often must be practiced in secret.
For men, children bring status. A wife might slip off to the
missionary hospital outside town for a clandestine injection of
Depo-Provera, a Norplant patch or a supply of birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a local midwife says, ``Women work harder than men
and live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the women whose lives American-born Lydia Issifu hopes
to change over the next several years as her husband, Sule, rules
as chief of the Mamprusi Tribe, whose capital is Nalerigu. Sule,
reared in Nalerigu and educated in the United States, inherited the
title when his father died last year.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the family traveled back to host the final memorial
service for the old chief and to prepare for the succession of a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   Believing they can do more to help the citizens of Nalerigu from
America, the couple will preside over the Mamprusis from their home
in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia will go to work in behalf of the women. Her priority is
education, the springboard to other opportunities. She said she
believes school is as important for girls as it is for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you educate a man, you educate a man,'' she quotes an old
saying. ``When you educate a woman, you educate a village.''
</P>
<P>
   School is free through junior high. Those children who wish to
continue must pay tuition at the local secondary school or attend
boarding school in towns as far away as Ghana's capital of Accra.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fierce determination to make progress. More and
more high school graduates are attending teacher-training schools,
then returning to the village to share their knowledge. Some
students go on to college either in Ghana or America, daring to
dream of opportunities across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While Sule works in human resources for Arizona, Lydia and her
brother run the family dairy farm at Higley, east of Phoenix. Hers
is a life Nalerigu women might envy, with her career, modern home
and husband all to herself. She does not condemn the practice of
polygamy but believes it is one more obstacle to equality.
</P>
<P>
   Each succeeding wife falls lower and lower in status. Sometimes,
wives squabble. It is the senior wife's duty to help select
subsequent ones; it is the husband's duty to keep them happy.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia and Sule say they will not try to change tradition but
will be role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just live by example,'' Sule says. ``I haven't married
more than one wife.''
</P>
<P>
   His one wife laughs and says that she will make sure things stay
that way.
</P>
<P>
   But women in Nalerigu face other problems. The only water source
is the reservoir formed by the Brimi River. With perfect posture
and an exquisite sense of balance practiced since childhood, women
transport huge earthenware jugs of water on their heads back to
common storage tanks in the village, making several trips a day.
</P>
<P>
   The water is used for cooking, drinking, bathing and washing
clothes and dishes. Adults tolerate it, but water-borne bacteria
often make children sick. A water purification program is on Sule's
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   Women have benefited from the services offered at a hospital
operated by American Baptist missionaries. Classes in nutrition and
prenatal care are available.
</P>
<P>
   While many mothers give birth with the aid of missionary doctors
and midwives, most deliver at home, assisted by traditional birth
attendants. Only an emergency, such as prolonged labor, would bring
them to the hospital
</P>
<P>
   If the woman is able to walk, she would make the 30-minute trip
on foot or by bicycle. If not, her husband would pedal to the
hospital and summon an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Though most children in Nalerigu appear healthy and happy, some
suffer the plagues of malnutrition, malaria, measles, whooping
cough and tetanus.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of all children die in their first year, says
Martha Nabila, a midwife at the missionary hospital. Of 10 children
a woman might bear, only five or six will survive childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Most girls marry by age 18, some as young as 15, through
arranged marriages brokered between families.
</P>
<P>
   A girl might become the third or fourth wife to a much older man
or be given as a gift, sent to live with the prospective groom's
mother until she is old enough to be a wife. Only a strong-willed
young woman defies her family's choice of a husband. In shunning
marriage, she risks ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   Nabila says that she believes polygamy was once a satisfactory
practice, but that now, men are less able to support several wives,
and everyone suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing many children is a status symbol for women as well as
men, Lydia &UR; says. A woman who appears infertile is the subject of
gossip. And a woman who is not a wife and mother has few
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is hard for the women,'' says Nabila, whose own husband
abandoned her with four children. ``They work too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving education, Lydia &UR; also wants to promote
entrepreneurship, something some women already practice.
</P>
<P>
   There are market women, for example, who travel as far as Accra
to purchase wholesale commodities such as housewares, then sell
them in Nalerigu and surrounding villages. Profits are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a living,'' Lydia says. ``It's subsistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the wife of a chief has no official duties, Lydia is
committed to improving women's lot in Nalerigu.
</P>
<P>
   But without such basics as electricity and clean water, progress
is uncertain. Change will not come immediately; tradition is
entrenched. But Lydia looks ahead 10 or 20 years and is filled with
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that life is going to be easier,'' she says. ``There
will be pipe-borne water coming into the households. There will be
electricity. . . . Over the next 20 years, women will have more
time and more ways to improve their income. They will send all
their kids to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I would like to see.'' &QL;

   GHANA, WEST AFRICA _ In the village of Nalerigu, women's work is
never done.
</P>
<P>
   Like most American wives and mothers, these women cook, clean
and rear a brood of children. But they do it without microwave
ovens, vacuum cleaners or day care.
</P>
<P>
   In a community where electricity and running water are only
promises, women's work means fetching drinking and bathing water
from a reservoir a mile away and cooking in huge pots outside their
front doors.
</P>
<P>
   Families are large. Abortion is illegal in Ghana, and
contraception is something that often must be practiced in secret.
For men, children bring status. A wife might slip off to the
missionary hospital outside town for a clandestine injection of
Depo-Provera, a Norplant patch or a supply of birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a local midwife says, ``Women work harder than men
and live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the women whose lives American-born Lydia Issifu hopes
to change over the next several years as her husband, Sule, rules
as chief of the Mamprusi Tribe, whose capital is Nalerigu. Sule,
reared in Nalerigu and educated in the United States, inherited the
title when his father died last year.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the family traveled back to host the final memorial
service for the old chief and to prepare for the succession of a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   Believing they can do more to help the citizens of Nalerigu from
America, the couple will preside over the Mamprusis from their home
in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia will go to work in behalf of the women. Her priority is
education, the springboard to other opportunities. She said she
believes school is as important for girls as it is for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you educate a man, you educate a man,'' she quotes an old
saying. ``When you educate a woman, you educate a village.''
</P>
<P>
   School is free through junior high. Those children who wish to
continue must pay tuition at the local secondary school or attend
boarding school in towns as far away as Ghana's capital of Accra.

   _  &UR; NOTE: As the first anniversary of the death of Princess Diana
approaches, a theologian asks whether she is in heaven or hell.  &LR; 
__
</P>
<P>
   The popular beatification of Princess Diana forces an indiscreet
theological question: Where is she now?
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian scheme of things, God judged the most popular
woman on earth after her death and sent her soul to heaven,
purgatory or hell.
</P>
<P>
   If heaven was her fate, God smiles on her posthumous veneration.
Purgatory is where the saved burn off their impurities, so at least
a ticket to heaven is guaranteed (and prayers might even speed her
deliverance).
</P>
<P>
   Hell, however, cannot be ruled out. If Diana died with ``grave
sins'' on her soul _ a not unlikely circumstance _ she is probably
now in hell, beyond hope and prayer, and thus unworthy of the
slightest reverence, let alone a funeral service at Westminster
Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the three possibilities in more detail. The 1994
Catechism of the Catholic Church, the most comprehensive modern
compendium of Christian doctrine (bearing the imprimatur of John
Paul II), is unequivocal. Although the Church of England differs
sharply from the pope on female ordination, married priests and
divorce, its beliefs about matters relating to Diana's salvation
(namely, adultery and fornication) are essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for heaven is, I am afraid, weak. Church tradition
reserves instant entry for saints, martyrs and baptized babies who
die before reaching the age of reason. Nobody else qualifies.
Diana's good works may have been very good, but her trespasses,
large and small, surely barred St Peter's gate, at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves purgatory or hell, depending on the state of her
soul at the moment of death. As the Catechism says, ``To die in
mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love
means remaining separated from him forever.'' In other words, hell.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana's soul was in dire peril of damnation on the
evening of Aug. 30, assuming that she and Emad ``Dodi'' Al Fayed
had committed unrepented fornication (``carnal union between an
unmarried man and an unmarried woman'') during their romantic
holiday in France. Let us remember that all sex acts outside
marriage, and not a few within, are hell-bent offenses in the
Catechism. Masturbation, homosexual relations and watching the
Playboy television channel rank, in scale of punishment, with
running drug cartels and exterminating aboriginal populations.
Adultery and fornication remain as satanic today as they were in
King Solomon's time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Diana had begged God's forgiveness after
the car crash, and if she expired in his grace, she would have been
cast into the ``cleansing fires'' of purgatory, there to expiate
her sins before ascending to heaven. Diana's last thoughts are
unknown, but if they did not include sincere sorrow for lying with
Dodi, even purgatory is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, hell looms as the most plausible spot for the
princess's soul. Christian dogma, immutable and infallible,
requires sinners in her presumed spiritual condition _ stained by
mortal sin _ to be condemned. ``Depart from me, you cursed, into
eternal fire,'' said Christ of the doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the pope overlooked the damaging evidence
against Diana and gave a positive signal as to her redemption.
``The Holy Father has offered prayers summoning her to our Heavenly
Father's eternal love,'' he wrote in the third person to Queen
Elizabeth on Sept. 1. His remark implied purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father, is surely permitted to exclaim
in grief: ``God took their souls to live together in paradise.''
But how do we explain the pope's apparent blessing of the world's
most famous offender against the sixth commandment?
</P>
<P>
   A devil's advocate might detect hypocrisy in the papal posture.
People who meet their Maker en route to an illicit and scandalous
rendezvous do not generally receive benedictions from Vatican City.
The exception of the princess of Wales suggests that the church's
official position on sex crimes and punishment cannot withstand
rational scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Diana in hell seems cruel and repellent in human
terms, although it comfortably suits the divine. ``The gate is
narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few,'' declared Christ on the depressing odds against
anybody's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Roman/Anglican theology, which demonizes deviations of the
flesh, leaves little room for optimism in Diana's case. But that
tells us more about the chilling core of Christianity than about
the ultimate worth of a young, kind, sometimes foolish beauty who
had the misfortune to marry a prince and perish with a playboy.

   _  &UR; NOTE: As the first anniversary of the death of Princess Diana
approaches, a theologian asks whether she is in heaven or hell.  &LR; 
__
</P>
<P>
   The popular beatification of Princess Diana forces an indiscreet
theological question: Where is she now?
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian scheme of things, God judged the most popular
woman on earth after her death and sent her soul to heaven,
purgatory or hell.

Purgatory is where the saved burn off their impurities, so at least

<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ This is what eating out in the monochromatic,
monolithic Communist state of East Germany and its capital, East
Berlin, used to be like:
</P>
<P>
   In Dresden, once such a picture of Baroque magnificence that art
historians unblushingly compared it to Venice and Florence, the
best meal in town was a watery, lackluster Hungarian goulash in a
dreary, Lubyanka-like restaurant. To cheer things up, a quartet of
Volkspolizei, or people's police, often stood along the walls,
fingering their Uzis, lower lips protruding in loathing for the
almost entirely foreign clientele.
</P>
<P>
   In East Berlin, which I visited several times in the 1970s and
1980s, a search for a gastronomically satisfying lunch was a search
for the imbiss, or snack bar, that sold the most distinguished
currywurst _ a grilled or fried sausage, sprinkled with curry
powder and slathered with paprika-spiked ketchup. For dinner, I
took the elevated train back to the bright lights, starched
tablecloths and sweet-and-sour bistros of West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And this is how things have changed on the restaurant scene,
every bit as quickly as they have changed on the political and
economic fronts:
</P>
<P>
   In Dresden, which is rapidly repairing the physical damage from
the hideous allied fire-bombing of 1945, if not the psychological
damage of the dismal decades that followed, the dining room of the
Buelow Residenz, a small hotel in a stunning canary-and-white
Baroque mansion, has won a richly deserved Michelin star for
cooking that would pass muster in Paris. The gun-toting cops are
long gone, replaced by shining crystal and fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Berlin, one is spoiled for choice; indeed, many
knowing visitors turn their backs on the fading glamour of the
Kurfuerstendamm in the western part of town to stay and eat in
Mitte, the heart of the east. There, too, is a Michelin-starred
restaurant, called Vau, a handsome room with a modern barrel-vault
ceiling, sharp service, and fresh, light German cooking.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, my wife, Betsey, and I were in Berlin when the wall
came tumbling down in 1989, and this summer we made our second
extensive trip to the reborn East. Polluting smokestacks have been
capped, shrubbery and window boxes decorate once-barren houses,
potholes have been filled with a zeal that would thrill Alphonse
D'Amato, and if satisfying, occasionally brilliant meals are not
quite as omnipresent as scaffolds, cranes and backhoes, they are
widely available if you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chefs in eastern Germany's new restaurants came from
the West, lured by economic opportunity; others, having traveled
through western Europe since the wall came down, have emulated what
they saw and tasted there.
</P>
<P>
   A passion for seasonal specialties is one of the joys of eating
in Germany, and especially eastern Germany, where the grip of
tradition is far more tenacious than in the West. Only in northern
Italy, where everyone who can afford it gorges in season on white
truffles and floppy porcini mushrooms, is there a comparable
obsession with fleeting culinary pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   People overdose on goose on St. Martin's feast day, Nov. 11,
when the birds are at their fattest; on Germany's remarkably sweet
cherries in early summer; and on pfifferlinge, the pumpkin-colored
mushrooms that the French call chanterelles, a little later. But
this is nothing compared to the frenzied consumption of white
asparagus (spargel in German), whose season is limited by law to
the period from late April to June 24, to give the beds ample time
to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans heap the earth around the spears of asparagus and
cut it in the pre-dawn hours, to protect it from the light that
would turn it green. All of which I thought a lot of nonsense until
we stumbled upon a little restaurant called Vogelherd outside a
village named Zerbst _ not far, incidentally, from the newly
restored Bauhaus architecture and design school in Dessau.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Vogelherd, kitschy in the manner of rural
Germany, owes nothing to the Bauhaus. But though we were late for
lunch, we were warmly greeted and offered a four-page menu of
asparagus specialties. In its way, we soon learned, this was a
sophisticated place, certainly from the drinker's point of view,
with elegant Rheingau rieslings from Robert Weil, grappas from Levi
and eaux-de-vies from Miclo. It was a bit like coming across Ridge
zinfandels on the Dakota plains.
</P>
<P>
   The asparagus, cut in the surrounding fields about six hours
before we ate them, were a revelation. Clearly, freshness is the
key to this game. Betsey ate them with brown butter; I chose
hollandaise sauce. Herby, sweet, just firm enough, the plump white
spears easily outdistanced in complexity and subtlety of flavor the
green asparagus I cut as a kid from my Aunt Peg's prized bed and
ate with melted butter. I can offer no more heartfelt praise.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey? She ate asparagus so often in the next week that I
started calling her Spargel Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   We had several good meals in Dresden, none of them Hungarian,
including a superb after-opera supper at the Taschenbergpalais, a
rebuilt schloss in the center of town, whose cuisine Michelin
underrates. But the highlight was the Buelow Residenz, the domain
of Ralf J. Kutzner, a chef trained in western Germany, Hong Kong
and Britain, who decided five years ago to cast his lot with
Dresden when trees still grew in ruined buildings near the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrived with no staff, no suppliers, no menu, no wine list
and a month to go until opening,'' Kutzner said. ``When we drove
into town, at night, having just left London, my wife looked around
and asked me, `Are you sure?' My old colleagues weren't interested
in coming, so I had to train people. Now, they call from all over,
looking for jobs in reception or the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Residenz is a residenz by chance. The Buelow family,
builders and real estate operators in Stuttgart, bought it for an
office in eastern Germany, but the city wanted to restore the
prewar residential character of the neighborhood, across the Elbe
River from the Opera House. Presto, change-o, the office building
became a hotel with a restaurant called Carrousel.
</P>
<P>
   A truck arrives from the Rungis market, just outside Paris,
twice a week, but just as he has trained staff members, Kutzner has
guided and encouraged local growers of vegetables and herbs. He
buys venison from Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, and
hopes to add other regional suppliers soon.
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect. On one of two nights we ate there, the staff
was overwhelmed by large parties, the service dragged, and my
wife's gimlet eye detected a tiny chip in one glass and a faded
bloom in one bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Carrousel delivered the goods 95 percent of the time.
The English menu is in English, not some Graustarkian mutation, and
the staff, in a region where Russian is still the dominant foreign
language, handles French and English with aplomb. Yellow-lacquered
walls, Dresden china chandeliers in pink, white and green, an old
porcelain stove in a corner, service plates with wide green borders
_ the look of the place is a welcome in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Hermann, all of 29, runs the kitchen now, with Kutzner
occasionally looking over his shoulder. A protege of Harald
Wohlfart, the chef of the Schwarzwaldstube in the Black Forest,
which many consider the best restaurant in Germany, he sent out a
stream of delicious dishes. Almost all showed a rare gift for
combining delicate textures with robust flavors.
</P>
<P>
   There were soups like an emerald-green puree of watercress,
peppery yet soothing, with a quail egg and bits of roasted salmon
adding accents, and a clear gelee full of tomato flavor, neither
rubbery nor watery, with chunks of fresh tomato. That was Betsey's
favorite dish of the trip, not just the meal. The kidneys and
sweetbreads were crisp and untouched by the lingering flavor of
uric acid that so often mars this dish. I would also cast a vote
for a perfectly timed slab of roast turbot, a veritable steak from
the sea. And then there was Jell-O gone to heaven: a pyramid-shaped
gelatin dessert with peak-of-the-season cherries trapped inside,
the gelatin itself flavored with rum, port, cassis and red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, understandably, since eastern Berlin is only a cab ride
from western Berlin, change in the old Prussian capital, soon to be
the seat of the national government again, has been more rapid than
elsewhere in eastern Germany. The star is Vau, just off the
magnificent square called the Gendarmenmarkt, which is dominated by
Schinkel's Schauspielhaus, one of the world's half-dozen greatest
neo-classic buildings, now a concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Vau strikes a different note. Long, narrow, with bare wood
floors, banquettes and rows of Breuer chairs, it looks more formal
than it is. Not surprisingly, both the cooking and wine list show
Austrian influences; this is a new venture of Josef Viehhauser, the
Austrian chef and owner of the high-profile Le Canard in Hamburg.
We ate very well. A veal steak with bits of grilled asparagus and
seraphic homemade noodles took the prize, but only just. The
cheeses were in perfect condition, and a glass of Banyuls, a
fragrant red wine from the French-Spanish border country, which had
the richness of dried fruit, proved a perfect partner for rye bread
and Bleu de Bresse.
</P>
<P>
   People had said Vau was hot, hot, hot, and we went expecting to
find a roomful of rich, rich, rich people. Not at all. The crowd
was old and young, local and foreign, dressy and casual. The room
hummed contentedly. It was fun.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Maxwell, which occupies the courtyard and
ground floor of a restored brewery, has a similar quality, both
warmhearted and with-it. The restaurant's eclectic menu is executed
with panache.
</P>
<P>
   A first course of rare tuna with soy, coriander and sesame was
enlivened by crisp, bright-flavored vegetables, and a more Germanic
dish, boar with cabbage, wild mushrooms and sliced, pan-fried
dumplings, showed how modern technique can salvage onetime
favorites that overburden fragile modern digestive systems. The
meat, sliced thin, was chewy but full of rich, gamy flavor: pork
tenderloin with attitude, and no murky sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clients at most of these places are visitors from
western Germany, westerners who have moved east and foreign
tourists. The prices are too steep for all but a few easterners.
Dinner for two with wine at Vau, whose prices are typical of the
best restaurants, costs $150 and up.
</P>
<P>
   My choice for a less expensive supper after the opera (or
anything else) would be Borchardt, a classic brasserie on the model
of Coupole in Paris or Balthazar in New York, though calmer than
the latter. The floor is tiled, the banquettes are raspberry-red
and the room is broken up by fat Corinthian columns.
</P>
<P>
   Delicious, unfussy food _ steaks, chops, Irish oysters and
premium quality seasonal specialties, from quail to strawberries _
is served with aristocratic wines at working folks' prices, such as
Ornellaia red from the Tuscan coast and Schloss Vollrads rieslings
from the Rheingau.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Gendarmenmarkt from Vau is a reincarnation of Lutter
&AMP; Wegner, which began life in a wine cellar in the East, moved to
the West after World War II and recently opened this branch, on the
site of the house of E.T.A. Hoffmann, the 19th-century artist,
writer and wastrel. Not without reason, the menu describes the
wiener schnitzel as ``our classic.'' You will find no better in
Vienna, and everyone sitting around us seemed to be eating it. The
frothy beet soup is good, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more tables to sample. You will find understated
Italian food at Cantamaggio, near the Volksbuehne theater;
Southeast Asian fare at Mao Thai near bustling Kaethe Kollwitz
Platz; innovative Middle Eastern dishes at Cafe Oren, right next to
the restored New Synagogue; and, I am told, good German cooking at
Kaiserstuben, opposite the Pergamon Museum, a 30-seater opened only
three months ago by a young partnership that makes a specialty of
brunch on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still more, no doubt, are on the way.

NEED TO ADD AREA CODES MAKES DIALING MORE COMPLEX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Baltimore resident Joseph Kaelin wants to call
up his next-door neighbor, he must dial 10 digits _ the area code
plus the telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   If he mistakenly dials a ``1'' before the area code, his call
still will go through, and no long-distance charges will be
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Now if Kaelin travels to Los Angeles next year, he'll need to
dial 11 digits (``1'' plus the area code and the number) if he's
staying along the coast, but only seven digits if he's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   And if he stops in Houston, he'll be back to punching 10 digits.
But if he tries to dial a ``1,'' he'll get a recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the traveler, it makes it absolutely insane,'' said
Kaelin, a Baltimore real estate agent who criticized Maryland's
overlay plan when it was being reviewed by regulators. ``The
frequent fliers of this country, what do they do?''
</P>
<P>
   This hodgepodge of local calling procedures _ more varied and
confusing than anything seen in this country in decades _ reflects
state regulators' attempts to cope with an explosion in demand for
telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are trying to accommodate an increasing need for
telephone numbers brought on by the burgeoning popularity of
technologies such as cellular telephones and pagers, while at the
same time setting aside millions of number combinations in the hope
of fostering local phone competition.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that area codes such as 713 and even the newer 281
in Houston are rapidly running out of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 16, Houston callers will be required to dial the
area code and telephone number when making all local calls.
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries between 713 and 281, drawn just two years ago,
will disappear. And a third, as-yet-to-be-assigned area code will
be laid over the entire Houston metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas callers will begin 10-digit dialing Dec. 5, when the
dividing line between 214 and 972 is erased. Dallas will then get a
new, ``overlay'' area code next July.
</P>
<P>
   Houston first flirted with the notion of an ``overlay'' area
code three years ago, but regulators backed off in favor of the
temporary 281 geographic split when residents began to howl.
</P>
<P>
   Other communities pushed ahead and have become the nation's
telephone overlay guinea pigs. While their transitions to this new
way of dialing have gone relatively smoothly, they have experienced
some minor, albeit embarrassing, glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, for instance, adopted a new 678 overlay area code last
January. Some pay telephone owners, however, failed to reprogram
their phones. When customers tried to make local calls within the
new area code, they found themselves getting charged $3 a pop
because the phones treated these as long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Miami began requiring 10-digit dialing earlier this month, only
to have the burglar alarm companies begin to wail. Many of their
alarm systems couldn't dial numbers longer than seven digits, and
they had to beg for a 90-day reprieve. Georgia regulators gave
Atlanta security companies a six-month break, and then had to grant
them an additional six months.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Georgia Public Service Commission, which for months
preached to businesses and consumers about the need to prepare for
10-digit dialing, forgot to reprogram one of its own phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission sent the states down this
road three years ago, when it began rejecting proposals to allow
states to assign new area codes only to ``wireless'' technologies
such as cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC _ pointing to the Communications Act of 1934 _ has
concluded such programs ``discriminate'' against the wireless
technologies, since they alone would have to bear the stigma of an
unfamiliar area code and the expense of reprogramming for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Public Utility Commission favored such a plan to
relieve the number crunches in Houston and Dallas, but the FCC
denied its request. Only New York's technology-specific plan, which
was implemented in 1992, was grandfathered in.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has asked the FCC to reconsider that ruling, and
Texas has joined in that request. But federal regulators have given
no indications of a change in direction.
</P>
<P>
   Critics ridicule the logic of the FCC decision. ``How can you
discriminate against a cell phone?'' Baltimore's Kaelin asked.
</P>
<P>
   But overlay plan supporters argue that technology-specific plans
merely delay the inevitable. New York, for instance, already has
plans for two new overlay plans because its ``wireless'' program
cannot keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   These newer technologies, however, account for only part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, trying to offer consumers competition in their local
phone market, have been assigning millions of numbers _ in blocks
of 10,000 per prefix _ to companies hoping to offer local service.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this competition, however, still is theoretical. Ten
companies have been assigned telephone numbers in the Houston area,
but even regulators aren't sure how many of them actually are
providing service.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have implemented number-conservation programs _
divvying out numbers in batches of 1,000 rather than 10,000 _ but
those efforts have often been too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for destroying residents' sense of a geographical
identity, overlay plans remain unpopular in many parts of the
country. Illinois is still hoping to avoid an overlay plan for
Chicago's northern suburbs scheduled to go into effect later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   California split itself into 25 different geographic area codes
before agreeing to create an overlay plan in the coastal portion of
Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Worried that ``11-digit dialing'' may be too grating for
Southern Californian ears, GTE California has come up with its own
description. ``We're calling it 1 plus 10,'' company spokeswoman
Julia Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Those communities that already have implemented overlay plans
argue they have received widespread public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Public Service Commission, for instance, has logged
only four complaints since Miami's new area code took effect July
1, while Maryland, which began mandatory 10-digit dialing more than
a year ago, has received only 13.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that a lack of complaints filed with a
little-known state agency is not an accurate reflection of public
sentiment. And it's not likely to take into account the opinion of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Self, president of Bethesda, Md.-based Market Dynamics,
tells the story of an old friend from out-of-town who came to visit
and got confused on the directions. She stood outside his office
for half an hour, trying to figure out how to use the pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami area went to 10-digit dialing, the posh
Fontainebleau hotel on Miami Beach sent letters to guests and
placed new phone cards in their rooms. But visitors are calling the
front desk in ever greater numbers, trying to learn how to dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few that are a little frustrated, like all of
us,'' said hotel spokeswoman Lisa Cole.
</P>
<P>
   While callers are adjusting to dialing more digits, the newly
created overlay codes remain virtually unknown. In eastern
Maryland, Bell Atlantic has assigned only about 6,100 numbers in
the new 443 overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen one of those numbers yet,'' said Self, author
of the book ``Long Distance for Less.'' ``They're supposedly giving
them out, but I've never had one to dial. I've never seen one
advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Dallas will go one step further by actually erasing
area code boundaries. With telephone experts already looking toward
the day when 12- or even 15-digit dialing will be required, the
idea is to conserve the dwindling pool of numbers as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You delay the date, to the absolute maximum, when you're going
to need the next area code,'' said Bill Adair, a Southwestern Bell
employee who is Texas' number administrator and the industry's
point man on the area code change.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy, suggested by a Southwestern Bell customer, has
raised eyebrows around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in God's name would they erase that?'' asked Mark Cooper,
director of research for the Consumer Federation of America and a
longtime critic of overlay plans. ``The (Public Utility) Commission
has approved this stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   To get the word out about the area code changes, Southwestern
Bell and local business boosters are considering taking out ads on
pizza boxes, on grocery store bags and in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   They're planning to hand out fliers at the state fair, rent
billboard space and possibly draw up materials for children to
color on at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   They've even come up with a slogan: ``Use 10 Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the media blitz will come soon enough for Houston
companies and consumers to make the change smoothly remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gowen, vice president of Alarm Data Corp. in Beltsville,
Md., said it took his company two years to contact customers and
adjust all their security systems to enable them to dial 10 digits.
</P>
<P>
   Elevator repair companies also must take action, since many of
their emergency phones must be reprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that work in the Houston area, however, was completed
when the city split into two area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Crimefighters of Texas Security reprogrammed all
of its alarms at that time to handle 10 digits, to ensure that all
customers' alarms could signal the company's monitoring station in
Channelview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pain in the butt, but we did it,'' said Jim Cassidy,
the company's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Maryland regulators, the Public Utility Commission of
Texas opted not to allow callers to dial ``1'' when making a local
call. Commissioners reasoned they wanted Houston and Dallas callers
to understand exactly when they were making a local call and when
they would be calling long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The overlay plans in Houston and Dallas will make dialing in
those areas different from dialing in the rest of Texas. In cities
such as Austin and San Antonio, callers still will dial only seven
digits to make a local call.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to create some uniformity within Texas, the
commission is considering requiring phone companies to allow
10-digit local dialing everywhere in Texas. This means in
communities where only seven digits are required to place a local
call, callers used to dialing 10 digits will be able to dial the
area code plus the number and still have the local call go through.
</P>
<P>
   Adair holds no illusions Houston residents will enjoy the
upcoming changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area code relief is painful no matter how you do it,''
Adair said. But he promises: ``It's not as bad as it sounds.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To many Americans raised on eating sweet, mushy
bananas, it is difficult to imagine one that does not taste sweet
and needs to be cooked. But the plantain, a tropical fruit related
to the banana and of near miraculous variability, is spilling over
from bodegas and flooding into supermarkets and restaurants all
over New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming so pervasive that it seems poised to join the
list of mainstream ingredients that were exotic not so long ago,
like cilantro, jalapenos and lemon grass.
</P>
<P>
   The plantain is surfacing on menus where you would never expect
to see it. At Park View at the Boathouse in Central Park, plantain
chips cozy up to a grouper club sandwich. Clementine, a downtown
restaurant with an eclectic menu, sometimes runs as a special
grilled octopus with a spicy plantain caper salad, a witty play on
a French potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Terrace on West 119th Street, a busy green chili
Caesar salad is sprinkled with crunchy plantain croutons and tuna
tartar.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the plantain such an extraordinary fruit is that it
can be treated as both a fruit and a vegetable. In one dish, it can
be tender, succulent and faintly sweet; in the next, stiff, starchy
and nutty. It is whatever you want it to be and is tremendously
forgiving in a pan, which is why chefs love it so much.
</P>
<P>
   Its taste and texture all depend on its stage of ripeness. A
plantain looks much like a banana but is slightly larger with
angular, faceted sides (it is sometimes called platano macho, or
``macho banana,'' in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   It is harvested green, when it is starchy and has a firmness
like that of a hard rubber ball. A green plantain is much like a
potato, with a high starch content and mealy texture. It may be
baked or boiled, but the flesh, a creamy peach color, is usually
thinly sliced and fried to make chips or cut into thick slices for
the flat, fritterlike snacks called tostones. And because the sugar
content is low, it doesn't burn but browns evenly and stays
crunchy.
</P>
<P>
   As the plantain ripens, it's peel yellows and softens slightly
as the starch begins converting to sugar. A yellow plantain, tender
and more succulent with a mild, vegetal sweetness, reacts well to
boiling and mashing, sauteeing and baking.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed to sit long enough, a plantain will shrivel and
blacken. Frankly, it will look rotten and hopeless and will attract
fruit flies like crazy, but the yellow flesh inside will be like a
sweet, fragrant flower, touched with acidity. It is best for sweet
plantain mash.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, chefs are known for seeking out new, exotic
ingredients, but there is more to the growing interest in the
plantain than mere fad value. For starters, a compelling change in
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the City Planning Department, the majority of
immigrants between 1982 and 1989 arrived from Asia, the Caribbean
and Latin America _ countries where the plantain is a fundamental
element of the diet. And imports of plantains nationally have
jumped nearly 25 percent during the last nine years, according to
the United States Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   George Contos, a partner in the American Banana Company Inc., in
Hunts Point, the Bronx, said that his company's sales of plantains
over the last five years have increased about 30 percent. ``When
you consider the fact that it is a specialty item,'' he said,
``it's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth of the plantain business is part of a larger development
in the produce business, Contos said. ``What were considered
Spanish items are gaining popularity on a broader population
level,'' he said. ``Things that were considered ethnic are becoming
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But why are so many upscale restaurants suddenly paying
attention to the plantain? Many chefs thank Douglas Rodriguez, the
chef at Patria in the Flatiron district. When he opened his
restaurant in 1994, he introduced what he calls nuevo Latino
cooking to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Plantains appear everywhere on his menu. Long strips of fried
plantain are stuck like tusks into a mound of plantains mashed
coarsely with sauteed onion and bacon _ an African preparation
called fufu _ covered in a confetti of salsa. Shredded plantain
forms a crust on mahi-mahi, and long silky slices of steamed sweet
plantain are used to line a mold of quinoa.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Miami, the son of Cuban immigrants, Rodriguez
cannot remember a family meal without plantains. ``If my father
didn't have rice and plantains with dinner,'' he said, ``it
wouldn't be dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   They say in Cuba that when a foreigner blends into the culture,
he has become aplatanado, or ``going native like a plantain,''
which though not native to the island or the Caribbean, has adapted
naturally to the local habitat. The plantain actually originated in
Southeast Asia, but it is so adaptable that it is grown abundantly
in warm climates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally adaptable in the kitchen, where the starchy and
succulent fruit has become a significant part of cuisines
throughout the tropics. It is so pervasive, said Elizabeth
Schneider, the author of ``Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables''
(William Morrow, 1998), that ``you can tell where someone is from
by the way they prepare their plantains.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Caribbean and Latin America, the plantain _ which is
higher in potassium and vitamin C than a banana and much higher in
vitamin A _ belongs to a group of starchy vegetables called
viandas, or ``staples'' in Spanish. Along with the breadfruit, taro
and malanga, among others, it forms the base of most meals. Which
is why some call the plantain the potato of the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But as easy as it is to compare it to the potato _ whose
versatility translates into infinite permutations of dishes in
Western cooking _ the plantain is actually quite different. It is
less earthy and more succulent, so it must be treated carefully
when it is mixed with dishes like, say, a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They function in a way that is amenable to cross-cultural
cooking because you can use a variety of spices,'' said Katy
Sparks, the chef at Quilty's in SoHo. ``It's like a sponge
absorbing flavors, but it has its own integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Schenk, the chef at Clementine, sees it just this way. In
his plantain caper salad, the assertive flavors of coriander and
green curry are mellowed by cubes of rich plantain. It wouldn't
work with potatoes. ``With plantains,'' he said, ``it's less of a
glaring mix.''
</P>
<P>
   The plantain turns up often with seafood, a kind of
meat-and-potatoes kinship in South American cooking.
</P>
<P>
   At Park View at the Boathouse, for instance, a tuna tartar,
bound with mango, cucumber and a curry mayonnaise, is paired with
steamed and fried plantains, like toast points. At One 3 in
Greenwich Village, slender, salty plantain chips are piled atop a
tower of raw oysters.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs stretch the plantain-seafood theme a little further.
Patricia Williams, the chef at the City Wine and Cigar Company in
TriBeCa, for instance, pickles plantains and serves them as a sort
of relish with sauteed halibut and avocado puree.
</P>
<P>
   But most chefs do not stray so far from tradition. There is no
need to, really. Most traditional dishes, when prepared well, are
incredibly good. Who doesn't love dishes with names like fufu,
mofongo and patacones?
</P>
<P>
   Tostones, made from green plantains, are thickly sliced, fried
and then smashed flat with a plate or meat pounder and fried again.
They are crisp and chewy, and they make smart vehicles for hors
d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Flay, the chef at Mesa Grill in the Flatiron district,
treats his like blinis with Latin blood, spooning salmon tartar and
an avocado relish on top of the rugged-looking, golden disks. Each
bite is at once crisp, silky, starchy and clean.
</P>
<P>
   At Patria, a Colombian dish called patacones pisados is served
with chicken. Whole peeled green plantains are steamed and then
rolled like pie dough with a rolling pin and fried again. Patacones
pisados, which means ``stepped on plantains'' in Spanish, are
usually served in a flat long oval, like the sole of a shoe,
Rodriguez said. He has manicured them a bit, cutting them into neat
triangles.
</P>
<P>
   At many small Latin American restaurants around the city, you
will come across _ in addition to tostones and fried plantains _ a
dish called mofongo. Though it is made in what seems to be 1,000
different ways, in Rodriguez's version, green plantains are braised
until tender and then sauteed with loads of garlic and lemon or
lime juice.
</P>
<P>
   As they saute, the plantains are mashed and tossed, much like a
potato hash, eventually forming a great, fragrant ball.
</P>
<P>
   Most common of all, though, are paper-thin strips of green
plantain _ sometimes the length of the fruit, sometimes a
cross-section _ fried in oil and seasoned with salt. It is a dish
rooted in nearly every tropical culture in which plantains are
grown, including southern India.
</P>
<P>
   There, the chips may be seasoned with curry leaves, chilies or
mustard seeds, said Madhur Jaffrey, who has written several books
on Indian cooking. She is working on a new book, ``Madhur Jaffrey's
World Vegetarian,'' to be published by Clarkson Potter next year
and to include several plantain recipes, like an Indian dish of
yogurt with plantains and mango.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my old books, I think I avoided plantains because I thought
it would be hard for people to find,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is certainly no longer the case. &QL;

THE MENU AS PUZZLE: ROLLING THE `EEL DICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day my friend ate a chicken foot from a dim sum
cart was the day she swore never to order anything unless she had
seen it on a menu first. ``If only it had been written down,'' she
kept saying. ``I never would have ordered it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Anyone who's been dining out at some of the
newest New York restaurants recently might have noticed that the
menu has become a rather puzzling document.
</P>
<P>
   Buttons of milkweed?
</P>
<P>
   Mint love letters?
</P>
<P>
   Hot eel dice?
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some of the items do speak for themselves even if they
don't sound particularly appetizing _ to me, at least. Beef cheek
ravioli with crushed squab liver sounds like something that should
be reported to the ASPCA. And I think the operative word in hot eel
dice is eel; hot or cold, sliced or diced, this creature is not
going into my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But it does seem that the newest rage about town is a menu so
special, so exclusive, that even you, the special, exclusive diner
who is paying for the privilege, has no idea what you are about to
eat. If you're among friends, you can always barrage the waiter
with inquiries as to what exactly is happening inside the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're with clients? Do you want to admit that you _
sophisticated diner that you are _ not only don't know that spruce
tips are buds harvested from the evergreen tree people put presents
under each December, but also that you're not all that interested
in widening your culinary horizons quite that far?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the late 1990s, where the 1980s Menu as Treasure Hunt
(baby lettuce from Indiana, wild salmon from Canada, purple
potatoes from Maine) has given way to Menu as Rorschach Test: Does
``wilted lamb's-quarters'' refer to the animal after an
exceptionally hard day on the range? Or when you discover it's only
lettuce, does your misconception reveal more about your own day at
the office than you want your guests to know?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little intimidation factor going on here,'' says
Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant based in New York.
``In the 80's menus were about whimsy, which pedigreed ingredients
came from which side of the creek. In the 90s it's about obscurity.
There's such a manic race to imitate Jean-Georges and Gray Kunz.
And the irony is that at Jo Jo, Jean George's other restaurant, the
menu says Cod. Salmon. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Loffredo, an owner of Cena on East 22nd Street, home of
the spruce tips and the milkweed buttons, maintains that his chef,
Normand Laprise, wants only to expose customers to exciting new
ingredients. ``But,'' Loffredo admitted, ``there is another side to
the coin. I think to some degree restaurants now are trying to push
the shock factor. It's clearly a marketing decision. They want to
show how cutting edge they can make the menu, to tweak interest as
much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Falcinelli, the chef at Moomba on Seventh Avenue South,
disagreed. ``The cooking world looks to New York to see what
ingredients we're using,'' he said. ``Farmers from Ohio or
Pennysylvania come to New York where someone will give something a
shot before anyone else tries it. It's good to educate people.
Chefs want to express what's on their minds. Sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't. But in New York, when you practice your
craft, you know you're where people appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcinelli's own menu is relatively straightforward, though he
calls cockles ``cockle clams.'' ``It's just to let people know that
cockles are like clams,'' he says. ``They're still bivalves.'' And
the ``natural lamb essence'' that accompanies the roasted rack of
Australian lamb is nothing more than a reduction. ``But when you
say reduction, people think it's thick or syrupy,'' he said. ``This
is just the juice cooked down to the pure essence of lamb flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs admit to extending their creativity past the bounds
of the kitchen. For his menu at Asia de Cuba on Madison Avenue,
Eric Basulto invented the word ``tunapica'' to describe his version
of tuna tartare. ``Picario is a simmered meat dish with capers,
olives, currants and almonds that is usually used for stuffing
empanadas,'' he said ``We've come up with tunapica to mean it's
tuna tartare made with picario ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   At Babbo, a new restaurant on Waverly Place, the chef, Mario
Batali, says his mint love letters are ravioli folded in the shape
of a letter. ``I invented the name,'' he said. ``I love mint. It's
like a kiss. And it kind of makes sense. It's got a sweet little
story inside. But items like this on the menu also invite a
discussion between the service staff and the customer. Granted,
some people don't want an intellectual conversation about the
ingredients; they just want dinner. But the questions can bring
about an interesting conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Or stop one. When I called Chris Johnson, the manager of Bond
Street, which lists the hot eel dice in the sushi roll section of
the menu, I told him I assumed the eel was diced and served hot
inside the roll. Not exactly, he said. ``It is hot as in
temperature, but instead of putting the eel and avocado on the
inside, we top the roll with eel and sprinkle it with almonds. The
chef thinks they look like dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll stick with the Christmas tree.

ODDS OF A GOOD MEAL IN LAS VEGAS ARE RISING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Charles Palmer, two top
New York chefs, have joined other prominent restaurateurs in in
responding to the lure of Las Vegas, Nev. Vongerichten of Jean
Georges, Vong and Jo Jo, and Palmer, of Aureole, the Lennox Room
and Alva, will be running restaurants in two new hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten is opening Prime, a steakhouse, in the Bellagio
hotel that is to open on Oct. 17. Bellagio, which is owned by Steve
Wynn, will also have branches of Le Cirque 2000 and Osteria del
Circo from New York, both of which will be run by Marc Poidevin,
the chef de cuisine at Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer will open a branch of Aureole in the new Mandalay Bay
hotel that is planned for the spring; the restaurant will be
designed by Adam Tihany.
</P>
<P>
   These chefs are part of a second wave. They follow those already
established in Las Vegas like Wolfgang Puck, with Chinois and Spago
at Caesar's, Emeril Lagasse who has Emeril's New Orleans Fish House
in the MGM Grand, Jean-Louis Palladin, with Napa in the Rio Casino
and Hotel, and Mark Miller's Coyote Cafe, also in the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   With all their trophy chefs, each of the new mega hotels in Las
Vegas are increasingly offering microcosms of the American dining
scene. And their customers never have to step out of the air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he was persuaded to open a restaurant in Las Vegas
by the city's growing market for convention business, instead of
just gamblers, and by a contract that gave him full control of his
restaurants, which will include a wine bar and the Aureole Swan
Court, a smaller restaurant. Mandalay Bay will also have a China
Grill restaurant and cafe, and a House of Blues. The hotel, owned
by Circus Circus, is planning a high-end Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In a city already overrun with steakhouses, and where Smith &AMP;
Wollensky will open a place, Vongerichten's decision to open Prime
may seem surprising. He said the hotel offered him a choice between
fish or steak. ``I thought steak would be simpler for us,'' he
said. ``It's a new challenge but I'm doing it with eight different
kinds of potatoes and all kinds of sauces, so it will be totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio will also have a Petrossian boutique and a La Brea
Bakery from Los Angeles, as well as branches of Olives from Boston,
Aqua from San Francisco, and Picasso, a spinoff of Masa's, also
from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Another hotel, the Venetian, which is being built on the site of
the Sands, has signed Joachim Splichal of Los Angeles to create
Patina-Pinot, Lagasse to open Delmonico's New Orleans Steak House
and Piero Selvaggio of Los Angeles for a branch of Valentino. Bill
Weidner, the president, said they are close to signing with Stephan
Pyles' Star Canyon from Dallas, and, from Paris, the venerable
Laduree patisserie.
</P>
<P>
   A contract with Nobu for an outpost in the Hard Rock Hotel is
under negotiation. And the Paris Las Vegas hotel being developed by
the Hilton Hotels Corp. has been talking to Alain Ducasse, the
Michelin-starred French chef.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ To sports lovers, this Bergen County
town is strictly a stadium for football, an arena for basketball
and a track for horses, cheek by jowl in a former swamp known as
the Meadowlands. The real town, which few fans ever see, is a mile
or two west, a gritty enclave dominated by the roar of Route 17,
the old truck route that cuts through it. It is also an unlikely
mecca for wine lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost among the small factories and auto-body shops are
two restaurants _ Park and Orchard, and Sonoma Grill _ that just
happen to make East Rutherford the best place in New Jersey,
perhaps in the entire New York metropolitan area, to eat well and
drink truly exceptional wines at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both are owned and run by dedicated and knowledgeable wine
experts, a quality extremely rare in the restaurant business. These
men are in the business as much to indulge and communicate their
personal fascination with wine as they are to offer good food and
hospitality. The locations may not be chic and may even be out of
the way. But as they say in the Michelin red guide, both
restaurants are worth a detour.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Orchard, which is almost 20 years old, got its name
from its first location, the intersection of Park and Orchard
Streets, just a few blocks from the present site, a cavernous
former machine shop at 240 Hackensack St.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the restaurant was vegetarian, but eventually fish
was added to the menu, then poultry. There is still no red meat,
except for private parties.
</P>
<P>
   What there is plenty of is wine, and most but not all of it is
on the 126-page wine list. ``There is a lot more,'' said Buddy
Gebhardt, the owner, ``but I really don't see how I can fit it on
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt is a hopeless burgundy addict. Once he added $200,000
worth of new burgundies every year. No longer. ``I bought the 1990
Leroys,'' he said, referring to Domaine Leroy, the prestigious
burgundy house, ``but none since. The prices are too outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his customers need worry; the selection is still
staggering. Some of the finest burgundies come from the Clos
Vougeot, and Park and Orchard offers 43, from the 1983 through 1990
vintages and from producers like Meo-Camuzet, Jean Grivot,
Mongeard-Mugneret, Daniel Rion and Georges Roumier.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Clos Vougeot from Grivot is $83 at Park and Orchard,
the 1985 from Rion is $100 and the 1989 from Jacky Confuron is $75.
There is also a 1983 Clos de la Marechale from Faiveley, at $50; a
1985 Vosne-Romanee Les Brulees from Rene Engel, at $75; a 1983 Clos
de la Roche from Domaine Dujac, at $75, and a 1990 Morey-St.-Denis
Les Sorbets from Domaine Serveau, at $45.
</P>
<P>
   To the occasional drinker, these prices may seem high, but in
fact each of these wines could command $20 to $50 more a bottle in
some Manhattan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   California wine fans are not slighted at Park and Orchard. Helen
Turley's 1996 Black Sears zinfandel is $65, the 1994 Pahlmeyer
merlot is $57 and the 1986 Diamond Creek Red Rock cabernet
sauvignon is $70. Gebhardt annotates each of his wine selections.
For the Diamond Creek, he wrote: ``For those of you who like
gigantic wines. You must call me hours in advance so I can decant
it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Foy, the owner of Sonoma Grill, has his own wine story to
tell. As a Peace Corps volunteer in Jamaica from 1969 to 1971, he
started experimenting with the island's wines. Later, as an
accountant in Belgium, he began to appreciate fine food and
eventually became a sous-chef at the ``21'' Club in New York. In
1976, he opened the Tarragon Tree in Meyersville, N.J., with his
brother Dennis; later, he opened Les Delices in Whippany, N.J.
Then, in 1992, he opened Sonoma Grill at 64 Hoboken Road.
</P>
<P>
   Foy's interest in wine extends well beyond his restaurant. He
publishes his own newsletter, John Foy's Wine Odyssey, and writes a
weekly wine column for The Bergen Record. His wine cellar may not
be as extensive as Park and Orchard's but he has a different
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy has breadth,'' Foy said of his colleague a few blocks
away. ``I try for depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, his cabernet sauvignons include 13 vintages from
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, 9 from Sterling Vineyards and 8 from
Beaulieu Vineyards Private Reserve. His Mondavi Reserve cabernets
go back to 1975, and his Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard cabernets
to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma Grill offers 10 wine tastings a year and twice-a-month
wine dinners. It is also noted for its sales. This summer, for
example, Foy is offering a 25 percent discount on all California
cabernets from the 1984 vintage and older. The same reduction
applies to burgundies from 1985 and older and Bordeaux from 1983
and older, with the exception of the 1982's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already lower than anyone else on 1982,'' he said. ``I
can't go down any more. Our prices on mature wines, from 1990 and
earlier, are anywhere from a third to a half of prices on
comparable lists in New York. On younger wines, I'm 25 percent
lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Foy's customers prefer California cabernet and merlot. ``The
dividing line is clear,'' he said. ``The under-40 crowd drinks only
California. They'll pay $80 for a California wine and ignore a
better French wine at half the price. I'll say to a customer, `Try
this Pomerol,' and he'll wave it off, saying, `I don't know
anything about that stuff.' If I explain that it's 100 percent
merlot, I'll get: `Really? Maybe I'll try it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both Park and Orchard and Sonoma Grill benefit from the crowds
at the Meadowlands, but neither owner thinks of his place as a
sports restaurant. Both have knowledgeable clients who come over
from New York because of the extensive wine lists and relatively
low prices, but neither caters only to wine sophisticates.
Gebhardt's wine list starts off with two pages of wines for $25 or
less, and both restaurants offer lots of wines by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Orchard's menu features lighter fare. Sonoma Grill
offers two menus, a modern American selection and one emphasizing
broiled meats. Park and Orchard's phone number is (201) 939-9292;
Sonoma Grill's is (201) 507-8989.

WINE TASTINGS: A BIT OF SUGAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Llano Estacado Chenin Blanc 1997, Lubbock, Texas. About $8.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Llano believe that chenin blanc is a vinifera
variety that is particularly well suited to Texas. Tasting this
wine leads me to believe that they are on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit is up front in this interpretation, and there is a
smidgen of residual sugar to please newcomers to wine drinking. I
could do without it, but then I've been drinking chenin blanc for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans recommend this chenin blanc as a partner for
Southwestern food. Probably so, but it will be tough to convert the
hard-core beer fans. I think it makes a nice aperitif.

A FESTIVAL THAT GIVES YOUNG ARTISTS A CHANCE TO GROW  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ The magnet of big names _ Peter Brook,
Claudio Abbado, Pierre Boulez and Pina Bausch among them _ drew
many visitors to Aix-en-Provence this month for France's best-known
summer opera festival. Once here, however, some operagoers wondered
whether they had landed by mistake at a youth jamboree. The veteran
stars were delighted. Things had gone according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1948 and floundering in the mid-1990s, the Aix
festival was reborn this year around the idea of giving young
singers and instrumentalists the chance to work with top
conductors, stage directors and soloists. To give structure to the
experiment, Stephane Lissner, the festival's director, created a
European Music Academy and invited 53 musicians under the age of 35
to attend its opening season.
</P>
<P>
   But the purpose was more practical than pedagogic. The academy
members were chosen both for their talent as musicians and their
lack of professional experience as performers. What they learned
from assorted maestros during long rehearsals in Aix was then put
to the test in recitals, concerts and opera productions. And they
performed before paying audiences that were not about to make
allowances for youth.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Lissner's long-term strategy of creating the
next generation of opera talent, the academy's two productions,
Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas'' and Britten's ``Curlew River,'' were
well received by both public and critics. Indeed, if the youth of
the performers was evident in the events, which will end on July
31, it was through the verve and energy they brought to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had to learn to handle myself under a lot of
pressure,'' said Rinat Shaham, 25, an Israeli-born mezzo-soprano
who sang the role of Dido. ``Having the main role, I feel the show
rests on my shoulders. I'm expected to be excellent every time. And
the exposure is unbelievable. Basically everyone comes here _
directors, critics, conductors, a great audience.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 13 singers and 15 instrumentalists involved in the
academy's two operas this year, more experience lies ahead when the
two productions tour 16 European cities from February to May next
year. ``In some ways, meeting musicians from all over the world is
the best thing about this,'' said Marc Thayer, 27, an American
violinist who has played in the Miami-based New World Symphony for
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guides for these two operas were the American
conductor David Stern, the British tenor Robert Tear and the
Japanese actor Yoshi Oida, who belongs to Brook's Paris-based
experimental theater company and who directed ``Curlew River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a desperately needed moment,'' explained Stern, 35,
who is music director for this year's academy. ``Too many kids come
out of conservatory without knowing what awaits them. This gives
them a chance to step back before they ply into a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight other singers participated in a workshop on Mozart's
``Zauberfloete,'' but again this was not an academic exercise.
Working with the veteran French soprano Regine Crespin, Stern and a
rising French director, Stephane Braunschweig, they have been
preparing the production of ``Die Zauberfloete'' that will be
presented at next year's festival. And to expose them to an
audience, several rehearsals have been open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, with 12 young singers, formed the chorus in
Brook's production of ``Don Giovanni,'' and they will join a
five-nation tour of the opera from August through January. These
singers, all planning careers as soloists, have also learned the
individual roles in ``Don Giovanni'' in hope of taking over a
leading part when the production is revived here next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even five young composers were able to hear their new works,
commissioned by the academy, performed in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the academy did not become a sort of youth wing to the
main festival, it was because young people were everywhere. The two
casts for ``Don Giovanni'' comprised experienced singers, but there
was not a gray hair among them. Accompanying them in the pit were
musicians of the newly formed Mahler Chamber Orchestra, all between
the ages of 22 and 28. For Bartok's ``Bluebeard's Castle,'' which
was directed by Ms. Bausch, Boulez conducted the Gustav Mahler
Youth Orchestra, whose instrumentalists were even younger, between
16 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Daniel Harding who best personified the festival's
spirit of bringing young and old together. A slightly built,
fair-haired Briton who looks even younger than his 22 years,
Harding shared the responsibility of conducting ``Don Giovanni''
with Abbado, more than 40 years his senior. And he held his own, in
the view of critics, precisely because he did not try to imitate
the maestro.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think Claudio would come along and tell me how to do
things, but he hasn't,'' Harding said. ``It's incredible how he can
be so open and flexible. The main differences are in tempi. Anyway,
it's not interesting to have a star conductor and a little person
who comes along to copy. You're better off with the real thing. If
they have me, better to let me do it my way.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Abbado is famous for encouraging young musicians.
He founded both the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra and the Mahler
Chamber Orchestra and, in 1995, invited Harding to be his
assistant. By then, though, the young Oxford-born conductor had
already cut his teeth working with Simon Rattle and the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. He is now principal guest conductor
of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra in Norway and next year will
become music director of the Deutsch Kammer Orchestra in Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more even than being acclaimed after conducting ``Don
Giovanni,'' Harding considers his strongest experience this summer
to have been working with Brook during two months of rehearsals.
``I think we're all spoiled, me in particular,'' he said, ``that my
first outing into opera should involve learning Peter's theatrical
way of working. He would be there as a kind of guiding light for
everyone. It's very hard to be nervous working with Peter because
he always makes you feel so secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Other young performers also appreciated the opportunities
offered by the long rehearsal time. ``It was very rewarding working
with Yoshi Oida,'' said Michael Bennett, 32, a Briton whose
performance as the Madwoman in ``Curlew River'' was widely praised.
``He didn't want us to act. The Madwoman is a very traumatized
character. He made me believe I could convey this without showing
it to the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was also ``incredibly stimulating'' to be counseled
by Tear, who sang the Madwoman in Britten's first production of the
opera. ``Without knowing it, your standard is raised,'' Bennett
said. ``I hope that when this is over I will sit down and think
about all we have done here and let it feed through to my work from
now on. And, yes, I'd like to come back.''

CORN CREPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crepe's reputation has suffered lately. The crepe is widely
seen as old-fashioned, but the truth is that it has a lot going for
it, no matter what fashion may be dictating at the moment. It is
delicate in flavor and texture, so it allows the personality of the
filling to emerge cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   A blessing for the cook is that a crepe, unlike a tortilla, is
easily made from scratch. Tortillas involve rolling or pressing,
the kinds of activity that benefit from years of practice. Crepes
are quicker to make and more forgiving; most troubles can be fixed
by adjusting the amount of batter in the pan or thinning it with a
little water.
</P>
<P>
   This dish was inspired by one of my favorite enchilada recipes.
The wrap is a corn-flavor crepe. The filling is nothing more than
fresh corn, stripped from the cob and sauteed with onion, zucchini
and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   But the true star of this dish is mole, a dazzling, nuanced
Mexican sauce that contains ground red chili, spices, Mexican
chocolate and a bit of vinegar (you'll find the chili and the
chocolate in stores selling Mexican or Southwestern ingredients).
</P>
<P>
   Ground chili is a natural thickener, so it binds the sauce and
gives it body. If you use a mild chili powder, which I call for,
you'll find the sauce hot but not at all fiery. The chocolate
further mellows the mole while adding complexity. Don't expect to
taste the chocolate, though; it disappears as it harmonizes with
the other ingredients. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORN CREPES WITH RED CHILI MOLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   One-thir cup cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2 large or extra-large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter, plus extra for cooking
the crepes
</P>
<P>
   \ cup raisins, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup pignoli nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (about 2 ounces) grated goat cheddar or other cheddar
cheese
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons coriander seed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon anise seed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin seed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons canola or sunflower seed oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups minced onion
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup mild ground chili
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce Mexican chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon sherry vinegar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced zucchini
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   { cup creme fraiche or very lightly beaten heavy cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, milk and {
teaspoon salt; blend well. Add the eggs and melted butter, and mix
until smooth. Place a 6- to 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium
heat. When it is hot enough for a drop of water to skitter over the
surface, add about { teaspoon butter. Ladle a scant \ cup batter
into the skillet, and swirl to form a thin layer; pour any excess
back into the bowl. When the top of the crepe is dry, after about 1
minute, turn, and cook the other side 15 to 30 seconds. The crepe
should brown only slightly; it should not be crisp. Put it on a
plate. Repeat the process, adding butter as needed. The cooked
crepes should make a stack of 12.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cover raisins with warm water, and set aside. Place a dry
skillet over medium heat. Put in pignoli nuts, and stir or shake
the pan until they begin to brown; transfer immediately to a small
bowl. Drain the raisins, and squeeze gently to remove excess
liquid. Add raisins to the bowl of pignoli nuts, along with cheese
and cilantro; set aside. In a dry skillet, combine coriander seed,
anise, cumin and oregano. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until
fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder, and grind
to a powder; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare the mole, place a medium saucepan over medium-high
heat; add 3 tablespoons oil. When oil is hot, add { cup onion.
Saute, stirring, until it just begins to brown. Add 1 teaspoon
garlic, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the reserved spice mix, and
remove from heat. Add chili powder and 1{ cups water. Return pan to
medium heat, and slowly bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Add
chocolate and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to low. Simmer,
stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add vinegar, adjust seasonings, and
keep warm until serving.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place a skillet over medium heat, and add the remaining 2
tablespoons oil. When oil is hot, add the remaining 1 cup onion,
and saute until onion is translucent. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon
garlic, zucchini and 1 tablespoon water. Saute until zucchini is
tender, about 5 minutes; add corn. Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes;
remove from heat. Stir in raisin-pignoli mixture.
</P>
<P>
   5. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. To assemble, place about 2
tablespoons of filling on one quadrant of a crepe. Flatten the
filling slightly, fold the crepe over, and place 1 tablespoon of
filling on the crepe covering the original portion of filling. Fold
again, and tuck a tablespoon of filling into the fold that was just
made. The finished crepe will be folded into quarters, with three
pockets of filling. Place the crepes on a baking sheet, and bake
until heated through, about 10 minutes. To serve, place two or
three crepes on each plate, and top with a spoonful of mole and a
little creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A hunter I'm not. But gathering, especially when it
comes to berries in midsummer, has delighted me since I was a
child.
</P>
<P>
   When I was small I could reach the heavily laden lower branches
better than grown-ups and could plunder the half-hidden clusters on
blackberry, blueberry and raspberry bushes.
</P>
<P>
   One berry for me, two for the bucket, or maybe the other way
around. There was never any concern about pesticides or herbicides
because these bushes were wild, flourishing along the roadside in
Long Island and upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult I have recaptured those joyous moments of picking
and nibbling on occasion, especially with my children when they
were young, and on a trip to Alaska, where wild raspberries and
their tasty pale cousins, salmonberries, grow profusely.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even berries in the market have an irresistible attraction,
especially in July and August, when so many ripe and delicious
varieties compete for attention; for a berry lover, these weeks are
prime time.
</P>
<P>
   With some berries, like raspberries and blackberries, there is
good reason to eat without delay, as anyone can attest who has
purchased a precious half-pint in a market only to find the bottom
layer fuzzy with mold. Raspberries should be intact, with a soft,
slightly downy look, while blackberries should be plump and glossy.
</P>
<P>
   To be assured of buying the freshest, go to a farm stand or
Greenmarket, and look for baskets unprotected by cellophane or
plastic, a sure sign that the berries were picked no more than a
day before and not shipped a great distance.
</P>
<P>
   Take them home, refrigerate them and use them by evening after
picking them over and giving a quick rinse. Some recipes call for
forcing berries through a sieve to remove the seeds before making a
sauce. But they are beautiful uncooked in a tart, and they also
hold up extremely well in baked desserts, including custards,
crisps, cobblers, pies and muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries are not only easier to pick _ no thorns or stooping
_ but also much sturdier. And always look for blueberries with a
pale bluish bloom, which indicates they are fresh. This natural
protective coating begins to disappear as the berries sit around.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivated blueberries are usually fairly large; wild ones, as
well as huckleberries, are smaller and more intensely flavored.
Blueberries are excellent for baking and are delicious lightly
sweetened and splashed with gin.
</P>
<P>
   Boysenberries, mulberries, gooseberries and red or black
currants are also among the berries that show up in markets this
time of year. Though the local strawberry season ended several
weeks ago, one variety, the Tristar, which continues to ripen well
into September, is sold in the Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny fraises des bois, as red or white Alpine strawberries are
called, are also harvested throughout the summer, but you may need
a bank loan to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipes are all quite simple. The souffleed
dessert is made by baking the berries in a light lemon batter that
separates into a custard enrobing them, with a souffle topping. The
nectarines are enriched with berries and a berry sauce, which can
also be used over ice cream or sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   And when you realize you are ready for chintz slipcovers instead
of plush upholstery, it's time for summer pudding. It resembles a
classic English steamed pudding, like a plum pudding, made in a
bowl. But it's not steamed for hours, as winter puddings are. The
berries are cooked very briefly and used to fill a shell of white
bread. The result is a stunning magenta dome filled with berries;
serve it cold. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SUMMER PUDDING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus overnight chilling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1-pound loaf good quality thinly sliced white sandwich bread
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   3 pints mixed fresh berries, including raspberries,
strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and, if available, currants
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons berry-flavored eau de vie, like framboise
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream, whipped. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Remove crusts from bread, and arrange slices, trimming them
to shape or cutting them in half, to line a 2-quart mixing bowl
completely. Press bread into bottom and sides, leaving no gaps (the
slices can overlap slightly around sides of bowl). Save enough
bread and any trimmings, including crusts, for covering the top. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Place sugar in heavy 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Stir in
lemon juice. When sugar has melted, add berries. Stir gently with
wooden spoon, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until all of the sugar
has dissolved and the berries have given up their juices and are
soft but still hold their shape. They should be in a rich deep red
syrup. Add the eau de vie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a slotted spoon, transfer berries to the bread-lined
bowl. Pour all but about one-third cup of the syrup over the
berries. The bowl should be nearly filled. Fit reserved bread over
the top, using the crusts if needed. Cover with plastic wrap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Place bowl in a pan with sides to catch juices. Place a plate
nearly the diameter of the bowl on top of the pudding. Place a
heavy jar or can on top of the plate to weight the pudding. Don't
worry if some of the syrup oozes up. Refrigerate the weighted
pudding for at least 8 hours or overnight. Refrigerate the reserved
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, remove the weight, plate and wrap, and run a thin
knife or spatula around the inside of the bowl. Unmold the pudding
onto a serving plate with a rim. Use the reserved syrup to paint
any patches of bread that were not completely soaked with the berry
juices. Serve at once, with whipped cream on the side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 to 10 servings. &QL;

TAL FARLOW, 77, JAZZ GUITARIST ROOTED IN BOP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tal Farlow, one of jazz's best-known guitarists, died
on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
He was 77 and lived in Sea Bright, N.J., and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Michele
Hyk-Farlow.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow, one of the early be-boppers, was immensely affected by
the playing of the pianist Bud Powell. His lines, clean and
undistorted, sprang from his guitar; his sense of narrative, the
way his ideas swooped and resolved, always sticking closely to the
geography of a tune's structure, made his improvisations well worth
following. A solo of Farlow's might quote other songs, but it was
his swing, an unstoppable forward motion, that gave the solos
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow brought plenty to the guitar vocabulary, perfecting a
technique in which he could extract the brilliant sound of a
harmonic from any fret of the guitar; a good example is ``Isn't It
Romantic?,'' from a Verve album from 1954 titled ``Tal.'' He also
tinkered with electronics, devising an instrument that split notes
into octaves; one of his early experiments to produce a
sweeter-sounding guitar led him to shorten the length of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow's musical originality was a reflection of his life. His
friends included scientists and NASA engineers, and he kept the
business side of jazz at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Greensboro, N.C., and quickly took up music. His
father, who had been an amateur musician, recognized the
destructive toll of work in the local mills and factories and urged
his son to take up sign painting. That background helped Farlow
when the rock-and-roll onslaught of the 1960s deprived many jazz
musicians of a steady living.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s he joined the pianist Dardanelle's group in New
York. In 1949 _ he had already dropped out of music once to go back
to sign painting _ Farlow joined the clarinetist Buddy DeFranco's
small group, as well as Red Norvo's trio, which included a young
Charles Mingus on bass.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings the group left behind were striking for their
ripping velocity and the accuracy with which the musicians played
complex arrangements. And Farlow stands out, his be-bop lines
cruising through with cool and power.
</P>
<P>
   He worked a stint with Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, spent a year
working with Norvo again, and, in 1954, won his first Down Beat
award. Around that time, Farlow began recording under his own name,
including a session in 1953 for Blue Note. Then he recorded a
series of albums for Verve that included ``Tal,'' ``This is Tal
Farlow,'' ``Autumn In New York,'' ``The Tal Farlow Album'' and
more; the albums often included Eddie Costa, a rocking, tough
pianist who was his perfect foil.

TAL FARLOW, 77, JAZZ GUITARIST ROOTED IN BOP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tal Farlow, one of jazz's best-known guitarists, died
on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
He was 77 and lived in Sea Bright, N.J., and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Michele
Hyk-Farlow.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow, one of the early be-boppers, was immensely affected by
the playing of the pianist Bud Powell. His lines, clean and
undistorted, sprang from his guitar; his sense of narrative, the
way his ideas swooped and resolved, always sticking closely to the
geography of a tune's structure, made his improvisations well worth
following. A solo of Farlow's might quote other songs, but it was
his swing, an unstoppable forward motion, that gave the solos
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow brought plenty to the guitar vocabulary, perfecting a
technique in which he could extract the brilliant sound of a
harmonic from any fret of the guitar; a good example is ``Isn't It
Romantic?,'' from a Verve album from 1954 titled ``Tal.'' He also
tinkered with electronics, devising an instrument that split notes
into octaves; one of his early experiments to produce a
sweeter-sounding guitar led him to shorten the length of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow's musical originality was a reflection of his life. His
friends included scientists and NASA engineers, and he kept the
business side of jazz at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Greensboro, N.C., and quickly took up music. His
father, who had been an amateur musician, recognized the
destructive toll of work in the local mills and factories and urged
his son to take up sign painting. That background helped Farlow
when the rock-and-roll onslaught of the 1960s deprived many jazz
musicians of a steady living.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s he joined the pianist Dardanelle's group in New
York. In 1949 _ he had already dropped out of music once to go back
to sign painting _ Farlow joined the clarinetist Buddy DeFranco's
small group, as well as Red Norvo's trio, which included a young
Charles Mingus on bass.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings the group left behind were striking for their
ripping velocity and the accuracy with which the musicians played
complex arrangements. And Farlow stands out, his be-bop lines
cruising through with cool and power.
</P>
<P>
   He worked a stint with Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, spent a year
working with Norvo again, and, in 1954, won his first Down Beat
award. Around that time, Farlow began recording under his own name,
including a session in 1953 for Blue Note. Then he recorded a
series of albums for Verve that included ``Tal,'' ``This is Tal
Farlow,'' ``Autumn In New York,'' ``The Tal Farlow Album'' and
more; the albums often included Eddie Costa, a rocking, tough
pianist who was his perfect foil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Farlow began retiring from view with greater frequency,
moving to Sea Bright, where he read, went boating and taught jazz
guitar; a one-hour lesson could turn into a daylong music session.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, he emerged more often, and in the '90s he
worked when he wanted, which wasn't often. He recorded through the
years for Fantasy Records and Concord Records.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow, who is survived by his wife, played up to a month or so
before his death.

   Thai Marketplace Replaces A Korean Restaurant
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bop, the little Korean restaurant that Brad Kelley
opened last December at 179 Prince St. (Thompson Street), was such
a success that he closed it a month ago. He knows what he's doing:
he is moving it to a bigger location at 325 Bowery (Second Street).
He has converted the Bop space into Kin Khao Market, a takeout
shop, food market and cafe specializing in the Southeast Asian
dishes served at Kin Khao, Kelley's Thai restaurant a block away on
Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the heat, the Kin Khao Market can coax appetites with a
tangy green mango salad showered with toasted coconut, a
chili-flecked tuna salad with a whiff of lemon grass, and a Thai
beef salad refreshed with cucumbers. Salads are $5.50 to $7.95.
Curries, satays, steamed dumplings, Mongolian barbecue and
sandwiches like Thai grilled chicken are served at the counters at
lunchtime. In the afternoon, ingredients that are peeled, sliced
and ready to go into the wok are sold, with recipes and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Kin Khao Market will also cater.
</P>
<P>
   Thin Sardinian Bread
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thinnest kind of flatbread, so fragile it is one
step from phyllo, is Sardinian carasau, or sheet-music bread, and
it is now available in packages (top, center). Triangular pane
carasau, made by a consortium of wheat growers on Sardinia, comes
plain, in whole wheat or sprinkled with olive oil and salt. Its
crispness is enhanced by a brief warming in an oven. Sardinians
serve it broken into pieces, which is the way you may find some of
the sheets in the box. A slightly thicker rectangular variety, pane
pistoccu, can be layered with tomato sauce and cheese and baked
like lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   Pane carasau is $3.50 to $4.50 for a 250-gram package (about
nine ounces) and $5.50 to $7 for 500 grams (17 ounces). Pane
pistoccu comes in a 500-gram box and is $4.75 to $5.50. Some stores
that have the breads are Todaro Brothers, 555 Second Ave. (30th
Street); Amish Market East, 240 E. 45th St.; Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560
Broadway (Prince Street); A. Razzano Salumeria, 287 School St.,
Glen Cove, N.Y., and Wheat Fields, 82 Mill Hill Road, Woodstock,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Caramel Success
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico and South America, caramel is not always made by
cooking sugar. Often, the process is to heat cow or goat milk
slowly until it thickens to a sweetly concentrated, honey-colored
confection. Haagen-Dazs has borrowed from this recipe for a new
flavor of ice cream, dulce de leche, whose success has taken the
company a bit by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The caramel ice cream, which is aswirl with darker, slightly
more bitter caramel, was developed for the Argentine market, then
introduced last fall in parts of New York and other North American
cities that have large Hispanic populations. The flavor did so well
_ in Miami it outsold the company's vanilla ice cream _ that
Haagen-Dazs is now introducing it to broader markets around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go out on a limb and say it could be the most successful
new flavor introduction we have ever done,'' said Vivien Godfrey, a
vice president of Haagen-Dazs. ``It's flying off the shelves in
markets where there is no major Hispanic presence.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. Dulce de leche is richly beguiling, and
unencumbered by distracting bits of candy or chunks of cookie. The
price is $3.50 to $4.25.

A MUSSEL DISH WITH ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a whole world of steamed mussels beyond white wine,
parsley and garlic. Don't misunderstand: you can't go wrong with
this traditional approach. But you can't go too far with it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   With favorites like mussels, a little adventure takes no more
effort than the tried-and-true. The basic trick is to use
distinctive Asian seasonings like ginger, soy or curry powder. And
to omit the cooking liquid, to make the sauce more intense. Mussels
generate so much good-tasting broth of their own during cooking
that additional liquid is superfluous. By relying only on the
mussels' natural juices, you can use fewer seasonings (and less of
them) to produce a flavorful sauce that is also less watery than
the usual one. These are mussels to eat on a flat plate, rather
than in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, any mussel recipe will work equally well for
clams. If you're clam-minded rather than mussel-minded, you'd do
best to avoid steamers (which tend to be sandy) and instead go for
littlenecks _ small hard-shell clams, the kind served on the half
shell and used for good pasta with clam sauce. Figure on one and a
half to two pounds of clams for each pound of mussels, and you'll
need to strain the cooking liquid, since the shells may be sandy
even after washing.
</P>
<P>
   When cleaning mussels or hard-shell clams, discard any with
broken shells. Clams must be shut tight before cooking; mussels may
be open, but their shells should close when lightly tapped (if they
don't close, discard them). If the mussels have beards _ hairy
vegetative growth attached to the shell _ trim them off. Those
clams or mussels that remain closed after the majority have been
steamed open can be pried open with a knife (a butter knife works
fine) at the table.
</P>
<P>
   If you use soy, the sauce becomes a lovely shade of mahogany;
with curry, it's stunningly yellow. Either way, these are mussel
dishes that are better served with rice than with bread.
</P>
<P>
   STEAMED MUSSELS WITH SOY
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup roughly chopped scallions
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon roughly chopped ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds mussels (or 6 to 8 pounds hard-shell clams), well
washed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put oil in saucepan large enough for all of the mussels. Turn
heat to medium. One minute later, add scallions, ginger and garlic.
Cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add mussels, turn heat to high, and cover pot. Cook, shaking
pot occasionally, until all (or nearly all) of them open, about 10
minutes. Turn off heat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Scoop mussels into serving bowl. Add soy sauce to liquid, and
then pass liquid through a fine strainer (or a coarse strainer
lined with cheesecloth). Pour liquid over mussels, and serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For Curried Steamed Mussels, substitute 2 tablespoons
butter for the oil. Substitute \ cup shallots for the scallions,
and omit the ginger and garlic. When shallots soften, sprinkle them
with 1 teaspoon curry powder, and cook, stirring, for another 30
seconds. Cook, and finish as above, substituting the juice of 1
lime for the soy sauce.

`THE NEGOTIATOR': WHEN A NICE GUY HOLDS SOMEONE HOSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a twist on the Hitchcockian maxim, ``The Negotiator'' places
two extraordinary actors, Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, in
the midst of surprisingly ordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And considering how well-known they are for delivering wildly
colorful dialogue with deadpan panache, it is no less unexpected to
find them cast as blandly nice guys. Though the film has its basis
in an actual event that took place in St. Louis, it takes on the
homogeneous look of many other thrillers in which an emergency
escalates into a paramilitary operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of close-ups, exaggeratedly tense moments and blue-lighted
nighttime scenes guarantee that ``The Negotiator'' will be right at
home on video some day.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, both Jackson and Spacey are cast as friendly,
pleasant family men and team players. Both also happen to be
tip-top hostage negotiators, well versed in the art of agreeing to
crazy demands so as to outsmart terrorists and persuade them to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   What a high-concept turning of the tables it is, then, to find
Jackson's Danny Roman, a Chicago police officer, forced to become a
hostage-taker himself. An elaborate though predictable scheme has
Danny framed by other officers for stealing from the policemen's
disability fund. Under this pressure, he goes crazy-like-a-fox
berserk in order to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   As directed with brisk, matter-of-fact momentum by F. Gary Gray
(``Set It Off''), ``The Negotiator'' has the unfortunate effect of
glamorizing Danny's gambit. Taking hostages turns him into a
powerful figure wielding great, dramatic influence on everyone
around him.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Jackson is also asked to deliver the
screenplay's typically flat dialogue by way of explaining himself,
as in: ``Put yourself in my position. What else could I do?''
Jackson is far too commanding and clever an actor to make his
character seem that uncomplicated, but the script doesn't leave
much to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The film's title really should have been plural, since the story
really concerns the two negotiators in an elaborate standoff.
Though they know each other only by reputation, Jackson's Danny
insists that Spacey's Chris Sabian be brought into the case.
(Explanation: ``When your friends betray you, sometimes the only
people you can trust are strangers.'')
</P>
<P>
   Like Jackson, Spacey cuts an impressively cryptic figure even
when dealing in platitudes, and the two stars do get to make the
sort of declarations that rarely crop up in everyday life. Like:
``We're gonna do it my way or I walk!'' Or: ``I'm reading your
eyes. The eyes can't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's supporting cast includes a solid array of actors well
versed in the ways of police thrillers, including David Morse, John
Spencer, Ron Rifkin and J.T. Walsh. Walsh, who died earlier this
year, had the best cynical scowl in the business and is seen using
it with his trademark shrewdness one last time here.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the cast is Regina Taylor as the loving wife of Danny,
who is supposed to be a love-struck newlywed. ``The Negotiator'' is
so intent on domesticating its stars that it even shows Spacey
kidding with a cute little daughter and Jackson line-dancing at a
policemen's hoedown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and violence.
</P>

UNIVERSITY PROVIDES SANCTUARY TO ENDANGERED GULF COAST DENIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ARANSAS, Texas _ Tony Amos somewhat resembles the biblical
figure Noah, although the ``ARK'' under Amos' care is a group of
land-bound tanks and cages rather than a seaworthy craft.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, the white-haired and bearded Amos climbs into his
pickup truck and scours 7.5 miles of beach for creatures native to
the Gulf Coast and returns to the Animal Rehabilitation Keep (ARK)
on the grounds of the University of Texas Marine Science Institute
at Port Aransas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really had a run on babies this year,'' Amos said as he
scurried about preparing to feed nearly 100 sick or injured sea
turtles and sea birds under his care. ``This operation has gotten
so large that we can't continue like we have for the past 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The ARK is run by university volunteers, mainly Amos, who
attempt to help Kemp's ridley, loggerhead, hawksbill and green sea
turtles, as well as various gulls, pelicans and other birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little babies attract the most attention,'' he said as
he held up a Kemp's ridley sea turtle that weighed about an ounce
and was no bigger than 2 inches across.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 of the endangered turtles are believed to exist, and
all of the other turtles and birds at ARK are listed by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service as either endangered or threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five of these ridleys now and could end up with about
a dozen. All of them are missing flippers, but we hope to be able
to release them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep seeing more of the baby ridleys through the
middle of August, and then we will see the young hawksbill in
September and October.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials removed the turtle eggs last year
from nests dug by their mothers. Each nest can contain as many as
90 eggs, which are incubated away from the beach to save them from
predators.
</P>
<P>
   Amos said this breeding season he saw one of the females he
helped release 13 years ago return and create two separate nests.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very rare. I saw her dig the nest and lay the eggs in
one nest and (during the same year) saw her returning to the water
from another nest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One had 90 eggs in it, and the other had 100.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 29 sea turtles and 245 birds were taken to Amos'
facility. More than 50 percent were returned to the wild, Amos
said, but the rest remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are still here and others can't be released
because of the severity of their injuries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amos has been operating his rehabilitation facility, the only
one of its kind in the area, for 20 years. While the university
provides the facility for the rehabilitation center, all food,
medicine, equipment and other supplies must be purchased with
donations, Amos said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Malachy McCourt says his railing days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a murderous rage in my heart of Limerick, the
humiliation of coming out of the slums,'' he says of his hometown
in Ireland, the setting of his brother Frank McCourt's Pulitzer
Prize-winning memoir, ``Angela's Ashes.'' ``It made you feel like
nothing and there was no place to go but down. It was assumed we'd
be low-class the rest of our lives. But who can you blame?
Governments and churches that are gone now? It's useless. Let those
things live rent-free in your head and you'll be a lunatic.
Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person
to die.''
</P>
<P>
   These are good days for McCourt, 66, whose own memoir, ``A Monk
Swimming,'' has spent six weeks on the New York Times best-seller
list. Not bad for a man who has had careers as an actor, radio
personality and bar owner. His book starts in 1952 with his arrival
in New York at the age of 20, when he sold Bibles on Fire Island,
ran the first singles bar in Manhattan (named after himself),
smuggled gold to India, drank, womanized and raged his way through
life as if sheer will and excess alone could make up for every
childhood hurt. His writing style is brashly confident, his
irreverent brand of storytelling laced with dark humor and
sometimes pathos.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't taken long for ``the ubiquitous they'' as McCourt
calls the press and other hangers-on, to snipe at him for trying to
cash in on the success of ``Angela's Ashes'' and readers'
insatiable interest in the McCourt clan. McCourt couldn't care
less.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say what I did was ego-driven and name-dropping,'' he
says. ``Damn right it is. Who am I going to write about? People I
didn't meet?''
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible to imagine anyone left in that category. At
Eamonn Doran on Second Avenue at 53rd Street in Manhattan, where he
is a regular, he greets everyone by name, settling into a booth
beneath his picture with President Clinton. ``I was toastmaster
when he was named Irishman of the Year at the Waldorf,'' he says
proudly. The photograph's inscription reads, ``Blessings on all at
Eamonn's from my pal Bill and myself, Malachy.''
</P>
<P>
   The chef comes from the kitchen to deliver McCourt's pot of tea
personally as he signals the waitress for menus. ``Would you bring
me some water, love?'' he asks in a tone just familiar enough to
make her blush.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's still a charmer after all these years, a fact of which
he's well aware. His blue eyes are clear and smart, thatched with
shaggy white brows from the Brothers Grimm. His wrists are as thick
as his hands, a reminder of his days as a longshoreman. His picture
on the back cover of his book shows a handsome young man, or in the
parlance of America, a ``cute'' one. A term to which he says he at
first took offense. ``Cute in Ireland meant cunning and devious,''
he said, then smiled. ``And I'm not sure that I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   But past his well-honed blarney shtick, which he shines on and
off again at whim, the gratifying thing about McCourt is that he
can drop his professional character act and segue into a smart,
emotionally direct conversation faster than you can say ``Top o'
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   His double layers of personality seem to echo what he says about
Ireland itself. Talking of the period covered in the book, he says,
``That was a tumultuous time for me. I was stepping into a new
life, casting off the rigidity of the church and its smothering
society. The corruption and degradation covered with Irish oak.
This image of a pink-cheeked mother offering cups of milk and peace
and happiness wherever you go, with the road rising to meet you,
and there in the slums they were dying of disease, despair and
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress brings the water, and McCourt orders filet of sole,
since he's become a vegetarian. He quit smoking 10 years ago,
drinking 13 years ago. ``Just sainthood now,'' he says dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the polar opposite of himself as a young adult. ``All
of a sudden here am I, a stripling, so freeing,'' he says of coming
to New York, where people ``trusted what I appeared to be, didn't
know what a messed-up fellow I was in my head. I left school at age
13. I was illiterate with no role models. The great psychobabble
today is the dysfunctional family. Well, I've never met one that
was functional. In Limerick, a family that was dysfunctional was
one who could afford to drink but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the taste of the alcohol since I was 11,'' he goes on,
sipping tea. ``It allowed me to be clever, charming and to behave
outrageously. Acting also allowed me not to be me. So I could
indulge every fantasy in this paradise of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Every paradise has its price, and so did McCourt's. He married
Linda Wachsman and they had two children, Siobhan and Malachy,
which did not stop McCourt's drinking and carousing. Divorce was
inevitable. He met Diana Galin in 1963, and they have been married
33 years. They have two sons, Conor and Cormac, and McCourt is
stepfather to her daughter, Nina. Through the years he acted in
daytime television dramas, including ``Ryan's Hope'' and ``Search
for Tomorrow,'' had successful shows on talk radio and tried his
hand at opening more bars. ``I'm a rotten businessman,'' he admits.
``I've closed more saloons than any alcoholic.'' He has worked
often in the theater, sometimes with his brother Frank, performing
the musical revue they wrote together, ``A Couple of Blaguards,''
about their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But as he says: ``At a certain age the lights begin to go out as
an actor. I was not getting work, I was broke, having never held a
steady job, really. When I told Frank I was thinking about writing
a book, he said great.'' His smile is rueful. ``But the money's all
gone,'' he says of his advance. ``I gave it to my kids. You can't
keep it unless you give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter Siobhan lives in Boston with her two children.
Malachy teaches diving in Bali. Nina, who is retarded, lives in a
group home in New York. Conor is a filmmaker whose documentary
``The McCourts of Limerick'' was on Cinemax. He is also a police
sergeant in Manhattan, where Cormac teaches integral yoga.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother is studying for a master's degree in community
economic development. ``And she puts up with me,'' McCourt says
gratefully.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's other favorite person is his brother Frank. ``He's an
amazing man,'' he says. ``When he was 12, one of our schoolmasters
said: `My boy, you are a literary genius. My strong suggestion is
to go to America. They will appreciate you there.' Over the years,
I've read what he's written that never got published, and I always
said it still holds. He is a literary genius. Also the most
nonjudgmental decent guy. He forgives.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he read ``A Monk Swimming?,'' whose title comes from
McCourt's mishearing the Hail Mary's ``Blessed art thou amongst
women'' as ``Blessed art thou, a monk swimming''?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's writing now, so he hasn't read it,'' he says. ``He told
me: `I can't be hearing your voice. For years it's been very
loud.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he laughs, though he admits he is still not free of the
long-reaching shadows of Limerick. He and Frank were born in
Brooklyn, N.Y., but the family returned to Ireland when Malachy was
3, after the death of his 7-week-old sister, Margaret. His father
drank and could not hold a job; the McCourts lived in desperate
poverty both in New York and Ireland. His twin brothers also died
of illness. Eventually, his father left them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When desertion is involved, the absent parent seems romantic
and caring,'' McCourt says. His mother, Angela, ``was in a
depression,'' he says. ``My father had taken to the alcohol, and
she was helpless in the face of it. My mother wanted to go back to
Ireland after Margaret died. And then she was thrown out of one
slum and only found shelter in another with a drunken beast of a
thing who would sit tearing at a steak with his bare hands and
throw meat to the dog while we children sat hungry. Then he beats
us and sleeps with my mother so we could hear it. The horrors of
that, the shame. There was a sadness of that for years and years. I
once wrote to her and said I loved her. She laughed at it. She
couldn't accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of that life, the things that get you are the two
evils of shame on one shoulder, the demon fear on the other. Shame
says you came from nothing, you're nobody, they'll find you out for
what you and your mother have done. Fear says what's the use of
bothering, drink as much as you can, dull the pain. As a result
shame takes care of the past, fear takes care of the future and
there's no living in the present.'' He sighs. ``The thing about the
low self-esteem rubbish is thinking you have no gifts. Eventually I
became my father, who I hated the most.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some healing, though. The success of both his
book and his brother's has helped, of course. And while Conor
McCourt was researching his documentary, he located the grave in
Queens County where Margaret was buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went out, Frank, Alphie, Mike and myself,'' McCourt
says, referring to his surviving brothers. ``It was a pauper's
grave. My wife, Diana, had decided to keep some of Angela's ashes
in our house, even after we had scattered them. But when Conor
found the grave, we brought the ashes and reunited the mother and
the daughter after 64 years.'' His eyes fill. ``It still makes me
weep to think about it. The recognition that there was something of
that child. We honored her and we honored my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He starts on his third pot of tea, and soon enough the talk
returns to Ireland. ``I picked up an old man on the road once,''
McCourt says, ``during the hardest driving rain. When he got out he
said: `Thank you sir for your kindness. May you have a happy
death.'''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. ``When you think about it, a happy death means you
had a happy life. And I think I have. These days, the simple things
are appealing. Diana, our closeness and love. The grandchildren.
I'm having my dream, one day at a time. I've learned acceptance and
letting go and to just keep a sense of humor about this absurd
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``That we're a species with a hundred percent mortality rate and
not one of us accepts it. So, it's true. Live every day as if it's
going to be your last, and one day, you'll be right.''

`OPIUM: A HISTORY': ALL THE FACTS, AND THEN A BIT MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opium is important and, in one or another of its derivatives and
preparations, has been for millenniums. It is mentioned by Homer,
who called it nepenthe; it was a major factor in the shaping of
19th- and 20th-century Chinese history; it contributed in its way
to the sensualism of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poetry, and, of
course, it is an addictive commodity traded by vast networks of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In his sprawling study of opium and its role in human history,
Martin Booth, a British novelist and documentary filmmaker, covers
everything from opium's chemical composition and manner of
cultivation to the organization of contemporary international
criminal networks for its distribution and sale. He describes in
detail the arduous work of extracting it from the pods of a certain
species of poppy cultivated in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, India,
Myanmar and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He recounts the story of a German pharmacist's assistant named
Friedrich Sertuerner who discovered its morphine derivative in the
19th century. He talks about famous addicts and infamous drug
dealers. He provides history of the Opium War by which the British
forced China to open ports to British trade and residents in 1842;
he talks about subjects as diverse as 19th-century Hong Kong opium
dens, the Hollywood drug scandals in the 1920s and the politics of
opium transport by the CI during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Booth in short has written a comprehensive survey based on a
prodigious and impressive amount of research. ``Opium'' in this
sense is a valuable work, a kind of book-length encyclopedia entry.
But despite its value, Booth's account presents some problems. He
uses no source notes, and that makes it impossible, without doing
considerable research, to assess some of the claims he makes.
</P>
<P>
   He does not help matters by frequently employing soggy
expressions like ``it was estimated'' and ``it has been suggested
that,'' but he rarely identifies those who are doing the estimating
or the suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Booth, who uses a very sober, judicious style, is
correct, for example, when he says that Benjamin Franklin was
``almost certainly addicted to opium in his declining years,'' or
that in the 19th century 90 percent of the adult population of two
coastal provinces of China were ``habituated,'' or that opium was
smuggled into the United States from Hong Kong in the hollowed-out
horns of imported cattle. (Hong Kong exported cattle to the United
States?) But he provides no sources for any of these interesting
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Booth makes some claims, always without
substantiation, that, if true, would force considerable revisions
of history. He gives a brief account, for example, of the Chinese
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek's shady dealings with the head
of the Shanghai underworld, Tu Yueh-sheng. That there was a
relationship between the two men is well-known. What is less well
known is Booth's assertion that ``Tu controlled opium and therefore
Chiang Kai-shek.'' Historians accept that the French police in the
foreign concession in Shanghai gave Tu the authority to control the
criminal underground, but the relationship between Tu and Chiang
has always seemed far murkier than Booth makes it appear.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, Booth obviously exaggerates, as when he asserts
that New York City is ``in a virtual state of siege'' and that it
is being ``killed by heroin.'' He cites a 1971 article in Newsweek
to that effect, but then asserts on his own authority, ``The
situation is little changed today.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Americans consider drugs the greatest problem
facing their nation,'' which will come as news to most Americans.
Less credible and entirely unsubstantiated is Booth's remarkable
claim that the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988 can be blamed on covert CIA drug shipments,
undertaken in a futile effort to gain influence over Middle East
terrorist organizations holding Americans hostage in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Booth gives a capsule history of the CIA's transport of opium
for the Hmong secret army in Laos in the 1960s, which is
well-known, but he later asserts, without documentation, that
without official Western promotion of the drug trade, ``it is
arguable whether or not the Golden Triangle and the Crescent would
be the major producers they are today.'' That almost meaningless
phrase ``it is arguable whether or not'' gives a gloss of
carefulness to what is actually a careless and certainly
unsubstantiated statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is even suggested,'' Booth writes, that ``the CIA has
reverted to its Southeast Asian practices of the 1960s and is
itself dealing in heroin as part of its Middle East strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Booth does not tell us who is suggesting this. He
argues that the CIA might be using drugs to pay bribes to Arab
governments so they will remain within the anti-Iraq alliance
created during the Persian Gulf war. If this is true, it would be
the story of the century, but Booth, with that phrase ``it is even
suggested,'' has certainly not demonstrated that it is true.
</P>
<P>
   In these instances, he does not so much practice journalistic
investigation as he passes along the various unconfirmed
allegations he has heard, especially when it comes to the nefarious
dealings of Western intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When Booth turns to other subjects _ and most of his book has to
do with other subjects _ he seems a far more reliable reporter. His
account of opium's use in medicine, the discovery of its active
properties, his appreciation of the paradox that Western
profiteering from the drug trade in China helped inflict the
scourge of addiction in the West: these and other subjects are
reliably and competently covered by Booth. It is too bad that his
dubious assertions undermine his believability.

`THE PARENT TRAP': SISTERS, SISTERS, SO CUTE AND SO WELL-DRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lavish, super-cute new version of ``The Parent Trap'' is a
remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills hit, which was seriously adorable
in its own right. Remember, it's the story of twins who have been
separated at birth and find themselves reunited at a summer camp,
in this case 11 and a half years later.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of this film's materialistic daydreams, which
are extravagantly illustrated by the ``Father of the Bride'' team
of Nancy Meyer and Charles Shyer, the twins' parents have spent all
of the intervening time shopping. And wasted no time on remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, Hallie and Annie, are both played with take-charge
gusto by red-haired Lindsay Lohan. Miss Lohan, a Ford model at 3
and then a very busy 10-year-old on ``Another World,'' plays the
dual role with apparent effortlessness and with so much
forcefulness that she seems to have been taking shy violet lessons
from Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Trading off English and American accents, and flouncing through
about as many costume changes as there were in ``Evita'' (both
films have the same costume designer, Penny Rose), Ms. Lohan easily
makes it credible that the two girls could switch places and
hornswoggle their credulous parents.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in ways the film hasn't a prayer of explaining, their
mother (a radiant Natasha Richardson) and father (Dennis Quaid,
heartily paternal) have not spoken since their no-fault divorce,
which left not a single hurt feeling or child support fight in its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, fantasy is the order of the day. So this ``Parent
Trap'' discovers, when the girls switch identities, that neither of
them has been living in a coal mine.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's place is a Napa Valley vineyard with a conspicuous art
collection, while mother resides in London and designs chic bridal
gowns. (The film manages to incorporate Ms. Lohan into a fashion
shoot.) That's nothing. There are also trips to a picture-perfect
camp and elaborate promotions for one hotel and one ocean liner
worked into the story.
</P>
<P>
   When they try throwing their parents together on a reunion date,
the girls rent a yacht, prompting Quaid's character to articulate
the film's great, unspoken question: ``So, how exactly are we
paying for all this?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyer, who directed this film exuberantly and who with Shyer
also has such gilded fantasies as ``Baby Boom'' to her credit, does
make it easy to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story's good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   The story incorporates every known creature comfort and a couple
of very likable supporting characters (Lisa Ann Walter as the
wisecracking cook and housekeeper who runs Dad's life, Simon Kunz
as Mother's butler) and only one amusing villain.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Hendrix plays the fashionable witch who threatens to
marry the girls' father and break up their newfound happiness. But
from the time the twins start calling her Cruella De Vil, it's
clear that her fate is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   The visual illusion that Ms. Lohan is actually two characters
has been accomplished so seamlessly that it barely diverts
attention from one of the film's greatest passions, its product
plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Visible brand names and logos are too many to mention, but one
standout is the scene in which the girls discuss how much they like
Oreos, and one says she enjoys these cookies with peanut butter.
Sure enough, out comes the jar of Skippy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parent Trap'' is rated PG (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes mild cussing, spirited practical jokes and one ill-advised
scene in which one twin tries out amateur ear-piercing on her
sister.

   Glenn's Show, And Cronkite's
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn's return trip to space has the ring of nostalgia for
a generation of Americans, and CNN will add to that flavor by
bringing Walter Cronkite back as a co-anchor for its coverage of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   The cable network announced Tuesday that Cronkite, who was
closely associated with the U.S. space program in his role as the
CBS News anchor in the 1960s, would join John Holliman in
presenting CNN's coverage of the launching of the space shuttle
Discovery on Oct. 29 and the planned landing Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite was in Florida in 1962 when Glenn became the first
American to orbit the Earth, and he said Tuesday that his memories
remained ``rather intense.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, technical circumstances for reporting were very
different. ``We had primitive quarters,'' Cronkite said. ``I was in
the back of a station wagon in a snake-infested field.'' And during
the network's minute-by-minute coverage, Cronkite said, ``We kept
track of where he was using this world chart that I unrolled like a
papyrus.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, he said, he recalled the national excitement
that built up before the launching. ``It was like the nation's
honor rested at the top of that rocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement even got to the CBS anchor, who was famous for
his coolness under pressure. ``I do remember my unbridled
enthusiasm at the moment of takeoff, when I said, `Go, baby, go.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the U.S. space program was the biggest of stories a
television anchor could cover; today, Cronkite conceded, things are
different. Interest faded, just as he says he predicted it would 30
years ago, as the trips became less suspenseful and more routine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the space program today was where he might
have expected it to be 35 years ago, Cronkite said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought we'd be further along,'' Cronkite said.
``Doing things like erecting a space city. Of course, none of us
knew what we'd find when we landed on the moon. At the time, we
were all thinking in terms of moon colonies. I didn't think we'd
abandon that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Glenn's flight, Cronkite said suggestions that it was a
gimmick to reignite interest in the space program were unfair. He
said he believed it was a legitimate, serious scientific
examination related to aging and space travel.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he is excited again about seeing Glenn take off. ``I
might be lured into saying `Go, baby, go' again.''

   Fox Populi
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected bedfellows: how did a radical leftist historian come
to have his main work purchased as a miniseries by the Fox network?
</P>
<P>
   Fox, is, after all, owned by Rupert Murdoch, who is not known
for making deals with left-wingers, unless they run China and it's
the only way to keep his satellite business solvent.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox did announce that it will present a 10-hour series based
on the book ``A People's History of the United States,'' by Howard
Zinn. The book, which was nominated for a National Book Award in
1981, chronicles American history from the point of view of blacks,
Indians, women and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn has also challenged U.S. participation in virtually every
war, and once wrote a play based on the early life of anarchist
Emma Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   What in this appeals to the Fox network? Apparently nothing.
It's Matt Damon and Ben Affleck that appeal to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn's name was celebrated in their film ``Good Will Hunting''
when Matt Damon's genius character lauded the book. That mention
was noticed by Marci Pool, the Fox executive in charge of movies,
who got in touch with Damon and Affleck and asked if they would be
interested in bringing this project to television.
</P>
<P>
   They will, as executive producers. What exactly the project will
be is a little unclear, though it may not be precisely the vision
presented in Zinn's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing the book,'' said David Grant, president of the
Fox Television Studio. ``It's a dramatic work. It's not a political
piece. The book is really the inspiration for Matt and Ben to tell
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   As described by Fox, the miniseries is going to tell stories of
American history from a ``youth-oriented'' point of view. ``It's
history as it happened to ordinary people,'' Grant said. ``It's
populist in that sense.''

   Media Quarterbacking
</P>
<P>
   Most listeners scoffed when a top UPN network executive declared
Sunday that only 12 to 15 percent of men aged 18 to 49 watched
``Monday Night Football'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   UPN programming chief Tom Nunan, used the statistic to explain
why UPN had put together a lineup of male-oriented comedies for
Monday nights in the fall. But his audience, a convention of
television critics and reporters, dismissed his comment as some
sort of cockeyed spin on the Nielsen numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Now hear this, critics and sports fans: the numbers are correct.
Among 18-to-49-year-old men, only 12 percent, or about 7.3 million,
watched ``Monday Night Football'' last season, according to Nielsen
Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers look better for ABC and the National Football League
when you consider the share number, or percentage of sets in use.
Among men 18 to 49 who were watching television on Monday nights,
an average of 34 percent were watching football. (The same
percentage held for all men over 18.)
</P>
<P>
   But among younger men, the numbers are even lower: 10.8 percent
of men 18 to 34 watch ``Monday Night Football,'' with a 32 percent
share.
</P>
<P>
   As Nunan argued, that means plenty of young men, a group coveted
by advertisers, are available and might be lured to other programs
_ in UPN's case, ``Guys Like Us,'' a buddy comedy; ``DiResta,'' a
sitcom based on the real-life story of a New York City subway
policeman, John DiResta; ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a screwball spoof
about Abraham Lincoln, and the returning ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie.''

   Watergate had its heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Glorified as their roles might have been in the book and movie
versions of ``All the President's Men,'' Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein and Ben Bradlee and even the shadowy Deep Throat were
crusaders for the truth. It seemed appropriate that dashing young
stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play the lead reporters in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, even Richard Nixon _ while no hero _ was an
undeniably fascinating and complex figure, worthy of a Greek
tragedy or at the very least an Oliver Stone film starring Anthony
Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no heroes in the Starr Wars saga. No one to cheer
for; no one who has emerged as the noble underdog or the innocent
victim or the champion of truth and justice and the American way.
</P>
<P>
   They're all kinda greasy. From Linda Tripp to Lucianne Goldberg
to Monica Lewinsky to Kenneth Starr to all the slick-talking
attorneys to the media pack hounding secretaries and bit players _
if you were related to any of these people, you wouldn't want to
invite them to the family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton? He's an above-average president riding the rocket
ship of a booming economy _ and he's a haplessly horny buffoon in
his personal life, if all the stories (or even half the stories)
about him are to be believed. Trysting with a blowsy lounge singer,
trysting with a beauty queen, engaging in something with a chatty
intern who's only a few years older than his daughter _ why doesn't
the guy just get a BMW roadster, undergo liposuction, dye his hair
and acknowledge he's the Warren Beatty of modern politics?
</P>
<P>
   From the cold of January's winter to the dog days of late July _
that's how long it took for us to get to that teeny-weeny press
conference Tuesday afternoon, when the wonderfully named Plato
Cacheris said, ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, have reached
an agreement today that for her full and truthful testimony she
will receive transactional immunity in this case,'' and then walked
away as reporters yelled ``What's transactional immunity!''
</P>
<P>
   It means the kid can tell her version of the truth without going
to jail _ an agreement that should have been hammered out months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation led to yet another bizarre press conference,
starring Mike McCurry and that wacky band of White House beat
reporters. Like a lot of people who have plans to leave a job in
the near future, McCurry seemed relaxed, bordering on goofy at
times, as he fended off a barrage of questions.
</P>
<P>
   He scolded the press: ``I know you're all going to have to run
out and yak and yak and yak forever about this, but it's going to
be based on very few facts.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked if any ``world leaders'' had discussed the
investigation with Clinton, McCurry chuckled and said: ``The
foreign angle! Looking for that foreign angle! I can safely report
I'm not aware of any foreign angle on this story.''
</P>
<P>
   He chided Sam Donaldson for predicting the content of Lewinsky's
testimony: ``That is sheer speculation on your part, Sam. We've
established some time ago you have absolutely no Earthly idea what
she's going to testify to; you've conceded that point.''
</P>
<P>
   He even dropped a trivia-bombshell. Turns out Lewinsky once
interviewed for a job in the White House press office _ leading
McCurry to admit with a twinkle in his eye how grateful he is about
that hire not materializing.
</P>
<P>
   It was an excellent and entertaining performance. You almost
expected McCurry to come out for a curtain call. But as masterful
as McCurry was in conveying the message that the immunity agreement
is no big deal to the White House, he can't fit the role of hero in
this drama. Spin doctors can't be heroes; they're sidekicks at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Sidekicks to a president who treats the truth like kryptonite.
It's time for Clinton to testify, to provide the ``he said'' to
Monica's ``she said.'' Admit it, deny it, explain it, step up to
the plate and be a man about it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything Clinton says should destroy his presidency. I
may be the last person in America clinging to this belief _ but I
still wonder if Clinton and Lewinsky really did have relations. And
if they did, so what? Jabber all you want about ``suborning
perjury,'' there's nothing impeachable here. The president's
alleged philandering is Hillary's problem, not Ken Starr's.

<P>
   Recent market research suggests that fat-free and reduced-fat
foods are not doing as well as they have in the past. More than
ever, taste is the No. 1 consideration when people buy food.
</P>
<P>
   And mayonnaise, without which a tuna sandwich and a potato salad
can hardly be made, is showing some signs of this trend. According
to Best Foods, the manufacturer of Hellmann's Mayonnaise, low-fat
and no-fat mayonnaises from all companies accounted for 28 percent
of the market in 1989; today they account for 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mayonnaise is the suspension of oil in egg yolks. Nothing more;
everything else is flavoring. But that basic prescription went out
the window when mayonnaises were invented that were low-fat,
reduced-fat, light, non-fat, not made with eggs at all or made with
tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a commercial brand may contain cornstarch; potassium
sorbate, which is a common preservative; xanathan gum; artificial
colors, and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lower-fat alternatives cannot compete with full-fat
mayonnaise in a taste test and certainly none are as good as
mayonnaise made at home, the best of which will include some olive
oil. Homemade mayonnaise does not call for sugar, but most
commercial brands contain some form of sweetening.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible for people who monitor their intake of fat and
calories to find a good-tasting, lower-fat mayonnaise? To find out,
I bought 13 low-fat mayonnaises and salad dressings. Fat-free
versions were not even considered for this taste test because my
experience with fat-free mayonnaise and almost anything else
fat-free has not been pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The mayonnaise against which all these brands were compared was
Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise, because of its consistent ranking as
the best seller. Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise has 100 calories and 11
grams of fat a tablespoon. (Out of curiosity, I also tried Walnut
Acres All Natural mayonnaise, which contains 17 grams of fat, just
to see if it tasted better than Hellmann's. It did.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, but not always, the greater the amount of fat and
calories in a mayonnaise, the better the taste. But in my test
there were several pleasant surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Hellmann's Light, with 50 calories and 5 grams of fat, was quite
acceptable and Bright Day Dressing, made without a single egg yolk
and containing only 60 calories and 6 grams of fat, made up for its
lack of fat with a good dose of vinegar and mustard that gave it a
decent flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Some flaws that are obvious in lower-fat mayonnaises when they
are tasted ``straight'' largely disappear when they are mixed with
other ingredients that often go into salads like lemon juice,
mustard, pickle relish or capers, or if they are mixed with
flavorful herbs like thyme, basil, dill or tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   A simple way to reduce the fat and calories in full-fat
mayonnaise without seriously disturbing the taste is to mix half
mayonnaise and half plain low-fat yogurt. Only the most flavorful
mayonnaises are suitable for this adjustment, which also produces a
more saucelike mixture.
</P>
<P>
   In flavor, the best of the 13 was the Ojai Cook Lemonaise with
90 calories and 9 grams of fat. That is not much of a reduction
from full-fat Hellmann's, but because of its sharp flavor from
lemon juice, Dijon mustard, cayenne pepper and garlic, this tangy
alternative is just delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the price difference is huge: an 8-ounce of jar
of Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise is $1.35 while a 10-ounce jar of
Lemonaise is around $5. And worth every penny. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In search of an alternative to full-fat, high-calorie
mayonnaise, I sampled 13 varieties that had fewer calories and fat
than the benchmark brand, Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise, which has 100
calories and 11 grams of fat a tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hellmann's is not the best mayonnaise on the market as far as
taste goes, but it has a creamy, pleasant, slightly sharp taste.
Among all mayonnaises, it is consistently the best seller. An
8-ounce jar costs about $1.35.
</P>
<P>
   To rank the lower-fat mayonnaises, each was sampled
``straight,'' then on a bit of white bread, then mixed with canned
tuna, Dijon mustard, capers and sweet pickle relish.
</P>
<P>
   The best-tasting mayonnaises, those ranked in the first tier,
ranged from delicious to acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In the second tier, the mayonnaises were acceptable only when
mixed with the tuna and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   In the third tier, there was no way to redeem the unappealing
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   In the ranking that follows, the mayonnaises in the first and
second tier are listed by preference; the third tier is in
alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   When mixed half and half with plain low-fat yogurt, the
mayonnaises in the first tier were still quite good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First Tier &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Oaji Cook Lemonaise 90 calories, 9 grams fat a tablespoon.
Tangy, gutsy, flecked with whole-grain mustard seeds; only real
ingredients used; 10 ounces, $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   Hellmann's Light Mayonnaise 50 calories, 5 grams fat. Good
texture, slightly less tart than Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise; 32
ounces, $3.59.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Day Dressing 60 calories, 6 grams fat. Stiffer texture,
pleasant very tart-sweet taste; 16 ounces, $2.99.

DESPITE INCIDENTS, SCHOOL VIOLENCE REMAINS STEADY IN RECENT YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: For release at 6 a.m. EDT Wednesday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around
the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady
since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively
safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice
think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a
media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington
and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does
not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention
and resources.''
</P>
<P>
   JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile
violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to
track it down, you're looking wrong place. School is about as safe
a place as you can put your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school
year, the report said. A year earlier there were 25. But In the
1992-1993 school year, 55 shooting deaths occurred. In 1993-1994
there were 51, followed by 20 in 1994-1995 and 35 in 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year
over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase
``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993
and 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
   The report relied on data from the U.S. Education Department,
the Justice Department, the FBI, nongovernment groups that track
school violence and newspaper clippings. It defined deadly school
violence as killings of adults as well as children on school
property.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it counted the May 1998 shooting of a speech
diagnostician by her jealous boyfriend at Stranahan High School in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over school violence reached its apogee in March when
two boys, aged 13 and 11, opened fire on a crowd of children and
teachers in Jonesboro, Ark. Four students and one teacher died in
the hail of bullets. Similar incidents during the 1997-1998 school
year occurred in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.;
and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Many news outlets referred to each shooting as ``an
all-too-familiar story'' or ``another in a recent trend,'' the JPI
report said. Members of Congress and other officials ``reacted
abruptly to what they perceived to be a huge swing in public
opinion,'' the report continued, adding: ``A moral panic swept the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has endorsed pending legislation to increase
the number of police officers available to deal with juvenile
crime. Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a Republican, suggested
reducing the number of nighttime scholastic sporting events and
after-school programs as a way of lowering the chance of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Local school administrators also reacted. Two elementary school
students in Tyrone, Ga., were temporarily suspended for pinpointing
those they wanted to do away with, a list that included Barney the
purple dinosaur and the British singing group, Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   The report called all these reactions ``overblown.'' It said
that ``everyday gun violence'' against children is a far more
pressing concern. More than 3,000 children a year die from gunfire,
said the report, quoting figures from the U.S. National Center for
Health Statistics. Children are killed in gun accidents at 23 times
the rate they are killed in schools, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively flat trend-line noted in the report appeared to
be in line with data from other sources. The FBI, for instance,
reported there were 25 homicides committed by juveniles under 13 in
1965 and 16 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-year study between 1992 and 1994, the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention found that students had less
than a one in a million chance of dying violently in school. By
contrast, the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Program in 1997 calculated that overall, for every
million juveniles, 38 were murdered that year. That's 40 times the
rate for deaths in schools, the JPI report said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's study encouraged continuation of after-school
programs as a way of ``productively occupying'' children. It also
recommended gun restrictions, including the ``one-gun-a-month''
laws that limit the quantities of guns an individual can purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the conservative Criminal
Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., said the flat
school violence trendline noted in the report ``doesn't mean a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although down overall in recent years, crime and violence in and
out of school remains significantly higher than it was 40 years
ago, he said.

`PARK RANGERS' GET IN THE ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just a couple of years ago, Trey Parker and Matt
Stone were living in a run-down dump on Santa Monica Boulevard,
about five feet from a freeway on-ramp, contending with fungus
infestations and wondering how to turn five bucks into two or three
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't going quite as planned since they left Boulder
and their friends at the University of Colorado for Bigger Things
in Los Angeles. They got an agent at William Morris on the strength
of a short titled ``Cannibal: The Musical,'' but they could never
get him to return their phone calls. They had an idea for a cartoon
series about a bunch of foul-mouthed, mixed-up third-graders, but
the networks passed. Some TV executives offered encouragement,
others were blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Fox told us `South Park' would never work,''
says Stone, who at age 27 is younger than Parker by a year. ``They
told us we'd better find a new line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, work is the last thing Parker and Stone need. In
fact, it's all they can do to hang out in a bar once a month and
have a beer. ``South Park,'' which airs on Comedy Central and
picked up an Emmy nomination for best animated program, is a
certified cultural phenomenon that will soon spawn a record album
(coming in the fall) and a feature film for Paramount (due next
March). The two also star in David Zucker's new comedy,
``BASEketball,'' more or less playing themselves, as a couple of
loser dudes who stumble onto a national obsession. Parker's
directorial feature debut, ``Orgazmo,'' will arrive in theaters
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Comedy Central has renewed ``South Park''
through the year 2001 (``We could drop 300 percent in the ratings
and still be their highest-rated show,'' Stone says), which means
that Stone and Parker will spend a good, solid year working on
nothing but new songs for Chef and new ways to kill poor little
Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the idea of this much `South Park' is a little scary,
but what's even scarier is the idea of not doing it,'' Parker says.
``The idea of Cartman not being alive ... you create these lives
and it's frightening to think of them ending.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds a tad sentimental from a guy who gave the world
alien rectal probes and sexually confused family pets, it's
perfectly in character. Parker and Stone look like the merry
pranksters that they are _ Parker with his baggy, plaid pants and
bottle-blond hair, Stone with his crazy, broccoli-top mane and
wrap-around glasses. But dig a little deeper and you actually find
a couple of intelligent, quiet and _ could it be? _ thoughtful guys
who are virtual encyclopedias of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been envious of the guys that had Jim Carrey and
Eddie Murphy before they became hot, and now I feel I got lucky
with Trey and Matt,'' says ``BASEketball'' director David Zucker.
``For every gag in the movie, they had dozens of different ideas.
And if we didn't have a gag, they would come up with one.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone recently gave their takes on comedy in the
'90s, the ``South Park'' movie and the fallout from their
big-screen kiss. And unlike their cartoon kids, they didn't break
wind once during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Word has it that you battled Paramount to make sure the
``South Park'' movie would get an R.
</P>
<P>
   Parker: Oh yeah, it's in the contract. Otherwise we told them
we'd raise the money ourselves or go to another studio.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did they raise a fuss?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: They were bringing out charts and graphs, giving us the
whole dog-and-pony show about how much more money we'd make if it
was PG-13. But we don't need the money. The difference between $1
million and $15 million isn't that important.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: It's much more important to us to keep ``South Park''
cool and be excited about doing the movie. Besides, the way
television is going these days, a PG-13 movie would be tamer than a
TV-MA show. If we put some of the ``South Parks'' on film and gave
them to the MPAA, they'd probably rate them R. So what are we going
to do, go backward?
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what can we expect from an R-rated ``South Park'' movie?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: There are lots of things we still can't do on TV. We had
a whole episode we wanted to do about language and how ridiculous
it is that people get upset just because you use the F-word.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: And there are other places that Comedy Central won't let
us go only because of fear for our lives. Like making fun of the
Nation of Islam. They wouldn't let us do that, even though we've
made fun of Christianity and Judaism. They're like, ``No, no, no.
We have a $1 million investment in you guys _ and you can't die.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker: It's just going to be a more epic version of the show.
It's cool because we're not two animators who have only done TV. We
come from a feature background, so we can make a story sustain
itself for 90 minutes. It's going to have a whole different
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything you won't do?
</P>
<P>
   Stone: We have an absurd view of everything. And you can't start
picking and choosing your targets. But both Trey and I grew up in
good homes, and our parents are still married, so we come to the
humor from a good place and treat everyone with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Parker: And then we just turn that on its (rear).
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``BASEketball'' follows ``There's Something About Mary.''
Both are rated R. Both are often pretty gross. Are we seeing a sea
change in comedy here?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: I think it's going to start a trend. Studios are going
to open their eyes and see the money that can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: The problem is we just had all these bland comedies for
so many years. I think there's a place for PG comedies, but for a
long time, because of the PG-13 rating, studios wanted everything
to be brought down a little so they could make more money.
</P>
<P>
   Parker: Yeah, and if you look at a lot of the great comedies _
``Blazing Saddles,'' ``Animal House,'' ``Stripes,'' ``Caddyshack''
_ they were all rated R. Because that's what comedy is all about _
pushing people's buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: A classic example is ``Liar, Liar,'' which could have
been a movie for forever and instead, maybe because of Jim Carrey's
price tag, they had to bland it down. Yes, it was successful. But
it was a truly forgettable movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the big kiss between the two of you in ``BASEketball''
part of pushing people's buttons?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: Totally. Now there's no way people can come out of this
movie and think, ``Oh, that was just a frat movie, a T&AMP;A piece.''
The kiss just dispels that.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: It just blows people's minds. And it totally sucked to
do. It was the worst thing. My stomach was tied in a great, big
knot. They gave us this great big thing of Listerine and we both
just chugged it. And my dad was on the set that day, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maybe you should have stuck to kissing Yasmine Bleeth or
Jenny McCarthy?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: That's what was originally in the script. But we wanted
to take a macho step down from that. Like in this movie we made
about a guy in the porn industry, ``Orgazmo,'' there's no female
nudity in it. Otherwise, it becomes just another Showtime (T&AMP;A)
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: It's kind of a dangerous concept. That's why we're trying
to get the word out about it. Otherwise, you're going to have all
these guys rioting who showed up at a movie called ``Orgazmo''
looking for flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you want to avoid a repeat of the time when you promised
to reveal the identity of Cartman's father on ``South Park,'' and
then failed to deliver?
</P>
<P>
   Parker: The reaction to that was amazing. We couldn't believe
it. People tune in to ``South Park'' because they're into rebellion
and breaking the rules, and then we break our own rules and they
get pissed off.
</P>
<P>
   Stone: That's the thing. We would love that if someone did that
to us. And people were like: ``Kenny didn't die. Chef didn't sing.
So it SUCKED!!!'' We fell victim to people feeling comfortable in
the ``South Park'' universe.

EVEN AS '90s REMAKE, `PARENT TRAP' IDEA WORKS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In a summer marked by the nuclear-powered
vulgarity of ``There's Something About Mary'' and the harrowing
brutality of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Disney's almost
pathologically innocuous remake of ``The Parent Trap'' is sure to
seem like some kind of relief.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, to an extent. Thoroughly undemanding, yet made with
enormous care and commitment by director Nancy Meyers and her
producer husband, Charles Shyer, ``Parent Trap'' is a reassuring
re-enactment of the eternally popular 1961 family comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the parts that remind you of another deathless,
early-'60s movie: ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an iffy proposition back then that a mother and father
would split up upon the birth of their twins, each flee with one
infant to different sides of the continent and never let either
girl know of their other parent or sister's existence. Thirty-seven
years and quantum leaps in child-development studies later, such a
premise not only seems hard to buy, but downright appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, oddly enough, this creepy idea prevents the movie from
wallowing in preteen empowerment pablum. Of course, Meyers and
Shyer refuse to address the queasy question in any direct way _
these are the folks who brought us those ``Father of the Bride''
remakes, and they appear to be constitutionally incapable of
visualizing anything that doesn't evoke (let alone challenge) a
sense of leisure-class comfort. But whenever the movie's mushy
romantics or repetitive, ``which-one-is-it-now'' twin jokes wear
thin, at least there's an interesting space for your mind to wander
to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not a movie meant to inspire thought. Like
David Swift's original, this ``Parent Trap'' is about feelings, and
darn powerful ones. The discovery of someone just like you, putting
a broken family back together, finding a dream dad/mom (well,
except for the total abandonment part) out of thin air _ these are
wish-fulfillment fantasies any child can take to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Shyer and Meyers have increased the geographical stakes here _
mom Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) and her half, Annie, live in
England, while dad Nick (Dennis Quaid) and his daughter, Hallie,
own a Napa Valley winery _ but they're otherwise remarkably
faithful to Swift's original.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, played by Lindsay Lohan with state-of-the-art digital
assists Hayley Mills never dreamed of, accidentally meet at summer
camp, take an immediate dislike to one another, then are thrilled
to discover the truth. When summer ends, Hallie heads to London
with a newly minted accent, and Annie goes West with an
appropriately American tomboy 'do.
</P>
<P>
   Both exult in fooling the parents they've never known while just
dying over how cool they turn out to be (Elizabeth is an ultra-hip
wedding gown designer _ is such a job possible? _ and Nick is
something of a cowboy). But there's a hitch: Nick's being vamped by
an evil publicist (Elaine Hendrix), and if the second phase of the
grand plan _ getting the folks, whose reasons for breaking up in
the first place are never made clear, back together _ is going to
work, the girls better act quick. Warmth and farce ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Although her visual capabilities are generally those of an
interior decorator, Meyers uses computer technology to seamless,
though hardly eye-popping, effect whenever Lohan has to act with
herself. And the young actress does a terrific job, maintaining
energy and comic timing throughout what must have been a tedious
and demanding process. Quaid and Richardson are as likable as can
be, too, without getting too sappy about it. Lisa Ann Walter and
Simon Kunz provide a few laughs as enthusiastically supportive
servants.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, really pleasant family fun, fundamentally demented
as it may be. But maybe that's just the '90s talking. Perhaps the
upcoming remake of ``Psycho'' will seem like a story about an
especially close, mother-son relationship where the wacky high
jinks just got a little out of hand.

`THE NEGOTIATOR' WALKS TIGHTROPE BETWEEN TALK AND ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars. 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine a chess game among savages and you've got
``The Negotiator,'' a movie that often builds interest and suspense
only to deflate it by inserting some big, dumb piece of violence
that's completely unnecessary to the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers are trying to sell this movie as an intelligent,
character-driven piece _ a breath of fresh air for those looking to
escape some of the season's more mindless fare. Unfortunately,
``The Negotiator'' too often resorts to the same contrivances,
cliches and overblown atmospherics that characterize summer movies.
Trying to please everyone, it ends up satisfying no one and, in the
process, wastes a couple of terrific star turns by Samuel L.
Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' begins promisingly enough, introducing us to
Chicago's top hostage negotiator, Danny Roman (Jackson), by showing
him in his element. Roman thinks nothing of risking his own life
and talks his way into an apartment where a deranged father is
holding his daughter hostage. The tense situation is quickly and
nimbly defused, and Roman finds himself in a familiar place _ as
the lead story on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   The headlines aren't so good later on, though, as Roman stands
wrongfully accused of some pretty heinous crimes. Hours before
being hauled off to jail, Roman storms up to the 20th floor of the
Internal Affairs headquarters and confronts his accusers. Push
comes to shove, guns are drawn, and, before you know it, the famous
hostage negotiator has taken a few hostages of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Roman doesn't want to hurt anybody. He just wants to
clear his name. And it's convenient that among his captives are a
secretary with expert knowledge of the Internal Affairs computer
files and a petty thief whose specialty is electronic fraud. To buy
time, Roman demands to deal with another well-known hostage
negotiator, Chris Sabian (Spacey), a man famous for smooth-talking
criminals into releasing their prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Director F. Gary Gray (``Set It Off'') comes up with some clever
ways to couple the two negotiators, men adept at mind games and
truth-bending. But instead of trusting his premise and his actors
(not to mention his audience), Gray and screenwriters James
DeMonaco and Kevin Fox resort to stunts and explosions straight out
of ``Die Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   There are far too many genre cliches on display, too _ the
seething media onslaught, the wailing sirens, the omnipresent
helicopters, the rotting paranoia about authority. All these
elements culminate in an inflated, contrived ending that reduces
much of the good will that the movie had worked hard to establish.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, too, if Jackson and Spacey had something more
to work with than stock characters, although, to their credit, they
bring conviction and passion to their performances. The late J.T.
Walsh is also on hand, playing Roman's Internal Affairs adversary
with the requisite mixture of aloofness and vile behavior.

CLASSIC IBSEN TALE GETS NEW FLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Henrik Ibsen often is thought of as a grumpy
Norwegian who wrote impenetrably gloomy plays about social
hyprocrisy and emotional repression.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's time to think again. In Trevor Nunn's enthralling new
production of ``An Enemy of the People,'' Ibsen comes off as
practically the flashiest playwright this side of Andrew Lloyd
Webber, whose ``Cats'' and ``Sunset Boulevard'' Nunn took to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the opening scene of this relentlessly kinetic effort
by Britain's Royal National Theatre company, which opened last week
at the Ahmanson Theatre. Almost before we've found our seats, some
40 actors sweep us into a bustling panorama of a 19th-century
coastal Norwegian village. Fishermen barter, businessmen gossip,
and a brass band wends its way through the whole mercantilist mob.
</P>
<P>
   The procession makes an apt metaphor for Ibsen's great theme:
Fall in line with the masses, or prepare to suffer the
consequences. Pity men like Dr. Tomas Stockmann, the play's
quixotic hero, who insist on marching to their own offbeat
drummers.
</P>
<P>
   But is Stockmann (Ian McKellen) ultimately a victim of
uncompromising integrity or monumental hubris? Does he deserve to
be treated as a savior or a pariah for discovering that the town's
lucrative spa baths are being poisoned by industrial waste _ then
going noisily public with the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Among this production's many virtues is that it leaves those
questions ajar, making you squirm for answers. Working with
Christopher Hampton's sinewy new translation, and a flat-out
excellent cast, director Nunn has retooled Ibsen's wordy
contraption into a supple cinematic drama. Like John Napier's set
design _ a rotating Rubik's cube that reassembles itself into a
house, a print shop and a meeting hall _ this production generates
nonstop excitement and tension from its shifting moods and
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The engine driving the whole thing is McKellen's spry, funny,
expertly measured performance as Stockmann, a man with the moral
rectitude of an Old Testament prophet and the political acumen of a
petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   In Arthur Miller's Cold War-era translation, Stockmann became a
stand-in for Joe McCarthy's Red Scare victims, a towering martyr
surrounded by moral pygmies. But that's only half the character.
McKellen gives us the other half, showing not only Stockmann's
courage but his vanity and naivete in thinking the townspeople are
going to reward him for killing their golden goose.
</P>
<P>
   When Stockmann finds that the local water supply is crawling
with bacteria, he's far too pleased with himself to break the news
gently to his brother Peter (Stephen Moore), the town's ruthlessly
pragmatic mayor. Twitching, rolling his eyes maniacally, unable to
sit still for more than five seconds, McKellen's Stockmann is
spacy, impractical, perverse _ in truth, perhaps, a little
unbalanced. He's the polar opposite of his brother, a drably
authoritarian bureaucrat who could pass for a Soviet commissar.
Moore's crusty, embittered portrayal, however, is every bit as
impressive as McKellen's more flamboyant turn.
</P>
<P>
   The large supporting cast is faultless, particularly Pip Donaghy
as the wary printer Aslaksen, Paul Higgins as a would-be radical
newspaper editor who crumbles in the face of economic expediency,
and Charlotte Cornwell, delivering a wise, gently resigned
performance as Stockmann's loyal, long-suffering wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Enemy of the People'' starts off bumpily, mostly because
Nunn insists on letting the dialogue flow forward in brisk,
naturalistic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But once the tempo settles down, Nunn's method yields some
spectacular payoffs, such as the Act 2 opening scene in which
Stockmann publicly confronts his accusers. Instantly, the Ahmanson
is transformed into an angry meeting hall, complete with hecklers
shouting threats from the aisles and an undercurrent of violent
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to imagine a similar scene occurring at Love
Canal, Chernobyl or anyplace else where the first casualty of
politics is truth. Still kicking and screaming at age 116, ``An
Enemy of the People'' presents a view of cringing civic conformity
that, sadly, still feels all too timely.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a three-month search for a new director, the
Whitney Museum of American Art has appointed Maxwell Anderson, the
director of the Art Gallery of Ontario. Anderson, who has spent
three years in that post, succeeds David Ross, who resigned in
March to become director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 42, who begins his new job in September, has been
chosen to bring a more scholarly approach to exhibitions and
programs at the Whitney than Ross did, said Joel Ehrenkranz,
president of the board and chairman of the search committee that
selected Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone to bring a serious perspective to
our programs,'' Ehrenkranz said. ``Max understands the balance of
our programs, both historic and contemporary. I think what he will
bring is a scholarly understanding to the importance of
contemporary art.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson seems less likely to mount shows like ``Black Male:
Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art'' or a
show devoted to the fashion photographer Richard Avedon,
exhibitions in 1994 that were attacked by critics as being trendy.
Earlier this month, the museum announced cancellation of ``The
Great American Nude,'' a show of visual and performance art, that
had been scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes three months after the Whitney unveiled a
$30 million renovation and expansion that includes new galleries,
the first dedicated to the permanent collection of the 67-year-old
museum. With these new quarters, Whitney officials say, they are
trying to balance the institution's reputation for venturesome
shows with a greater emphasis on art of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a tradition of writing and thinking about American
identity,'' said Anderson, grandson of the playwright Maxwell
Anderson and son of Quentin Anderson, a professor of American
literature at Columbia University for nearly 40 years. ``At the
Whitney I am hoping to help define the character of American art in
a more international arena.''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Anderson graduated from Dartmouth College
and earned a Ph.D. in fine arts from Harvard University. For six
years, until 1987, he worked in the department of Greek and Roman
art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1995, he was the director of the Michael C. Carlos
Museum at Emory University in Atlanta, where he oversaw the
museum's expansion by Michael Graves.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto,
Anderson increased its collections, expanded its special
exhibitions program and increased revenues significantly during a
period of government cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney appointment was voted by the board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his mission would be at the Whitney, Anderson said he
wanted to ``get great works of art in front of the public and help
them understand what they are seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for acquisitions, he said he wanted the Whitney to increase
its holdings of Abstract Expressionist masters while remaining open
to some risk-taking collecting of works by emerging artists. &QL;

FESTIVAL RESULTS PLEASE LINCOLN CENTER OFFICIALS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Relieved that their third summer arts festival has
survived its pre-opening calamity _ the last-minute cancellation of
a centerpiece production of a revered 19-hour Chinese opera _
Lincoln Center officials began this week to assess the damage and
look ahead to the next two scheduled festivals and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For the 20-day Lincoln Center Festival '98, which was perhaps
more notable for what was not performed than what was, the
experiment in luring younger audiences with unconventional works
from all over the world fell into a pattern established by the two
prior Lincoln Center Festivals: a mixed bag of critical successes
and flops and a decidedly last-minute audience, which sent
organizers into paroxysms of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a nail-biter,'' Nathan Leventhal, the president of
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the delicate business of mixing adventurous but risky,
way-out offerings with bankable but predictable crowd-pleasers, the
1998 program balanced the lurid weirdness of a cybernetic (and
negatively reviewed) ``Faust'' from Barcelona with an elegantly
star-studded (and far better received) production of ``Twelfth
Night,'' programs dedicated to Leonard Bernstein, and two plays by
the Gesher Theater of Tel Aviv intended to draw New York's large
Jewish and Russian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal and Beverly Sills, the chairman, said that as a matter
of policy they would not disclose financial and attendance figures
for the festival, which ended on Sunday. But they said that the
majority of the 99 performances of 20 program events met or
exceeded their box office projections. They declined to say which
fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one happy guy,'' Leventhal said in an interview. But he
acknowledged, ``I lost 10 years off my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured by the Mohawk index, it was a success, said Nigel
Redden, the festival's director, who was formally designated only
last month. ``I have not seen that many Mohawk haircuts ever at
Lincoln Center,'' said Redden. The successor to John Rockwell, who
returned to The New York Times as editor of the Arts and Leisure
section, Redden also serves as general manager of the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the thwarted attraction _ ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a
400-year-old kunqu opera, abruptly bottled up in Shanghai _
remained unclear, along with Lincoln Center's chances of recouping
its investment in the opera of close to $400,000. That includes its
$180,000 share of the creation costs plus about $200,000 in labor
and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll write it off for now,'' said Leventhal, citing expected
surpluses from other operations.
</P>
<P>
   Redden, who held cliffhanger, face-to-face talks with the
resistant director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture
until the very eve of the opera's scheduled opening on July 7, said
he hoped it could be brought to New York next summer. Lincoln
Center's three co-producers of ``Peony Pavilion,'' arts festivals
in Paris, Hong Kong and Sydney, have their own performances
scheduled and are now expected to take the lead in negotiations
with the bureau's director, Ma Bomin.
</P>
<P>
   Faulting the production, which is directed by Chen Shi-Zheng,
for supposed elements of pornography, superstition and feudalism,
Ms. Bomin embargoed the company of 21 actors and 15 musicians,
although the set, costumes and props were released. Efforts to
reach accommodation failed and, Ms. Sills said, even a call by
Henry A. Kissinger to the mayor of Shanghai proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion,'' rarely, if ever, performed in its
entirety in the last few centuries, was to have highlighted the
opening of the festival with episodes spread over the first six
nights. It was to have been repeated in a three-night marathon the
second week. Ticket holders were offered a refund or the chance to
exchange their seats for any other production. Nothing else was
substituted in the scheduled venue, the theater of the Fiorello H.
La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, and
two Lincoln Center symposiums on the opera were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster, no question about that,'' Ms. Sills said.
Still, ``it called attention to the fact that the festival was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more acclaimed highlights of the season were two
evocations of the Holocaust, the Gesher Theater's mock-circus
production of ``Adam Resurrected,'' and the Theatre de Complicite's
London production of ``The Street of Crocodiles,'' based on the
hallucinatory stories of a murdered writer, Bruno Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Also well received were the Stuttgart Ballet's first
reappearance in New York in 19 years, the complete organ works of
Johann Sebastian Bach (although often played to moderate audiences
in Alice Tully Hall), and ``Patience and Sarah,'' the world
premiere of a folk opera about a pioneering lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous festivals, the New York Philharmonic drew often
disappointing crowds, perhaps because the orchestra performs
regularly at Lincoln Center. Still, as part of a politic effort to
include its constituents in its summer festival, the Philharmonic
has already been booked for next year's festival, organizers said.
In the same way, the festival underwrote part of Lincoln Center
Theater's production of ``Twelfth Night,'' which continues a
regular run now that the festival is over.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics assailed the American premiere of Krzysztof
Penderecki's oratorio ``Seven Gates of Jerusalem'' and the
cyberspace ``Faust,'' ``Faust, Version 3.0,'' by La Fura dels Baus.
The mixed-media Spanish production, performed in the New York State
Theater, was the first festival offering ever to bear a warning
label of unsuitability for minors. Leventhal insisted he enjoyed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a vivid presentation,'' he said, adding, `I'm not
saying it was my favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival employed some new marketing tools,
including the sale of various ``passports'' for discounts and
better seating. One version, the ``Diplomat'' passport, which for
$100 offered access to prime full-price seats within 48 hours of a
performance, went so quickly that its sale was capped at 300, weeks
before the festival's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Although no figures were released, Leventhal said the festival
would be within budget this year, ``which was not the case last
year.'' Started on a budget of $8.5 million, of which $5.5 million
was to be raised from benefactors, the festival ballooned to
considerably above that, with some of the box office deficit later
offset by production savings. This year is expected to be closer to
the original figure.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal and Ms. Sills said that although the board had only
authorized the festival through the 2000 season, they considered a
longer future likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a chore to raise the money,'' Ms. Sills said.
``Here we have three or four of the most beautiful theaters in the
U.S. They should stay dark in the summer?''

<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

JAPANESE CONTINUE PROBE OF FESTIVAL POISONINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Police in Wakayama continued Tuesday to investigate the
mystery surrounding a mass poisoning that left four people dead
Saturday after they had eaten at a festival.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Wakayama Prefecture police said although
investigators strongly believed that cyanide had been deliberately
introduced into curry at the festival, they could not rule out the
possibility that the food was accidentally tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The four victims died within hours after the curry had been
served. Forty-two others remained hospitalized. An additional 21
were treated at hospitals for symptoms of cyanide ingestion and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dead, Takatoshi Taninaka, 65, and Takaaki Tanaka, 53,
were officers in the community association that had organized the
festival. The other two fatalities were a 10-year-old boy and
16-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer Japan comes alive with festivals, as city
dwellers return to their hometowns to celebrate Obon, a Buddhist
holiday that honors the spirits of dead ancestors.
</P>

   The Wakayama poisoning promises to put a damper on the season
this year, with some municipalities going so far as to cancel their
festival plans, according to the Japanese press.

<P>
   Although the apparent randomness of the incident recalled the
poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway system three years ago,
masterminded by the Aum Shinrikyo cult, the police spokesman said
the authorities did not suspect the involvement of any religious
group.
</P>
<P>
   Police have learned of disputes between the local community
association and other community associations, as well as within the
sponsoring association. But the spokesman said there did not appear
to be any conflict serious enough to lead to an act like poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Police are grappling with odd strands of information. The curry
was made in two large pots in a resident's garage and a smaller pot
at another house before the festival, police said. The organizers
sampled the food at noon before taking it to the festival grounds.
</P>
<P>
   After people who had eaten the curry became violently ill, some
curry was left in the smaller pot and one of the large pots, but
there was no trace of cyanide in the leftover food. The other large
pot had been cleaned after the curry in it had been served.
</P>
<P>
   Police found traces of cyanide in a nearby sewer and have
speculated that it was, perhaps, washed out of the second large
pot.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, more than 100 small fish were found floating
dead in a stream near rice paddies in the festival area, and the
police are conducting autopsies on the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Cyanide is a deadly and fast-acting poison. Ingestion of a trace
causes extreme nausea in 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The festival poisoning was not the first incident of random
cyanide poisoning in Japan. In 1977 two high school students died
after having picked up a can of soda in a telephone booth and
sharing it. The soda was laced with cyanide. The case was not
solved.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases of attempted extortion cyanide has been found
injected in foods like chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous case of cyanide poisoning was in 1948,
when a man pretending to be a health officer killed 12 bank
employees while claiming to be checking for dysentery.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerry Herman has often said that one of the places he
is happiest is at the keyboard, and that, naturally, is where he
can be found throughout most of ``An Evening With Jerry Herman,''
the no-frills retrospective of his career as a Broadway composer
that opened Tuesday night at the Booth Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by his friends Florence Lacey and Lee Roy Reams, who have
both appeared in his musicals, and playing many of his most famous
songs from ``Hello, Dolly!'' ``Mame,'' ``Milk and Honey'' and ``La
Cage Aux Folles,'' as well as several lesser-known numbers from
``Dear World,'' ``Mack and Mabel'' and ``The Grand Tour,'' Herman
spends an amiable couple of hours savoring his hits and mourning
his flops. The production is not unlike those award-show tributes _
including the mock-ups of the marquees from the old shows floating
down from the ceiling _ except in this case, the honoree is the
host of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   With the two men in tuxedos and Ms. Lacey wearing the kind of
form-fitting sequined cocktail dresses that once seemed fashionable
in the lobbies of the Fountainebleau or Eden Roc in Miami Beach,
the show is tailored to the specifications of another era in the
theater, the one during which Herman reigned as one of Broadway's
top tunesmiths. The era has passed, as the 66-year-old composer
keeps reminding us _ he hasn't had a new show on Broadway since the
Tony-winning ``La Cage'' opened in 1983 _ and much of ``An Evening
With Jerry Herman'' is bound up, a bit mustily, in memorializing
that period and the names that typified its glamour: Merman,
Channing, Merrick, Sardi.
</P>
<P>
   The evening evokes the age of the well-made song, a time when
``Broadway musical'' meant musical comedy and featured the sort of
character, comedy and statement songs at which Herman excelled,
numbers like ``Before the Parade Passes By'' and ``Bosom Buddies''
and ``If He Walked Into My Life.'' Throughout the show, Herman
tells brief tales about how this musical or that came into being,
and if these events hadn't really happened _ he says the producer
David Merrick hired him to write the score for ``Hello, Dolly!''
with the Winchellesque blessing ``Kid, the show is yours!'' _ they
certainly would have wound up as subjects of some Jerry Herman
Hey-world-get-outta-my-way-type production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The revue, directed by Reams, is an outgrowth of a cabaret act
he devised with Herman at Rainbow and Stars in 1989 and that they
have intermittently taken on the road. It remains a cabaret act and
will probably be most affectionately embraced by people who enjoyed
Herman's musicals and maybe even have held on to the old vinyl cast
albums. His shows brimmed with goodwill toward the Broadway of
Berlin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and I was hoping ``An Evening With
Jerry Herman'' would recapture some of his bountiful sense of _
well, to use two Jerry Herman-sounding words _ class and pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   It may have them for you, but I found the revue waxen on the big
stage, even a stage as intimate by Broadway standards as the
Booth's. The 28 songs, written from the 1960s to the early '80s,
show off Herman's considerable skills as a lyricist; the words mold
to the musical phrases like Saran Wrap. The show also reconfirms
his status as Broadway's leading proponent of carpe diem: Song
after song, from ``It's Today'' (``Mame'') to ``Hello, Dolly!'' to
``The Best of Times'' (``La Cage''), promises that ``this very
minute has history in it'' or ``Tomorrow will be brighter than the
good old days'' or pleads with us to ``hold this moment fast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sentiment may be paper thin, but it is genuine. Yet what
makes it hard to receive in the same spirit is Reams' underwhelming
presentation of the material. For example, his shuffle-and-swivel
choreography seems as out of style as a restaurant that still
serves salads of iceberg lettuce; it lends a worn-out air to the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially unfortunate in a show in which the star
player continually draws attention to his feelings of not always
having been fully appreciated; after the phenomenal success of
``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Mame'' in the '60s, Herman's next several
shows got disappointing receptions from critics and audiences, and
it wasn't until the blockbuster ``La Cage'' that the composer felt
a sense of popular redemption. He still appears hurt and angry at
the failure of ``Mack and Mabel,'' for example, and the weary tones
in which he describes his black decade, the '70s, puts an
unnecessary damper on things; every show, after all, can't be a
juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, Reams and Ms. Lacey take us chronologically through the
composer's work, and it's Ms. Lacey, the most accomplished stylist,
who has most of the memorable moments. Her renditions of ``I Don't
Want to Know'' (a personal manifesto in waltz tempo from ``Dear
World'') and ``I Belong Here'' (a soothing sigh from ``The Grand
Tour'') are delicate and touching, as is her smooth handling of
``Song on the Sand'' from ``La Cage.'' She's not much fun, though,
which makes her a mismatch for Reams, who is loosest in comic songs
like ``Penny in My Pocket,'' a number for the miserly Horace
Vandergelder that was cut from ``Hello, Dolly!'' (His piercing
tenor tends to overwhelm songs like ``It Only Takes a Moment'' that
cry out for a lighter touch.)
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 memoir, ``Showtune,'' Herman wrote that illness, the
death of a lover and a nagging sense that his kind of music had
gone out of fashion were among the reasons he stopped writing after
``La Cage.'' In the intervening years, contemporaries like Stephen
Sondheim and John Kander and Fred Ebb continued to churn out
musicals; what seems apparent is that they had far greater
capacities for responding to changing musical tastes and, perhaps,
farther-reaching musical talents.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the evening, Herman plays a song that he says
has become a personal anthem: ``I'll Be Here Tomorrow,'' from ``The
Grand Tour.'' ``I'll be here tomorrow/Alive and well and
thriving,'' the lyric begins. That he articulates it with such
conviction will thrill his fans.

BY BEING HONEST ABOUT VIOLENCE, SPIELBERG WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 2)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the landmark film event that is Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan'' opened last weekend to strong attendance
and critical cartwheels, it also set off a flurry of talk-show
trepidations.
</P>
<P>
   Worries spread about the violence level in this already famously
harrowing World War II epic. Was it too much to bear? A decent date
movie? Upsetting to veterans? In no time, this tour de force had
taken on the medicinal whiff of something punishing, instead of the
aura of so-called entertainment value that we associate with
``Armageddon,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``The Negotiator'' or ``Lethal
Weapon 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the U.S. Capitol, our notion of acceptable
violence raged out of control. In what sounded exactly like a
pistol-packing summer-movie scene, a man found his way to the
Rotunda, pulled out a concealed weapon and opened fire, mowing down
two guards as screaming tourists fled.
</P>
<P>
   This horrific event conformed so well to movie-style terrorism
that it became all the more shocking for its sense of deja vu. Real
life has hard acts to follow these days: what's one more shaky
skyscraper in midtown Manhattan after ``Godzilla''? What's a
gunfight at the Capitol when the White House has been incinerated
by spaceships and the Chrysler Building is Hollywood's favorite
punching bag?
</P>
<P>
   In a week that brought ``The Negotiator,'' another
hostage-crisis drama in which the apparent terrorist becomes an
instant celebrity and finds himself suddenly able to wield enormous
power, why should it be ``Saving Private Ryan'' that gives anyone
pause? Because Spielberg's war games are not played by the usual
rules, which means they don't offer the reassurance of playing
games at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the movie that thrills audiences with over-the-top
violence also creates its own buffer zone, protecting us from
uncertainty as it indicates when to be frightened, when to breathe
easy, where to find an above-the-title hero who can save the day.
Many of these films can match ``Saving Private Ryan'' for graphic
bloodshed, but it's more pernicious in a context of pure fantasy.
They kill off armies without eliciting a twitch.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``Starship Troopers,'' last year's super-violent
film in which cute earthling military units fought huge
extraterrestrial bugs, was a much more gruesome battle film than
Spielberg's. But it passed for light entertainment thanks to its
slavish pandering to teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Starship Troopers'' included
early in its story the casual sight of a military officer who is
missing a limb. In each case this served as a harbinger of the toll
taken by warfare, but for ``Starship Troopers'' that just meant a
hint at ugly, formulaic combat sequences featuring abundant
mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Without itself exploiting such misery, ``Saving Private Ryan''
is frank about what war does to the body and even more so about
what it does to the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's film has been widely admired for its breathtaking
D-Day sequence, which surpasses any known special effects in
immersing audiences into the fierce chaos of the battlefield. No
less astounding is its final showdown in a bombed-out French town,
as all of the film's dramatic and historic events fuse into a
crescendo of visceral terror.
</P>
<P>
   But within that second long section of the film, one episode
stands out as unforgettably as the shower scene from ``Psycho,'' a
brilliantly edited model of furious clarity and shattered audience
expectations. The incident has to do with a failure of nerve at a
crucial dramatic juncture, and it defines this film's way of
breaking through conventional storytelling into terra incognita. It
goes beyond the spectacle of killing, and even the immediate
experience of violence, to contemplate a fate worse than death.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to be gained from the core of bitter honesty in
this one episode than there is in watching the whole planet get
rescued to a rock-video beat, ``Armageddon''-style.
</P>
<P>
   And between those two films, incidentally, it's ``Saving Private
Ryan'' that has by far the greater entertainment value. While
everything about ``Armageddon,'' including its prettified violence,
hurtles forward on automatic pilot, and while its characters'
asteroid-sized triumphs are so inflated that they bear no
relationship to life on earth, ``Saving Private Ryan'' opens a
window onto real men in real turmoil and leaves us sharing every
nuance of their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can bombard viewers with gaudy, unrelated images and a
lot of noise, but it takes a storyteller of Spielberg's stature to
draw an audience so deeply, and so movingly, into the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It's that quality of the unfamiliar, and not the actual ravages
of war, that makes ``Saving Private Ryan'' so disturbing _ and also
so vital. Here's a film with no interest in reinforcing what we
already know. Nor does it care to keep us within the collective
Truman Show of toothless violence that constitutes most Hollywood
action fare. When real life imitates, or is shaped by, such
Hollywood ideas of bloodshed, the trigger-happy action genre leaves
us all the more stymied and bereft.
</P>
<P>
   The same films that feed fantasies of vicious omnipotence _ of
the gun in the Rotunda _ haven't a clue about the nature of real
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' does. That's why, for all its terrifying
candor, it is an inspiration and not an ordeal. It is Spielberg's
triumph this time to restore a sense of courage and sacrifice to a
medium in which boisterous, empty victories are all the rage, and
in which another kind of rage grows out of feeling cheated and
impoverished by such deceptions. This surfeit of cartoon blowhards
and fake conquests is junk food of the spirit. No wonder we yearn
for something better. No wonder the two most lingering words in
``Saving Private Ryan'' are ``Earn this.''

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; OFF THE BEATEN PATH &QL; 
 &UR; (North Point, $24)
</P>
<P>
   This is a collection of original short fiction created by some
of today's finest writers at the request of the Nature Conservancy.
Barbara Kingsolver tells in her introduction how it came about:
``In the hope of raising awareness, raising Cain, and raising money
with which to spare more wildlands from the blade, the editors
conceived this book. They called a dozen or so fiction writers and
issued an invitation: Visit one of the wild places the Conservancy
is working to protect (you get to choose which one), then go home
and write a story. The story need not be about anything that
happened during your visit, particularly. It need not even be about
the place you visited. Just see where the inspiration takes you.''
As Kingsolver notes,``this is not something we fiction writers hear
very often from editors and publishers,'' so most of them took the
bait. Included are Howard Norman, Jill McCorkle, Barry Lopez,
Gretel Ehrlich, Julia Alvarez, Rick Bass, Rita Mae Brown, David
James Duncan, Richard Bausch, Eric Lustbader, Larry Watson, Lee
Smith and Annie Proulx. Among the places that inspired them:
Montana's Blackfoot River, Alaska's Katmai Peninsula and the Ten
Sleep Preserve on the slopes of Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MR. MIKE: THE LIFE AND WORK OF MICHAEL O'DONOGHUE &QL; 
 &UR; Dennis Perrin (Avon, $25)
</P>
<P>
   As deaths go, Michael O'Donoghue's was dramatic. On Nov. 8,
1994, he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage, a misfortune, writes
Perrin, that ``mirrored somewhat the anatomy of his jokes: a swift
buildup to a violent finish.'' And then there was the wake, which
``New York'' magazine described as ``the hippest party in New
York,'' attended by friends O'Donoghue had made at ``National
Lampoon'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' (and a few enemies as well,
most notably Lorne Michaels and Chevy Chase). O'Donoghue's comedy
was lacerating, aggressive and all-inclusive. His life didn't just
touch people, said one friend. It (begin itals) stabbed (end itals)
them. Perhaps it's normal that some parts of this biography are
seriously overwritten as Perrin attempts to convey the spirit of
his subject. In death as in life, O'Donoghue is hard to take, an
assessment that probably would delight him. As Perrin says, ``the
only boundaries he acknowledged were his own.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A NEW KIND OF PARTY ANIMAL &QL; 
 &UR; Michele Mitchell (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is 27 and the youngest person to have written for
the editorial page of The New York Times, paints a flattering
portrait of the 18-to-35 age group that is at the center of a
national marketing blitz, is a collective political wild card and
has its elders scratching their heads and wondering what this
younger generation really wants. When all the generational analysis
began, Mitchell was just starting a job as a press secretary on
Capitol Hill. ``We weren't the first to be dissected in an attempt
to figure out what we would do with the country when we took
over,'' she says, but still it was insulting and often downright
silly. They don't vote? They don't read? They don't seem to know
how to dress? In debunking those insinuations (made by no less than
``Time'' magazine), Mitchell focuses on six factors that set her
contemporaries apart: their lack of party affiliation, their
interest in a range of issues, their grassroots-based approach to
problem-solving, their lack of gender bias, their skepticism of
marketing and advertising, and their computer savvy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE 50-YEAR DASH &QL; 
 &UR; Bob Greene (Doubleday, $11.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not exactly a guidebook for being 50,'' writes Greene.
``It's more like a companion volume to take along on a trip. It's
about all the things that 50 is about _ family, career, body,
money, sex, mortality; friendship, regrets, fears, memories,
doubts, dreams; angers, clothes, resentments, houses, parents,
fantasies; children, food, love, bosses, doctors, rivalry;
yearnings, sleep, employees, shoes, medicine, backaches; hope,
cars, lust, embarrassments, heartaches, horizons.'' Think he's left
himself enough room to move? Just to be safe he goes a step farther
and tells us that 50 is the age at which we will want to buy
birdbaths for our yards. Is this stretching things a bit? We think
so, have for years, but people keep buying his books anyway. This
one is new in paperback. Read it fast _ 60 is just around the
corner, and we know Greene is watching. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GOOD SCRIPTS, BAD SCRIPTS &QL; 
 &UR; Thomas Pope (Three Rivers, $14)
</P>
<P>
   As Pope was studying screenwriting (he has written screenplays
for ``The Lords of Discipline,'' ``Hammett'' and others) he
discovered that he learned as much from bad films as from good
ones. ``But when I asked why `The Jewel of the Nile' didn't work as
well as the original,'' he writes, ``why `Falling in Love' fell on
its face, why `Havana' was revolting, or why so many films simply
didn't work, all I got was a shrug and a smile.'' This book, he
says, is ``the Harvard Business School gone Hollywood,'' in which
he seeks to teach by example, good and bad. He discusses, among
others, ``The Abyss'' (that disaster of disaster films), ``Singin'
in the Rain,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``The Usual Suspects,'' ``Fargo,''
``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``Tender Mercies,'' ``The Day of
the Jackal,'' ``Chinatown'' and ``Groundhog Day.'' It's useful to
fledgling screenwriters, and entertaining to people who just like
to talk about movies. &QL;

 &HT;    COLUMN: Tuppers' expansion creates shortage of six-pack carriers
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the little things we take for granted. The ham can be smoky
and sweet, the potato salad perfect and the eggs deviled just
right, but there won't be a picnic unless someone can scare up some
plastic plates and forks. And some napkins.
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Dominion Brewery in Ashburn, Va., an unexpected
shortage of six-pack holders _ the cardboard contrivances for
carrying half a dozen bottles of beer _ has arisen. You never think
about these things. You wonder if the beer is available, if it can
be transported, if there's enough retail demand. But cardboard
holders?
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened after Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale was
introduced to the Atlanta market two weeks ago and sold out within
days. At Harry's Farmers Market in Marietta, Ga., beer manager Juan
Viteri received 20 cases of Hop Pocket on a Thursday _ one of the
largest shipments in the area _ and by midday Saturday all but
three were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a once substantial display, Viteri sounded like
someone wondering how the snowman had melted away. ``You see
that,'' he said. ``It's all we got left.'' Even as he was saying
it, someone walked up and asked, ``Excuse me, but can you sell me
some of the Tuppers'?''
</P>

   Demand in Atlanta for Tuppers' Hop Pocket _ winner of the gold
medal for American-style pale ales last year at the Great American
Beer Festival _ surpassed all projections. ``We've already got 200
cases back-ordered, and that's probably shy of what we need,'' says
Peter Marte, president of Thunder Head Distribution Services.
``We've also got orders in Athens(Ga.) we're trying to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   For Old Dominion founder Jerry Bailey, whose following had been
largely confined to Northern Virginia, Maryland and the District of
Columbia, it's all come rather quickly. After the small craft
brewery shipped 1,000 cases of Hop Pocket to England _ where
national pride limits enthusiasm for an ale that's too assertively
American _ cardboard six-pack holders suddenly have become more
than incidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``That beer has moved faster than anything I've seen since
Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale _ and that's a seasonal beer,'' says
Andy Klubock, proprietor of the Taco Mac pubs in Sandy Springs and
Snellville, where Hop Pocket is sold on draft. ``Beers like this
aren't something you guzzle to get drunk. It just shows how
knowledgeable people in Atlanta are becoming about beer. They are
as knowledgeable here as they are in Boston, New York or Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll notice he didn't say Seattle, San Francisco or Portland,
Ore., but he said more than anyone could have said only a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Better than respectable
</P>
<P>
   When you've done someone a disservice, better that you try to
rectify it than deny it. A few weeks ago, in another section of
this newspaper, I offered my impressions of the area's brewpubs. Of
John Harvard's Brew House in Buckhead I wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Half a dozen or so `chain beers,' brewed to corporate recipe,
are on tap, most of them respectable, others quite commendable.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what appeared in the paper. Somewhere in the
editing process the phrase ``others quite commendable'' was
deleted, leaving a reader to infer that certain of brewer Kurt
Harrison's beers were less than respectable.
</P>
<P>
   It was an innocent mistake, but one that should be acknowledged.
The fact is that Kurt Harrison and assistant Happy Harris brew
beers that are respectable and then some. I happen to think they
are better with ales than with lagers, but that's true of most
brewpubs. Harrison's Scottish Ale, as the article reported, won a
silver medal at the Great American Beer Festival, and his India
Pale Ale reproduces the original British style as well as any. I
admit a partiality to the more assertive Pacific Northwest style,
but Harrison's IPA is one any knowledgeable brewer would admire.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison also took exception to the phrase ``cookie-cutter
beers,'' made in reference to beers made according to corporate
guidelines. The truth is that those guidelines, established at the
company's Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, aren't as rigid as the
phrase would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   John Harvard's head brewer, Tim Morse (whose credentials include
several years at Anchor Brewing Co. in San Francisco), specifies
ranges within which certain styles should be brewed _ from
maltiness to hoppiness, for example _ but individual brewers are
allowed degrees of latitude. Palates might differ from city to
city. Still, there is a point beyond which a pale ale, say, is no
longer a pale ale but something else. You can't fault John
Harvard's for wanting a certain consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the article I said that John Harvard's brewers
``take their beer seriously.'' No retraction is in order there.

 &HT;    Cartoon museum salutes Garfield
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garfield, the fat cat created by artist Jim Davis, is
celebrating his 20th birthday, prompting the International Museum
of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., to stage an exhibition
featuring the feisty feline through Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It's as good an excuse as any this summer to check out Boca, the
booming Palm Beach County resort that is steadily gaining a
reputation for brainy as well as beachy attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000-square-foot exhibit contains original comic strip
panels, sketchbooks, lithographs, animated TV films, books in two
dozen languages and Garfield toys, including the stick-on doll that
once graced car windows all over America (and is still hanging onto
some).
</P>
<P>
   ``With Davis' generous help, this show really captures the
development of Garfield from 1978 to the present,'' says museum
chairman Mort Walker, creator of the Beetle Bailey strip.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, Garfield is seen walking on all fours, with
a smaller head and more stripes. Viewers can follow the evolution
of his sweet-and-sour personality, plus the introduction of owner
Jon, dog Odie and Pookie the teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield's favorite themes are explored, such as overeating,
laziness, hating Mondays and loving lasagna. Davis' original
basement studio in Indiana is re-created, with his desk, lamp,
drawing board, brushes and a big poster of Raquel Welch. An award
room contains Garfield's three Emmy Awards, various cartooning
awards and a world map pinpointing the strip's growth to 2,500
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon buffs will also enjoy the permanent museum exhibits,
including the first ``Yellow Kid'' comics of 120 years ago, Walt
Disney's original 1926 storyboards of Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
editorial cartoons from around the world and the Cartoon Hall of
Fame, honoring 31 artists.
</P>
<P>
   Walker founded the museum in 1960 to preserve classic cartoons,
including his own. He moved it from Rye Brook, N.Y., to Boca Raton
in 1992 when the Florida city revitalized its aging downtown mall,
Mizner Park, and offered concessions to land a major anchor
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   -- When and where: The museum is open 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays, noon-6 p.m. Sundays; adults $6, children $3.
Call 561-391-2200. It's at 201 Plaza Real in Mizner Park, east of
I-95 on Federal Highway at Palmetto Park Road. Mizner Park, called
``the village within the city,'' has been expanded to 1 million
square feet, with shops, restaurants, a movie multiplex, tropical
park, fountains, offices and apartments. Try Max's Grille and
Coffee Shop, 404 Plaza Real, for sesame seared tuna, barbecue ribs
or turkey meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   -- More fun: Boca Festival Days is being celebrated through Aug.
31, with golf and tennis tournaments, charity luncheons and what's
billed as Florida's largest wine-tasting party (145 varieties).
``Wine and All That Jazz'' will be staged at the posh Boca Raton
Resort &AMP; Club, 501 East Camino Real, at 6 p.m. Friday; admission
$25. Call the Chamber of Commerce, 561-395-4433.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Thomasville's big oak had a famous fan
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people draw celebrities like magnets. I spent a week in
Thomasville, Georgia once and the most famous person I met was a
well-regarded gentleman who sold peanuts on the main street.
</P>
<P>
   Now I hear from my friend Pat Gainey that Thomasville's
celebrated ancient oak tree is a natural attracter of the eminent
and celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article about the old oak tree in Mobile(Ala.) reminded
me of one of Thomasville's landmarks, our vintage live oak tree,
corner of Monroe and Crawford streets,'' wrote Miss Gainey.
``Visitors to our town are always shown the oak. Each time I drive
by, I wonder how much longer its wide, low, heavy branches will
stay intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike comes calling
</P>
<P>
   Miss Gainey continues: ``One of the last visits President
Eisenhower made to Thomasville (about 1958) was a side trip to view
the big oak. After several days of hunting and golfing in the area,
Ike and his motorcade were departing to drive 25 miles to Moultrie,
Ga. and Spence Field, to board the plane for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the locals lined the main thoroughfare to get a glimpse as
the president passed. Mrs. Rudolph Keyton and sister Janie Bett
Tharpe stood among the crowds along the route on the edge of town.
Mrs. Keyton's house was directly across from the big oak, and the
president walked up and down her front porch looking at the tree
and the wide spread of its branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This side trip to see the oak was unannounced, but if Mrs.
Keyton had stayed at home she could have stood beside Ike,
conversed with him and had an unusual experience. She was so
unhappy learning about this missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Miss Gainey's report on the oak and its
celebrity fans.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise guests
</P>
<P>
   ``Another time when Ike was in the Thomasville area, we heard
that he was playing golf on a particular day. We have an excellent
18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President usually came to hunt quail, deer, etc. But that
day he was rumored to be at the golf course, so we went to the Glen
Arven clubhouse hoping we would see him. There were Washington
reporters and cameramen outside, but no local people. We waited
awhile and were ready to leave, when one of the press told us to
wait, he was coming outside. To our surprise, the golfer who came
out was the Duke of Windsor!''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Gainey suggests that golf and shopping, perhaps more than
the oak, drew the Windsors, who often spent winters at the Baker
family estate in Leon County, Fla., just south of the state line.
They were often spotted downtown and at the country club, probably
because, as she explained, the townspeople didn't bother them.
</P>
<P>
   As polite as you and me
</P>
<P>
   ``Her father, leaving the Thomas Drugstore, automatically opened
the door for a lady _ who turned out to be the duchess. She
politely thanked him and went her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these memories,'' concludes Miss Gainey, ``because you
wrote about an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomasville has always cherished her trees. But after
Hurricane Kate ripped through here in 1985, toppling trees on 80
houses, we've become a lot more nervous. Nevertheless, we love our
shade trees and I hope and pray we'll never have another
devastating storm like Kate.''

 &HT;    Plenty of food sites to savor on the Net
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have all become familiar with the warnings that have come
along with the burgeoning of the Internet _ take heed before giving
out personal information, don't become a Net addict, beware of
strangers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes yet another, although far more benign, Internet worry.
Affected are those millions of folks who jealously guard a precious
hour or two a month when they can steal away to a favorite chair,
facing no distractions, with a favorite food magazine. Leafing
through the slick pages showing tantalizing food being prepared in
impossibly fabulous kitchens, by impossibly fabulous people in
exotic settings, can be a seductive escape from busy lives _ to say
nothing of the inspiration you can get for your own kitchen. The
problem may arise because the Internet presents too much of a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, only a handful of food magazines were being
published. Now it's hard to keep up with the proliferation of
gourmet and cooking publications that hit the newsstands every
month. Add to those print publications their Internet versions and
``webzines,'' which are found only on the World Wide Web, and there
are more food publications out there than you can possibly ever
read. So, with a warning to be selective, here are some Internet
addresses that, with a press of a button, will give you instant
access to hundreds and hundreds of food and gourmet magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Go to http://www.sapphireswan.com/webguide/wg/recipes.htm and
you'll have instant access to Gourmet Connections, Gourmet Fare,
Only Gourmet, Gourmand, Wine and Dine Connoisseur, StarChefs,
Virtual Gourmet, Wine and Dine, Diabetic Gourmet and even The
Hungover Gourmet. And that's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``Mega-Guide'' to gourmet magazines at
http://www.netfinderusa
</P>
<P>
   .com/Magazines/cooking.htm, which makes the one just mentioned
look downright skimpy. And there's also
http://hearte.com/in/food.htm and
http://mecklenburg.net/news/magsFood.htm and
http://super.net.pkresource_list/FOOD.HTML and
http://www.ahandyguide.com/cat1/m/m911.htm and
http://hearte.com/in/food.htm and
http://www.excite.com/apple/guide/Lifestyle/Food_and_Drink/.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these sites, with surprisingly little duplication, has
hundreds of food-related magazines as well as the food sections of
a number of daily newspapers. All this competition has proved to be
a plus for the reader, as many of those we scanned had top-notch
photography, articles by first-rate food critics, tips, feedback,
interesting and informative features about food, travel and
entertaining and other slick content.
</P>
<P>
   Just promise us you won't try to read it all.
</P>
<P>
   We found this week's summer recipe on Gourmet Fare (http:
</P>
<P>
   //www.gourmetfaremagazine.com), an award-winning webzine
published in metro Atlanta (Roswell, Ga.).

 &HT;    ``Saving Private Ryan'' creates ``dialogue'' for America Online
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veterans of the Second World War II and high school students
just learning about it are venturing onto America Online's Saving
Private Ryan area (Keyword: Saving Private Ryan) to remember,
exchange stories and just talk.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokeswoman Janine Dunne says that since the area opened
Friday, more than10,000 messages have been posted. Dunne says the
only time there was such a large response to a topic was after the
death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Kornbluth, AOL's editorial content director, says the
outpouring of messages can be directly related to the movie's power
and the need to talk about the war and its aftermath in a different
way. He also says that AOL's infrastructure and technology make
this kind of dialog easier than it would be on the Web or other
online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime on AOL we get real and deal with the struggle of
everyday life, there is just an outpouring of emotion on the
boards,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the messages are personal reactions to the movie
and heated debates about Matt Damon's acting ability, the most
interesting and moving posts are a spontaneous dialogue between
those old enough to recall the war in vivid detail and those who
are young enough to regard it as ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Comments range from those of vets recalling their wartime
memories to amazed teens who now see ``grandpa's war'' in a new
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you loved the movie, hated the movie, found it
overdone, inaccurate, too gory, etc., ``Saving Private Ryan'' did
exactly what a good movie should do ...i t created a dialogue,''
wrote one AOL member marvelling at the number of messages.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Saving Private Ryan'' message boards aren't the only place
where AOL members have gone en masse to express their opinions and
feelings. AOL has set up areas to talk about the Florida forrest
fires and Jonesboro, Ark., high school shootings and met with an
outpouring of emotional and heartfelt response. The combination of
AOL's screen names which protect the identity of the user (members
are warned not to post their names, addresses or any other specific
personal information) and the online service's technology that
makes chats and message boards easier to manipulate than those on
the Web are part of what makes AOL something akin to a national
watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed that it takes a movie to make us realize what
it took to get this country where it is,'' wrote one AOL member.
``Sure we learned about the wars in history class, but I don't
think it ever soaked in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought back memories one tried to supress for 50 years,''
wrote another veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Vietnam vet and the son of a WWII vet who was in the
invasion of Normandy, I can say I finally understand how and why my
father became the man he is,'' one AOL member writes. ``When I
asked him about the invasion, he said he left his soul on the
beach. After seeing 'Saving Private Ryan,' I know now what he
meant. I served in Vietnam and did see some action, but nothing
compared to the carnage and destruction of Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornbluth believes the ``Saving Private Ryan'' area is what
America Online is all about. ``To me we are an online 'service,'''
he said. ``The service aspect is hugely important to me and crucial
to what we do. After you check the stocks and look at your e-mail,
there is one other thing to do _ to share and feel. ``
</P>
<P>
   The boards are monitored, not censored. A teenager who doubted
the film's authenticity and touted Adolph Hitler as a great man,
received many responses _ some gentle and some passionate _
disagreeing with him. One member replied. ``Millions fought and
died 50 years ago so that you can voice that kind of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best example of how high emotions are running on
this topic come from a Vietnam vet who responded to a message from
a teenage girl: ``You said, 'I have so much respect for veterans
from the past wars, I only wish I could tell them all and hug them
and thank them.' Young lady, you just did. As a Vietnam vet I thank
you for your thoughts and believe me, your hugs felt good.''

 &HT;    Lemon Pie, Part Deux: New take on a pie classic
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, we ran an old favorite for many _ Eagle Brand Magic
Lemon Pie. The recipe came to us from Plennie Robinson of
Dawsonville, Georgia who had copied it straight from the ``Borden's
Eagle Brand Magic Recipes'' booklet published many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly what Gwendolyn Connally was looking for. But
while the recipe has been used by many over the years, Borden has
revised it and renamed it Creamy Lemon Pie.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the revision? The cooking time in the original
recipe (which appeared in this column last week) is 15 minutes.
That's not long enough to bring the eggs in the filling to 160
degrees _ the safe temperature for eliminating risk of a food-borne
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Those using the original recipe should be aware that consuming
foods with uncooked or partially cooked eggs can be a health
hazard. To avoid that risk, Eagle Brand has created this new
recipe, which we share with you and Connally. It's still a yummy
summer treat.

 &HT;    World War II documentry on PBS
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Wayne's ``War is swell'' film legacy is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are seeing to that. And those
who've already seen Spielberg's ultraviolent ``Saving Private
Ryan'' are likely to have their interest in World War II piqued
further by tonight's PBS special ``Guts 'n' Glory: An 'American
Experience' Special'' (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   The 150-minute show is actually two documentaries _ one on D-Day
(nominated for an Oscar in 1995) and another on the Battle of the
Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to retired Army Lt. Col. William Friedman recalling D-Day
and Allied troops landing on Normandy beaches amid heavy gunfire.
``Rank had nothing to do with anything on that beach ... Not by
unit, not by role, everybody individually ... did what they had to
do ... (Men) started yelling, 'Goddamit, get up, move in, you're
going to die anyway, move in and die!''
</P>
<P>
   You need more proof that war is hell? This documentary points
out that 60 percent of all allied equipment parachuted in was lost
and large numbers of troop transports overshot their drop zone by
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The second documentary chronicles the nearly two-month-long
Battle of the Bulge, the Nazi counterattack of 250,000 men across
an 85-mile-wide Allied front from Belgium to Luxembourg. Nearly
80,000 Americans were killed, wounded or captured (PBS notes the
battle is ``the single biggest and bloodiest American soldiers have
ever fought.'').
</P>
<P>
   Both stories are told through eye-witness accounts. And their
words shatter the legacy of Wayne's war movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't go away,'' one soldier says. ``It sleeps sometimes,
but then it awakens again ... It's an enormity of an experience.
And everything after that has been a footnote.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   UPN shows to premire late
</P>
<P>
   UPN strategy has always been to debut its fall shows early. Not
anymore. This year, the mini-network will launch its entire new
season in October. Thirteen shows will debut from Oct. 5 through
Oct. 14. Here's the rundown (All times are Eastern): On Oct. 5 _
``Guys Like Us'' at 8 p.m.; ``DiResta'' at 8:30 p.m.; ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' at 9 p.m.; and ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' at
9:30 p.m. On Oct 6 _ ``Moesha'' at 8 p.m.; ``Clueless'' at 8:30
p.m.; and ``Mercy Point'' at 9 p.m. On Oct. 7 _ ``Seven Days'' at 8
p.m. On Oct. 8 _ ``UPN's Thursday Night at the Movies'' at 8 p.m.
On Oct. 9 _ ``Legacy'' at 8 p.m. and ``Love Boat: The Next Wave''
at 9 p.m. On Oct. 14 _ ``Seven Days'' at 8 p.m. and ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary . . .
</P>
<P>
   We hold these truths to be self evident: that ``Ally McBeal''
needs a diary. And come Nov. 1, America will have just that.
ReganBooks will publish ``Ally McBeal: The Diary'' with more than
250 photos from the show. A press release claims the book will
delve ``inside the mind ... the soul ... and the heart ... of Ally
McBeal.'' Truth is, it will be gleanings from show scripts and
penned by former Entertainment Weekly writer Tim Appelo.

   Picture it: Miles and miles of road ahead of you. You've just
started your trip and the wailing has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we there yet?'' ``She hit me!'' ``Turn up the
air-conditioning!''
</P>
<P>
   Will your family survive the vacation trip?
</P>
<P>
   Put an end to the kids' backseat whining and bickering. Pass the
sodas and popcorn, then pop a cassette into the tape deck.
</P>
<P>
   A (begin itals) book (end itals) on tape, that is. They make
them for little people, too. Buy or rent a few before your next
trip. Splurge on separate tape recorders and earphones if you have
kids of different age levels to entertain. Before you know it,
you'll arrive safe and sane at your destination.
</P>
<P>
   Books on tape also make a nice variation to kids' bedtime
routines. Engaging for them, easy for you. Just turn on the tape
player, kiss them good night, and you can be out the door! Or
better yet, stay and listen with them.
</P>
<P>
   Listening Library produces unabridged audiobooks primarily for
children. For a free catalog, call 800-243-4504, or check its site
at www.listeninglib.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Audio Partners Publishing Corp., also known as Audio
Editions, at 800-231-4261, also has an extended selection for kids
and parents. Its site is www.audiopartners.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some standout tapes for children: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ARTHUR CHAPTER BOOKS: VOLUME 1 &QL; 
 &UR; Marc Brown (Listening Library, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   Young kids love Arthur, who has his own PBS television show.
These tapes contain three stories: ``Arthur's Mystery Envelope,''
``Arthur and the Scare-Your-Pants-Off-Club,'' and ``Arthur Makes
the Team.'' Playing time: Two hours. For ages 4 to 8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE SECRET GARDEN &QL; 
 &UR; Frances Hodgson Burnett (Audio Editions, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   This 1911 classic has served as the basis of several movies and
a Broadway musical. It is the story of an unloved and selfish child
named Mary, who discovers friendship and happiness by helping her
invalid cousin become strong. The children work together in their
secret garden, and nature's restorative touch heals them both.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Wanda McCaddon's British and Yorkshire accents perfectly
suit the characters in this absorbing tale. Playing time: Seven
hours, 45 minutes. For ages 7-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Twain (Audio Editions, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   We all know the story of Tom Sawyer, the scrappy kid who grew up
on the banks of the Mississippi. But voice-over actor Patrick
Fraley brings the lively dialogue to life in an amazing way. He has
created 36 ``voices'' for the wide range of Twain's characters,
reflecting various dialects, ages and sexes. You'd swear there was
a cast of thousands. It's almost like watching a play. Everyone in
the family will enjoy this one. Playing time: Seven hours, 42
minutes. For ages 8 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MINUTE MYSTERIES &QL; 
 &UR; Patrick Fraley (Audio Editions, $11.95)
</P>
<P>
   For shorter attention spans, actor Joe Mantegna adopts the
``Dragnet'' persona of Lt. Harry Rhyne, who lays out the facts of
brain-teasing whodunits for the whole family to solve. A short jazz
riff gives you time to solve the crime. When you give up, the
lieutenant explains his dazzling detective work. Playing time: 80
minutes. For ages 10 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MIGHTY &QL; 
 &UR; Rodman Philbrick (Listening Library, $16.98)
</P>
<P>
   Max Kane is a troubled, lonely kid, teased all his life for
being dumb and slow. He meets Kevin, a small, physically disabled
kid with the brains of Einstein. Together, they become ``The
Mighty,'' an invincible force for justice.
</P>
<P>
   The story is the basis of a motion picture to be released this
fall starring Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton.
The audio book was declared a winner by our 12-year-old field
tester. Playing time: Three hours, 16 minutes. For ages 10 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; REDWALL: BOOK 1, 2 AND 3 &QL; 
 &UR; Brian Jacques (Listening Library, $19.95 per book)
</P>
<P>
   This trilogy centers on the exploits of peace-loving mice who
must defend their home against Cluny, the Scourge and his army of
rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redwall: Book 1'' and ``Redwall-Complete Set'' won Audie
Awards for Best Children's production and Best Children's Title at
this year's BookExpo America Conference in Chicago. The first book
also was honored as an American Library Notable Recording. Playing
time: Three to five hours per book. For ages 10 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; OUT OF THE DUST &QL; 
 &UR; Karen Hesse (Listening Library, $16.98)
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's digging his own grave, / he calls it a pond, / but
I know what he's up to. / He is rotting away, / like his father, /
ready to leave me behind in the dust. / Well, I'm leaving first.
(July 1935.)''
</P>
<P>
   Hesse's prose about a 14-year-old girl growing up in the
Oklahoma Dust Bowl during the Depression won the 1998 Newbery
Medal. This first-person story, written in free verse, is
particularly well suited for reading aloud, especially by the
authentic Oklahoma narrator Marika Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist, Billie Jo, is very much alone as she struggles
through traumas no child should have to face. Her mother dies in an
accident caused by her father, whose self-absorption alienates
Billie Jo. Ultimately, Billie Jo heals herself, then reunites with
her father. Playing time: Two hours, 9 minutes. For ages 10 and
up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SEES BEHIND TREES &QL; 
 &UR; Joseph Bruchac (Listening Library, $16.98)
</P>
<P>
   A lilting flute begins the mystical story of Young Walnut, a
Native American boy who doesn't see very well. He's worried about
an upcoming feast, where he's supposed to shoot moss from the air
with his bow and arrow and earn his grown-up name.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has trouble seeing with his eyes, he's developed
another form of vision by using his other senses. This special
ability prompts a village elder to take him on a journey, where his
skills and wits are challenged in a difficult test. The story
transports kids to another culture. Playing time: Two hours, 29
minutes. For ages 10 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Lee (Audio Editions, $34.95)
</P>
<P>
   Headed across country? This 10-hour reading of the
third-bestselling book of all time ought to get you there.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator Roses Prichard slips easily into the persona of Scout,
who observes her Southern hometown wrestle with the issue of a
black man who has been falsely accused. For ages 12 and up. &QL;

   Those four words put you and your children on a journey to
castles; kings and queens; fishing holes; gingerbread houses;
baseball fields; outer space; and dark, forbidding forests.
</P>
<P>
   How you tell the tale can make the difference between the
listeners' restless indifference and total enthrallment.

   Patrick Fraley, a professional voice-over performer on cartoons
and radio and the father of four boys, shares his tips on ``How to
Read Aloud to Kids,'' published by Audio Partners. Patrick Fraley,
a professional voice-over performer on cartoons and radio and the
father of four boys, shares his tips on ``How to Read Aloud to
Kids,'' published by Audio Partners. His ideas and demonstrations
are worthy instruction for parents, teachers and librarians.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use emphasis to enhance meaning. You can do this by making
words louder or softer in volume or higher or lower in pitch,
elongating or shortening pronunciation and pausing before or after
a word. Emphasize verbs to move along the action.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tempo sets the mood. A slow, soft voice aptly describes a
dark, spooky barn. A jaunty pace recounts how Peter Rabbit squeezed
through the gate just in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change your voice for various characters. Feel free to steal
voices from movie and cartoon characters. Practice talking like a
crafty elf, a wicked witch, a Southern belle or a grouchy old man.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the story interactive by having kids assist you with
sound effects, like that made by a howling wind, a slammed door or
twittering birds. Ask older kids to recap the previous night's
episode before you read the next chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley also addresses certain problems that may crop up during
read-aloud sessions.
</P>
<P>
   What if your 3-year-old grabs the book and wants to read it
herself? That's fine. Let her patter on about the pictures and
story, but don't let her go off into her own world. Be the kind of
listener you would like her to be _ one who is attentive and asks
questions.
</P>
<P>
   What if your kid wants to skip to the last page to find out what
happens? Knowing that Cinderella eventually marries the prince
doesn't ruin the story for adults, so why should it for kids? Flip
to the last page, then go back and pick up where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pleasure to be gained lies in the activity _ don't be too
goal-oriented,'' Fraley says. ``Reading aloud is not about
finishing. That's just what happens when you get to the last
page.'' &QL;

   ``Once upon a time ....''
</P>
<P>
   Those four words put you and your children on a journey to
castles; kings and queens; fishing holes; gingerbread houses;
baseball fields; outer space; and dark, forbidding forests.
</P>
<P>
   How you tell the tale can make the difference between the
listeners' restless indifference and total enthrallment.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fraley, a professional voice-over performer on cartoons
and radio and the father of four boys, shares his tips on ``How to
Read Aloud to Kids,'' published by Audio Partners. Patrick Fraley,
a professional voice-over performer on cartoons and radio and the
father of four boys, shares his tips on ``How to Read Aloud to
Kids,'' published by Audio Partners. His ideas and demonstrations
are worthy instruction for parents, teachers and librarians.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use emphasis to enhance meaning. You can do this by making
words louder or softer in volume or higher or lower in pitch,
elongating or shortening pronunciation and pausing before or after
a word. Emphasize verbs to move along the action.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tempo sets the mood. A slow, soft voice aptly describes a
dark, spooky barn. A jaunty pace recounts how Peter Rabbit squeezed
through the gate just in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change your voice for various characters. Feel free to steal
voices from movie and cartoon characters. Practice talking like a
crafty elf, a wicked witch, a Southern belle or a grouchy old man.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the story interactive by having kids assist you with
sound effects, like that made by a howling wind, a slammed door or
twittering birds. Ask older kids to recap the previous night's
episode before you read the next chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley also addresses certain problems that may crop up during
read-aloud sessions.
</P>
<P>
   What if your 3-year-old grabs the book and wants to read it
herself? That's fine. Let her patter on about the pictures and
story, but don't let her go off into her own world. Be the kind of
listener you would like her to be _ one who is attentive and asks
questions.
</P>
<P>
   What if your kid wants to skip to the last page to find out what
happens? Knowing that Cinderella eventually marries the prince
doesn't ruin the story for adults, so why should it for kids? Flip
to the last page, then go back and pick up where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pleasure to be gained lies in the activity _ don't be too
goal-oriented,'' Fraley says. ``Reading aloud is not about
finishing. That's just what happens when you get to the last
page.'' &QL;

   The New York Times News Service has moved the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 2,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-FILMS (Hong Kong) _ As recently as eight years ago,
Hong Kong was second only to Hollywood in exporting movies, and
Hong Kong films were among the most exciting things happening in
cinema. Talented directors were casting charismatic stars in movies
that were by turns stylishly violent, breathtakingly magical,
beautifully tender or silly kung-fu comedies. Slowly, Hong
Kong-style art direction, action choreography and even plot
elements began to appear in American films. Today, audiences here
are flocking to Hollywood films, especially ones filled with
special effects, and ignoring ones made in Hong Kong. By Neil
Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ Attendance at American art museums
is skyrocketing, but upstairs in the director's office, the desk
chair is often unoccupied and an eerie silence prevails. At last
count, there were about 20 openings for directors at prominent
museums, and trustees are insisting, with only partial
exaggeration, that they can't find anyone for the job. By Deborah
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   RYAN-FILM-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ Though the landmark film event
that is Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' opened last
weekend to strong attendance and critical cartwheels, it also set
off a flurry of talk-show trepidations. Worries spread about the
violence level in this already famously harrowing World War II
epic. By Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   BENOIT-JACQUOT-FILMS (New York) _ Benoit Jacquot is not about to
write his autobiography. ``I'm not interested in recounting my life
through my films,'' the famously reticent French director said
recently. ``I'd rather they teach me something about my life.'' His
presence in his work is close to transparent: a finely tuned eye
and intelligence, focused on the intricate, oblique entanglements
of human beings. By Leslie Camhi.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   VIEWPOINTS-DANCE (Undated) _ Invented in the 1970s by two dance
choreographers, Mary Overlie and Wendall Beavers, Viewpoints has
recently become part of the contentious debate currently going on
in America about actor training. In the last five years, there has
been an explosion of interest in new ways to train American actors.
Some people in the theater believe the itch to explore different
theories is a reaction to the longtime dominance of the Method,
preached by the controversial teacher Lee Strasberg, who died in
1982. By Rachel Shteir. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Many things about the Russian
Symphony Orchestra seem to resonate of formative youth. The
ensemble was organized just six years ago, and the average age of
its members is 25. But to judge from a collection of exceptionally
well-produced recordings, the sapling Russian Symphony might be as
old as its musical roots. Indeed, the youth of its players is
belied by an intensity, insight and precision that usually come
with more years on stage than most of these musicians have lived.
By Lawrence B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   DON-GIOVANNI-OPERA (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Peter Brook's
production of ``Don Giovanni'' is at the Festival Internationale
d'Art Lyrique this summer. Brook gives us not much of a production
at all: a few benches on the big courtyard stage of the
Archbishop's Palace, the Don in a vanilla suit and Panama hat, his
colleagues in street clothes and party dresses. Yet Mozart has been
treated exceptionally well: not with visual effects or theatrical
coups that draw us into the events, but by an attempt to look at
the opera's people from the inside out. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-DRUMMER (New York) _ In barely a decade, the percussionist
Leon Parker has gone from stints with the pianist Kenny Barron to a
chair in the pianist Jacky Terrasson's fine trio to a major label
contract. By Adam Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-COMPOSERS (New York) _ The last quarter century has seen
the emergence of female composers as serious professionals. Opera
and the bigger forms of `serious music' require both practical
experience and real opportunity to learn (and earn) from
performance, as Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, the Pulitzer Prize winning
composer of large scale instrumental works, points out. It has been
easier for women to compose pop. But successful women are often
more readily co-opted by commercial forces than men. By Albert
Innaurato. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Hollywood-crazed collectors have
long been willing to pay handsomely for original props like
Dorothy's red shoes. But reproductions of collectibles? Chronicle
Books, a medium-size San Francisco publishing house, is betting
that there is a market out there for such items, and somewhat
closer to earth than the Tatooine desert. Chronicle has just issued
``Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential Collection,'' by Stephen J.
Sansweet, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is
revered by other collectors for having one of the world's largest
collections of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   SHOCK-ART (New York) _ With art, there are three forms of shock:
the shock of recognition, the shock at something merely appalling
and the shock of the new. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   ITALIAN-GESTURES-TV (Undated) _ In the documentary ``The
Italian-Americans II: A Beautiful Song,'' which has its premiere on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WLIW, Nick Stellino, a New York cookbook
author of Italian descent, describes the way he and family members
used hand gestures when speaking to one another. By Warren Berger.

PANTANI RETAINS LEAD AS JULICH HANGS ON TO SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBERTVILLE, France _ Italian Marco Pantani barely missed
winning the race Tuesday but kept his overall lead. And American
Bobby Julich barely held on to second place.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say that the Tour de France is in a precarious,
let's-shake-up-the-standings state as the race enters its third and
final week.
</P>
<P>
   There was a dubious consistency to one aspect of the
proceedings, however. The drug scandal that has plagued the Tour
since its start widened yet again Tuesday when a third team _
Bigmat _ was implicated as suspicious medication was seized from
its van.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Festina has been banished, and the Dutch TVM team is
under investigation. Meanwhile, two former Festina cyclists,
Emmanuel Magnien and Gilles Bouvard, were released by police a day
after being held for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   On the roads, Jan Ullrich of Germany and Pantani rode in front
of the pack for the last 40 miles of the race, with Ullrich
finishing first in 5 hours 39 minutes 47 seconds. The win moved him
up a notch to third place, and it was almost, but not quite, enough
to knock Julich out of his spot.
</P>
<P>
   Julich led the sprint as the next pack raced in, 1 minute 49
seconds behind Ullrich. That was enough for Julich to keep his
tenuous hold on second, just 14 seconds ahead of Ullrich, last
year's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who won the Tour of Italy last month, seems determined
to chalk up another major win and hold on to the yellow jersey he
wrested from Ullrich Monday. Indeed, it seems a fitting fashion
statement to go along with the trademark multicolored bandanna he
wears over his bald head.
</P>
<P>
   The 127-mile stage started in the town of Vizille in eastern
France, went north, and ended up in Albertville, where the 1992
Winter Olympics were held. In between were four climbs, then a trip
up and over the Col de la Madeline, called a ``beyond category''
climb, at 2,000 meters one of the steepest summits in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it had everything that spectators relish about a
stage in the Alps _ the grimacing faces of riders as they push
their way up the mountains, the way they often stand up in their
seats for more power, the way they put on their caps and nylon
jackets to keep warm as they speed down the descents at speeds of
almost 60 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchman Stephane Heulot, German Rolf Aldag, and Andrel
Teteriouk of Kazakhstan led the way up the mountains and built a
lead of six minutes on the pack. But it was too much too soon in
the Alps, and eventually, they were reeled in.
</P>
<P>
   On their way up the final climb, Ullrich and Pantani were intent
on showing their champion mettle. They surged away from the other
riders, building a lead of more than four minutes on a group of
pursuers that included Julich, 1996 Tour winner Bjarne Riis of
Denmark, and Jean-Cyril Robin of the US Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani seemed determined to show that his impressive win in the
rain Monday was no fluke, and Ullrich seemed just as determined to
show that he's still in the hunt. Up the mountain and down, Ullrich
led the way as Pantani followed on his wheel.
</P>
<P>
   And as the two headed into town, the end was as close to a photo
finish as a stage can get, with Ullrich and Pantani riding neck and
neck, or rather wheel and wheel, Ullrich lunging forward with his
bike just enough to get the win. It was so close, in fact, that the
two were given ``same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ullrich could shake off Pantani at the finish, it's
not certain he can shake the yellow jersey off his back. After
surrendering to Pantani's power Monday, Ullrich said, ``I never
said I could win five Tours. I'll be happy just to be on the
podium.'' He might have to settle for that.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., finished with a pack 11
minutes behind the leaders and is now in 68th place overall.
</P>
<P>
   The race thinned some more Tuesday as six riders pulled out,
including Jan Svorada, winner of Stage 2. With the high attrition
rate _ of the 198 riders who started 17 days ago, 134 are left _
the American-based US Postal Service team might once again be in
the select company of finishing the race with its nine-rider team
intact. Last year it was one of three teams to get to Paris
undamaged; now just the Postal Service and the German Telekom team
still have all their original riders.

BMW FORCES VW TO GIVE UP THE ROLLS-ROYCE NAME IN 2003 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Volkswagen AG suffered a humiliating setback Tuesday
when it was forced to agree to hand over the Rolls-Royce name in
2003 to BMW AG, the archrival it had faced down to acquire
Britain's luxury automaker from Vickers PLC in May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts quickly declared BMW the real winner of the takeover
brawl over Rolls-Royce Motor Cars because the name is considered by
many to be Rolls-Royce's most valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen had paid $780 million for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
known for its Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, glowing with
hand-tooled leather and walnut, beloved by rock stars, royalty and
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   But when the deal was announced in May, one key element was
absent: Vickers did not own the rights to the Rolls-Royce name.
That license belonged to another company, Rolls-Royce PLC, an
aerospace concern with close ties to BMW and a marked preference
for BMW to become the custodian of Britain's most prestigious
automotive brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone clearly made a big mistake,'' said Hartmuth Hoen, an
analyst an Enskilda Securities in London. ``It's obviously a big
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement announced in London on Tuesday, BMW said it had
acquired the Rolls-Royce name _ and the ``Spirit of Ecstasy''
emblem that adorns the hoods of Rolls-Royce cars _ from Rolls-Royce
PLC for $65 million, a sum regarded by many analysts as a steal.
``BMW is getting a lot and paying next to nothing,'' Hoen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive of VW, and Bernd
Pischetsrieder, his counterpart at BMW, appeared together Tuesday
to announce the details of a deal that will allow Volkswagen to
maintain exclusive rights to the Rolls-Royce name until the end of
2002. Thereafter, BMW will acquire the rights to produce a new
Rolls-Royce and Volkswagen will maintain the right to build
Bentleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went for a peaceful solution'' rather than a long legal
battle, Piech said. But he ruefully acknowledged that ``I would
have preferred to keep both brands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the seesawing contest for Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen always
seemed ready to put up a higher financial stake, and many analysts
were puzzled by BMW's refusal to raise the ante.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW had two trump cards: its coziness with Rolls-Royce PLC _
the two companies already had a joint venture _ and a deal to
supply the engines for the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the
Bentley Arnage. When Vickers agreed to sell Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
to Volkswagen, BMW said it would cancel the deal for V12 and V8
engines within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volkswagen had a car but no engine,'' Hoen said. Since the
Volkswagen deal with Vickers closed earlier this month, analysts
said, BMW intensified the pressure. Under Tuesday's deal, BMW
withdrew its threat to cancel the engine deal and will continue to
supply engines to the Rolls-Royce plant at Crewe in northern
England until the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Then, BMW will ``take over the distribution of Rolls-Royce cars
and will continue the production of the Silver Seraph in
cooperation with the plants in Crewe and manufacture additional
Rolls-Royce automobiles in a newly built plant in Britain,'' a BMW
statement said. It did not say where the new plant would be.
</P>
<P>
   BMW already owns plants in Britain through its Rover subsidiary,
but Pischetsrieder indicated the new Rolls-Royces would not be
produced at those factories. Volkswagen will be left with the aging
plant in Crewe and the Bentley name.
</P>
<P>
   Bentleys account for 60 percent to 70 percent of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars' sales. But ``the Rolls-Royce name is potentially more
valuable than Bentley because it is known better globally,'' said
Christopher Will, an analyst at Lehmann Brothers in London. He
predicted BMW would seek two markets, the United States and
Germany, where the Rolls-Royce has more cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``BMW got the last laugh,'' Will said.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal _ splitting brands between rival auto producers _
will mean that Rolls-Royce and Bentley will be direct competitors,
produced by different companies, for the first time in most
Britons' memory.
</P>
<P>
   That sat uneasily with the union representatives of the 2,400
Rolls-Royce Motors Cars workers in Crewe. The agreement was
``absolutely disgraceful and nothing short of a betrayal of trust
by Volkswagen,'' the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union
said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had another long-term implication. Daimler-Benz
AG in Stuttgart announced Tuesday that it would develop its own
luxury car, the Maybach, its first such luxury automobile since the
600 Pullmann series was discontinued in 1981. Anyone looking to buy
a European luxury car in the next few years will, thus, one way or
the other, be buying German. &QL;

   Temperatures soared to a record 112 degrees at The Dalles in
eastern Oregon on Monday as an intense heat wave gripped the
interior Northwest. On Wednesday, heat will build across the
region, but a bevy of scattered thunderstorms will erupt as an
upper-level low presses inland from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   With hot air near the surface and high-altitude cold air
associated with the lofty low, the atmosphere will become very
unstable, heightening the risk that a few of the storms may
approach severe levels in east Oregon and east Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful wind gusts called microbursts are possible as
concentrated, intense downdrafts of air within storms spread
rapidly outward upon impact with the ground. Hail is also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will blossom again over the central and
southern Rockies as the uneven heating of mountains and valleys
promotes vigorously rising currents of moist air. Farther east,
clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop and roam across
parts of Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, Dallas will notch its 24th consecutive day with
triple-digit temperatures and warm air aloft will continue to act
as a lid and suppress the formation of drought-breaking
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop in
the very warm and humid air mass covering the Southeast. In New
England, a few potent thunderstorms will attend an arriving cool
front. The concentration of showers and thunderstorms will steadily
thin out along the front across the Middle Atlantic and upper Ohio
Valley states.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DOOMED DARBY
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Darby weakened Tuesday as it passed over cool seas
while moving west toward Hawaii. The cool waters provide a natural
shield against the full fury of eastern Pacific storms. Only a few
storms that approach Hawaii rapidly from the south can deliver a
major blow (such as Iniki in 1992). The fortress of cool water is
due, in part, to high evaporation rates induced by intense tropical
sunshine. During evaporation, salt is left behind, and with little
rain for dilution, increasingly salty water becomes dense and
sinks, allowing cooler water from the depths to rise to the
surface. &QL;

HOW THE TAME CAN SUDDENLY SEEM WILD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With art, there are three forms of shock: the shock
of recognition, the shock at something merely appalling and the
shock of the new. At the Bonnard show at the Modern the other day,
the big landscapes and especially the pictures of Marthe, Bonnard's
wife, looked less pretty, more audacious than I'd recalled (I'm
talking about a certain simmering, subterranean emotion and
weirdness of drawing).
</P>
<P>
   Bonnard's pictures are best when they're biggest, and when the
colors buzz, and these paintings suddenly seemed wild in a way that
was mildly shocking.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a bad feeling. One critic of the Bonnard show attacked
him as a piddler (and the people who like him as complacent or
blind), and I wondered whether the critic's unusual peevishness
didn't perhaps also reflect an agitation that can be linked, at
least subconsciously, with shock.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare to feel really shocked by anything in art now, shock
having been the aim of so much of what's on view for so long that
it has become a cliche, which poses the obvious problem that
cliches by their nature aren't shocking. Bonnard did not aim to
shock, of course; maybe that's why he can.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that a few days after seeing Bonnard I went to ``Pop
Surrealism'' at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in
Ridgefield, Conn., much of which involves surreal or grotesque
images, what might be called hard-core Pop irony and violent riffs
on the human body _ supposedly shocking stuff, though all
hard-boiled art veterans, mimicking Sam Spade, have perfected a
reaction of indifference. Fortunately the crime scene is the Venice
Biennale, and we're sipping Bellinis at Harry's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   This topic comes to mind having lately run across a remark by
Charles Rosen, the pianist, in a little book he wrote a few years
ago, ``The Frontiers of Meaning.'' He recalls his nauseated
response as a boy to Bartok's Fifth String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen demonstrates how we may actually be sickened when
something is truly unfamiliar to us, when it thwarts our
expectations, which is what the Bartok quartet did to him.
</P>
<P>
   True shock, in other words, isn't specifically about grotesque
or horrific or risque effects. It's about incomprehension, the
reverse also being the case: we obviously feel most comfortable
with art that conforms to what's already familiar to us.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations and tastes evolve. The art historian Leo
Steinberg famously noted that resistance to modern painting
originally derived not from what painters put into their pictures
but from what they left out, meaning that abstraction shocked
people at first because it lacked recognizable images. Then viewers
gradually accustomed themselves to judging art on the basis of pure
forms and expressive brushwork _ until Abstract Expressionism
became so widely accepted that Pop seemed shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Its shock had to do not just with the return of images (a
certain brand of imagery, anyway) but with the absence of visible
touch in the works of painters like Lichtenstein, Warhol and
Rosenquist, touch having become what people had learned to equate
with art.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen cites Wordsworth's axiom that an original poet ``must
himself create the taste by which he is to be relished,'' which is
undeniably true, although we have often misconstrued this idea,
mistaking tastelessness for originality. Invention, though it
sometimes shocks us by seeming tasteless, mostly assumes, as with
Bonnard, subtler.
</P>
<P>
   I liked ``Pop Surrealism,'' but not because it affronted my
taste, which is almost impossible to do at this point. My reaction
involved the way the best work looked oddly beautiful. It seemed
obsessively well made _ intricately painted, drawn and put together
_ and the clash of refined technique with sometimes gross or banal
imagery heightened a sense of a strange new elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen this sort of work fairly often in recent years, I
felt that perhaps, almost surreptitiously, my perception of what is
beautiful had gradually been altered.
</P>
<P>
   But then I wondered: maybe I'm only reacting positively to a
kind of refinement that recapitulates what I already prize in art.
Could it be that the art in ``Pop Surrealism'' that outwardly seems
shocking is actually more conventional than Bonnard, who to his
critics seems almost pathologically safe?
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not sure. Surprise or shock is tricky to decipher.
``This is the legacy of Romanticism,'' Rosen writes, ``and critics
who would like to maintain or return to absolute standards have
been protesting it without much success for almost two centuries.
Whether there is, in fact, anything constant or invariant about
esthetic appreciation is irrelevant _ even if there is, it must be
on a level of such generality that it can never help us in any
given instance.''
</P>
<P>
   I recall there was a Harvard professor decades ago who tried,
without success, to quantify beauty in art mathematically.
Standardless, some people today defensively embrace whatever is new
(and disdain what isn't), fearing that otherwise they may miss what
turns out, in retrospect, to be significant. Not wanting to be
remembered like the Paris critics who hated Impressionism, they opt
for a kind of critical limbo.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say we worry too much about being correct in our reactions.
Being right is a matter for pedants and historians. Of course,
knowledge and experience help when they don't lead to rigid
opinions, as they often do; they sharpen awareness.
</P>
<P>
   But art, by its nature, demands simply that we be open to what
we see and feel, that we keep looking. In return we may
occasionally have the disturbing pleasure of a certain
indeterminate shock in front of something even as familiar and
deceptively tame as Bonnard's pictures.

THE MORALITY WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans are discovering that
pious lectures about declining public moral values do not sell well
among voters who consider themselves independent or undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that people are not inclined to look on
politicians as paragons of virtue who know best how others should
behave in private life. Preachers belong in churches, not in
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP leadership made a political mistake recently by
capitulating to pressure from the religious right, which demanded
that the party devote more attention to a moral crusade against
homosexuality, abortion and other conservative social causes. The
religious right exerts so much influence now over the GOP that
conservative lawmakers rushed to denounce gays and push for new
gay-bashing and anti-abortion measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the political backlash was swift, demonstrating that many
Americans are more tolerant of homosexuality and personal privacy
freedoms than religious conservatives are. A new poll by the
Republican Leadership Council, a group of GOP moderates, confirms
the findings of previous surveys that so-called moral issues turn
off independent and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of registered independents and swing voters
approved of the party's opposition to gay rights and abortion in
all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN poll in early July said 59 percent of Americans disapprove
of active homosexuality. But that does not mean most voters would
endorse efforts to discriminate against gays and lesbians or would
support politicians who arrogantly pass judgment on other
individuals' private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans have been persistent in their efforts
to chip away at the legality of abortion, trying to slip inventive
restrictions into unrelated legislation at every opportunity. But
the issue of gay rights has been relatively dormant until recently,
when religious right leaders threatened to turn their backs on the
GOP if its officials did not give a higher priority to their
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right was upset that GOP leaders had not protested
immediately when President Clinton issued an executive order in May
to assure equal opportunities for gay federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   After the threat, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss,
jumped in with both feet. He attacked homosexuals as sinful and
compared them to kleptomaniacs, sex addicts or alcoholics who
indulge in bad behavior that they should be able to control. He
also vowed not to allow a Senate vote this year on the nomination
of James Hormel to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel would
have been the nation's first openly gay ambassador if confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   This official ratification of its views in turn encouraged the
Christian Coalition to take out full-page advertisements in major
newspapers across the country contending that homosexuality is
voluntary, self-destructive behavior that can be cured by faith in
God. The ad urges gays to ``recognize their sin and repent.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads' assertion is contrary to majority scientific opinion,
which does not view homosexuality as an illness to be easily
remedied by merely finding God and changing one's ways. There is no
real consensus as to the cause of homosexuality, but many experts
believe it has a genetic basis over which a person has little
control.
</P>
<P>
   The ads' underlying purpose seemed to be to frame a new
political crusade that would seek this fall to label any candidate
who defended gay rights as immoral and approving of sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights
group, countered with its own commercials attacking the religious
right as mistaken and prejudiced. The ads say, ``Some in this
country are selling a myth that gay Americans are not people of
faith ... they are those who want to claim God and the Bible for
their own narrow vision of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, noting the
sudden re-emergence of homosexuality as an issue, said, ``I don't
know whether Republicans think gay-bashing is good politics. There
are some who apparently act like they believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, congressional Republicans are divided about whether
picking on gays is good politics. They must ultimately choose
between appealing to mainstream voters they need to lure into their
party and pandering to a narrow group they already have.
</P>
<P>
   It is exclusive politics versus inclusive politics, and the
answer should be clear that attracting more voters is better than
attracting fewer. In any case, it is wrong to be mean-spirited
about gay rights. Homosexuals have a right to be treated fairly
like anyone else, and their private sexual preference is none of
our business.

<P>
   DALYAN, Turkey _ On many nights this summer, a mysterious and
wondrous spectacle has been unfolding on the beach of this
Mediterranean town.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning soon after dark, dozens of giant loggerhead turtles,
some a century old or older, emerge from the waves, lumber up the
sand, dig 3-foot-deep holes and deposit 100 or more eggs before
returning to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the shoreline, a British-born woman who has made
Turkey her home sits contentedly in a house made largely of
driftwood. Without her, the sea turtles might have lost their
breeding ground here, one of the most important in this part of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, June Haimoff, spent many summers abard a boat
sailing in the Aegean before settling in a shack on the sand bar
here in 1975. Before long she saw her first breeding sea turtle,
and slowly she came to realize that the Dalyan beach was a vital
part of the turtles' world. When she learned that a Turkish-German
consortium was planning to build a hotel on the beach, she flew
into action.
</P>
<P>
   Sea turtles time their egg-laying so that 60 days later when the
eggs hatch, a full moon will be shining. The hatchlings follow the
glare of the moon to find the sea, which is to be their home.
Lights from a hotel would almost surely disorient them and lead
many to die within hours of their birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haimoff, who when asked her age said only that she was born
in the 1920s, began by collecting signatures and contacting
environmentalists in Germany. Before long an international campaign
was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of either being for the turtles, who need
this beach for survival, or for people who are just looking for
someplace hot for a week so they can go back like lobsters to
Bremen or Dusseldorf,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental consciousness was very low in Turkey during the
1980s, and there was not yet a government agency to defend nature
and wildlife. Many people in Dalyan became angry at Ms. Haimoff for
blocking what they saw as a money-making project. At one point they
accused her of being a Greek spy.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, a combination of factors led to a
trail-blazing victory for Ms. Haimoff and the turtles. German
campaigners brought public pressure to bear on the German company
that was building the hotel. At the same time, management of the
family-owned Turkish partner company, Kavala Holding, passed to a
young man, Osman Kavala, who considers himself a conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started construction, hardly anyone in Turkey knew
about sea turtles coming to this beach,'' Kavala said in an
interview. ``After we found out what the situation was, we tried to
modify the project and turn it into a kind of environmental hotel.
But after a while it became clear that the only solution was to
abandon the project altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   As the developers were changing their position, the Turkish
government began to focus on the issue. In 1987 the prime minister
at the time, Turgut Ozal, came here and proclaimed the beach a
``specially protected area.'' As he was departing, several people
in the crowd pointed to Ms. Haimoff and shouted that she was the
``turtle woman.'' He stopped, shook her hand and told her: ``Thank
you. We need people like you.''
</P>
<P>
   With backing at such a high level, public officials began to
take the turtles and their defenders seriously. Today the Dalyan
beach is closed between dusk and dawn, and large signs list rules
that daytime visitors must follow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haimoff's success helped inspire Turkey's fledgling
environmental movement. But many environmentalists say that the
government pays only lip service to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a new brochure, one environmental coalition asserts that
controls at Dalyan and other beaches where turtles lay eggs are too
loose, and that waterfront development is racing out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there remains almost no coastal area still in its natural
state, neither for nesting of marine turtles nor for use by
tourists and ourselves,'' the brochure says. ``Existing and planned
construction has already exceeded the carrying capacity of our
coasts.''

OFFICIAL WARNS ABOUT OVERINDULGENCE IN POWERBALL BETTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As dreamers in 20 states and the District of Columbia lined up
Tuesday for an infinitesimal chance at the richest jackpot in the
history of jackpots, the man New Hampshire puts in charge of
selling tickets issued a surprisingly frank warning: Don't waste
your money.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wisler, executive director of the New Hampshire Lottery,
warned residents not to spend beyond their means on a lottery they
have virtually no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a better chance of throwing a quarter over their
shoulder into a glass on the sidewalk from the top of the Empire
State Building,'' Wisler said of Wednesday's $250 million Powerball
jackpot. The odds of winning are one in 80.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the stratospheric odds of playing the lottery are hardly a
secret, gambling experts said it was unusual for the leader of a
lottery to warn participants about the dangers of careless
wagering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcome sign,'' said Marvin Steinberg, a vice president
of the National Council on Compulsive Gambling. ``It wasn't long
ago that lottery directors would tell you that the lottery isn't
gambling, the lottery is entertainment. Lottery is gambling and
it's often entertaining to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay James, chairwoman of the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission, said states are becoming increasingly dependent on
lottery revenue and are devising creative new games to entice
people to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``His effort to make sure people understand exactly what the
odds are can be nothing but applauded,'' James said. ``I suspect,
however, that in the midst of the frenzy that's going on right now
that message might not get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo!
</P>
<P>
   Even as Wisler was telling reporters that buying 50 to 100
tickets is not going to increase a player's chances by very much,
he was predicting record sales that would eclipse last week's $6.5
million _ more money than the New Hampshire lottery took in over
the entire three years from 1968 through 1970.
</P>
<P>
   And in gasoline stations, convenience stores, liquor stores, and
newstands around Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut _ the
three New England states to participate in Powerball _ proprietors
reported that lines are long, hopes are high, and tempers in some
cases are frayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's hoping,'' said Harvey Goldberg, owner of Stateline
Tobacco Store in Tiverton, R.I., just over the Massachusetts line.
``It's like going to the circus. A few people get ticked off
because the line is long. But it's a party atmosphere. And I
haven't seen anybody playing irresponsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisler, the New Hampshire lottery chief, said he has never
before called a press conference to issue a word of caution to
lottery players on the eve of such a big jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   But he said state government has a special responsibility to
their taxpaying customers that private retailers don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the maker of Beanie Babies saying to their
customers, `Go out and just buy one or two, but don't buy a bunch
more?' '' he asked. ``But anybody standing in line for a couple
hundred tickets isn't going to do much to improve their chances
when we're talking about 80 million to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisler said the average lottery bet this week has been about $5,
a wager slightly more modest than what Susan Glegg, assistant
manager at J.B. Liquors in Woonsocket, R.I., has witnessed from
behind her busy counter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people spending $20 to $50,'' Glegg said. ``That's very
common. We did have someone come in and put $20 worth of quarters
on the counter and it makes you wonder where the money is coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Scanlan, executive director of the Massachusetts
Council on Compulsive Gambling, said there is a growing number of
casino and lottery executives who are recognizing the need to make
sure the glittering attraction of spectacular prizes does not blind
participants to the dangers of excessive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sign of the times,'' Scanlan said. ``It's really
coming to this and I'm thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan said her office recently fielded a call from a woman who
was in tears at a nearby supermarket. She had spent her family's
grocery money on lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the jackpot gets higher, more people who have an impulse
problem want to play,'' said Steinberg, who is also director of the
Connecticut Council of Problem Gambling. ``Maybe you and I can
withstand the hype and walk into a store and not buy a Powerball
ticket, but the next guy is drawn into it like a magnet. I know
people who are spending thousands of dollars a week on the lottery
regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said 16 percent of the callers to a gambling hot line
in Connecticut have trouble controlling their wagers on the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   While many proprietors of stores selling lottery tickets in
Rhode Island and New Hampshire near the Massachusetts border
reported record sales and well-behaved customers, tensions were
tighter elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn., state troopers have been stationed to keep
order in lines of 500 people with waits of up to 10 hours. At one
exit on the New York-Connecticut border, more than 150 people
abandoned their cars on the highway shoulder to walk to a rest area
lottery outlet. In Stamford, Conn., police were called to stores
when customers waiting to buy Powerball tickets refused to leave at
closing time.

THROUGH HIS HANDS, THE HEALING POWER OF RHYTHM 
</HEADLINE>
   Adam Shatz, editor of Lingua Franca Book Review, writes about
jazz.  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the percussionist Leon Parker isn't practicing
on his West African shakers and his Tibetan singing bowl at his
apartment in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, he passes the time
browsing at a nearby Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to surround myself with knowledge,'' Parker explained,
waving his hand like a baton at the stacks from his seat in the
bookstore's cafe. So what had he been reading lately? ``Oh, that's
a secret,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further nudging, he disclosed: ``OK, Quentin Crisp's
`Resident Alien.' Crisp is not really an American, and he's not
really an Englishman. He's a gay Englishman living in New York, so
his perspective is right on. He doesn't belong to any of the
fashions we have in America _ black or white, man or woman. And to
be an artist, you've got to be willing not to belong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not immediately clear what Parker, 32, would have in common
with Crisp, the androgynous British performance artist and writer.
Where Crisp has spent half a century on the margins of respectable
society, Parker's resume suggests the irresistible rise of an
insider. In barely a decade, Parker has gone from stints with the
pianist Kenny Barron to a chair in the pianist Jacky Terrasson's
fine trio to a major label contract.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Parker's enthusiasm for Crisp says a lot about the
drummer. Like Crisp, Parker is a romantic loner with a dread of
other people's expectations. In conversation, as in his music, free
association is his way of keeping his listeners on edge. His sound
is one of the most recognizable and unusual in jazz _ light and
airy, yet as visceral as the kettle drummers in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Like his hero, the drummer Roy Haynes, Parker is a natural
storyteller; like Ed Blackwell, another drummer, he has a love of
polyrhythmic subplots. And though he can swing hard, he prefers the
shadings of timbre and texture to the forward drive of modern jazz
drumming.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '90s, Parker has been smuggling some fairly
unorthodox ideas into the mainstream. While playing in Barron's
trio, for example, he pared his drum set down to a lone ride
cymbal. Some people thought he'd lost his mind, but he figured:
``Why wouldn't it work? When you listen to Billy Higgins or Ben
Riley, what do you hear? You hear a cymbal.'' So Parker threw out
his snare drum and floor tom and just played cymbal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Parker is bidding farewell to straight-ahead jazz
and reinventing himself as a world-music percussionist. ``Jazz has
become a marketing term that has nothing to do with what the music
is about,'' he said, echoing the complaints of many younger players
like the clarinetist Don Byron and the pianist Rodney Kendrick. On
his new album, ``Awakening,'' Parker plays a variety of African,
Latin and Asian hand drums, with scarcely a nod to traditional jazz
drumming. He canceled all of his jazz gigs for the summer,
including his appearances with Terrasson.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz fans may regret Parker's departure from jazz. But Parker
said he doesn't have a choice: ``I have to be a monk now. I have to
withdraw from the world in order to get in touch with whatever this
power is.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds vaguely New Age, it's no accident. Parker sees
himself as a spiritual messenger who communicates in rhythm. A
handsome, bearded man who often covers his meticulously shaved head
with a knit cap, Parker looks at once earthy and urbane in his
beige moccasins and khakis. He speaks volubly of ``using organic
sound for healing purposes,'' and likens the proliferation of the
drum machine since the early '80s to ``a nuclear bomb.'' (``I
couldn't understand how everyone could walk around as if nothing
had happened,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Parker's vision, ``Awakening'' offers a serene
balm for the spiritually and rhythmically impoverished. No longer
is Parker trying to juggle the worlds of jazz drumming and ethnic
percussion, as he did on his first two albums.
</P>
<P>
   Like the late-'60s work of Pharaoh Sanders and Don Cherry, much
of ``Awakening'' is third-world pastoral music, evoking rivers and
forests more than skyscrapers and alleyways. The songs, which bear
titles like ``Mother Earth'' and ``Peaceful Dream,'' are
sun-drenched collages of percussion, wordless vocals and reeds. If
the minimalist composer Steve Reich had soul, his works for
percussion would probably sound like Parker's.
</P>
<P>
   Some jazz listeners will be mystified by the music's dreamy,
uneventful mood, but dancers will have no trouble understanding
Parker's intentions. With its dense layerings of African, Cuban,
Brazilian and Afro-American syncopation, ``Awakening'' clearly
aspires to be heard on the dance floor rather than in the jazz
club.
</P>
<P>
   Like most self-styled healers, Parker has his own image of Eden,
and it looks a lot like his childhood in Greenburg, a small town in
Westchester County. ``Greenburg was one of the first integrated
school districts in the country, so it was like a utopia
socially,'' he recalled. ``Since then it's gone downhill like the
rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's mother, a former jazz and rhythm-and-blues singer,
nurtured his interest in music. His father, who is part Cherokee,
taught him, as he put it, ``how to live in accordance with nature,
as the Native Americans did.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who is mainly self-taught, began drumming with kitchen
utensils at the age of 3. As a teen-ager, he played in jazz
ensembles and pop cover bands and went out at night to hear funk,
rap and Latin music. Coming home, he would often stay up all night
``because there was too much good music on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Parker came to New York City. Fordham University
offered him a scholarship to study religion and philosophy, but he
decided to enroll in the pianist Barry Harris' Jazz Cultural
Theater, a workshop for young musicians on Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go there and wait three hours for your five minutes to
play,'' he said. ``It had an old, grungy, dirty jazz feel to it,
and it was really beautiful.'' He paid his rent by drumming in the
Mighty Zippers, a band led by the former Woody Herman tenor
saxophonist Carmine Leggio that played at black social events in
Westchester County. Soon he was jamming regularly at Augie's, a
Columbia University haunt, with the alto saxophonist Jesse Davis
and the organist Larry Goldings.
</P>
<P>
   But, not for the last time, he became fed up with the jazz
scene. ``The black musicians were thinking Art Blakey; the white
musicians were thinking Bill Evans, and it felt old,'' he recalled.
With his wife, Lisa, a flutist, he ``ran away'' to Europe in the
spring of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In Barcelona, he went to a pawnshop and traded his drum set for
a djembe, a West African hand drum; he and Lisa traveled through
Spain, Portugal and France for a year, performing duets in the open
air.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York a few years later, Parker was introduced to
Terrasson, the French-American pianist, and the Nigerian-German
bassist Ugonna Okegwo. They hit it off instantly and began playing
together at Bradley's. Bop, French Impressionism, funk, Afro-Latin
_ the Terrasson trio ranged across all these styles, becoming one
of the most inventive live acts in jazz. Terrasson says that after
playing with Parker, who has an affinity for shifting tempos, he
felt ``as if I'd only been making love in one position.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has a theory about his rapport with Terrasson and Okegwo:
``Jacky and Ugonna are both mixed, and I'm mixed in my mentality,
so we don't think black or white; we're thinking as artists.''
</P>
<P>
   On his albums, Parker has surrounded himself with a remarkably
diverse group of musicians. The group on ``Awakening'' features,
among others, Lisa Parker, who is Anglo-German (she and Parker are
now divorced); the Puerto Rican percussionists Adam Cruz and his
father, Ray; the Brazilian vocalist Rita Silva; the black American
reedmen Steve Wilson and Sam Newsome, and the French-American
percussionist and vocalist Natalie Cushman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely international ensemble, and that's the
beauty of it,'' Parker said. Nor is the lineup just a matter of
pride; it's a full-blown program. His objective, he said, is ``to
bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, though, the man who wants to bring people
together now prefers to dispense with his band. Parker has recently
embarked on a career as a solo percussionist. Next spring, he hopes
to have a monthlong engagement at the Knitting Factory in Tribeca.
By playing solo, he believes, he can commune with a larger
ensemble, namely the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In his festively didactic concerts, Parker assumes the
ceremonial airs of a tribal leader, imploring his audience to form
an impromptu percussion chorus. Besides drumming and singing,
Parker makes what he calls ``body sounds'' by rapping on his chest
and thigh; he also creates rhythmic patterns out of grunts, huffs,
yelps and pants.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he's staking a claim to the territory mapped out
by Bobby McFerrin and Savion Glover. It's the kind of performance
art that works best in theaters, schools and small avant-garde
clubs where people aren't hovering over drinks and chatting with
their companions. Parker declares the jazz club ``almost
obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy for him to leave behind his jazz roots
altogether. While world-beat percussion covers a broader musical
terrain than jazz, solo instrumentalists are a hard sell. Jeff
Levenson, an executive at Columbia, Parker's label, commented:
``Leon is exploring where to go next, and it could be in the
direction of dance or visual art. The question is whether he can
harness his own creative spirit and give it an expression that
enables his fans to feel fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker is confident, though, that fans will come around to his
new concept. Cosmic forces, he said, are on his side: ``We've used
up all that outside kind of stimulus _ the drum machine, the
computer. So we're turning inward, to our bodies and our voices.
It's just a natural inclination.''

THOUSANDS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass.)  (Eds: With CAPITOL-SHOOTING) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their clunky strollers and squirming children,
in their sneakers and shorts and visors, the visitors from
Cleveland and Chicago, Puerto Rico and Washington itself, came to
the Capitol Tuesday eager to whisper their thank yous to two police
officers they never met.
</P>
<P>
   Not a week goes by that some police officer somewhere is not
felled by a bullet. Murder is routine in this country. And so,
generally, is the numb response. But this is different, the
visitors said. This is not some drug-laced street corner; this is
the Capitol, the frontline of Democracy, a place free of ordinary
menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nation's capitol,'' said Laurie Waller, 33, as she
headed for the back of the line with her 1-year-old in a stroller
and her 8-year-old walking alongside. ``This building means freedom
for the rest of us. It means the United States, and these men were
guarding it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbol of Democracy,'' said Steve Giblin, a visitor
from Cleveland who came here with his wife and four children before
heading home.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was echoed up and down the line Tuesday, as
thousands of tourists and Washington neighbors waited outside to
sign a condolence book and pay their respects to the two slain
officers, Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   One boy traded a visit to the Air and Space Museum to stand
under the hot sun in front of the Capitol for what seemed like
forever to him. A South Carolina mother rounded up her three
children to show them that Americans can act with dignity, not just
hatred. And hundreds of police officers, from states as near as New
Jersey and as far as Minnesota, waited patiently, their hats tucked
under their arms, to offer a slow, measured salute to two slain
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply said they sought to freeze a memory _ a pastel
blue sky, twin flag-draped coffins under a frescoed ceiling, the
sharp click of a uniformed officers' heels on the floor of the
rotunda _ a sliver of history to carry home with their T-shirts and
baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands who showed up here Tuesday, waiting up to two
hours in a line that snaked from the Capitol doors to the corner of
the street, the deaths of the two Capitol Hill police officers
stirred complicated feelings of loss, patriotism and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the usually bustling rotunda, visitors walked solemnly in
a circle around the coffins, mixing in with staff members, police
officers and members of Congress. They clutched at their cameras
while their children looked on uncomfortably, squinting up at the
oversized historical paintings, stealing quick glimpses at the two
coffins at the center of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Parents said they wanted their children to come away with a
sense of respect for police officers and to witness the pomp and
circumstance of a nation paying them tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Colella, a 45-year-old Boston homemaker, said she
``thought long and hard'' about whether to bring her 10-year-old
daughter, Stephanie, to file past the coffins. She decided yes,
``to show her this is the U.S. government and we don't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experience she'll take with her for the rest of her
life,'' she said. ``Hopefully, she won't see it this way again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among a public grown used to playground shootings and gunplay,
Friday's act by a gunman prompted few calls for a lockdown of the
Capitol or even for heightened security.
</P>
<P>
   A few visitors did turn their sights on guns, saying there are
too many floating around the country. ``What more can you do, and
how much more tax dollars can you spend?'' asked Angela Frazier,
33, a Washington native who stood with a bottle of water and a
white umbrella to block the midday sun. ``Maybe the right to bear
arms should be for law enforcement, and not civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frazier, who lives nearby, said she was drawn here for a
personal, none- too-common reason. As a teen-ager, she and her
friends used to gather on the Capitol grounds to ``make out'' with
their boyfriends, ``and the officers were always nice and
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   A few steps away from her, Burnice Kearney, 59, who worked for
the Parks Department, said he came with his wife as a gesture of
solidarity with the fallen officers' families. ``I felt it was
something we had to do,'' said Kearney, who gripped a bouquet of
flowers. ``It will give us a sense of satisfaction to know that we
did what we could.''
</P>
<P>
   As the children scrambled around the grounds or sat wearily on
benches, their backpacks slung next to them, they talked about how
the Capitol seemed quieter than the rest of Washington. One woman
set up a table with small paper cups to dispense water. At least
one person fainted from heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Colella said she was touched to see that the government had
planned such a noble ceremony for two of its guardians. It was a
fitting gesture, she said, for a building that belonged just as
much to them as to the senators and representatives who are elected
to serve there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a president to deserve the respect the
rotunda offers,'' she said, swiping tears as she spoke. ``They did
their jobs and gave their lives for it.''

BOSTON COLLEGE LOSES MAGLOS TO GREEK TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The upcoming basketball season was already shaping up
as a tough one for Boston College, but it got exponentially tougher
Tuesday when Kostas Maglos confirmed he was signing a three-year,
$1.35 million contract to play in his native Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Maglos, 22, an athletic 6-foot-10-inch forward/center from
Athens, said Tuesday he was not coming back to BC after signing for
$450,000 annually with Panathinaikos, the reigning Greek club
champion, which won a bidding war with another Athens-based team,
AEK, for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard decision,'' said Maglos in a telephone interview
from in Athens, where he had returned for the summer to try out for
the national team. ``I was ready to come back (to BC). I had said
no to both of those teams, but then Panathinaikos just made a
better offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglos averaged 13.3 points and 6.7 rebounds per game on a BC
team that went 15-16 overall and 6-12 in Big East last season. He
was projected to be the focal point of BC's young squad as its only
senior. Now sophomore Kenny Harley (4.5 points, 3.5 rebounds per
game) ranks as BC's leading returning scorer and rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you notice the improvement he made in a year's time, he
certainly had the chance to come back and be one of the better big
men in the league,'' said disappointed BC coach Al Skinner, who was
in Canada on a recruiting trip. ``He had a great opportunity to
really solidify his game and continue his improvement and maybe
become a first-round (NBA) pick. All I can do now is wish him
nothing but the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglos said he spurned earlier offers this year from both Greek
teams, including a $1 million proposal last summer from AEK. But
when Panathinaikos, which was unable to sign a player it had
coveted, came back and upped the ante by offering guaranteed money
in the first two years, Maglos reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great offer,'' said Maglos, who indicated he had
every intention of returning to BC after taking two summer school
courses. ``So it would be crazy for me not to take the money and
stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Panathinaikos made an offer he couldn't refuse. It was an offer
that allowed Maglos to earn a huge sum and enabled him to remain
home with his widowed mother, Maria, and his older brother,
Manolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if he had a good feel of what could happen for
him here,'' Skinner said, ``but I also think his mother wanted him
home and that had a little bit to do with it. I guess the money got
to the point where they thought it was a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that it's not a lot of money, but it's all
relative,'' he added. ``For an average individual, it's a lot of
money. For an NBA basketball player, it's not a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglos said he called Skinner Monday and informed him of his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they wanted me back,'' he said. ``I feel bad
because I know they were counting on me, but this was different. It
was my life and it was my decision. I just really want to thank
them for everything they did because without them, I wouldn't have
been able to get this money. It was the best experience for me. I
want to thank the college and the coaches and the team. I'm going
to miss them a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglos becomes the sixth player from last year's team to leave
the program. Seniors Mickey Curley, Duane Woodward, and Antonio
Granger graduated, sophomore Damien Foster transferred to the
Univeristy of Buffalo, and freshman guard Javier Rodriguez, a
native of Vitoria, Spain, turned pro with his hometown club team.
</P>
<P>
   BC returns six players, including three walk-ons, and will add
five freshmen and one transfer who sat out last season to fill out
a roster that now numbers 12.

RETIRED PROGRAMMERS WILL BE RECRUITED TO TACKLE `YEAR 2000' BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the request of the White House, two senior
citizens' groups have agreed to recruit retired computer
programmers to go back to work finding ``year 2000'' bugs in old
computer systems, the head of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons will conduct an
``aggressive outreach campaign,'' assisted by the National Council
of Senior Citizens, said John Koskinen, who was appointed by
President Clinton in February to lead the federal effort to
minimize disruptions to the government and the economy from the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many computers record the date as a 2-digit number and will
recognize the day after Dec. 31, 1999, as Jan. 1, 1900. The
resolution of this problem will involve the reviewing of millions
and millions of lines of computer programs, and finding all the
places where date information is stored. Some of the programs were
written decades ago, some in computer languages no longer widely
used.
</P>
<P>
   AARP spokesman Ted Bobrow said, ``Many people think you have to
be 20-something to understand this stuff, but there are people
who've been working on it for 30 or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industries are having trouble finding the programmers they
need for the job. Koskinen on Tuesday launched a public campaign to
improve awareness of the problem and unveiled a web page
(http://www.y2k.gov) with a job bank maintained by the Labor
Department, for potential employers and employees to register.
</P>
<P>
   AARP staff member Deborah Russell said ``The money is good, and
it's an opportunity to go back into the workforce for a finite
amount of time, an opportunity to be useful, to make a
difference.'' She said people who had programmed in early computer
languages like COBOL and FORTRAN were in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Kosikinen also said that a bill would be introduced in Congress
on Wednesday to make it easier for companies to share Y2K fixes
without fear of liability suits if the fixes cause new problems.
The bill would make companies liable only if they knew the
information was false or had reckless disregard for its accuracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the federal government itself, Koskinen said, there has been
some progress, but it will not be clear how much until later this
year. ``We have a lot of work under way; we've got people all
around the country focused on this problem,'' said Koskinen, a
former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``I
think it's too early to say there are going to be major problems,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal government was doing better than most small
companies, but not as well as some big ones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to get the federal government's own
computers fixed, he said, ``we're also engaged in a campaign to
encourage information sharing about solutions. It's clear that if
every organization in every country dealing with this issue has to
reinvent the wheel, there's not enough time left to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said that programmers were making progress with
software, but that sometimes the problem was not in computers but
in microchips that are parts of other machines. ``Increasingly,
people are focusing on what I've called growth industry of the
problem: embedded chips or integrated circuits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen was reluctant to discuss how many systems have actually
been fixed. ``We're moving through the proselytizing and organizing
phase,'' he said. But he added, ``We're running out of time for
people to be organized.''

GREEKS OFFER APOLOGY TO US OVER OFFICIAL'S REMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Greek government tried to calm tensions with
Washington Tuesday by dismissing the blistering words of the Greek
foreign minister against President Clinton as ``a parenthesis that
has already closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration quickly accepted what amounted to an
apology and said normal relations would resume. But observers who
follow Greece say that heated exchanges between the NATO allies the
past few days signaled frustration with a stalled peace process
between Turkey and Greece over the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   The contretemps between the United States and Greece started
over a single word. White House spokesman Michael D.McCurry called
the Cyprus disagreement a ``conflict'' instead of an ``invasion,''
the term the United States has used in the past to describe the
situation on the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
   Greece interpreted the change as a deliberate softening of the
US position. Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos accused Clinton of
``gross lies'' and suggested that Greek-Americans donate money to
Greece's defense budget instead of to US political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting angrily, the Clinton administration canceled a trip to
Greece by Thomas Miller, the new US special coordinator for Cyprus.
Speaking to reporters Monday, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said, ``When friends disagree and allies disagree, they
should share their concerns privately rather than resort to these
kind of insulting and spurious public criticisms.''
</P>
<P>
   That the administration has been unable to help restart the
stalled Cyprus peace process may have contributed to frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a lot of anxiety and anger at the Americans, who
may have promised more than they could deliver,'' said Eileen
Babbitt, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Babbitt has worked
on a project attempting to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Tozun Bahcheli, a professor of political science at Kings
College in Ontario and author of an upcoming book on Cyprus, said,
``Pangalos is a loose cannon,'' and he thinks ``he does a lot of
harm to Greece's image.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bahcheli added that, ``US diplomacy has not been successful
in narrowing the gaps (on Cyprus), so there's frustration on the
part of the Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, former governor Michael Dukakis, who follows events
in his ancestral homeland, said Pangalos is a smart politician who
sometimes ``lets things fly'' when speaking in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it means that the US-Greek friendship is in
jeopardy, and it certainly does not mean that Greek-Americans will
not be actively involved in politics here,'' Dukakis said. He said
that both Greece and Turkey have expressed disappointment as
mediation efforts by the United States and the UN have failed to
achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the profile of the Cyprus talks, Clinton last year
assigned one of his top negotiators, Richard Holbrooke, to shuttle
among Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. He also named a blunt-talking
career diplomat, R. Nicholas Burns of Wellesley, Mass., ambassador
to Greece. Clinton has nominated Holbrooke as ambassador to the
United Nations, where the negotiator promised to continue working
for peace in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of continuing tensions in the region, the government
in Athens said Tuesday that Greek coast guard ships fired warning
shots Monday at Turkish fishing boats within Greek waters of the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Greek authorities warned about 10 fishing boats to leave but
only half of them complied, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to calm the rhetorical jabs at Washington Tuesday, Prime
Minister Costas Simitis held a meeting about US-Greek relations
with several of his top aides. ``Greek-American relations are
good,'' spokesman Dimitri Reppas said later. ``An annoyance was
created on both sides. We believe this is a parenthesis that has
already closed.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official familiar with Greece accepted the
unofficial apology, saying, ``Now that we've made our views clear,
we believe it makes sense for both sides to limit themselves to
private discussions.''

SENATOR SEEKS TO BOOST SECURITY AT U.S. CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Warner, who for months was a lone voice
in calling for more security on Capitol Hill, is getting new
support from colleagues since two security guards were gunned down
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, R-Va., said the Senate Rules Committee would meet
Wednesday to consider enhanced security measures that would be paid
for with public funds and private donations. The senator said he
hoped the private support would blunt criticism about cost.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who heads the Rules Committee that oversees Capitol
security, envisions funneling visitors to the U.S. Capitol from an
underground center that could hold 30,000 people. The visitors
could see educational films and artifacts and would pass through
state-of-the-art security devices before entering the building that
houses the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take the level of security up to the next notch,''
Warner said in an interview, adding he intends to tap the military,
Secret Service and crime laboratories to determine just how to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesday, Warner announced he was asking for
an additional $14 million that would beef up security and could go
toward the visitors center. If approved, that would be added to the
$20 million the Senate appropriated in April for improved security.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a gunman burst into the Capitol and fatally shot two
Capitol Police officers, Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson. The
coffins of the slain officers lay in state in the grand Rotunda
Tuesday during an emotional ceremony attended by President Clinton
and members of Congress, while thousands of people gathered outside
to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in the shootings, Russell Eugene Weston Jr., who
relatives say is a paranoid schizophrenic, remained hospitalized
with gunshot wounds at a Washington hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said the ``tragic circumstances'' have given new momentum
to a proposal for a visitors center that he introduced in November
with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D. The the proposal
languished amid concern over the cost, estimated at $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings were the first in the Capitol since 1954, when
Puerto Rican nationalists fired shots from the House gallery onto
the floor, wounding five members of Congress. In 1983, a bomb
exploded outside a Senate office, but no one was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, the Capitol Police asked for sniper stations
in the ceilings of both the House and Senate and called for a tall
fence around the complex, but both ideas were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last week's shootings, lawmakers appeared to
be giving a fresh look at efforts to bolster security.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., who has led a crusade to reopen
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House after it was closed
in 1995 as a security measure, said he doubted such a Capitol
visitors center would prevent the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only would have happened farther out,'' Grams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grams said such a center had merit because it ``could add
convenience for tourists and give them a place to get out of the
rain and the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said ``the visitors center might be
good rather than having all kinds of screening at every door.''
Tourists to the historic building now pass through four Capitol
entrances by walking through a metal detector and placing
belongings on an X-ray machine, much like those in airports.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho, said a visitors center was worth
considering, but he added it could never guarantee safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can not create a fool-proof system in a society in which
there are violent people,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant majority leader, said
he did not want to see Capitol Hill blocked off from public access,
adding he ``hates'' to see how traffic is detoured away from
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to closing a two-block stretch of Pennsylvania
Avenue to vehicular traffic in the aftermath of the truck bomb
explosion at the federal building in Oklahoma City.

   Grams said the president overreacted because several security
breaches that happened around the White House were not related to
automotive traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several security breaches at the White House in
recent years. In 1994, Francisco Martin Duran fired shots from a
semiautomatic rifle at the White House but was tackled before he
could reload. Also that year, an unlicensed pilot named Frank
Eugene Corder flew over the White House and crashed on the lawn
south of the Executive Mansion, killing himself.

   Nickles said a Capitol visitors center would be a good
alternative to other proposals such as installing a fence around
the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that constituents walk in,'' Nickles said.
``We don't want to eliminate that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., cautioned against a
knee-jerk reaction to last week's violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should jump at it at this time,'' Roth said.
``This is the people's building and we ought to keep it open.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he did not see how a visitors'
center ``would substantially change the security equation,'' and
said Congress must keep in mind what kinds of signals any walling
off of the Capitol might send.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantively and symbolically, it says something about what
kind of society we live in,'' Graham said.

SINGER CHICO RYAN, 50; PLAYED BASS FOR SHA NA NA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Chico Ryan sang ``Teenager in Love,'' his bandmates handed
him a hanky as he wailed his way through the kitschy '50s pop
lament. His histrionics usually elicited more laughs than tears.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ryan, who sang and played bass with the mock '50s rock act
Sha Na Na for 25 years, died Sunday at Mediplex of Beverly (Mass.).
He was 50.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Sha Na Na, Mr. Ryan toured the world. He also
appeared in the classic musical ``Grease'' with John Travolta and
Olivia Newton-John. He and his bandmates appeared in the film as
the band Johnny Casino and the Gamblers. Earlier this year, they
traveled to Los Angeles, where they performed at a party
celebrating the 20th anniversary re-release of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ryan's real name was David-Allen Ryan. He was raised in
Arlington, Mass. He attended Boston University and graduated from
Emerson College.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth he played with the Minutemen from Arlington. During
his college years, he performed with the Rockin' Ramrods, a local
rock band that performed regularly at the Surf Ballroom in
Nantasket Beach, outside of Boston. The Ramrods released an album
under the name Puff and once toured with the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   He then fronted his own band, Rainface, before joining the
Happenings, an act based in New Jersey that recorded the top 10
hits ``See You in September'' and a rock update of the Gershwin
classic ``I've Got Rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Sha Na Na, he performed satirical versions of the
the hits of the '50s while decked out in a gold lame costume or
black leather jacket. The band hosted a syndicated TV show from
1976 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Susan (Patience); a daughter, Kimberley, of
Wenham, Mass.; his mother, Marie (Mahoney) Ryan of Arlington; a
brother, Peter, of Lowell, Mass.; and a sister, Pamela, of Holyoke,
Mass.

EATON CHALLENGING WHEELER, THOMAS FOR TACKLE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I._ If anything, Chad Eaton used to be the guy who
could provide a bit of comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   He was the guy who two years ago once asked the media who had
won the Patriots' game from the day before. Those were the days
when Eaton was on the practice squad, and he wasn't required to
dress for the games. So he'd stay home and watch the ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the tattooed Eaton is still a hoot, but he's
showing his serious sides as well, playing well enough to be
pushing both Mark Wheeler and Henry Thomas for a starting tackle
job.
</P>
<P>
   And he's taking that very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not coming in hoping I'll be a role player,'' said
Wheeler. ``No way. I want to play. And the coaches are telling me
every day I'm competing for a starting job.''
</P>
<P>
   He's come a long way since the days when Parcells got him off
the scrap heap in Cleveland, where former Patriots assistant Bill
Belichick first noticed him. Back then he was just a crazy kid from
Washington State University who used to be reprimanded for hitting
Drew Bledsoe at WSU practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of myself back then I didn't have the
confidence,'' Eaton said. ``I had the size and the strength. I
didn't have the ability to take the next step. The coaches are
giving me a chance. Being on a practice squad two years ago and now
competing for a starting job, that's a big step for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everyone knows I'm in the mix. The guys in front of me
know that. They're going to play the best guys. We have five
preseason games, and the best guys are going to play. Whoever plays
best is who will open against Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   His adrenaline seems to flow a little harder than most. He has a
side of him that other players don't have, and he uses those
intangibles to motivate himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I say this?'' he said. ``The edge I have on them is
that I love camp. I love going out there. Right now I have a quad
bruise the size of Texas on my left leg. I couldn't even get into
my car last night. The coach says, `what are you on? What are you
doing?' That's what I'm all about. I'm not going to take any time
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys here ... they have a little nick here and a
little nick there, and ... this isn't college any more. You come
out and you play. If you're gonna be on the sideline, I don't even
want you on my team. It gets to the point where I care about
playing. I mean, Ted Johnson has a full blown hamstring, Ted
doesn't stop. He's going to make the team. He doesn't have to be
out there, but he loves to play. We have guys who sit on the
sidelines. You have to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more encouraging when you're nicked up. Right now my leg
hurts, my hands are swollen. It's bad, but you actually start
liking it after awhile. The offensive line, they're hurting. so
when I look into (center) Dave's (Wohlabaugh's) eyes and he's a
little sore, that's my edge. That's what makes me go harder.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots came out with no pads in both sessions Monday
after a long scrimmage Sunday, Eaton was miffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually mad that we didn't have the pads on today,'' he
said. ``I kind of miss the days with Bill (Parcells) when we used
to go out and beat the crap out of each other and being all bloody
and seeing who's standing at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be the last man standing at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   He played in the scrimmage Sunday after coaches advised him
against it. ``I was out there for 12 or 13 snaps,'' he said.. ``I
shouldn't have been out there. I worked on my reads and just to
help out the defense. I was trying to be a leader on the white team
with Zo (Scott Zolak), but it didn't work out. We lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows going from the practice squad, to backup work a year
ago, to starter is a long road. So he's realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely a run-stopper,'' he said. ``I'm not focusing on
a pass rush. I just want to be out there first and second down _ if
I emerge as a pass rusher, great. My game is strength and shutting
down the run. Centers aren't going to beat me. I'm quick enough
where if I get my hands on them _ I just need to make sure Ted
Johnson doesn't have a center on him so he can make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to change how he perceives the coaches view him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear is that they think that I feel that being a
second-string player is OK,'' he said. ``Usually practice squad
guys don't make it as starting players. Who makes it as a starter
from practice squad? I was on the practice squad in Cleveland and
New England. The coaches might say he wasn't a big-time draft
choice, so he doesn't want it. Why do they think that? I don't
know. I think the frame of mind is changing. Bobby Grier came up to
me saying, `start thinking of yourself as a starter' and that's
what I'm doing. I have it written on my wrist bands: stay low and
start. I write that every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He is serious, but in a funny way. He has removed some of his
tattoos. He no longer bleaches his hair. The only discolored part
of him now are the bruises on his body. And they feel good.

 &HT;    Investagator thinks public discussion of Tailwind, recognition
of veterans important
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the Pentagon's lead investigators on the
Tailwind-CNN controversy said Tuesday that the public debate over
the secret mission may bring long-overdue recognition to veterans
of covert military operations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Tailwind veterans, who have been hesitant to speak about their
behind-the-lines operations even decades after the fact, came
forward to publicly protest what they feel was an unfair
characterization of them as possible war criminals, said Charles
Cragin, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their training, given their background, understanding
what they did and how they did it, you can appreciate their
reticence to engage in public discussion. This instance cast such
an aspersion on their heroism and essentially branded them, if
true, as war criminals, they coalesced because of the nature of the
accusations,'' said Cragin, a Navy veteran and former judge.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN special report last month charged that Operation Tailwind
targeted American defectors in Laos in September 1970 and used the
deadly nerve gas Sarin during the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Following an outcry from veterans and an internal CNN
investigation, the network retracted the story and apologized to
Operation Tailwind participants. In addition, CNN is negotiating
financial settlements with several veterans of the mission
mentioned in the report. Retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, cited in the
CNN report as one of the key sources, has already reached a
financial settlement with the network.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's own investigation, during which Cragin
interviewed several key team members, found no evidence to support
the CNN allegations, Cragin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cragin, in Atlanta to address a conference on assistance for
families of military reservists called to active duty, said
Secretary of Defense William Cohen has ordered a further
investigation into whether additional recognition is due the 13
Americans who participated in Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   All were wounded during the four-day battle in Laos which Cragin
said produced the single largest intelligence document cache of the
Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so impressed with the heroism of this group of men
and they probably never got the recognition they deserved because
of the secret nature of the operations that they were employed
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN producers April Oliver and Jack Smith, fired for their role
in the show, charged that the Pentagon used undue influence on the
network and veterans to disparage the story.
</P>
<P>
   But Cragin said the facts, culled from three different sets of
military documents, did not support the CNN thesis and that he saw
no undue influence being exerted on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had such pressure been brought to bear, I would have been
aware of it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Braves ondeck with the Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (9-2, 3.20; 14-10,
2.08 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. RHP Steve Parris (1-1, 4.40; 1-0,
1.29).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Smoltz has been on the DL twice this season and along the
way has needed cortisone injections in his back. Maybe other clubs
should investigate his method. Since last coming off the DL on June
20, Smoltz is 5-1 with a 2.52 ERA and brings a four-game winning
streak into tonight's start, his 16th of the season. He has grown
increasingly stronger with each outing, averaging 7 1/3 innings and
108 pitches in his last six performances. In his first nine, Smoltz
lasted just an average of 5 2/3 innings and 86 pitches. He is
coming off his first complete game and shutout of the year, a
three-hit, 10-strikeout performance in Pittsburgh Saturday. The
Reds don't want to hear about it. Smoltz beat them 5-1 in
Cincinnati on May 12, going eight innings and allowing just four
hits. Parris moved into the Reds rotation in late June, as manager
Jack McKeon keeps rolling his last two pitching spots. It is his
sixth start, and he hasn't won since his Reds' debut on June 28
(5-2 over Detroit), which also was his first major-league start in
nearly two years. His ERA as a starter is 5.06, and he usually
doesn't last long, working beyond the fifth just twice. But
right-handers are hitting just .162 against him. His only
appearance against Atlanta came when he was a Pirate, when he beat
the Braves 2-1 July 12, 1995. His nine strikeouts that day remain
his career high.

 &HT;    Golf Notebook: Pepper loses track of Pak
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why no angry reaction from Dottie Pepper after three-putting the
18th hole at the Giant Eagle Classic Sunday, allowing a third win
in four events for the amazing Se Ri Pak? Pepper, it turns out,
despite missing a 4-footer for birdie, thought she had tied Pak at
14-under par and was headed for a playoff. Pepper walked off the
green and asked her caddie, John Killeen, why he was removing his
bib. ``We're going back to the tee, aren't we?'' Pepper said.
``No,'' the caddie said. Watching up ahead as she played the 18th,
Pepper was unaware Pak had two-putted for birdie and finished at
15-under.

   Can Nicklaus avoid hip surgery?
</P>
<P>
   His closing 67 at Riviera notwithstanding, Jack Nicklaus might
be on a collision course with hip-replacement surgery. After
finishing at 8-over-par 292, Nicklaus, 58, declared it his last
tournament of the year and said he will start an aggressive program
with his longtime physical therapist, Pete Egoscue, to strengthen
his legs and mid-section to aid mobility in the left hip. Is that
realistic? Probably not. Cartilage in Nicklaus' hip basically has
been ground away over the years, leaving minimal cushioning. In
other words, it's bone against bone. ``I decided long ago that my
first option was exercise,'' said Nicklaus, who just ended a streak
of 154 majors in a row. ``If it works, great. If not, then at least
I'll be in good condition when I have an operation.''

   Atlanta's Billy Andrade seemed to be crawling out of his
year-long slump with a tie for 14th at Hartford July 5, but he took
a step backward last week by missing the cut at another favorite
event, the CVS Charity Classic in Sutton, Mass. Although Andrade
began the year strongly with a tie for sixth at Phoenix Jan. 25, he
has missed the cut in 10 of 19 events and is 104th on the money
list at $177,083. A strong iron player normally, Andrade is ranked
155th in greens in regulation. ... Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar will
spend 13 days with his family in New Hampshire after finishing play
Aug. 2 in the Palmer Cup, where his partner at St. Andrews will be
Tech teammate Bryce Molder. Kuchar has yet to say whether he will
defend at the U.S. Amateur at Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y., Aug.
24-30. ... Father Peter Kuchar might have turned off at least one
agency in the pro talks that germinated after Matt contended at the
U.S. Open. While speaking about endorsement contracts for Matt,
Peter, according to one agent, said he wanted some deals, too. ...
Don't push Golf Channel commentator Doug Tewell, 49, to the Senior
Tour just yet. He's enjoying one of the most efficient seasons on
the PGA Tour. With a tie for fourth at Hartford and a tie for sixth
at Hilton Head, he's earned $192,087 in nine events _ $21,343 per
week. ... Peachtree City's Franklin Langham has recovered
impressively after missing five straight cuts in the spring.
Although disappointed to have lost his Sunday lead at the Deposit
Guaranty on the way to a runner-up finish, the former Georgia
player should retain his PGA Tour card; he stands 101st with
$184,765. ... Ben Wright, 65, whose sexist comments about the LPGA
Tour forced his suspension by CBS-TV two years ago, will be back on
the air in September as a regular contributor to a syndicated show,
``Golf 2000 with Peter Jacobsen.'' The two-minute segment will be
called ``Quite Wright.

 &HT;    Nelson facing an uncertain future
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Such is the fragility of life on the Senior PGA Tour.
A week ago 50-year-old Larry Nelson of Marietta, Ga. had earned
more than $1 million in 1998 and was pondering a U.S. Senior Open
title to accompany his three PGA Tour majors. Now Nelson is
uncertain about when he can compete again and what the long-term
future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   Test results in Orlando this week revealed a herniated disk in
Nelson's neck that will keep him off the Senior Tour for at least
five weeks and could require surgery. Nelson had to withdraw from
the U.S. Senior Open last week when pain in his neck and shoulder
sapped his right arm of strength to compete. On Monday, he
underwent an MRI ordered by his Orlando orthopedic surgeon, Dr.
Norton Baker, and was told of a protruding disk that appears to be
pressing on a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, Nelson's big concerns were drives in the fairway and
greens in regulation. Now, he's at his Atlanta Country Club home
wearing a cervical collar for two weeks, gulping cortisone pills to
reduce the inflammation and hoping that an exercise and
strengthening program can alleviate the problem without an
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that I never have to have the surgery and I just
have to cut back my schedule,'' Nelson said Tuesday, ``but surgery
is possible. It's something I'm not really going to know for two or
three weeks. ... There is a slim chance that it could be
career-threatening, or career-ending, only in the sense that I
wouldn't be able to play as much as I want to play. But it's not
like I wouldn't ever play again.''
</P>
<P>
   From the conversation with Baker, a 25-year friend, Nelson said,
``I could tell it was going to take a while and that he was
concerned. He said he didn't want to operate on my neck because the
neck is never the same. He said it definitely would be my last
resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a two-time winner this year with $1,087,753 earned,
said, ``My right arm was like a noodle'' before his first round
Thursday at Riviera. He withdrew after eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerves tell the arm to work,'' he said, ``and they had no
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is encouraged that the medication already has eased some
pain, but he realizes that a longtime problem is unlikely to be

RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC INDICATORS ARE IMPROVING, NEMTSOV SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An architect of Russia's fiscal recovery strategy
allowed Tuesday that foreign investors need some good news to stem
renewed fears that the government is losing control of its
financial destiny, a belief that has driven stock and bond markets
to near-record lows this week.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, said some of
the economy's key indicators are beginning to tick upward, and he
added that the government will soon begin to issue regular and
detailed economic reports to investors that would prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov said the markets' steep slide has been due mostly to a
``public relations problem'' caused by a vacuum of reliable
information about the course of Russia's fiscal recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate of tax collections, a crucial indicator of the
government's progress toward solvency, will show a modest increase
in July, he said. And the government will issue new policies late
this week aimed at stabilizing the value of the ruble and laying
out its plans for issuing new debt, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he stressed that the government will fight any
drop in the value of the ruble in relation to other currencies.
Devaluation would raise prices domestically and slash the value of
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no devaluation,'' he said, adding confidently,
if jokingly, that ``devaluation will happen with other governments,
not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets have been on a stomach-churning ride
since May, when it became clear that the government was headed
toward insolvency unless international lending agencies stepped in
to bolster currency reserves and calm investors who were pulling
their money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund voted on July 13 to immediately
add $4.8 billion to Russia's gold and currency reserves after
President Boris Yeltsin decreed a sweeping overhaul of the
country's tax and spending policies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other lending agencies have promised to increase
that package to a total of $22.6 billion if the government actually
carries out its new policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after that announcement, Russia's stock market leapt
by more than 25 percent and short-term interest rates dropped from
as much as 150 percent to 50 percent. But little has happened since
then, in part because Russia's Parliament _ a stumbling block to
full implementation of the reforms _ will not take up some of the
most important economic changes until the middle of next month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the stock market has given up all its gains.
The price of one much-watched government bond _ a repackaged
version of international debt run up by the old Soviet Union _ has
hit record lows.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday the rate on the Russian version of an American
treasury bill neared 80 percent, up some 30 points from a few weeks
ago. Russian blue-chip stocks regained about five percent of their
value Tuesday, following six straight days of losses that had
sliced some 25 percent from the most popular index of the market's
value.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nemtsov said Tuesday that investors are overlooking promising
aspects of the Russian economy, including industrial sectors like
automobile production, which are registering large gains in output
and a threefold reduction in strikes.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the government is drafting new plans to sell
off vast chunks of state-owned companies, from oil to
telecommunications, in a way that will encourage competition and
net the government a healthy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov noted in particular the government decision this week to
sell nearly a seventh of its 41 percent stake in Gazprom, a
natural-gas monopoly that is Russia's largest company. Investors
have reacted skeptically to that decision, noting that Gazprom
shares have fallen more than a third in the last two weeks and that
a decision to sell now would amount to a fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   But Nemtsov said Tuesday that it generally makes sound economic
sense to shed state interests in private companies, and he said
that the government would not sell part of its Gazprom stake until
the stock price had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Russia needs _ what the government needs _ is a very
transparent policy to explain to everyone what is happening'' on
economic issues in the executive branch and the Parliament, he
said. The government hopes to begin issuing weekly reports on key
economic issues, including statistics on tax collection, currency
issues and market activity.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blitzer, a leading analyst of Russian economic issues,
said he agreed that foreign investors have overreacted lately to
the dearth of good news about the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the sentiment is negative and the market's sort of
lost confidence in the government and in a whole string of positive
actions the government's taking _ selling off part of Gazprom,
cracking down on tax evasion, and so on,'' said Blitzer, director
of emerging market research at the investment firm of Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette. ``The government hasn't done a very good job
of getting its information across.'' &QL;

CITIZENS FINANCIAL EARNINGS RISE 11 PERCENT IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citizens Financial Group Inc., the third largest bank in
Massachusetts and New England, said earnings in the just-ended
quarter were up 11 percent on last year's levels but down slightly
compared with the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Providence, R.I. bank reported higher expenses as well as
increased sales of investment products.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, whose Massachusetts franchise is Citizens Bank of
Massachusetts, said net income for the three months ending in June,
the company's second fiscal quarter, rose to $50 million from $45.1
million a year ago. The number was 8 percent below last quarter's
record earnings of $54.3 million, in part due to a higher tax
bracket, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, a large community bank with 274 branches throughout
four New England states, has been spending heavily on hiring,
compensation, and benefits after buying Connecticut-based Bank of
New Haven last August. Non-interest expense rose 15 percent
year-on-year to $125.5 million, an amount roughly flat on the
previous quarter's level.
</P>
<P>
   Noninterest income, from sales of investment products and
motgages and from trust operations, was $50.4 million, up 27
percent on a year ago but down 6 percent on the previous quarter,
mainly due to flat Treasury bill prices. Net interest income, or
earnings from loans, leases and other bank mainstays, was up 6.2
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, with $17 billion in assets, is majority owned by
Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, which has 76.5
percent. Bank of Ireland holds the remainder.

NEW MASSACHUSETTS BUDGET UP $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When he was lieutenant governor, Paul Cellucci vowed to
reorganize government and slash the number of jobs by 7,500, saving
more than $650 million. But a new state budget, expected to be
signed Thursday by now Acting Governor Cellucci, will increase
state spending by $1 billion over last year's total and the number
of state jobs will have risen by almost 700 people.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the $19.5 billion budget are earlier plans to
eliminate the Commonwealth's multiple correction agencies for a
savings of $10 million and merge the state's 20 human services
agencies into four, for a savings of $127 million. Another $15
million that was to be saved by privatizing the management of two
higher education institutions is also absent from the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little appetite in this building for that kind of
initiative without a fiscal crisis behind it,'' said Charles D.
Baker, secretary of administration and finance, blaming the
Democratic-controlled Legislature. ``You need the sword of Damocles
ready to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci and former governor William F. Weld were supposed
to wield that sword. With great fanfare 2 1/2 years ago, the two
unveiled proposals to eliminate five cabinet secretaries, kill 76
state agencies and 263 boards, and reduce the Commonwealth's
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieutenant Governor Paul Cellucci heard loud and clear from
the citizens of Massachusetts: State government is too large, too
costly and too intrusive,'' said a 1996 Weld-Cellucci report that
took state government to task for duplicative efforts, burdensome
regulations, and too many hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the proposals have largely gone unrealized, and the
number of executive department workers has actually increased by
698 people since that time. In January 1996, there were 54,238
workers in the executive department of state government. Currently,
there are 54,936 employees, according to the Office of
Administration and Finance. The bulk of the additional hires _ 397
_ are working in a new state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials decided last year to change course and
stop asking the Legislature to pass all of their ``reinventing
government'' proposals. Instead, officials decided to pick off and
push small pieces from their report.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Cellucci said he understands that big
ideas take time to become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sometimes takes more than one year or two years to
get major proposals through,'' Cellucci said. ``I think welfare
reform was an example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Weld fought and lost for a welfare overhaul in
1994, then they campaigned before the voters to change the welfare
laws and were finally successful in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But in ticking off the issues he would keep fighting for, if
elected, Cellucci talked about an income tax cut, the death
penalty, and teacher testing legislation. He never mentioned any of
his proposals to downsize state government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the $1 billion increase in state spending that
Cellucci will authorize Thursday represents a 7 percent growth rate
compared to the 2.3 percent inflation rate. Of his five
reorganization proposals he resubmitted this year, three were
relegated to studies and two were adopted by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But while many of the proposals from the 117-page report have
disappeared, the philosophy behind it has not. As Cellucci signed a
historic $770 million tax cut bill last Tuesday, he reminded his
audience of the importance of fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the government's money, as Bill Weld used to remind
us all the time,'' Cellucci said. ``It's the taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the administration's ideas require legislative approval,
a major stumbling block with a Democratic-controlled Legislature
concerned about preserving jobs in an election year and currying
favor with the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   But one item could have been put into place with a stroke of a
pen, said State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, who is running for
governor against Cellucci in the Republican primary. In their
report, Weld and Cellucci said they would have executive agencies
manage their organizations with 5 percent less over two years _
which Malone calculates would have saved about $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cellucci added $102 million in his budget proposal for
executive agency operations, Malone said. ``Paul Cellucci is more
interested in reinflating government than reinventing government,''
said Malone. ``If he had any spirit of reinvention he's certainly
lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokesman for the office of administration and
finance rejected Malone's contention as ``categorically false.''
Spokesman Joe Landolfi said Cellucci's budget proposed a 3.4
percent increase over last year, with the bulk of the money going
for health care, education reform, and money for cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the downsizing effort has accomplished this: Five
Cabinet secretaries were eliminated, though four of the five
survived under new titles; a few agencies were merged; the county
system of government is gradually being abolished; several toll
gates on the Massachusetts Turnpike were torn down; and the
20,000-page Code of Massachusetts Regulations dating back to 1907
has been rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plan was ill-received in the state Legislature and to a
large degree disappeared from sight,'' said Cam Huff, a senior
research associate at the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a
government watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   David Tuerck, executive director of the Beacon Hill Institute, a
conservative think tank, said it was the so-called Pacheco bill
that derailed many of the initiatives, virtually preventing the
privatization of all government services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the opportunity for downsizing would have come from
privatizing government services,'' Tuerck said.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone says Cellucci should have launched a campaign to tout
the downsizing initiatives that have worked, and urged voters to
tell the Legislature to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have the kind of passion and follow-through and
conviction to get the job done,'' Malone said. ``He buckled to the
liberal spenders.''

OFFICIAL SUGGESTS MEXICO OPEN DEBATE ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In its push to create a more democratic society,
this country of 96 million people has tackled a number of defining
issues over the last several years such as multiparty elections, a
weak and often corrupt criminal justice system, and the yawning gap
between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes perhaps the most sensitive topic of them all:
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   During a women's health conference here 12 days ago, Juan Ramon
de la Fuente, the country's secretary of health, surprised people
on both sides of the issue by saying that it is time for Mexico to
open a national debate on legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue should be reviewed (and) debated, with objectivity
and seriousnes,'' de la Fuente said. ``All points of view should be
heard respectfully. We need to be tolerant, not just in talk but in
practice, accepting from the outset that there will be different
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that abortion has been mentioned
publicly. The subject is broached regularly by politicians,
religious leaders, and activists on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   What makes de la Fuente's remarks notable, specialists here
agree, is that they come from the government's highest ranking
health official, also a highly regarded doctor appointed by
President Ernesto Zedillo, who has remained silent on the issue.
Other colleagues in the ruling party Cabinet have supported de la
Fuente's call that the Mexican Congress should consider the outcome
of the abortion debate, including possible legislation legalizing
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction to de la Fuente's comments from some
leaders in the Catholic Church, which staunchly opposes abortion,
has been remarkably positive. One Cardinal, Juan Sandoval Iniguez
of Guadalajara, said late last week that the church would
countenance debate as long as the discussion were honest and
without a predetermined agenda to alter abortion's illegal status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to raise the discussion,'' Sandoval Iniguez told a
Mexico City daily. ``We are in a democratic society, but this has
to be done with principles and values.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other predominately Catholic Latin American countries,
abortion is illegal in Mexico, except in cases where the mother's
life is at risk or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.
Under provisions of most Mexican states, both the woman who
receives an illegal abortion and the person who performs it can be
imprisoned from 6 months to 8 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such strict laws have led to an increasing number of underground
abortions and abortion-related deaths and injuries, say
legalization supporters. One leading women's health group estimates
that 1,500 women in Mexico die annually from such procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman decides to have an abortion, it's usually for a
grave reason, not for pleasure,'' said Guadalupe Salas y
Villagomez, a specialist on Mexican abortion laws and coordinator
for the Demographics of Mexican Society, a nongovernment
organization. ``Now we're seeing it as a public health issue,
because women are the nucleus of the family and because
complications can lead to death or to longer and more expensive
hospital stays.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Institutional Ruling Party and those who oppose
any new debate on abortion offer a number of theories to explain de
la Fuente's pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders of both the center-right and center-left
parties say the Institutional Ruling Party is merely raising the
abortion controversy to distract voters from other serious issues
such as severe budget cuts, the stalemate with rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas, and the government's request that
taxpayers bail out a bankrupt government lending agency. Cynics
call it a ploy to attract more support and votes from women to the
Institutional Ruling Party.
</P>
<P>
   Others say de la Fuente's statement reflects the growing
pressure on the government by international business firms, such as
pharmaceutical companies that favor legalized abortion to create a
market for drugs like the ``morning after pill.''
</P>
<P>
   And a few even point to the mounting political influence from
Washington, where the Clinton Administration vetoed a bill last
spring that would have prevented family planning organizations from
lobbying to overturn abortion prohibitions in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that make this a new and dangerous
chapter in the abortion discussion,'' said Jorge Serrano Limon,
national president of Mexico's Pro-Life Committee. ``First, you
have the secretary of health stating his opinion on this. Then you
have a congress dominated by the (center-left) party. And you have
the president of the United States pressuring Mexico to legalize
abortion. Together these things make us worry very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smith, a religion professor at Ripon College in Wisconsin
who specializes in Latin America, says abortion discussions, such
as those seen recently in Argentina and Brazil, will become more
common as these countries open up their political systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the result of the redemocratization of these
societies, especially as more women influence politics and as more
parties try to increase the popular vote,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Mexico City, however, it remains unclear how
comfortable residents are to talk about such a sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have trouble communicating with my children about things
like sex before marriage and diseases,'' said Adriana Montoya, a
45-year-old department store clerk and mother of three teenagers.
``Abortion brings up all kinds of questions about God, love, and
money. I don't know how I feel.''

FLAGSTAFF RESTAURANT FILLS A KNEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ I was biding my time up here, enjoying the
cool weather between the Arizona Cardinals football team's
two-a-day practices, and decided to get a bite to eat downtown.
</P>
<P>
   With its big front windows and rustic brick-wall interior, the
Mountain Oasis looked like a relaxing place for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea . . .
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lots of plants, a hipper-than-thou wait staff and
a vaguely New Agey menu _ I had lemon tahini dressing on my salad,
if that tells you anything _ the Mountain Oasis offers a great
idea:
</P>
<P>
   Massage.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch and a massage _ I know how that sounds, but this wasn't of
the ``gentleman's lunch'' variety that you find at strip clubs (or
so I have heard).
</P>
<P>
   This was all on the up and up. Dean Davidson, a licensed massage
therapist, sets up shop every Tuesday and Thursday, right in one of
the front windows. ``Shop'' in this case being one of those massage
chairs you lean into face first, with a hole in the pad where you
place your face.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that hole is there so that you can breathe while
you're getting your massage. But in this case, it's also handy
because it blocks your view of the rest of the restaurant, whose
customers can watch Davidson knead your back and shoulders while
they munch their lunches. I don't mind being gawked at, but I
didn't want to watch it happen.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was my thinking when I entered. As I watched a
woman get a massage, I also watched the three people sitting at a
table 2 or 3 feet away watching her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Except that they didn't, much. Oh, sure, there was the
occasional glance, but no elbow-in-the-ribs, ``Look what he's doing
now!'' gawking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are a bit reluctant to sit too closely'' at
first, Davidson said. ``I get some people who have a troubled look
on their face. There may be an initial reaction, but it kind of
dissipates. It becomes normal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's even more true for the person getting the massage. I paid
the $15 fee, which gets you about a half-hour of tugging and
rubbing (purely for research purposes, you understand).
</P>
<P>
   At first, I felt a little conspicuous. After all, it's not just
the customers at the Mountain Oasis who can see you. Anyone walking
down the sidewalk out front gets a good look through the window,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But after about five minutes, I couldn't have cared less who was
watching. Davidson tugged and stretched my muscles, often to the
point of pain. Yet when he let go . . . ahhh. I could have been
naked and slobbering in a lawn chair in front of my in-laws, and it
wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Even the occasional ``BLT and a gyro!'' shouted by an overly
eager waiter failed to break the spell.
</P>
<P>
   Many clients start out a little agitated, Davidson said, but the
feeling passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I can feel the shift,'' he said. ``That's the
whole point.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson has been massaging customers at Mountain Oasis for two
years, he explained as he moved his Isuzu Trooper in an attempt to
stave off a parking ticket. Before that, he massaged in a
health-food store for three years. He started in a Wild Oats
grocery store in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to bring massage out into the open, and make it
available to literally anyone walking by,'' he said, as many people
did just that. ``I love working in the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he's a good fit. Forgive the unfair stereotyping, but
dressed in a distressed denim shirt, Dockers khakis held up by a
woven-rope belt and brown walking shoes, Davidson looked the part
of a massage advocate. His longish gray-brown hair furthers the
impression.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's serious about bringing massage to the masses,
shouldn't Davidson take his show on the road? Isn't giving massages
in a place like Mountain Oasis just preaching to the choir?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. And that's why he's planning to set up his massage chair in
a city park, once he takes care of the needed permits.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's on to something big here. I love his attitude _ with
it, massage could catch on everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I say we start with newsrooms. &QL;

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) Microsoft Corp. denied it
committed any antitrust violations and countersued 20 states that
had charged the software giant with anti-competitive behavior. The
company said the states unconstitutionally undermined its software
property rights. It filed a formal denial to allegations in
antitrust lawsuits by 20 states and the U.S. Justice Department.
The company has been accused of trying to crush competition for the
Internet browser market to protect its virtual monopoly for
operating systems. In its counterclaim, Microsoft said that the
states were seeking ``to impose state-law restrictions on and
thereby impair Microsoft's rights under the Copyright Act and the
Constitution.'' The company also denied allegations contained in
the Justice Department's complaint that it asked Netscape
Communications Corp. executives to illegally divide the market for
Internet browsers. (summary from wires.)

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than
defeat youngsters, says Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the mailboxes of Americans overflow with sweepstakes offers
from big-name magazine publishers, a new class of con artist is
using the same promise of riches to bilk the elderly out of
hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes often tailor their solicitations to sound like the
authentic contests, promising sweepstakes prizes, discounted
vacations and extravagant gifts. But the authorities say the
promises are empty, and often so are the pockets of the victims at
the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Most often the victims are elderly, and their losses can be
devastating. A retired dean of women at the University of
Massachusetts lost $80,000 to a con man who convinced her that she
had won the American Family Publishers sweepstakes and that Ed
McMahon would deliver her prize. A former businessman in North
Dakota paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for promised prizes he
never received.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing swindles are telemarketing schemes. Armed
with lists of people known to play legitimate sweepstakes, the
fraudulent telemarketers tell their targets, or marks, that they
have won a valuable prize and then try to persuade the marks to pay
phony fees and taxes _ sometimes amounting to thousands of dollars
_ in order to collect.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes are increasingly popular in Canada, where
cross-border fraud has become a thriving industry, even as U.S.
authorities have made inroads against telemarketing crime.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting primarily Americans, fraudulent telemarketers in
Canadian cities exploit the jurisdictional differences that arise
when criminals are in one country and victims in another, while
also benefiting from weak laws and light sentences.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian telemarketer under indictment in Seattle grossed
$70 million a year, and some authorities estimate that consumers
lose hundred of millions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why sell drugs and risk a huge sentence, when you can make all
kinds of money in telemarketing with less risk and a kiss if you
get caught?'' said Barry Elliott, the head of the Ontario
Provincial Police's national telemarketing fraud task force,
Operation Phonebusters.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way on both sides of the border to deal with
these problems. After President Clinton and Prime Minister Jean
Chretien discussed the issue last year, a U.S.-Canadian task force
was formed. But progress in coordinating investigations and
strengthening Canadian laws has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen people across the continent saying, `We're
getting out of this business,''' said Jonathan Rusch, special
counsel at the Justice Department in Washington and co-chairman of
the task force. ``They have switched schemes and moved their
operations, but they have not stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The target of choice is the elderly, who often have more assets
to steal and can be more susceptible to the blandishments and false
friendship of smooth-talking hucksters. Sometimes, too, the elderly
are reluctant to report losses because they are embarrassed or fear
family members will have them declared incompetent. Operation
Phonebuster records show that more than 70 percent of the Americans
victimized by Canadians are over 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketing fraud describes any crime in which a telephone is
used to deprive victims of money or property or to misrepresent the
value of goods or services being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent telemarketers play off the popularity of legitimate
sweepstakes and contests, often incorporating them into their cons,
but they differ in critical ways. Most significantly, the
fraudulent operations promise big prizes to try to get money in
advance from ``winners,'' which is illegal. The promised prizes or
gifts are never delivered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there are countless schemes and variations, following are
the five basic scams, according to law-enforcement officials and
consumer advocates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Prize or sweepstakes frauds, the most common type in the
United States last year, according to the National Fraud
Information Center in Washington. People are guaranteed a prize or
gift, but the caller requires money up front, saying it is needed
to cover shipping costs, taxes or processing fees. Once a mark
makes the first payment, con artists make repeated calls seeking
more money by claiming that the value of the award has increased.
Some schemes send trinkets, but most never send anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advance-fee loan or credit card schemes, most often directed
at people with financial problems. Callers offer loans or credit
cards but require payments in advance. Borrowers never receive
loans; people offered credit cards get only a standard application
form.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment schemes. Victims are sold securities or goods that
appear to offer high profit, but often the products don't exist or
are almost worthless. Because returns on legitimate investments may
not be realized for long periods, these schemes can go undetected
for months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foreign lottery scams. People are offered a chance to
``invest'' individually or as part of a club in tickets for
well-known foreign lotteries, such as the Irish Sweepstakes.
Victims are often deceived about the chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recovery rooms. In perhaps the most insidious scheme, callers
claiming to be lawyers or government officials promise to help
people who have lost money to scams recover the losses _ for an
advance fee. The callers may be the same people who defrauded the
victim initially, or they may have bought names of victims from
other telemarketers.

The company has been accused of trying to crush competition for the

states were seeking ``to impose state-law restrictions on and
thereby impair Microsoft's rights under the Copyright Act and the

WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU WIN THE POWERBALL 
</HEADLINE>
 WON-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Ok, let's say for the sake of argument that you defy
the 80.1-million-to-1 odds and win the $250 million Powerball
jackpot tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Someone has to win it sooner or later, so let's assume
it's you.
</P>
<P>
   If you opted for the cash payout, you just won, depending on
your state's tax rate, roughly $132 million, after state and
federal taxes, or, if you took the annuity, about $6.7 million a
year for 25 years, again after taxes. Quit whining about the taxes.
You paid $1 for a ticket and now, by the random grace of some
numbered balls, you are as rich as sin.
</P>
<P>
   What are you going to do now?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, don't lose your ticket. The lottery office isn't
going to be open until Thursday morning and, knowing you, a lot
could happen to that ticket in the meantime. Don't go showing it
off to the neighbors, and for heaven's sake, don't let the dog
anywhere near it. Seal it in a baggie and put it in the freezer. Go
to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, first thing Thursday morning, get the ticket out of the
freezer, double check the numbers, kiss the ticket, dance around
the kitchen laughing hysterically, and then put it back in the
freezer. Call in sick. Have some coffee. Then get on the phone and
find the best tax lawyer/investment counselor/money manager you
can. Ask them what to do. Then do whatever you want. You're rich.
</P>
<P>
   Ok, next: Move. You're rich. You can afford to live somewhere
lse, preferably some place with better weather and no state income
tax. You can always come back to visit. In your private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Do you tell anyone that you won? You don't have to. Your
anonymity can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   You realize, of course, that within one hour of your name being
made public you are going to have blood kin you never knew existed.
Plus, every television, radio or newspaper reporter and
photographer in a 300-mile radius is going to be camped on your
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   As fair and responsible members of the press, they are going pry
into every nook and cranny of your life, including that little
incident in the sixth grade, and - this is guaranteed - they are
going to hate you. They are going to hate you because you are
undeservingly rich and they aren't. In fact, you haven't even won
yet and they already hate you because you might win and they won't.
</P>
<P>
   So, best keep a lid on it. Besides, being anonymous offers more
possibilities for fun. Take $10,000 - what's 10 grand to you, big
shot? - go to the mall, stop the first person who strikes your
fancy, say, `Here's $10,000,'' and walk away. That would be
extremely cool.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, you really should give away a fair amount of
money - 10 percent at least. It's the decent thing to do and you
know it. Just write out a check to your favorite charity, walk into
their office and hand it to the receptionist and walk out.
</P>
<P>
   You could give it all away. That would be something. You could
just give it all away to set an example for the rest of us about
charity and rejecting the culture of materialism. Of course, the
rest of us would think you were an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   This also would be extremely cool: Assuming you have enough,
secretly buy up controlling interest in your company, keep going to
work as if nothing had happened and wait patiently for some SOB to
cross you. Then have them fired.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't do anything trashy. If you're going to
buy a new car or jewelry or a house, buy something tasteful. On the
other hand, if you bought something trashy, it would make the rest
of us feel somewhat better. We could sniff and tsk, tsk and assure
each other that if we had won, we would have had better taste.
</P>
<P>
   An acquintance said that if he won, he would fill a big garbage
can with $100 bills, pour it out on his bed and roll around in it
naked. This, while not trashy, is not an image one cares to dwell
on.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, money can't buy happiness, although for $133
million you could buy some really major giggles. The history of
lotteries is full of people whose lives were ruined by wealth, who
died broke and disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   So if you spend your millions foolishly and have only grief and
unhappiness to show for it, don't come crying around to us with
your sad story. We already hate you. &QL;

 UNDATED: other telemarketers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission and other federal
and state agencies have brought hundreds of civil and criminal
fraud cases against operators of direct-mail and telemarketing
schemes disguised as legitimate sweepstakes and contests.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest civil cases, a Southern California firm,
Direct American Marketers Inc., sought bankruptcy protection last
year after a Missouri judge ordered it to pay $8.6 million for
misleading consumers. The company was accused in several states of
mailing authentic-looking checks for $7,500 and urging people to
call a 900 number for details on how to collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   The small print on the back said the average call would cost
$30; some people paid as much as $400. In exchange, most people
received a check for $1. In Missouri alone, the company pocketed
$4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, most telemarketing frauds in the United
States were run out of boiler rooms where 20 or 30 people made
calls simultaneously. Often a single operation took tens of
millions of dollars a year from thousands of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating and prosecuting were difficult because victims
were usually far apart and because many were elderly and reluctant
or unable to testify. Authorities knew where the boiler rooms were
and what they were doing, but efforts to attack them were
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Two undercover operations developed new tools to counter those
problems. The first was Operation Disconnect, in which FBI agent,
Timothy Healy posed as a salesman with an automatic dialing machine
supposedly capable of placing 12,000 calls a day.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the machine gave him access to top-level fraudulent
telemarketers, Healy gathered evidence on their operations from
1991 to 1993. The result was 300 convictions in 15 cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next came Operation Senior Sentinel, which capitalized on con
artists' penchant for going after the same victims repeatedly. The
FBI and Justice Department, with help from the American Association
of Retired Persons, identified elderly people who had been victims
of previous schemes and recorded their calls from telemarketers.
The investigation was coordinated with state and local authorities
across the country and has led to 1,000 convictions since the end
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Today's swindlers are more likely to set up smaller operations
in hotel rooms or apartments. Such operations are called ``rip and
tears'' because they can be dismantled and moved quickly, and
operators rely on cell phones to make detection tougher.
</P>
<P>
   THE REFUGE: North of the Border, A Homegrown Industry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few American telemarketers sought refuge in Canada after
the crackdown. Most of the fraudulent operators in Canada,
authorities say, are homegrown. And telemarketing fraud aimed at
Americans has risen steadily since late 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police say at least 50 rooms are operating in Toronto, 30 in
Montreal and 20 to 30 in Vancouver. There also are countless
smaller rip-and-tear operators. Montreal police said they know of
200 active mail drops used by telemarketers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even though police may log dozens of complaints about a
telemarketing operation, stopping one is difficult, particularly
when the victims are across the border, as half the victims of
Canadian telemarketing fraud are, according to police data.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in both countries say their cooperation is
improving, but investigations and prosecutions involving two
jurisdictions still are slow and complex. Formal approval for
investigations commonly takes six months. If charges are filed,
extraditing Canadians to the United States, where the victims are
and the sentences are tougher, takes time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fraud on this scale involves levels of planning and
coordination. An operation needs a large number of telephone lines
or cell phones, a script, people to place calls and a list of
potential victims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for victims is insatiable. Even a small operation
makes thousands of calls a day. The highest prices are paid for
``suckers lists,'' which carry names and phone numbers of people
who have lost money before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The demand for names spawned a cottage industry of
semi-legitimate businesses known as ``lead companies'' that provide
names and phone numbers of people who have bought goods through
legitimate sweepstakes. The lists can be bought from sweepstakes
companies and direct-mail businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police said some lead companies also buy names of victims from
fraudulent telemarketers, so the telemarketers collect twice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies also run phony sweepstakes, offering a
vacation or car to people who send in entries, unwittingly
providing telemarketers their name, address and phone number. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices can go up to $3 a name for previous victims on a
suckers list,'' said Laurier Quesnel, a police sergeant who heads a
14-member telemarketing fraud unit in Montreal. ``When we go into a
boiler room, we find boxes and boxes of lead names.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most lead companies are in the United States. Police on both
sides of the border say they have difficulty cracking down on them
because the owners claim to have no knowledge of what is done with
the lists they sell.
</P>
<P>
   THE PITCH: Painting a Picture And Picking a Pocket
</P>
<P>
   The heart of telemarketing fraud is the pitch. The callers learn
by example and through trial and error how to create fantasies and
instill trust in their victims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing as a salesman, what we are doing, is
painting a picture,'' one telemarketer said in a conversation
recorded by the FBI. ``Soon as they pick up the phone, and I get on
the phone with them, my hand is on the way. My hand goes, two hands
go, through the phone. One hand goes up the wall and starts
painting pictures, the other hand is in their checkbook and writing
it out.''

   Some con artists spend weeks setting up victims for big losses.
They call two or three times a day to gossip. One in Toronto sent
an elderly woman a new puppy after her dog died, police said.
Sometimes theirs is the only voice an elderly person living alone
hears on a regular basis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We targeted people who were homebound,'' one explained at a
sentencing hearing in California. ``It was kind of like
entertainment for the homebound.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they often do their homework. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helen Cole, a retired dean of women at the University of
Massachusetts, found herself tricked by a man who identified
himself as Richard. He knew many details of her life, including
which charities she supported and how much she loved the
university. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard claimed falsely that he was from American Family
Publishers, the big sweepstakes company, and that she had won $2
million. Another $2 million, he said, would go to the university to
endow a scholarship in her name. He said that he and Ed McMahon, a
representative of the real sweepstakes, would deliver the money.
But first Mrs. Cole, an 88-year-old widow, would have to send
$20,000 for a bond to cover taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I said I couldn't come up with that much, he said he was
willing to help pay for the bond because he would get a bonus,''
she said. ``He said he discussed it with his wife and they would
take out a second mortgage on their home to pay half the bond. I
sent him my $10,000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cole ultimately sent Richard $80,000 over several months,
cashing in her stocks and other investments. He stopped calling
only after she told him she had run out of money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was a gullible fool,'' Mrs. Cole said. ``But this
guy, he was so persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews in Canada and the United States, victims
and the police marveled at the smoothness of the telemarketers'
pitches. Relatives said they were unable to convince victims that
they were being conned.
</P>
<P>
   Police said elderly victims often ignore hard evidence. Since
September 1995, for example, Montreal police have intercepted and
returned $7.5 million in courier mail deliveries to known
telemarketing mail drops and rooms, most of it from Americans. But
victims are not always grateful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe us,'' Quesnel said. ``The telemarketer is a
lot more convincing than we are on the phone. We returned one check
six times to the same person.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MARK: Twice Bitten, But No Less Shy
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Leo Flaming, a wealthy retired lumber man from
West Fargo, N.D., began getting calls from two men who said they
were from Montreal and specialized in selling unclaimed estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there was a $16 million estate,'' Flaming, 83, said
in an interview. ``They said in Canada people leave an estate and
if no one claims it they put it on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaming said he was told he could pay $500,000 and the estate
would be converted into certified checks with $16 million that
would send him certified checks worth $16 million. ``I said I
wasn't interested,'' he said. ``It sounded too good. Two weeks
later they called back. I said no. They called every day and I did
some research and finally I sent them a check.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flaming said he and a business partner put up the $500,000 and
mailed it to Montego Bay, Jamaica. For two weeks, he said, the
callers offered excuses for delays in sending him the $16 million.
Then there was silence.
</P>
<P>
   Flaming said he hired a lawyer and a private investigator, but
no one could locate the men. A later police inquiry discovered that
the check had been cashed at a currency exchange in Montreal. The
callers had strung Flaming along only until the check cleared.
</P>
<P>
   After that experience, Flaming said, he was bombarded with
similar schemes. ``Once they got my name, boy did I get telephone
calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flaming said he rebuffed all callers except one. He sent $10,000
to a woman in Montreal who said he had won a lottery. He also sent
her an airplane ticket so she could deliver his winnings in person,
but he and his wife were left standing at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed like a very nice girl over the phone,'' he
explained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flaming insisted that he lost only $260,000 in the schemes and
that he participated in no others. But an investigation by the FBI
determined that Flaming lost far more money. Because he had waited
nearly a year to complain, the trail was cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flaming has now expended somewhere in the vicinity of $700,000
to $800,000 and will take no advice from anyone regarding this
matter,'' the FBI report said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a worker at the Federal Express plant in Memphis
telephoned Operation Phonebusters in Canada. She said a man named
Flaming was sending a package to a known fraudulent telemarketing
operation in Montreal. The package was returned to him. &QL;

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEGAL TELEMARKETING AND SCAMS: A PRIMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with SWEEPSTAKES-ELDERLY-II) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are tips from government agencies and nonprofit
organizations on how to distinguish legitimate telemarketing calls
from scams:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have really won a prize, you do not have to send money
in advance or provide your credit card number to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   _ You do not have to call to claim a prize. Legitimate companies
notify you in writing.
</P>
<P>
   _ You do not have to buy anything to enter a legitimate contest.
</P>
<P>
   _ In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to request a fee in
advance to obtain a loan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for information in writing. Wait at least 24 hours to
evaluate a proposal. Discuss it with other people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons has developed
programs to help its members protect themselves from fraud. The
organization found that a key difference between victims and those
who avoid the scams is the ability to simply hang up. It stresses
the need to plan ahead and know what to say when a stranger calls,
because the longer a person stays on the line, the greater the
chance they will become a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, which enforces telemarketing
rules, offers two free booklets, `Tips Sheet' and `Bookmark,' that
contain advice and information about consumer rights under
telemarketing laws. Write to the FTC Public Reference Branch, Room
130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20580.
The commission also has a web site at www.ftc.gov.
</P>
<P>
   People who think they have been victimized can call their state
attorney general's office. They also can seek help from the
National Fraud Information Center, a nonprofit organization
affiliated with the National Consumers League. The toll-free number
is 800-876-7060. The web site is www.fraud.org.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Phonebusters is a task force set up by the Ontario
Provincial Police in Canada to combat telemarketing fraud. It
collects data on specific companies and pitches and shares it with
law-enforcement officials in Canada and the United States. The
toll-free number, which can be used from the United States, is
888-495-8501. The web site is www.gov.on.ca/phonebusters.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS `TERRIFIED' TEXAS TEEN DID NOT BURN BOY, 8  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAUL McKAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ The teen-ager accused of dousing an 8-year-old
East Texas boy with gasoline and setting him on fire on his
birthday denies any involvement in the offense and was
``terrified'' into giving an incriminating statement, the youth's
defense attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer William E. ``Bill'' Hall said 13-year-old Don Wilburn
Collins _ whose request for release from detention was denied by a
judge Tuesday _ may have been pressured into telling investigators
he was present on June 28 when Robert Middleton was splashed with
gasoline and burned over 99 percent of his body in the rural
Splendora-area subdivision where the boys were neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County investigators maintain that Collins _ who is
in custody in the juvenile justice system on allegations of
aggravated assault and injury to a child _ gave a statement when he
was taken into custody July 2 in which he admitted being present
when Robert was burned. Investigators have said he blamed another
boy who lives near the neighborhood northwest of Splendora for the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Splendora is about 30 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, however, said Collins was ``scared to death'' and
``terrified'' into giving the incriminating statement shortly after
he was picked up by police and taken into custody at gunpoint while
television news crews hovered around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gangbusters arrest,'' Hall said. ``Guns were pulled
on him The media was there. It's entirely conceivable to me how,
after he was snatched up that way, that adults could get him to say
anything they wanted him to say. It's obvious to me that the
investigators had already made up their minds that he had done
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He denies any involvement whatsoever,'' Hall said of Collins.
``He was terrified when he gave the statement. It's quite possible
he told (investigators) what they wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Robert _ who is in critical condition
at the Shriners Burns Hospital-Galveston where he is being treated
_ told his mother and two nurses that ``Don did it'' before
sheriff's investigators obtained a warrant and took Collins into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Robert's sensitive condition, investigators say they
have not been able to obtain a detailed statement from him as to
what exactly did happen to him on the wooded trail where he was
burned a short distance from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was living with relatives next door to the Middleton
family at the time of the episode. Court documents allege that
Collins had threatened to hurt Robert on the day of the burning
because Robert, who was celebrating his eighth birthday, reported
to his father that Collins had stolen his fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Collins _ who have maintained since his arrest that
the teen-ager is innocent _ say his mother died several years ago.
His father has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Green, a Conroe lawyer who has been appointed by
juvenile Judge Mason Martin as Collins' temporary guardian,
declined comment about the teen Tuesday after Judge Mason Martin
ordered a psychological evaluation on the teen-ager and scheduled
another detention hearing for Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Collins wept Tuesday after Martin refused to release him.
Prosecutor Bill Pattillo told the judge that the teen would be a
flight risk and argued that further detention would be in Collins'
best interest because threats have been made on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Pattillo also cited the seriousness of the offense as reason
enough to keep Collins in the county's juvenile detention center, a
lockup in which he has been held since his arrest earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall urged Martin to release the youth to the custody of an
uncle, noting that ``a 13-year-old boy can't go far on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge gave no reason for not releasing him at this time,
and I don't want to be putting words in the judge's mouth,'' Hall
said. ``But it's my understanding that he's not even going to
consider releasing him until a psychological evaluation can be
done, and I can't argue with that. I think it's important that we
get a psychological evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously disappointed that he couldn't be released
today so that he can be with people he loves. But I'm optimistic
he's going to be released soon. Arrangements have been made for him
to be taken to a safe place within the county's jurisdiction if he
is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been discussed and tentatively arranged.''
</P>

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BUSINESS AIR FARES LEVEL OFF; CLAIM FREQUENT-FLIER
MILES; DISNEY SHIP SETS SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in ``t'' category.) 
(mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look now, but typical business air fares finally appear to
be holding steady. The reasons why are a matter of some dispute.
But after having to contend with steadily rising fares from 1995
through 1997, as the airline industry struggled to return to
financial health after its $14 billion hemorrhage in the first half
of the decade, business travelers are likely to welcome any
leveling off, whatever the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent evidence of stability is contained in the
American Express domestic air fare index, which shows that from
October 1997 through May of this year, typical one-way business
fares rose only 1 percent, to $452. In contrast, those fares
climbed 16 percent in 1997 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In its first-ever domestic air fare report, released a week ago,
the Air Transport Association found that average ticket prices
overall (that is, business and leisure fares combined) increased
last month only 2.2 percent over fares in June 1997. So far this
year, the association added, average fares remained relatively
unchanged, increasing only 1.7 percent for a 1,000-mile one-way
trip, to $141.80 from $139.38.
</P>
<P>
   In an obvious dig at American Express, which has compiled its
fares index for eight years, the association said its report ``is
based on actual prices paid by the vast majority of the flying
public,'' rather than relying ``on estimates or only on tickets
purchased by customers of a particular company or on a limited
number of routes.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Abernathy, manager of public affairs for American
Express, shrugged off the implied criticism. ``In all the years
we've put out the index, we haven't heard a word out of them,'' she
said of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Differences aside, there is general agreement that stable fares
are not the result of a single event, but a combination of factors.
Corporate travel managers cite the success of negotiated discount
fares and corporate policies that impose restrictions on everything
from what carriers to fly to flight times to routes and even to
preferred airports. But the main reason, many business travelers
say, is that the airlines are almost certainly responding to
election-year pressures from Washington, which is hinting that it
may reregulate some air fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that pricing suddenly stopped escalating, that's
suspicious,'' said James Haynes, president of the Atlanta-based
Commercial Travelers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers have another explanation, obviously, including
lower-priced aviation fuel, improved productivity, lower interest
rates for leases on planes and, of course, competition.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, members of the frequent-flier programs of AMR's
American Airlines and US Airways can begin claiming awards for
travel on either airline. And at a date to be announced ``in the
near future,'' the carriers said Tuesday, members of both carriers'
programs will be able to combine miles from each program in order
to claim awards on either airline.
</P>
<P>
   Because of hot temperatures in many cities, Delta Air Lines will
not check live animals as baggage through Sept. 15. Passengers who
had planned to fly with their pets during that period can cancel
their reservations without penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Third Time Around
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too late to book passage on Thursday's maiden
voyage of the Disney Magic, Walt Disney Co.'s twice-delayed ship,
the company said limited berths were still available for most of
the Magic's cruises in August. For September and later, there is
ample space on the ship's weekly sailings from Port Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   All sailings include three or four days at Walt Disney World
Resort followed by a three- or four-day Bahamas cruise.

   C &UR; .M.O. &LR;  wonders if the San Francisco Chronicle is
``transmitting covert political advice'' to  &UR; President Clinton &LR; 
``under the guise of astrology.'' The president is a Leo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was told: ``Adversaries think they can force your
hand, but they neglected one very important detail. You can always
say `no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: ``You put up with all the hassle because you knew you'd
be proven right in the end. The end is finally in sight.''

   &UR; TOUGH GUYS PUT UP POLITICAL DUKES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The London Times reports that  &UR; Sean Connery &LR;  donates $7,871 a
month to the independence-minded Scottish National Party.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of that figure adds fuel to speculations that
Connery's politics are the reason he has yet to be knighted, says
the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Daily Record went on the record when Connery failed
to make knighthood in June, at the same time poking fun at the
suave actor's pronunciation: ``Sean is shnubbed onsh more! ... It
is another shameful rebuff for Scotland's No. 1 son, verging on a
national insult.''
</P>
<P>
   (Meanwhile, the Telegraph reports that  &UR; Queen Elizabeth  &LR; made
 &UR; Petula Clark &LR;  a CBE, Commander of the British Empire, in ceremonies
at Buckingham Palace last week.)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger &LR; , who with special permission, holds
dual citizenship in the United States and Austria, may decide to
run for the presidency of Austria. Schwarzenegger was last there
for the second (and final) inauguration of  &UR; Thomas Klestil &LR; , whose
term is six years long.
</P>
<P>
   The movie star ``has ambitions,'' Austrian diplomat  &UR; Hans &LR; 
 &UR; Janitschek &LR;  told the New York Post. ``There is no doubt about it.
And I think he has a better chance of getting elected president of
Austria than he does governor of California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be the crown of our country,'' columnist  &UR; Wolf &LR;

one step in Buzz the Fuzz, a fund-raising drive for terminally ill

</P>
<P>
   The idea _ cops get dollar sponsors for shaving their heads, &LR;

is an 18.6 rating instead of a 16.4 rating, and if Dennis Rodman
can help her get it, she's willing to do that. That's her version
of Jerry Springer letting people throw chairs at one another.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BUSINESS AIR FARES LEVEL OFF; CLAIM FREQUENT-FLIER
MILES; DISNEY SHIP SETS SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in ``f'' category.) 
(mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look now, but typical business air fares finally appear to
be holding steady. The reasons why are a matter of some dispute.
But after having to contend with steadily rising fares from 1995
through 1997, as the airline industry struggled to return to
financial health after its $14 billion hemorrhage in the first half
of the decade, business travelers are likely to welcome any
leveling off, whatever the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent evidence of stability is contained in the
American Express domestic air fare index, which shows that from
October 1997 through May of this year, typical one-way business
fares rose only 1 percent, to $452. In contrast, those fares
climbed 16 percent in 1997 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In its first-ever domestic air fare report, released a week ago,
the Air Transport Association found that average ticket prices
overall (that is, business and leisure fares combined) increased
last month only 2.2 percent over fares in June 1997. So far this
year, the association added, average fares remained relatively
unchanged, increasing only 1.7 percent for a 1,000-mile one-way
trip, to $141.80 from $139.38.
</P>
<P>
   In an obvious dig at American Express, which has compiled its
fares index for eight years, the association said its report ``is
based on actual prices paid by the vast majority of the flying
public,'' rather than relying ``on estimates or only on tickets
purchased by customers of a particular company or on a limited
number of routes.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Abernathy, manager of public affairs for American
Express, shrugged off the implied criticism. ``In all the years
we've put out the index, we haven't heard a word out of them,'' she
said of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Differences aside, there is general agreement that stable fares
are not the result of a single event, but a combination of factors.
Corporate travel managers cite the success of negotiated discount
fares and corporate policies that impose restrictions on everything
from what carriers to fly to flight times to routes and even to
preferred airports. But the main reason, many business travelers
say, is that the airlines are almost certainly responding to
election-year pressures from Washington, which is hinting that it
may reregulate some air fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that pricing suddenly stopped escalating, that's
suspicious,'' said James Haynes, president of the Atlanta-based
Commercial Travelers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers have another explanation, obviously, including
lower-priced aviation fuel, improved productivity, lower interest
rates for leases on planes and, of course, competition.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, members of the frequent-flier programs of AMR's
American Airlines and US Airways can begin claiming awards for
travel on either airline. And at a date to be announced ``in the
near future,'' the carriers said Tuesday, members of both carriers'
programs will be able to combine miles from each program in order
to claim awards on either airline.
</P>
<P>
   Because of hot temperatures in many cities, Delta Air Lines will
not check live animals as baggage through Sept. 15. Passengers who
had planned to fly with their pets during that period can cancel
their reservations without penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Third Time Around
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too late to book passage on Thursday's maiden
voyage of the Disney Magic, Walt Disney Co.'s twice-delayed ship,
the company said limited berths were still available for most of
the Magic's cruises in August. For September and later, there is
ample space on the ship's weekly sailings from Port Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   All sailings include three or four days at Walt Disney World
Resort followed by a three- or four-day Bahamas cruise.

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a pointed reminder of California's role in
electing presidents, the city gave each member of the Democratic
Party convention site selection committee Tuesday a Los Angeles
Kings jersey _ emblazoned with a large ``54.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 54 as in 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of what's
needed to win,'' City Council President John Ferraro told the
committee, which is visiting to decide whether Los Angeles will
host the Democratic National Convention in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These not-so-subtle reminders of California's political clout
were coupled with pleas and promises of what the city can offer and
its historical ties to the Democratic Party. They include the
President John F. Kennedy's nomination during the 1960 Los Angeles
convention and the state's support for President Clinton in the
last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there for you then; we're here for you now,'' an
announcer intoned in a special video presentation designed to show
off the Staples Center sports arena, which is under construction
downtown and would be the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center, owned by developer Ed Roski and Denver oil
billionaire Philip Anschutz, is scheduled to open in 1999 as the
permanent home of the Lakers and Clippers professional basketball
teams and the Kings hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members were presented with tickets to the first
Lakers home game scheduled for Nov. 4, 1999, in a show of
confidence about the opening of the $300 million arena.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leiwecke, president of the Kings, said the developers stood
ready to make changes in the Center to help win the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of event we built this for,'' Leiwecke said.
``It is the home of the Kings, the Lakers and the Clippers. But it
is also to be part of the community and to have events that involve
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, with its 160 luxury suites and 32 guest suites,
could be used to help bring in money for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's tour of Los Angeles began with a three-course
breakfast at the Convention Center, during which the city made its
formal bid setting out what it offers in terms of facilities, hotel
rooms, transportation, security and communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   It cited the 93,000 hotel rooms available in the Los Angeles
area, enough space for each state delegation in the Convention
Center. The proposal also cited the city's ability to shift work
hours to ease traffic and provide the latest technology for
broadcast and other productions.
</P>
<P>
   The city also offered to provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of the
convention on its cable station as well as full-time security.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members held closed sessions in the afternoon to
question city officials and others about specific concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it was a day of entertainment and sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast, that began when a wall of white balloons was
exploded as the door to the Convention Center hall as trumpeters
blared a fanfare, the committee members saw a stuntwoman dressed in
a white angel's costume descend some 60 feet from the ceiling as
other ``angels'' distributed a copy of a CD-ROM with the formal
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning presentation that included walking through the
Convention Center facility next to the Staples Center site, the
committee was taken to the Central Library where groups of cheering
children lined the entranceway to greet them as two Chinese dragons
and a Chinese band played.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was reminded of the diversity of Los Angeles and
how it has served to adopt new comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my council district, there are 250,000 people,'' Councilman
Mike Hernandez said. ``Yet, there are 85 different ethnic groups.
You should bring the convention here because this city represents
what America will look like in the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members said they were impressed with what
they saw and heard, but were withholding judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Seven cities are bidding for the convention, which local
officials have estimated could bring in $160 million and 30,000
visitors. Other cities include Philadelphia, Boston, Minneapolis,
New Orleans, Miami and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The day's activities ended a tour of the new Getty Center with
its views of the city from the ocean to downtown and an evening
reception at Mayor Richard Riordan's private residence in
Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a Republican, said the bid to host the convention has
wide support as he promised a city willing and able to provide for
the Democratic Party's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is the city that is the crossroads to the world,''
Riordan said. ``We will be the capitol city of the next
millenium.''

SHOCKING NEGLECT REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Witnesses recited a litany of abuses at California
nursing homes Monday at a Senate hearing, telling of malnutrition,
bone-deep bed sores and other symptoms of severe neglect.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel, headed by Iowa Republican Charles Grassley, also
released a General Accounting Office report finding that one-third
of California's nursing homes had ``serious or potentially
life-threatening care problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had the problem licked'' after legislation was
enacted 12 years ago to remedy such problems, said Grassley.
</P>
<P>
   ``To imagine that these things are going on today in one or more
nursing homes in the state of California is simply intolerable,''
he said. ``We will not stand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley indicated, however, that he is not seeking new
legislation but rather stronger enforcement of existing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, scheduled
through Tuesday, were upstaged last week after President Clinton
announced a set of 14 reform proposals that emphasized stepped-up
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, as well as the state's health director, reacted
with both skepticism about the GAO figures and promises to rid the
state of negligent facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't quibble at all with the desire and the obligation to
get rid of bad facilities,'' said Paul Willging, executive vice
president of the American Health Care Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But Willging said accepted government surveying methods put the
number of nursing homes posing ``an immediate and serious jeopardy
to residents'' at 1 percent nationwide, with an additional 5
percent of homes providing ``substandard'' care.
</P>
<P>
   California Health Director Kim Belshe took strong issue with the
hearing, refusing to send state officials to testify. In a letter
to the committee, Belshe said the panel had unfairly singled out
California and had already drawn conclusions ``to which we take
considerable exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Belshe said that many nursing home problems are created by
federal regulations, some of which she called ``seriously flawed.''
Belshe also questioned the credibility of some witnesses, saying
they ``appear to have their own agendas,'' and she concluded that
Grassley's panel ``does not appear to be genuinely interested in
exploring the critical issues associated with the system of nursing
home oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses _ nursing home residents, their relatives and
staff _ told the Senate committee of terrible neglect at several
California nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Malnutrition, dehydration, filthy rooms and beds, and unanswered
calls for assistance were common at several homes, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   John Davis, a nursing home resident from Santa Cruz, Calif.,
complained of conditions in several homes in his videotaped
testimony, but the names of the facilities were edited out by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also said that care tended to be worse for Medicare
and Medicaid residents than for private payers. And they noted that
substandard facilities seem to know when state inspectors are
coming because they suddenly intensify efforts to clean rooms and
bathe patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited my husband every day but two in the two months he
was in this facility,'' said Ellen Curzon of Lakeside, Calif. ``In
61/2 weeks, he lost 35 pounds, developed decubitus ulcers on the
buttocks and became so dehydrated he flinched when touched . . .
Every single day, I had to literally hunt for someone to change
him.'' Curzon is suing the facility, which she did not name.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said that despite federal and state regulations,
``certain California nursing homes have not been and currently are
not sufficiently monitored to guarantee the safety and welfare of
their residents.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not name the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO used data from federal surveys and state complaint
investigations on 1,370 California nursing homes. Of these, 407, or
nearly one in three were cited by state surveyors as having
``serious or potentially life-threatening care problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that surveyors frequently miss problems and
that those homes that are identified are not sufficiently
penalized. The GAO said federal regulators ``took a lenient
stance'' toward facilities showing violations, and said the state
Department of Health Services normally grants a facility a 30- to
45-day grace period to remedy violations except in extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
   Belshe said in a statement that many of the reforms proposed by
the Clinton administration ``are identical to California policies
that are already in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   These include criminal background checks of nursing home
employees, immediate fines on nursing homes that commit serious
violations and staggered inspections so that operators do not know
when inspectors are coming.

FOR LUNGREN AND DAVIS, ABORTION STANCE IS CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's two major gubernatorial candidates,
Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren, don't agree on much
when it comes to taxes, tobacco, guns or the environment. But even
though both are Catholic, it is the emotional issue of abortion on
which they are most dramatically divided.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's most populous state _ one of just 15 remaining
that provide state funding for abortion in most cases _ such clear
definition has prompted forces on both sides to proclaim the
California's governor's race to be the nation's premier
battleground over abortion and reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the pro-choice lieutenant governor, has said that
abortion must remain a private decision between ``a woman, her
physician and her God.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, the anti-abortion state attorney general, has cited his
status as a practicing Catholic, saying he believes in ``the
sanctity of innocent life and its protection as a matter of
societal good.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis pledges to maintain state financing for abortion and
family planning services for California women, particularly
military women and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren opposes legalized abortion except in cases of rape,
incest or when the life of the mother is at stake. He has said he
will veto state-financed abortions for Medi-Cal recipients and
oppose birth control services to minors. He supports parental
consent laws, and a ban of late-term abortions, except when the
mother's life is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Both pro-choice and anti-abortion lobbies are keenly aware of
the high stakes involved in the election, and they intend to pump
both money and manpower to influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is ground zero,'' said Tanya Zumach, the Northern
California director for CARAL, the state arm of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ``If we can't hold
the line here, there's no hope elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has the endorsement of feminist icon Gloria Steinem,
who founded the nonpartisan Voters for Choice, and Harriet Stinson,
founder of California Republicans for Choice, who predicts that GOP
women will desert the party in droves over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren's anti-abortion supporters are saying just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Lungren has a very solid record on life issues, . . . and
we have the greatest confidence that will not change,'' said Jan
Carroll, a legislative analyst for National Right to Life and
California Right to Life, organizations that have both endorsed
Lungren and are working for his election, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that two-thirds of all Californians support
current abortion laws _ or would liberalize them _ Davis has wasted
no time addressing abortion as a campaign issue. His web page
 &LR; (www.gray-davis.com) &LR;  includes a link to related ``women's
rights'' issues, detailing his positions on family planning and
contraceptive funding, child care, child support, abortion and sex
education.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, too, has a record on those issues, dating back to his
days in Congress. He argues he is firmly ``in the mainstream'' on
such matters as late-term abortion and parental consent, but he
faces a challenge in satisfying both the GOP's staunch
anti-abortion conservatives and moderate GOP women on this
high-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason he appears markedly less than eager to
put such topics at the front and center in his campaign. His web
page  &LR; (www.lungrenforgovernor.org) &LR;  contains no mention of abortion
or reproductive health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a defining issue,'' said Lungren campaign manager
Dave Puglia. ``Davis wants to . . . ignore the issues the voters
care most about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Puglia has protested when reporters use the term
``anti-abortion'' to describe Lungren, saying ``it's too large a
blanket,'' and does not accurately reflect the candidate's
position, which allows for some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lungren has never shied from questions about abortion _
neither does he appear to relish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of abortion, I don't bring it up,'' he told a
Chronicle editorial board in June. ``I respond to it when it's
brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren argues that the governor's ability to directly effect
abortion issues is restricted to just three areas: parental
consent, late-term abortions and taxpayer funding of abortions. ``I
would try to be a leader in all three of those areas,'' he said.
``Outside of that, the governor has no real role to play in
influencing the question of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But those on both sides disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important position,'' said anti-abortion
spokeswoman Carroll. ``The governor signs bills and makes
appointments to all areas that are important (in family planning
and abortion). ... There are many ways that an agenda can be
advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has budget power . . . and veto power,'' agreed Zumach,
``which is really important to funding for contraception, sex
education, abortion care and health care,'' she said. ``He also has
the power to appoint California Supreme Court justices.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has been involved in pro-choice legislation for
decades, boasts of a ``near-perfect'' rating with California NOW
and the League of Women Voters on women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' campaign manager Garry South charges that Lungren is
already ``running'' from ``a whole continuum of reproductive issues
_ from adoption assistance, foster home assistance and abortion to
contraception.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Lungren was the California co-chairman of the
Republican Party platform committee in 1996, helping to write the
plank calling for appointing judges who ``respect the sanctity of
innocent human life'' _ the kind of ``litmus test'' opposed by
pro-choice advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a member of Congress, Lungren in 1987 co-sponsored
the Human Life Amendment, an attempt to amend the Constitution to
ban abortion, and also cast votes to restrict or cut abortion, even
in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment. ``He voted for a
bill in 1988 which would have repudiated Roe v. Wade,'' South
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try to gussy it up, but are you for a woman's right to
choose or are you not?'' he said. ``He is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren himself has called some of those votes merely
procedural, but his spokesman, Bob Brown, said he has never wavered
from his basic beliefs. ``Dan Lungren is pro-life _ and has always
been pro-life. He has said it is drawn from his belief in the
sanctity of life, being raised Catholic,'' he said. ``He has been
consistent on that from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren ``doesn't have a litmus test on the issues regarding
judges,'' Brown argues.
</P>
<P>
   Some women's groups have charged that as state attorney general,
Lungren has not been aggressive in protecting clinics from violent
anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said Lungren has stood up for women's rights, for
example, prosecuting a number of doctors accused of injuring women
in botched abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from abortion issues, the vast number of voters could be
far more affected by the next governor's profound influence on
family planning and reproductive health services issues.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor oversees the State Department of Health's
Office of Family Planning, which budgets $82 million to fund
contraceptives, pregnancy testing, sex education, health
examinations for nearly 600,000 low-income women and girls in
California _ a fifth of them 19 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   The state also grants money to clinics that perform abortions,
such as the Planned Parenthood Association. And under Governor Pete
Wilson, the state's Expanded Teen Counseling Program provides
family planning and counseling to more than 350,000 youth
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the candidates have differed markedly on their views of
such services.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has previously stated his opposition to the distribution
of condoms and birth control to teenagers, and has said his
policies regarding the State Office of Family Planning will mirror
those of his mentor, Governor George Deukmejian. The GOP governor
slashed the Office of Family Planning funding by two-thirds _ but
was forced to restore the cuts after widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was then the state controller, took the same stand
then as he does today: that basic quality-of-life issues are at
stake in providing services to poor women and teenagers who cannot
afford such health care. He argues that for every dollar spent in
family planning and the prevention of adolescent births, the state
saves $12 in health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, who has said his own budget decisions will be made on
an individual basis, said that while he respects his opponents, he
will firmly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming from a set of values that are to be respected
and to be joined in mutual and respectful debate,'' Lungren told
The Chronicle in June. ``But if you start equating life with
dollars, I think you run us in the wrong direction, and you truly
go to what people would call a materialistic society.''

TUBBS CATCHES A BREAK AS THE NEW MIDDLE MAN  
BY GARY SWAN
</HEADLINE>
   Chronicle Staff Writer  
    STOCKTON, Calif. _ Sometimes it's the little things that make a
difference when a player moves from one team to another.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask linebacker Winfred Tubbs, for example, what it's like being
a 49er after four years with the Saints, and he pauses only briefly
to talk of the winning and losing and cuts to what matters during
two-a-day practices in broiling weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am in training camp and they're giving me days off,''
Tubbs said, referring to the occasional afternoons when players are
told to take a break and the holiday given all players and coaches
Monday. ``Other training camps I've been in, it doesn't matter
what's wrong with you, they never give you a day off. Here they
seem to know you don't make our playoff run in July. They save you
so there's still spring in your legs come November.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs was receptive to the 49ers' offer that arrived literally
at the stroke of midnight as the free-agency signing period opened
in February. The team needed to replace middle linebacker Gary
Plummer, a vital cog in the No.1-ranked 1997 defense. The Saints
did not want to lose a player who set the team record with 160
tackles last season, but they did not match the 49ers' offer of
$14.25 million over five years with an added $4 million to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs does not expect the same numbers with the 49ers. One guy
makes that many tackles only on bad teams, he said, although Ken
Norton Jr., who holds the 49ers' record with 165 tackles in 1996
and also had a team-high 138 tackles last season, might argue the
point. Defensive schemes differ from team to team, and the 49ers
like to funnel the ballcarrier to Norton.
</P>
<P>
   As the inside linebacker, Tubbs inherits much of Plummer's
coach-on-the-field duties. When he sees the offense approach the
line in certain telltale formations, he will have to bark commands
for the defensive line and the other linebackers to adjust their
coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I'm replacing should also be a Hall of Famer, so I
have a lot of pressure on me,'' Tubbs said. ``If I don't come up
and play just as well or better than Gary Plummer, the guys are
going to look down upon me, and the coaches are going to say `We
wasted our money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was 37 last season, and 12 years of pro football had
taken a toll on his body. He rarely practiced during the week and
would trudge out to the field with bandages from head to toe that
made him resemble the pictures of Confederate soldiers coming home
from the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   With Tubbs, 27, the 49ers' defense gets much younger and
quicker. Tubbs probably will not be replaced with a defensive back
on every passing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been associated with a superstar team like this
before,'' he said. ``It's amazing to look around here. You've got
people here who are the best ever at their positions. The
quarterback, the receiver, the safeties, the linebackers, it seems
like I've got to just sit back and watch everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs is smart, as anyone filling Plummer's position has to be.
He has already bonded with Tim McDonald, a locker-room leader. And
what he likes so far is the way the 49ers make training camp more
of a mental challenge than a physical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches know your physical talent already. How tough you
are,'' he said. ``So they watch for a guy who is less talented, and
if he uses proper technique, he can beat out guys who are tougher
or with more talent. The difference is the mental aspect. And they
know that here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim McDonald told me, `Once you come here, it's hard to leave
here.' This type of training camp as opposed to a training camp
where every day you hit, hit, hit and all they care about is how
tough you are. In comparison to this where there isn't much hitting
and a lot of classroom stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he can fill Plummer's role all the way to the point
of being the sidekick to Norton during endless streams of practice
banter, which can become nasty at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot in New Orleans, too,'' Tubbs said. ``And
Kenny, he's the kind of guy who talks a lot and backs it up. So I
have no complaints.''

MENTOR SHAW, PUPIL ALLEN CONTINUE TO CROSS PATHS  
BY RON KROICHICK
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Eric Allen sat in his living room, a talented
athlete prone to mischief. He was 16 years old at the time. His
talent would land him a college scholarship, as long as the
mischief subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Shaw also sat in Allen's living room on that long-ago
day. Shaw was an assistant coach at Arizona State. He had come to
his own hometown, San Diego, to meet with Allen, his mother and his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw arrived with a straightforward message: Stay out of trouble
and go to class. Satisfy these modest requirements and the
scholarship belonged to Allen, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Allen listened.
</P>
<P>
   Here they stand, 16 years later, student and teacher once again.
Shaw now is the defensive coordinator of the Raiders, the man
trying to retrieve respect for Oakland's wayward defense.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the starting right cornerback, qualifies as one of Shaw's
prized pupils. He was the team's most significant acquisition of
the offseason, arriving from New Orleans for a fourth-round draft
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there are meaningful stories beyond the semantics. There is
history at work here _ a long relationship between Shaw, the
mentor, and Allen, the star athlete who nearly fumbled his future.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw encouraged Allen to resist the easy option of staying home
and going to junior college. Shaw talked of improving in school,
attending a four-year college, opening up a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   He seldom talked about football, something Allen remembers to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last year in high school, Willie was integral in helping
me see past tomorrow,'' Allen said Monday at training camp in Napa.
``That's very difficult for a 16-year-old guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like any teenager growing up in the inner city.
There were a lot of temptations. I wasn't always on the straight
and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen grew up in rugged southeast San Diego, near Shaw's alma
mater, Lincoln High School. (Running backs Marcus Allen and Terrell
Davis also are Lincoln alums.) Eric Allen's mother taught at
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble surfaced before Allen ever reached high school. He
was expelled from junior high for fighting. His mother ultimately
put Allen on a bus and sent him to Point Loma High School, about 10
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   There, Allen resuscitated his grades and excelled in football
and baseball. One of his Point Loma baseball teammates was David
Wells, who pitched a perfect game for the New York Yankees earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Allen straightened out his act. He earned that
scholarship, starred at ASU and climbed into the NFL. Along the
way, he never forgot the role Shaw played in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie's a teacher at heart,'' Allen said. ``That's what I
like about him the most. He not only wants you to succeed on the
football field, he wants you to learn things that can help you in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a role model for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 54, was Allen's position coach last season in New Orleans.
So it was no great surprise when the Raiders, acting largely on
Shaw's recommendation, traded for Allen on Mar. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's presence also helped when Allen initially refused to
report to the Raiders, because he did not consider them Super Bowl
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Allen later backtracked. He said he was angry with the Saints,
who had promised to confer with him before they completed a trade.
Allen, 32, signed a new contract and officially joined the Raiders
on Apr. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Raiders are counting on Allen to revitalize their
secondary. He brings along six Pro Bowl berths, 39 career
interceptions and a sparkling reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric's a pro,'' Shaw said. ``He brings his lunch pail, and he
comes to work every day. You can tell the young guys there's
someone to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The mantle has been passed. Now it's Allen's turn to be the role
model.

   A boy group time line
</P>
<P>
   1977: Producer Edgardo Diaz comes up with the idea for Menudo.
As performers age, they are replaced with younger versions. All
told, there were 33 members of Menudo. Six former members have
reunited this summer for an international tour: El Reencuentro _
The Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   1981: New Edition is formed by producer Maurice Starr, who
envisions an '80s version of the Jacksons. Before dissolving in
1989, the collection launches the careers of Bobby Brown, Johnny
Gill, Bell Biv Devoe and Ralph Tresvant.
</P>
<P>
   1986: Maurice Starr tries it again with New Kids on the Block, a
white version of New Edition. He meets Donnie Wahlberg, who
recruits some of his friends. By 1993, Starr is no longer managing
the band. They change their name to New Kids, then to NKOTB. They
disband by 1995.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Oklahoma City band Color Me Badd is discovered by Robert
Bell of Kool and the Gang. The group is quiet after ``Now and
Forever'' is released in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   1994: All-4-One forms. They haven't released an album since
1995, but have appeared on the soundtracks of ``Space Jam'' and
``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.'' A new album, ``My Brother's
Keeper,'' should be in stores Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The boy group rules
</P>
<P>
   Like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, each member needs an
over-simplified personality: ``The shy one,'' ``the flirt,'' ``the
wild one,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the group must have some acting experience, so he can
ham it up for the close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   One guy should have a name made of two letters or less, such as
T.J., J.C. or just J.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a maestro who orchestrated the group's shtick.
</P>
<P>
   During the band's strongest love ballad, a girl must be pulled
on stage and serenaded. (Don't just pick the good-looking girls, or
you'll risk the wrath of parents.)
</P>
<P>
   Keep the lone bad boy in check. New Kids on the Block allowed
Donnie Wahlberg to lose it. He set a fire in a hotel and attacked
someone on an airplane.

GOVERNORS PRAISE WELFARE OVERHAUL TWO YEARS AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Nearly two years after Congress passed legislation
overhauling the nation's welfare system, leaders of the National
Governors' Association (NGA) on Tuesday voiced bipartisan support
for the measure and praised state efforts to reduce welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people receiving such aid has dropped 27 percent
since 1996 to 9 million, according to the Department of Health and
Human Services. When Congress passed the welfare bill on Aug. 1,
1996, 12.4 million people were receiving cash assistance. The
number had peaked at 14.4 million in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, president of the NGA, said at a
news conference here that the measure ``far exceeded our
expectations.'' He criticized people who said state control over
welfare would result in a ``race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics have been wrong,'' he said. ``We have been, in
fact, witnessing a race to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility that the federal government gave to the states
makes the decrease in welfare rolls possible, Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., NGA vice president, said the drop
is also due in large part to the booming economy. ``Whoever decided
to launch welfare reform in the midst of the longest economic
expansion that I can remember in my life, that was a smart
person,'' Carper said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress changed the face of welfare two years ago when it ended
the 61-year-old practice of giving federal funds to all those
eligible. Instead, the government gave states overall control of
welfare and provided them with lump sums of money, called block
grants.
</P>
<P>
   The government also required the states to limit the time a
person can be on welfare to five years and to put half of those
then receiving the aid into the job market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, states are now devising new methods to get welfare
recipients into jobs, Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new system has allowed states to create a new culture for
treating welfare recipients not as numbers but as individuals,'' he
said. ``It has allowed us to say to people, `We respect you.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Voinovich, states are spending more on child care,
transportation to get people to work and efforts to make jobs more
attractive to those on welfare. Twenty-two states have already
implemented programs that help people find jobs, he added.
</P>
<P>
   According to NGA figures, 32 states currently have or plan to
devise strategies to check on individuals who leave welfare to see
whether they really have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Carper warned that welfare problems are not over. If anything,
he said, ``the opposite should be suggested. ... A lot of people
have drug and alcohol addiction problems. We still have some tough
customers out there to help get off of welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   He advocated assessing which programs work now while the economy
is strong instead of waiting for a recession when more people will
be out of jobs. ``It is incumbent upon (the governors) to use this
period of time wisely,'' he said.

GROENING HAS A HAND IN FOX'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``The Simpsons'' perks along merrily to the
delight of Fox and the show's creator, Matt Groening, who can see
``no end in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' is an established hit, too, and will move
to new Tuesday quarters in the fall. And within a year, it's
conceivable that Fox will have four animated shows and one
claymation-type production on the air.
</P>
<P>
   These shows are joys for their creators and their networks. For
one thing, cartoon characters are permitted a loutishness _ see
``South Park'' on Comedy Central _ that would amount to
broadcasting felonies if they were human.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cartoon characters seldom ask to have their contracts
ripped up and renegotiated. Or ask networks to grease their
four-fingered hands with fat production deals. Or demand on-set
trailers equipped with hot and cold running sycophants and personal
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   No, Homer Simpson is the same unadorned, beer-swilling slug we
met a decade ago. He's an unwitting, penniless prisoner of his own
little ``Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening himself is about to capitalize on the animation surge
he launched. He's readying for Fox a midseason show set in the year
2999 called ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   During a session at the TV press tour, Groening said he wanted
to indulge his notion that ``it would be really neat to take some
of the conventions of science fiction and have fun with them in a
`Simpsons'-style way.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening's vision of the future apparently doesn't involve a
Zen-like quest for harmonic convergence, backed by a benign
military federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love `Star Wars' and `Star Trek' and all the variations on
them,'' he said. ``However, I wanted to do a TV show in which the
problems of the universe are not solved by militarism guided by New
Age spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, `Let's try something different.' It's not a
knock. It's not a knock on the optimism of those shows. I just have
a slightly more subversive take, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   You can expect disembodied heads in jars. Aliens commingling
with earthlings. ``Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve 3000.'' A
popular TV show called ``The Mass Hypnosis Hour.'' And bumptious
robots.
</P>
<P>
   Groening said the show's main characters will be Fry, ``a guy
from our time who has a tragic mishap'' and regains consciousness a
thousand years into the future; Leela, a female alien who sweeps
her hair onto her forehead to disguise the fact that she has only
one eye; and Bender, a kleptomaniacal robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the standout character right now on this show,'' Groening
said. ``He's our robotic Homer Simpson. He's just totally corrupt _
lovably corrupt, a la Homer. Loves his vices. I think he's the
first robot in science fiction who shoplifts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Groening said he and his production team have been patching
``Futurama'' together for three years. It doesn't yet have an air
date or time period on Fox, though 8:30 p.m. Sundays, after ``The
Simpsons,'' and 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays, after ``King of the Hill,'' are
surely prospective slots.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``The Simpsons,'' Groening is promising a 1998-99 season
``as good as any we've ever done, or better.''
</P>
<P>
   In one episode, he said, ``keeping a secret proves difficult for
Homer when he lands a personal assistant job working for Alec
Baldwin and Kim Basinger.'' In another, ``Homer raises a lobster _
you know, he goes to the store and he wants a lobster. It's too
expensive, so he gets a baby lobster to raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Flanders will suffer a midlife crisis and go to Las Vegas
with Homer, where they'll waken one morning in the company of two
cocktail waitresses. There will be ``our obligatory Jerry Springer
appearance,'' and a show in which Homer tries to become a more
adept inventor than Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will not happen, Groening said, is a crossover
episode between ``The Simpsons'' and ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Futurama' is real,'' he said. ``The Simpsons are fictional.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Simpsons don't have their place in the world of
2999.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Simpsons' is still on a thousand years from now,''
Groening said. ``With original episodes.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a pocket of somber calm apart from Washington's
political turmoil, President Clinton and congressional leaders
gathered Tuesday under the Capitol dome to join thousands in paying
tribute to democratic ideals and the two police officers who died
protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Brief memorial services for the officers' families and official
Washington punctuated an extraordinary day of public mourning as
police officers, congressional staff and visitors from as far as
Los Angeles filed through the Capitol's rotunda to pay respects by
the flag-draped caskets of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson died Friday
after a man armed with a 29-year-old revolver and apparently
tormented by visions of an oppressive federal government tried to
shoot his way into the Capitol. Their coffins stood at the center
of the rotunda all day, in a gesture of gratitude and respect that
Congress usually reserves for former presidents and military
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were honored more with silence than with speech.
From eight o'clock Tuesday morning, thousands lined up to make a
wordless, counterclockwise circle across the polished sandstone
floor of the rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   In T-shirts and suits, sundresses and midnight blue uniforms,
they waited for hours in the July swelter to climb the steep
Capitol steps and make a circuit of perhaps 90 paces and less than
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The day's official remarks lasted perhaps 20 minutes, all told.
After following congressional leaders in silently laying a wreath
at a half-hour service Tuesday afternoon, President Clinton said
that in doing their duty, the officers saved lives and
``consecrated this house of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They remind us that what makes our democracy strong is not
only what Congress may enact or a president may achieve,'' Clinton
said. ``Even more, it is the countless individual citizens who live
our ideals out every day, the innumerable acts of heroism that go
unnoticed, and especially, it is the quiet courage and uncommon
bravery of Americans like J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president spoke, facing the two coffins, he was flanked
by dozens of members of each officer's family, some clutching
handkerchiefs. Around the sitting families, hundreds of standing
police officers and legislators filled the rotunda, pressing up
against bronze statues of Jefferson, Jackson and Martin Luther King
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the president, Speaker Newt Gingrich said that
the two officers ``brought together this nation.''

   NEW YORK _ Actor James Earl Jones, artist Ellsworth Kelly and
musician Tito Puente are to receive 1998 Governor's Arts Awards,
which celebrate outstanding individuals and organizations in their
field. Others to be honored when Gov. George Pataki, his wife,
Libby, and Earle Mack, chairman of the New York State Council on
the Arts, take part in ceremonies on Oct. 5 at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater at Lincoln Center are: Marian and Andrew Heiskell, 1717
Cedar Arts Center, Albany Symphony Orchestra, Brooklyn Children's
Museum, Dance Theater Workshop, George Eastman House, Munson
Williams Proctor Institute, North Country Public Radio and
Playwrights Horizons. As a tribute to the 150th anniversary of the
Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, the Governor's
Commission Honoring the Achievements of Women will also present
special citations to dancer and choreographer Judith Jamison,
artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater;
composer and conductor Tania Leon, and singer and arts
administrator Beverly Sills.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Terrence McNally's play ``Corpus Christi'' is to
begin previews on Sept. 22 at Manhattan Theater Club and have its
official opening on Oct. 13. Last spring, when the play about a gay
Jesus-like figure attracted protests from a Roman Catholic civil
rights group and bomb threats, the club removed it from its fall
schedule, citing security concerns. Then, as outraged artists
accused the theater of being intimidated into self-censorship,
``Corpus Christi'' was reinstated. In a gesture of support for
``Corpus Christi,'' South African playwright Athol Fugard removed
his play ``The Captain's Tiger'' from the theater's schedule. It is
back on, and is to begin previews on Dec. 15 and open on Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless
</P>
<P>
   Arson is cited as the cause of the fire that gutted the boyhood
home of Thomas Wolfe in Asheville, N.C., on Friday. Harley Shuford
of the Buncombe County Arson Task Force said it appeared that
someone hurled something through a dining room window to ignite the
blaze. The 1883 Queen Anne-style Victorian house was the setting
for Wolfe's 1929 novel ``Look Homeward, Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe and Sound
</P>
<P>
   Grammy Award-winning blues singer and guitarist John Lee Hooker
escaped with his life and his guitars when fire destroyed the roof
of his home in Los Altos, Calif. The blaze, which began in the
bedroom of one of Hooker's housemates on Sunday night, caused about
$400,000 in damage to the $1.5 million, eight-bedroom home. Hooker
has recorded more than 100 albums, including ``The Healer,'' a
winner of a Grammy in 1992.

TEEN VIEWERS LIFT THE WB TO GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The wheel of fortune used to crank around one
gear notch at a time. Now it's spinning crazily. Take the WB: a
joke of a TV network one day, a perfect business model the next.
</P>
<P>
   The WB was where embarrassingly bad shows played in obscurity
until they were mercifully extinguished. Then ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' came along. And ``Dawson's Creek.'' And, quietly,
``Seventh Heaven.'' And, in the fall, the can't-miss ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple. The WB got lucky. Teenagers found it. In May,
advertisers were lining up to plunk down as much as $285,000 for a
30-second spot on ``Dawson's Creek,'' dwarfing the commercial cost
on the higher-rated but older-skewing ``60 Minutes.'' You're old,
you're chopped meat.
</P>
<P>
   In three more years, the WB might even turn a profit. But while
the WB is rising from the launching pad, the rival UPN is taking a
decidedly different tack to assure its own survival.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between these fifth and sixth networks is a
reflection of all of television today. One seeks to be a
``narrowcaster,'' the other a broadcaster. Right now, the smart
money seems to be on the ``narrowcaster'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   The WB is ``narrowcasting'' to viewers 12 to 34 years old,
locking that demographic in its sights and firing programs at it.
UPN is pursuing a more traditional broadcasting model, trying to
program for a middle American audience between 20 and 50 years old
_ more or less the same 18-to-49 demographic that, say, NBC
targets.
</P>
<P>
   There are spills. The WB doesn't exactly instruct 40-year-olds
not to trespass, and UPN isn't checking IDs to keep 13-year-olds
away. But the two struggling networks are definitely exploring
divergent paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any broadcast network that adopts a narrowcast model is
ultimately doomed to failure,'' UPN President Dean Valentine told
the press in Pasadena last weekend. ``I don't believe in it as a
business model. I don't believe in it as a social model.''
</P>
<P>
   A social model? Valentine apparently meant the further
fragmentation of the TV audience, the prospect of programming that
speaks only to the experiences and desires of narrow bands of the
national population, the loss of one more unifying thread in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   There's life yet, Valentine said, in UPN's ``umbrella strategy''
of reaching the broadest possible cross-section of adult,
middle-class Americans. Steven Spielberg just proved it, he said.
```Saving Private Ryan' opened to $30 million in business this
weekend, and I hazard to say they weren't 16-year-olds who were
going to it,'' Valentine said.

   But ``Saving Private Ryan'' didn't depend on selling 30-second
spots to ad agencies craving the attention of young consumers.
Jamie Kellner, the WB's chief executive officer, and Garth Ancier,
its entertainment president, say even the big networks must learn
to narrow their aim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the most competitive marketing areas _
sneakers, the movies, fast food, beverages, computers _ all these
really hot marketing areas, they tend to be very focused on younger
people today,'' Kellner said. ``I think it's the battleground, in
effect, for the future of marketing in our country _ to attack
these younger demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the idea of being able to focus advertisements toward
gigantic groups of people is almost over, in my opinion. The future
of our business is going to be very targeted. All the networks will
eventually select certain targets, and try to attack those targets,
and be very specific toward those groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The major networks, Ancier said, are already ``starting to
become self-defined.'' Fox skews younger than NBC. NBC skews
younger than CBS. ABC _ well, one day ABC will know what it is.
(That's me, not Ancier, picking on ABC.) Anyway, Ancier continued,
programming is tailored accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us tremendously on the program side,'' Ancier said,
``because we know that show isn't for us, this show is for us. Our
casts should be in this age range, not in that age range. It says
you don't do your shows with Ted Danson, you do them with Joshua
Jackson, or Sarah Michelle Gellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner and Ancier make a persuasive case. And certainly the WB
is projecting a consistent, well-defined image while UPN has no
persona at all, except maybe what remains of its ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' sci-fi infatuation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  But the Kellner-Ancier model, attractive as it seems, is
ultimately devastating. If not to commerce, to the social weal and
to television's brittle veneer of art.
</P>
<P>
   If TV entertainment is to serve any larger purpose than to
massage the brain between commercials, it should be akin to the old
theatrical aspiration of broadening our humanity and deepening our
understanding of what's called, for lack of a better term, the
human condition.
</P>
<P>
   When a Garth Ancier says that ``our casts should be in this age
range,'' he's already cheated that goal, wittingly or not.
</P>
<P>
   Is the best TV show one that simply regurgitates anyone's own
demographic perspective on the world, turning the rest of the
species into nonentities, bit players or generational enemies? No
wonder so much television drama has turned weary and angst-ridden;
angst is a natural byproduct of self-obsession.
</P>
<P>
   So the WB, with its top-hatted frog mascot prancing ahead of it,
is on a parade route toward prosperity. Smart business plan. But
one more gulp of poison for an increasingly fractious, selfish and
myopic society.

U.S. EX-IM BANK CHIEF FAVORS MORE LOANS FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a sign of the new emphasis the United States is
placing on China as an economic engine for Asia, the chairman of
the Export-Import Bank wants China to become its largest recipient
of loans to buy U.S. products and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The official, James Harmon, promised to push for an increase in
lending to China, which currently has loans and trade guarantees of
$5.5 billion, and is the Ex-Im Bank's second-largest borrower after
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a phenomenal opportunity for U.S. companies and a
great challenge,'' Harmon said here Monday, adding, ``It should be
our No. 1 market.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon was in Hong Kong as part of a 12-day tour of Asia that
includes stops in Japan and Thailand. But it was clear that his
focus was squarely on China, where he said he hoped to seize upon
the momentum established by President Clinton's recent visit. Of
the 12 days, he is spending nine in China, with visits to Beijing,
Shanghai and the industrial city of Chengdu in interior Sichuan
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Ex-Im Bank is an independent U.S. government agency that
promotes exports by subsidizing loans and providing credit
guarantees so that developing countries can purchase U.S. goods.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In China this year, the bank will help finance about $1 billion
worth of purchases, primarily aircraft and power turbines. Harmon
said he would like to extend loans for the Chinese to buy
everything from medical equipment to water-filtration systems.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that China would be hungry for loans, as it starts
a campaign, orchestrated by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, to spend
$750 billion on new roads, bridges, hydroelectric projects and
other public works.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said he also wanted to redress China's trade imbalance
with the United States, which ballooned to $20.4 billion in the
first five months of this year, compared with $16.9 billion in the
similar period last year. An aide to Harmon said that during
meetings in Beijing, senior Chinese officials acknowledged that the
trade gap was a problem and pledged to help close it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ex-Im Bank also wants to mend its relations with Beijing,
which were badly strained in 1996 when it refused to subsidize
loans to buy equipment for the gargantuan Three Gorges Dam project.
The bank said the $25 billion Yangtze project, which involves
flooding a vast area of Hubei province in central China, did not
meet its environmental standards, and China obtained financing from
others.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's intense focus on China is in marked contrast to that on
Japan, where he spent only a day, despite extensive ties between
the Ex-Im Bank and its counterpart in Japan. He said he tried to
persuade officials there to consider environmental standards in
deciding which countries should get loans.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Ex-Im Bank's emphasis on China made sense,
given that it is one of the few Asian countries still showing
growth. ``If you want to save Asia, you'd better save China
first,'' said William Overholt, the head of research at BankBoston
in Singapore. ``A few tens of billions of dollars can make a big
difference in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the situations in other Asian countries worry the bank.
It has lent several billion dollars to troubled economies like
those of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. Given the suffocating
debt and economic turbulence in these countries, some of them might
have trouble paying back their loans on time.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bank acknowledged that it might have to
stretch out the repayment period, particularly with Indonesia. But
he said no Asian country had yet signaled it would default on an
Ex-Im Bank loan, adding, ``A rescheduling is not a loss; it is a
stretching out of a repayment.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, who was a New York investment banker before joining the
Ex-Im Bank in 1997, said he believed that Asia would take three to
five years to recover from its economic crisis. ``A lot of people
in Asia haven't lived through bear markets,'' he said, ``so it's
harder for people here.''

 &HT;    NATION'S LEADERS SAY FAREWELL IN THE U.S. CAPITOL TO TWO SLAIN
OFFICERS WHO PROTECTED THEM
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They filed in silently Tuesday, the senators and
representatives, the members of the president's cabinet, and
finally President Clinton himself, filling in the space between the
rows of uniformed Capitol Police and the caskets that held the
bodies of two fallen officers.
</P>
<P>
   Last to enter were the widows, the children and the
grandchildren, taking seats beneath the soaring Rotunda in the
Capitol where the men that they loved had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this room there are murals, pictures, statues of the great
men and women in our country's history,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``Today we honor two men that should
rightly be recognized in this hall of heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men _ Capitol Police officers Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut
and John Gibson _ died Friday from gunshots allegedly delivered by
a delusional gunman just one floor below the Rotunda where Congress
convened in silence Tuesday to hear the United States' top leaders
pay tribute to the officers' sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of what they did here on Friday in the line of duty
is already a legend,'' Clinton said. ``And we thank their families
for enduring the pain and extra burden of joining us here today,
for they remind us that what makes our democracy strong is not only
what Congress may enact or a president may achieve...
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the countless individual citizens who live our ideals
out every day, the innumerable acts of heroism that go unnoticed,''
Clinton said, ``it is the quiet courage and uncommon bravery of
Americans like J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson....''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Rotunda was closed Tuesday for the congressional
memorial, long lines formed outside the Capitol as people waited in
a baking sun to spend a minute or two passing the officers'
flag-draped coffins. A group of about 30 bagpipers from different
law enforcement agencies gathered on the Capitol's east lawn in the
early afternoon, sending their mournful music across an abnormally
quiet plaza toward the building where their brethren lay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their devotion to duty, their sacrifice to defend freedom,
their commitment of their life, both on a daily basis and at the
crisis that occurred on Friday, has in fact reminded millions and
millions of people that, while this is the center of freedom in the
world, and this building is the centerpiece of freedom in our
constitutional system, it only lasts as long as there is courage,''
said House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also spoke of the symbolism of the
Capitol:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we honor two watchmen who guarded not just a building
but an ideal,'' he said, ``men who lived and labored not only to
keep our democracy free from harm, but to keep it free and open to
all our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead officers' commander, Capitol Police Chief Gary Abrecht,
defiantly promised that the Capitol would remain open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there are those who seek to disrupt the
national legislative process or come here to commit acts of
violence,'' Abrecht said. ``It is important that those individuals
understand that there are other officers like J.J. and John who are
determined to fill the breach and hold tight the thin blue line
which protects our congressional community and allows the public to
safely visit their seat of government.''

GOVERNMENT CALLED LENIENT TOWARD ERRANT NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La., Iowa, Maine)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly one-third of the nursing homes in California
have been cited for violations that cause death or life-threatening
harm to patients, but the federal government ``generally took a
lenient stance toward many of these homes,'' congressional
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the General Accounting Office said that
federal officials had been extremely reluctant to take action, even
against nursing homes repeatedly cited for serious violations of
federal health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homes can repeatedly harm residents without facing
sanctions,'' William Scanlon, director of health care studies at
the accounting office, told the Senate Special Committee on Aging
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO investigation focused on California. But Charlene
Harrington, a professor of nursing at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that ``California is symptomatic of all the
states,'' and that it was actually better than many other states in
detecting substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the ranking Democrat on the committee,
said, ``Other states probably have similar problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to eight hours of testimony over two days, Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee chairman, said that the
federal Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates
nursing homes, ``has been comatose for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said that nursing home residents in California ``were
left sitting in urine and feces for long periods of time.'' Some
patients were allowed to waste away with no medical attention, he
said, while others had bedsores so bad that they infected the
surrounding tissue and exposed the underlying bone.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that a lawyer for one California nursing home had
apparently tried to intimidate a witness who testified before the
committee on Monday. The lawyer sent the woman a letter saying she
faced ``various forms of liability'' because her prepared testimony
included inaccurate statements about conditions at the home where
her mother was a patient in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, the lawyer, Dan Woods, from the firm of
White &AMP; Case, said, ``It was not our intent to intimidate any
witness.'' He said that he just wanted to make sure that the woman
testified truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said the situation in California was ``horrifying _ the
equivalent of a national scandal.'' It was, he said, all the more
remarkable because Congress in 1987 passed a law that set
stringent, extremely detailed standards for nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Edelman, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law
Center, said: ``The federal enforcement system now in place looks
very much like the system that Congress repudiated in 1987, when it
enacted the nursing home reform law. Compliance with the new
standards remains largely a voluntary matter. Nursing homes are
nearly always given an opportunity to correct deficiencies before
they can be sanctioned for providing poor care.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Tuesday's hearing, President Clinton last week
announced steps to crack down on nursing homes that violate federal
health and safety standards. But experts told Congress Tuesday that
the administration had done nothing to address one of the biggest
problems: a shortage of nursing assistants and other personnel at
many homes.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO examined the quality of care at 1,370 California nursing
homes inspected from 1995 to 1998. It found that 30 percent of the
homes had committed violations that caused death or
life-threatening harm to patients, or had understated the amount of
poor care by falsifying medical records.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thirty-three percent of the homes had violations that harmed
patients without threatening their lives, and 35 percent had
deficiencies that could harm patients if not corrected, Scanlon
said. Only 2 percent of the homes had no violations or minimal
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said the nursing homes continued receiving Medicare and
Medicaid payments after they had been cited for serious violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Health Care Financing Administration has authority to
terminate a home from participation in Medicare and Medicaid,''
Scanlon said. ``But termination rarely occurs and is not as final
as the term implies.'' Of the 1,370 nursing homes, he said, 16 have
been terminated at some time since 1995, but 14 of the 16 were
reinstated. Since their reinstatement, Scanlon said, six of the 14
homes have been cited for new violations that harmed patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said federal officials had imposed
``rather puny penalties'' on nursing homes. ``This lack of
enforcement sends a very troubling signal to unscrupulous providers
of care,'' she said.

POWER PLANT BLASTS INJURE 17 IN INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, Ind. _ Two explosions within seconds ripped through a
power plant Tuesday, injuring 17 people, four of whom suffered
critical burns.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe a cleaning crew inside the State Line Power
Plant, a coal-burning plant owned by the Southern Energy Corp., may
have sparked fumes inside one of the plant's giant coal bunkers
shortly before 8 a.m. Seconds later a transformer ignited, sending
flames and clouds of smoke high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 workers were inside the plant when the explosions
occurred. Three employees were trapped on the roof, but
firefighters doused enough of the fire to allow the workers to
escape through the building.
</P>
<P>
   Although an investigation was incomplete, fire officials said a
spark from the cleaning crew, which was vacuuming coal dust in the
plant in a routine cleaning procedure, probably ignited the highly
flammable dust.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial explosion, employees trying to escape opened a
set of doors, creating a back draft that helped spread the fire,
said Jim Walsko, a spokesman for the Hammond Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which sells power to Commonwealth Edison, the main
source of electric power in the Chicago area, is on the shore of
Lake Michigan just across the Indiana state line from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Plant officials could not say when it would be back in
operation, but Commonwealth Edison said that the plant was one of
its smallest suppliers and that its customers would not be
affected.

NO MYTH: THEY DO SPEAK WITH THEIR HANDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WARREN BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the documentary ``The Italian-Americans II: A Beautiful
Song,'' which has its premiere on Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WLIW
(Channel 21), a Long Island public television station that
broadcasts throughout the New York area, Nick Stellino, a cookbook
author of Italian descent, describes the way he and family members
used hand gestures when speaking to one another.
</P>
<P>
   As Stellino explains, there was more to these gesticulations
than the casual observer might suspect. Each family member adopted
and honed his or her own singular flourish: Stellino himself liked
to jab at the sky, while his father favored a to-and-fro motion
with hands in front of chest, and his brother Mario adopted a
dramatic shoulder-rolling arm movement.
</P>
<P>
   The gestures were like signatures, within which could be found
clues to the speaker's personality.
</P>
<P>
   Stellino makes a colorful point that is central to the premise
of this one-hour documentary. In all of the distinctive
characteristics of America's various ethnic groups _ those quirks
and curiosities that have often formed the basis of ethnic jokes
and stereotypes _ there is, upon closer inspection, complexity and
richness.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Stellino embraces that old ethnic saw that Italians
``speak with their hands'' and shows us that in all those flying
hands, there is a depth of feeling and a flair for individual
expression that is to be envied, not mocked.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a few such revelations to be found in ``The
Italian-Americans II,'' the latest installment in a series of
documentaries on American ethnic groups produced by WLIW.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which has also featured shows on Jewish-Americans,
Irish-Americans and Polish-Americans (all of which have been picked
up by PBS for national broadcast), employs the basic
talking-heads-and-old-snapshots approach of Ken Burns and his many
imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Each documentary tries to create a kind of warm and fuzzy
photo-album profile of each ethnic group and has a tendency to
praise that group to the heavens, often citing the same virtues
across the board: strong work ethic, solid family values, religious
piety and the ability to make great food (the Irish excepted on
that one).
</P>
<P>
   But the shows do provide small surprises here and there (Did you
know that the polka, revered by Polish-Americans, is not popular in
Poland?) and the occasional larger insight as they peel back the
layers of familiar customs to show their greater meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documentaries have met with tepid press reviews, but
no matter; the series has undeniably struck a chord with its
audience, largely made up of members of the groups depicted. The
series has been drawing significant numbers of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The real measure of the series' success, however, is its ability
to raise funds for public television. Like those old reruns of
``The Lawrence Welk Show'' that PBS traditionally trotted out
during pledge drives, WLIW's ethnic shows cause the station
telephones to ring off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   When the first documentary profiling Italian-Americans had its
premiere a year ago, it became the most successful production in
the station's history, raising a remarkable (by local public
television standards) $120,000 in one hour. The station's
executives responded to this happy phenomenon in much the same way
Hollywood studios do upon discovering an unexpected hit in their
midst; a sequel was quickly produced.
</P>
<P>
   The station has also produced and run a sequel to its first
Jewish American documentary, and there are more ethnic shows in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers at WLIW (which has a lower profile than its larger
sister station, WNET, but is nevertheless the country's
fourth-leading public television station in viewership) had no idea
there was such a hunger for ethnic fare when they first became
involved with the subject matter, said WLIW's president, Terrel
Cass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for some kind of nostalgic program to do,'' he
said, because the station had previously produced a documentary
about New York's past that was popular. At first, the plan was to
make a documentary about the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but then
the focus shifted to one of the primary ethnic groups inhabiting
that neighborhood, Jewish-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting program, ``A Laugh, a Tear, a Mitzvah,'' had its
premiere in November 1996 and, according to Cass, ``people went
crazy over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to that film and others in the series may be part
of a larger sociological trend. While members of American ethnic
groups have historically tended to focus more on assimilation than
on celebrating their roots, that has gradually changed in the last
20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Among white ethnic groups, there has been an awakening of
interest in their own culture and background,'' said Aileen Riotto
Sirey, a New York psychotherapist who has studied ethnicity and
appears as a commentator in ``The Italian-Americans II.''
</P>
<P>
   This relatively new strain of ethnic pride, says Ms. Sirey,
seems to have first gained momentum after the civil rights movement
of the 1960s, which called attention to group identity. It
manifests itself in the growing popularity of ethnic cultural
festivals and in more subtle changes like the tendency of modern
celebrities, unlike their predecessors, not to change their ethnic
names.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bernie Schwartz, who became Tony Curtis, or Margarita
Cansino, who became Rita Hayworth, compared with Al Pacino, Emilio
Estevez or Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Strempek Shea, an author whose books focus on
Polish-American life, said members of some American ethnic groups
were now far enough removed from the immigrant experience that they
might finally feel comfortable embracing it. First-generation
immigrants are often preoccupied with fitting in, Ms. Shea added,
while the second generation tries to create a whole new American
identity. ``It is only the third generation,'' she said, ``that
starts to look back.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Sirey, that's a healthy thing to do. Recent
``ethnotherapy'' studies, she says, have examined the relationships
between ethnic awareness and self-esteem and found a connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have a better understanding of their cultural
background, they usually begin to feel they have more control over
their lives,'' Ms. Sirey said, adding that such people are often
less encumbered by the emotional baggage _ fear of being
stereotyped, anxieties about being different, extreme class
consciousness _ that can be part of the ethnic experience.
</P>
<P>
   While the hunger for information about ethnic backgrounds may be
growing, many depictions of certain ethnic groups on television and
in film continue to be oversimplified and often negative. In that
regard, the WLIW series has been a welcome exception, to which
viewers have responded.
</P>
<P>
   When the station first showed ``A Laugh, a Cry, a Mitzvah,''
said Cass, ``for once, this was a program about Jewish culture that
was not focused on the Holocaust; it was a warm celebration of
Jewish life.''
</P>
<P>
   As the series was expanded to cover other ethnic groups, the
producers continued to accentuate the positive and generally ignore
the negative. The shows are ``not meant to dig up the things that
ethnic groups don't want to hear and have been hearing too much
through the years,'' said Roy Hammond, the executive producer of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond points out, for example, that many media depictions of
Italian-Americans involve organized crime, ``even though that has
nothing to do with the lives of most Italian-Americans,'' he said.
And so, in ``The Italian-Americans II,'' there are fond tributes to
Mario Lanza, Joe DiMaggio, Frank Sinatra and Fiorello La Guardia,
but no trace of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we first showed `The Italian-Americans,' '' said
Hammond, ``one of the reactions we heard was, `Finally, something
about Italians that's not about the Mafia!' ''
</P>
<P>
   While it's understandable that some ``Godfather''-weary
Italian-Americans would welcome such an approach, others may find
``The Italian-Americans II,'' along with other shows in the series,
a bit too sanitized. And perhaps a bit too eager to flatter the
audience that calls to make contributions to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every culture has certain problems and there's nothing wrong
with talking about that,'' said Ms. Sirey. For example, she noted
that the closeness of families in traditional Italian-American
communities has sometimes caused members of the group to forgo
far-flung opportunities so they can remain close to the nest.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is a profile of Greek-Americans, to be followed by one
on Puerto Rican-Americans. Interestingly, the man behind the
series, Hammond, is from Texas and sees himself as ``not very
ethnic at all.'' But he says working on the series has changed his
thinking about the notion of the melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see these rich ethnic cultures still in existence in
New York, it makes you realize that this is something that isn't
available in many other parts of the country, where some of the
cultural differences between people have melted away,'' he said.
``I think the message we're trying to get across with the series is
that we don't want those differences to disappear completely.
Different is good.''

DEAL GIVES LEWINSKY `BLANK CHECK' IN AVOIDING PROSECUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rare immunity deal between Monica Lewinsky and
independent counsel Kenneth Starr gives the former intern a free
pass from prosecution as long as she tells the truth to a grand
jury investigating President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's pledge to give Lewinsky ``transactional immunity''
provides broader protection than the more common ``use immunity''
prosecutors give witnesses for testifying in criminal cases. Under
the deal, Starr, who made the same pledge to Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, will be barred from prosecuting Lewinsky for matters
discussed in her testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Use immunity would have prevented Starr from using her
grand-jury testimony _ or any evidence derived from it _ as part of
a prosecution of Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Starr would
still have been free to bring Lewinsky up on charges based on
evidence he could collect independently of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But with transactional immunity, the independent counsel has
given Lewinsky, who faced potential charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice, a ``blank check'' that enables her to avoid
prosecution, said Houston defense attorney Kent Schaffer. All
Lewinsky has to say is ``Bill did it'' to hold up her end of the
bargain, Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the immunity deal depends on how broadly her
seasoned Washington attorneys, Plato Cacheris, Jacob Stein and
Nathaniel Speights, defined ``transaction'' in their agreement with
the independent counsel, said former federal prosecutor John G.
Douglass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, her lawyers have defined it very broadly,'' said
Douglass, who teaches law at the University of Richmond. ``Their
aim would be to protect her from prosecution for perjury ... or
obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement with Starr makes Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony less credible because she now has the ``ultimate bias''
against Clinton, said Schaffer, who is president of the Texas
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. Starr, in effect, has told
Lewinsky, ``You will never go to jail, you will never be
prosecuted; now, what do you want to say?,'' Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to cross-examine that witness,'' the lawyer said.
``I don't know what stronger incentive you can give somebody to
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified under oath in Paula Jones' since-dismissed
sexual harassment case against Clinton that she had no sexual
relationship with the president. However, Lewinsky allegedly
contradicted her sworn testimony when she said she and the
president had been intimate, a contradiction that her former friend
Linda Tripp secretly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also allegedly urged Tripp to mislead investigators if
they asked about Tripp's claim that Clinton had made unwelcome
sexual advances toward Kathleen Willey, who was seeking a job in
the White House.

 &HT;    Powertel becomes player in 'mobile data' serviceBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big winners usually have a way to break out of the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That is true of the wireless phone market as much as it is for
the Peachtree Road Race _ to win means breaking away, by either
crossing the finish line first or catching the eyes and wallets of
more consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta may be one of the nation's hottest wireless
markets, with more than 20 percent of residents using the service.
But with six companies in the race, each must find a distinct
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has its brand name. So does BellSouth. AirTouch
Communications has aggressive marketing. Southern seems to rely on
its identity as a utility icon. Nextel markets its ability to
provide either phone or two-way radio communication.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel, an ambitious upstart out of West Point, Ga., surged
into the market late last year and has hammered several themes: No
contracts, clear rate schedules and cutting edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just at the very start of mobile data right now,'' said
Allen E. Smith, company president and chief executive officer.
Analysts say wireless use could double in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started in 1990 selling analog cellular
service, now has licenses to provide digital wireless to areas in
the Southeast with a population of 24.3 million. Powertel has
raised about $1.3 billion from investors including Ericsson and
South Carolina Electric and Gas Co. Each of its 1,000 cell sites
can cost up to $300,000. And the company plans to build 500 cell
sites more by year's end, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues last year were $79 million with a $135 million loss _
and it will be some time before the company, which has 1,300
employees, can turn investment into profit. Tuesday, the stock
closed at 17 9/16, up 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   When Powertel paid GTE nearly $200 million for its wireless
license in metro Atlanta, some skeptics scoffed. Cam Lanier,
Powertel's chairman, obviously wanted to make a regional splash so
the company could be sold to some national player. Now, Powertel
thinks of itself as hunter _ not prey. ``There is not an
acquisition on the plate today, but we need to be in position so
that when opportunity presents itself, we can take advantage,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will not say how many subscribers it has, but says
its average customer spends nearly $60 per month _ well above the
cellular industry average. Demand for wireless will keep growing,
Smith said. ``The more it becomes an integral part of your life,
the more you will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for a particular customer _ the professional who needs
connections to data and the Internet _ the company in the next few
months will offer two-way data links. Connection speeds may not be
stellar, but Powertel says velocity will improve.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel uses a wireless standard known as GSM, for global
system for mobile communication. Other Atlanta providers use other
standards, like the time division multiple access _ TDMA _ used by
BellSouth. GSM allows Powertel to deliver a cutting-edge data
service, Smith said. ``This standard was developed for data.''
</P>
<P>
   Powertel users can receive e-mail on their phones, they can
receive and reply to pages. They have voice mail and caller ID, and
they get their first minute free _ key to avoiding expense of
taking unwanted calls. A user can receive notification that a fax
has been sent, type in a fax number and have the fax sent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these features are available from other providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data market has never evolved or been a big piece of the
market,'' said Tim Birmingham, marketing director for Nextel in the
Southeast. ``It's a very small niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Nextel uses a Motorola technology, similar to GSM and will be
able to _ eventually _ deliver similar features, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Battcher of BellSouth Mobility said the market and not the
technology is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the gee-whiz stuff is great, but it affects very few
customers.'' BellSouth marketing often pounds the company's
extensive wireless coverage _ a weakness for Powertel. ``We are not
rushing to offer new features that customers aren't asking for yet.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel's service area now includes 26 metropolitan areas with
a population of 10.5 million. In metro Atlanta, Powertel has been
steadily expanding service toward Peachtree City and Griffin in the
south, toward Canton and Lake Lanier to the north. This fall it
plans to offer service to Chattanooga, Nashville, Louisville and
Charlotte .
</P>
<P>
   Powertel offers five basic rate plans. For $20 a month, a user
gets 100 minutes of air time and pays per minute after that. For
$40, a user gets 400 minutes and heavier users can pick more
expensive plans. Users who roam outside the Powertel service can
connect to other GSM providers and pay 50 cents a minute for
airtime and 25 cents a minute for long-distance calls.

&HT;        CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE ANIMAS LA PLATA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 28 -- A month after Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell said a presidential veto threat effectively killed the
Animas La Plata water project, the White House wants to ``enter
into a good faith dialogue'' with two Indian tribes, an
administration official told a House panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ute Indian Tribal leaders said it may be too late to
renegotiate the proposed $300 million plan to divert the Animas and
La Plata Rivers in southwestern Colorado and northern New Mexico to
two Ute Indian tribes to resolve water rights issues remaining from
an 1868 treaty with the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their good faith doesn't hold water,'' said Judy Knight-Frank,
Chairwoman of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, one of the two tribes
involved in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes have been mulling over filing suit, something
Campbell has encouraged, as a breach to the treaty. Without the new
water supply, the tribes say their health will be endangered and
economic growth stunted.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, sponsored by
Campbell in the Senate and Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Pueblo, in the
House, would build a reservoir and pumping plant on the Animas
River near Durango, along with other features for municipal and
industrial water supplies. It would serve Ute tribes and other
communities in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-down version -- known as ``Animas La Plata Lite'' --
would cost approximately $300 million, far less than the original
$754 million project which Congress passed in 1988. But
environmental groups have attacked the plan as just the first step
in an attempt to reinstate the original, larger plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eluid Martinez, commissioner of the Interior Department's Bureau
of Reclamation, said that the Clinton Administration opposes the
current plan, and opposes efforts to scrap the whole plan and start
over. Martinez wouldn't say how the plan could be changed to
satisfy the President, only that such details could come in the
next ``30 or 60 days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Roy Romer, D-Colo., who helped negotiate the
settlement, said that it is crucial for the administration to come
to Colorado no later than August with a list of specific changes
they want to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot start from square one again,'' said Romer. ``Too
much time has been lost and we've discussed all the alternatives...
We need some decisions to be made here.''
</P>
<P>
   A Campbell spokesman said that as long as the administration
opposes the deal, the Senator considers it dead. But McInnis said
he plans to continue to push for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dead -- of course there's hope for it,'' said
McInnis. ``It's going to be built.''

REMAKE OF `PARENT TRAP' DOESN'T DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the good news: ``The Parent Trap'' is the first Disney
remake in recent memory that doesn't cheapen its source material.
That's a rarity these days, when ``update'' usually means adding
jokes about crotch injuries and passing gas. The new ``Parent
Trap'' is just as sweet as the 1961 original _ maybe even sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a dark sweetness. Both movies are romantic
comedies that take off from a tragic premise _ namely, that a young
couple gets married in a fever, quickly has twin girls, then splits
up, each taking one of the twins with no plans for the girls to
ever see each other again. Even in 1961, this was cruel; in the
'90s, when no one has to explain the terms ``deadbeat dad'' or
``parental abduction,'' it's almost sadistic.
</P>
<P>
   If director Nancy Meyers was going after a realistic update,
both girls would have been in therapy faster than you could say
``child abandonment.'' At least Meyers and her co-writers have the
sense to include a child's-eye lecture about the importance of
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   As for originality _ put aside the occasional cell phone or
alt-rock song, and the new ``Parent Trap'' isn't just a remake;
it's a Xerox. Not only does it follow the original virtually scene
for scene, it lifts some lines verbatim _ and not always the best
lines, either. That it took three writers is baffling.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers and husband/co-writer Charles Shyer are so close to the
material they even name Hallie and Annie _ the two girls who meet
at summer camp, realize they're twins, and then plan to reunite
their parents _ after their own daughters, who have small roles in
the film. Brian Keith may have been in the original, but this one's
the real family affair.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Meyers and Shyer have visited such
territory _ they gave us 1984's ``Irreconcilable Differences,'' a
movie in which 10-year-old Drew Barrymore sued her parents for
divorce. (Even though Meyers and Shyer are by all accounts happily
married, one could be forgiven for thinking that they have, you
know, ``issues.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although Meyers is a veteran of nearly two decades of film work,
this is her first time behind the camera. Her pacing is better than
the original, but her biggest success is the performance she gets
out of Lindsay Lohan, who plays the twins.
</P>
<P>
   Lohan's no rookie, either; she's been acting since she was 3,
and she gives one of the most refreshing, unaffected kid
performances to come along in a while. She's natural and unenamored
of her own freckle-faced cuteness, no easy feat considering the
movie's tendency to play cute.
</P>
<P>
   And how nice it is to see a movie in which Dennis Quaid smiles.
Quaid, who plays the girls' father, has sulked through much of the
'90s, sometimes successfully (1993's ``Flesh and Bone''), sometimes
not (last year's ridiculous ``SwitchBack''). He seems relieved to
be playing a good-natured hunk again, and he delivers his most
relaxed performance since 1987's ``The Big Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the girls' mother, Natasha Richardson gives a performance
that's perfectly nice _ and that's just the problem. She's neither
impish nor feisty enough to do some of the things she does to
sabotage her ex's romance with a gold-digging publicist (Elaine
Hendrix, in a deliciously comic performance). Richardson has the
biggest shoes to fill here _ Maureen O'Hara, an actress few can
match for backbone and spirit, was the best thing about the
original. (She was so feisty that she even popped Brian Keith in
the eye, a scene that Meyers has wisely chosen to delete.)
</P>
<P>
   As sweet as it is, ``The Parent Trap'' is too derivative to
merit a wholehearted recommendation. But several preview-goers said
they enjoyed the movie BECAUSE it sticks so closely to the
original. Seems a little odd, when it's so easy to rent the real
McCoy. And it's too bad _ if it had tried a little harder, we
really could have had something special here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parent Trap'' is rated PG for slapstick, two or three
questionable words and some relatively heavy kissing scenes. It's
still family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Film: ``The Parent Trap'' Director: Nancy Meyers Featuring:
Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson Length: 124 min.
Rated: PG Rating: 2 1/2 stars

JOY COMES FROM JUST WINGING IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The road to wisdom is a difficult one. The path is rugged,
filled with giant potholes. There are unexpected detours and
inexplicable U-turns. The few maps available are written in crayon,
on a paper towel, under water. Following the traffic can result in
a foolish mistake but, hey, at least you've got company.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, then, that so many people just give up and
settle for something less than true enlightenment? I think not.
There is much joy to be found in other areas of life. I know
because there I was, and there I would have remained if I hadn't
been issued a particular challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge? Find the restaurant that has the best chicken
wings in the Metroplex. The prize? A pack of Tums. So it's not a
Good Will Hunting type of exercise. I'm no good at complex math
equations but chicken wings, yes, that's something I can do.
</P>
<P>
   So off we went, me and Honey Bunny, in search of the ultimate
hot wing. Every week, we tried a different restaurant. The Chinese
place scored a lot of points with its spicy sesame wings, but we
couldn't stop there. The barbecue place had this
finger-lickin'-good sauce, but the chicken was tough. We searched
from Chez Sammie's, where the poultry was covered in slimy peanut
oil, to KFC, which earned an honorable mention. Still, there was no
clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged but determined, I was drinking another bottle of
Pepto Bismol when my husband commented, ``I've heard that Hooters
has good wings.''
</P>
<P>
   I sputtered and pink stuff came flying out of my nose.
``Hooters! You have got to be kidding. I'm not going near that
place. Don't they exploit the wait staff and make them wear
revealing clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh I don't know about that,'' he said. ``I've only heard about
the chicken wings. They've won several national awards with their
recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   How he managed to avoid the bolt of lightning that came through
the kitchen is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Hooters for goodness sakes. Do they serve owl
there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the founders was named Hooter.''
</P>
<P>
   He's good, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   I let curiosity smother indignation and agreed to try the world
famous Hooters cuisine. But I insisted that the children accompany
us and wear their T-shirts that say ``I love my Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress came over as soon as we were seated. She looked
like a model for Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, where are your hooters?'' my youngest son instantly asked
her in a loud voice. My husband stared at the table, but I saw the
smile torturing his pressed lips. The four guys at the adjacent
table roared. I pointed to a small, fake owl on the wall and my son
said, ``That's a hooter? That's sorry. I thought hooters were
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, much as I hate to admit it, those were some awesome
chicken wings. They won the contest hands down.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, my son said, ``I wish I could work there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that, son?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, they had 20 televisions! I could watch sports all day.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, true enlightenment is highly overrated.

DEMOCRATS COULD BE AT TURNING POINT IN CLINTON STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH   AND CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky's immunity deal with independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr could prompt Democrats to put new pressure
on President Clinton to tell everything about his alleged sexual
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Some party members are worried further delay by Clinton could
mean the issue will explode as they head into the fall elections.
But others said Tuesday they will continue their strategy of
criticizing Starr's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are running as far away from the president on this
as they can,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who
follows many congressional races around the country. ``They want
him to deal with this, and they don't want to be anywhere near him
when he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon E. Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff, said on CNN
that Clinton ``owes an explanation ... to the American people. In
the end, I think that will save his presidency.'' Panettta said
Lewinsky's agreement with Starr showed ``this has reached a crucial
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultants interviewed Tuesday said the party is not
concerned if the case comes down to ``he said, she said.'' But some
Democrats are concerned Starr could have independent evidence that
would corroborate allegations that Clinton had an affair with
Lewinsky and urged her to lie about it. Clinton has sworn in an
affidavit he did not have an affair with Lewinsky and he has denied
telling her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as members of Congress left a memorial service for two
slain Capitol Police officers, some Massachusetts Democrats were
not running away from Clinton. ``As a prosecutor, I always had a
concern about immunized testimony because it does go to the
question of credibility,'' said Representative William Delahunt,
referring to Starr's agreement with Lewinsky for complete immunity
from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the public is interested in a $40 million
investigation about consensual sex between adults,'' said
Representative Martin Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the question of whether Clinton had an affair with
Lewinsky has come up in only a few congressional campaigns. But
that could change, especially if Clinton does not follow through on
his promise to speak ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   House minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who is
preparing to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, has called on Clinton to make good
on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that Bill Clinton would do as he has
said he would, and would get all the necessary information to the
independent counsel,'' Gephardt said recently. This comment has
been interpreted by some analysts in the last few days as a party
message to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario for Democrats, Starr could deliver
his report on the investigation to Congress before the November
elections, and Congress could start impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House continues its strategy of continued legal
appeals and delaying of the investigation, it could play into the
hands of Republicans who want to turn the case into a broader
campaign issue of whether Democrats can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton holding record-high approval ratings throughout the
year, many Democrats hoped nothing would happen to damage his
standing. But there have also been signs throughout the year that
Democrats wished he would tell everything as soon as possible.
Former top Clinton aides George Stephanopoulos and Panetta have
urged Clinton to speak up, and White House press secretary Michael
McCurry has mused aloud that Clinton would have talked more if the
matter could have been explained easily.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Mark Mellman said, ``The level of anxiety
has throughout this whole episode exceeded the level of damage.''
For Democrats to become deeply concerned, he said, there would have
to be overwhelming, independent corroboration of wrongdoing by the
president, not just an alleged sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's development about an immunity agreement, some
Democratic leaders said they still think the matter will die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another television story,'' said Anne Pedersen,
acting chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party. ``People are not
tuned in to it. It does not affect their lives.''

DOW DROPS 93.46 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although investors might not think so, Tuesday's
stock market performance might not even race the pulse of some
die-hard roller coaster aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   But it probably came close.
</P>
<P>
   There were twists and turns and wild gyrations, as continuing
concerns about corporate profits, Asia's financial crisis and the
specter of political upheaval in Washington pushed stocks lower. At
one point, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 212.15 points,
before bargain hunters ratcheted it upward to trim its loss to
93.46 points.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip index closed at 8,934.78, erasing Monday's 90.88
gain. J.P. Morgan, United Technologies and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. led
the declines, a 1.04 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the persistent concerns about Asia and corporate
profits was news that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky had
received immunity from prosecution, paving the way for her to
testify before a grand jury seeking to determine whether President
Clinton tried to obstruct justice to hide any relationship with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very high run-up, and there's some uncertainty
about the sustainability of earnings,'' said Shannon Reid, a
portfolio manager for the Evergreen Select Strategic Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are more willing to pay up for predictability of
earnings vs. earnings growth, which is what you see at the end of a
cycle,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets were mixed Tuesday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225
index rose 170.18 points, recouping less than half of Monday's
417.53 point loss. Analysts predict Japan's fundamental economic
situation will take at least 12 months to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read this as indicative of an uptrend,'' said Dan
Seto, a senior economist at Nikko Securities International.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of skepticism that this new leadership
will shift to anything aggressive'' to spur the Japanese economy,
he said. ``Therefore, the other Asian markets will have limited
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   In domestic markets, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, fell
17.03 points to 1,130.24, a 1.5 percent decline. The Nasdaq
composite index suffered even steeper declines, falling 36.73
points, or nearly 2 percent, to 1,896.53. Microsoft, Worldcom and
MCI led the declines.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors still leave investors searching for clues
to determine whether corporate profit growth will improve in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on earnings for the 385 member companies of the S&AMP;P 500
that have reported thus far, earnings are expected to grow by about
4 percent in the second quarter. That is slightly above the first
quarter's 3.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now forecast growth to improve in the third quarter, up
7.6 percent. They are looking for even stronger earnings growth in
the fourth quarter, up 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Hill, head of research at First Call Corp., cautions
investors to realize that analysts have already begun making
substantial downward revisions in their third quarter forecasts.
Those changes, at a sharper than usual pace, are a signal that
analysts believe the impact of Asia's woes have not yet entirely
filtered through the domestic market, he said. &QL;

   ST.-OURS, France _ Louis XIV built Versailles. President
Francois Mitterrand rebuilt the Louvre. Now his predecessor, former
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, plans to build his own
monument.
</P>
<P>
   A volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes used to erupt here in Giscard d'Estaing's home region
of Auvergne until 5,000 years ago, leaving a mountainous landscape
of cinder cones, lava fields and basalt that is best known for the
pure mineral water it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcania, the name of the former president's pet project, will
be a theme park, one costing $87 million, mostly in public funds.
It will have simulated fumaroles (the volcanic vent), steaming lava
flows and temblors, on a site where real lava buried a valley
27,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nature never seems quite good enough for the French, as anybody
knows who has seen what they put plants through in a formal garden.
</P>
<P>
   So two years from now, if all goes according to schedule, the
Puy de Dome, the biggest extinct volcano in the area, will be
mirrored in miniature by a striking metallic cone that will be the
centerpiece of the theme park being built at 3,000 feet altitude
here on the grounds of a former arms depot.
</P>
<P>
   The cone's interior copper lining will reflect bursts of light
simulating eruptions. Most of the exhibits will be below ground _
long walkways through basaltic columns, dial-a-blast consoles that
will show digital simulations of Mt.-St.-Helens-style explosive
eruptions, and auditoriums presenting real-time data on discoveries
on other active volcanic locales, even ones on Mars or the moons of
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 feet below the surface, rumblings will issue from
a pit that will be the mirror image of the metallic cone. On a
recent day, giant Volvo trucks and shovels were busily digging the
pit out of the solid lava on the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the project to be on time,'' Giscard d'Estaing,
president of the Regional Council of Auvergne, the elected body
that commissioned it, told workers celebrating the first
anniversary of construction work. ``If I understand correctly,
you're not going to take any vacation this summer,'' since there
are ``only two years left before we present this project to the
Auvergnat people.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulcania? Megalomania, environmental groups and other opponents
reply. The fracas has sent pyroclastic flows of controversy
sweeping over Auvergne regularly since Giscard d'Estaing first
broached the idea in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decision this spring by the Council of State, the
country's highest administrative court, struck down the last of a
series of suits by environmentalists and other opponents of the
project, Vulcania now seems unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Giscard d'Estaing, now 72, looking fit, patrician and pleased in
his office in Clermont-Ferrand, the somewhat down-at-the-heels
regional capital, said in an interview that the project would give
the area a forward-looking image and bring in 500,000 tourists a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are our assets here?'' he asked. ``We have the
countryside, which is superb. We have beautiful Romanesque churches
and medieval castles, but nothing like the chateaus of the Loire
that would attract visitors and make people want to stay.'' If the
unique volcanic landscape doesn't, the theme park will, since it is
meant to take an entire day to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a center about the study of volcanic activity, and
it will change the way people in this region, intelligent but
isolated and somewhat backward-looking, look on life,'' Giscard
d'Estaing said. ``It's a qualitative leap forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Vulcania's opponents, Daniele Auroi, a member of the
environmentalist Greens party and a deputy mayor in
Clermont-Ferrand, dismissed the park's scientific ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a Disneyland,'' she said. ``No research will take
place here at all. It'll be Giscard's monument to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The park and the planned superhighway the former president
succeeded in getting to go with it, she said, would bring an
environmentalist's nightmare of cars and tourists and cheap hotels
and McDonald's restaurants, harming a preserve of natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to learn about volcanoes, all they have to do
is come to the Puy de Dome to see one,'' she said. ``And 400,000
visitors a year already do that. Vulcania could drive people like
that away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Auroi and other opponents collected 15,000 signatures
against the project, but the Regional Council, controlled by
Giscard d'Estaing's conservative majority, has commissioned polls
that showed that 72 percent to 86 percent of voters approve.
</P>
<P>
   The futuristic design would fit in with the natural
surroundings, he said, and the council chose one of Europe's best
known architects, Hans Hollein, of Vienna, to come up with it.
European Union rural development funds will provide $12.5 million
for the project, and the French government $4.6 million more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was inspired by Jules Verne's ``Journey to the Center of the
Earth,'' Dante's ``Inferno,'' and the landscape, among many other
things,'' said Hollein, visiting the site with Giscard d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking his feet in the porous decayed basalt that overlays the
location, the designer of the exhibit, Rainer Verbizh, like Hollein
an Austrian, commented: ``In Germany or France, a project like this
would get talked to death. But the French have their Sun Kings, and
their projects get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Simone Shinkaretzky, a local summer resident, said she thought
the former president, who was in office from 1974 to 1981, should
pay no attention to his hecklers. ``They made fun of Louis XIV
while he was building Versailles, too,'' she said.

AN ANALYST OF PASSION, AND PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Leslie Camhi writes frequently about film, art and contemporary
culture for the Village Voice . )  
(rl) 
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benoit Jacquot is not about to turn out
autobiography. ``I'm not interested in recounting my life through
my films,'' the famously reticent French director said recently.
``I'd rather they teach me something about my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His presence in his work is close to transparent: a finely tuned
eye and intelligence, focused on the intricate, oblique
entanglements of human beings. Inspired by the sensual, emotional
immediacy of actors, he also partakes in his films of an analyst's
measured distance and reserve. His characters, veiled in silence or
adept in miscommunication, rarely say what they're thinking. And
while Jacquot is not the product of a tell-all society, he also
remains largely faithful to a city, Paris, and a set of
psychological concerns that differentiate his work from recent
French films set in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can see Jacquot's analytical mind at work in ``Seventh
Heaven,'' a 1997 film that opened in New York on Friday. Subtle,
cryptic and funny, it explores a modern triangle among a wife, her
husband and her therapist. Mathilde, a young woman, neglects her
job and suffers from frigidity, fainting spells and bouts of
kleptomania. When an enigmatic hypnotist cures her of these ills,
her husband, Nico, begins to shirk his work as a surgeon and his
conjugal duties. A poignant survey of the shifting grounds of
marital power, this comedy of the unconscious is also a compendium
of Parisian neuroses and pleasures, from adultery to
psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot, 51, is as contradictory and recondite as his oeuvre.
Tall and angular, with elegant manners, a foxlike face and a gaze
that nails its object, he can seem in conversation at once
surprisingly self-effacing and rather wearied by the limits of
language. He has set two films (one recent, one to come) in the
18th century, and that age of enlightened libertinage probably
appeals to him, for despite his crow's-feet, he reminds an
interviewer of an oddly amiable Marquis de Sade _ fundamentally
chilly but as mirthful as a schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Parisian by birth and by existence,'' as he puts it, Jacquot
grew up on the films of the French New Wave, assisted the great
writer and director Marguerite Duras when he was in his early 20s
and began his own career as the director of abstruse, rigidly
stylized dramas amid the theoretical ferment of Paris in the 1970s.
``I don't like my early films,'' he admitted. ``I have a hard time
seeing them and acknowledging them as my own. When I made my first
film, `The Musician Killer,' in 1975, it seemed like my last; while
15 years later, with `The Disenchanted,' I felt that I was
beginning my career anew.''
</P>
<P>
   That lyrical, deeply moving film, which was shown this spring at
Film Forum in New York, stars Judith Godreche as a 17-year-old high
school student who lives with her mysteriously paralyzed mother and
her little brother in a once-grand apartment. The film traces her
encounters over the course of three days with several men: her
handsome, arrogant boyfriend; Chan, a Chinese friend and fellow
student; Alphonse, an older writer whom she meets by chance, and
``the uncle,'' a cultivated and insidious retired doctor who
supports her impecunious household.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Disenchanted'' moves across Paris with the exactitude of
an anatomist palpating a body, revealing the city's lush little
islands, afternoon dance clubs, high-rise workers' housing and
gracious bourgeois apartments. It's also a remarkably tender
vivisection that all but exposes the beating heart of a young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship to Paris is extremely precise in all of
Benoit's films,'' said prolific French producer Philippe
Carcassonne, Jacquot's frequent collaborator. ``We are working
right now on `Pas de Scandale,' to be shot this fall. Benoit has
already indicated the two or three avenues where we are to look for
the main character's apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot's later films have all focused on the mystery of women's
identities and desires, set against the exigencies (material,
social, psychological and physical) that circumscribe them.
``Marianne'' (1994), an adaptation of Marivaux's novel ``La Vie de
Marianne,'' stars Virginie Ledoyen as the 18th-century heroine of
indeterminate origins who moves uncertainly through an often
predatory world of servants, tradespeople and aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ledoyen also stars in ``A Single Girl'' (1995), which was well
received in the United States two years ago. Filmed for the most
part in real time, it follows a young woman through an early hour
of a gray Parisian morning as she meets her unemployed boyfriend in
a cafe, tells him she's pregnant and begins her first day of work
as a room-service waitress, delivering breakfast in a four-star
hotel. There she navigates a maze of bosses, co-workers and a
multitude of strangers with whom she shares unwanted moments of
intimacy; all the while, her secret is privately at work within
her. This small, dazzling film tells almost no story; instead, it
focuses with the intensity of a lover's gaze upon the riddle of
another's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for ``Seventh Heaven'' was double. Jacquot wrote
the script with Jerome Beaujour for Sandrine Kiberlain and Vincent
Lindon, the two French stars who play the married couple and who
are, in fact, husband and wife. ``I could only have made this film
with a couple who live together,'' Jacquot said. ``It's fiction,
but it also has a documentary aspect, in the way that George
Cukor's films play off the real-life couple of Katharine Hepburn
and Spencer Tracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That the film has the lightness of a 1930's domestic comedy is
all the more striking when one considers its second source of
inspiration: Lacanian psychoanalysis. In 1974, Jacquot directed the
only televised interview with Jacques Lacan, the highly celebrated
and controversial Parisian psychoanalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read Lacan's work, and it moved me very deeply,''
Jacquot said. ``Before him, psychoanalysts tended to write of the
unconscious as if they themselves had none. For me, he was a
brilliant model of someone who could be at once extremely rigorous
and precise, and yet open to the effects of the unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also had a remarkable sense of comedy; he was extremely
adept in the art of surprise,'' Jacquot continued. ``And surprise
is our only real proof of the unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an art that, as a director, Jacquot takes pains to
cultivate. His preparatory work with actors is lengthy but oblique;
he never rehearses, and all his films are shot using very few
takes. ``The films always spill over the idea I had of them,'' he
said. ``They lead me, together with the cast and crew, elsewhere.
Otherwise, they're just illustration.''
</P>
<P>
   In relation to his work, he attempts to preserve something of
the analyst's fertile silence and enigmatic power.
</P>
<P>
   Kiberlain's troubling and touching performance as Mathilde in
``Seventh Heaven'' required her to feign fainting, hypnosis and
(discretely) orgasm. ``If there's a rapport between hypnosis and
acting, it has to do with the sense of surrender,'' Kiberlain said.
``When Benoit would tell me, now you faint, I didn't have the
faintest idea of how to go about it. But you just let go, you fall.
There has to be a great deal of confidence between actor and
director for that to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot enjoys the reputation of a director who is highly
respected by actors. Lindon concurs. ``It's because he loves
actors, listens to them, respects them, and because the actors in
his films are always good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about women that so interests Jacquot?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born a man,'' Jacquot said, ``and women are the part of
humanity that is at once familiar and very, very strange to me.
It's difficult for a man to ask the question, what is a man. It's
as if the question just doesn't arise. Or as if we already know the
response, and it's not necessarily amusing. But a woman can ask
herself the question, what is a woman? I try to respond to that
question with the female characters I invent and the actresses I
film. And they always lead me to further questions.''

JACEK KALABINSKI, 59, POLISH JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacek Kalabinski, a Polish journalist and former opposition
figure who worked in the United States since fleeing his native
land in 1983, died on Friday at his home in Rockville, Md. He was
59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kalabinski was the Washington-based correspondent of the Warsaw
daily Rzezcpospolita (The Republic). He previously worked for Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a program editor in New York and as a
senior correspondent in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A 1961 journalism graduate of the University of Warsaw, he did
postgraduate work at the Ecole Nationale des Sciences Politiques in
Paris and as a journalism fellow at Stanford University. He started
his career in the 1960s working as a reporter and editor in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he became a news editor for Polish Radio, and from 1973
to 1981 he was a foreign-affairs commentator for the Polish
National Radio network. After the imposition of martial law in
Poland, he was dismissed as ``unfit to serve in a militarized unit
of Polish Radio and Television.''
</P>
<P>
   He had become the president of the Warsaw chapter of the Polish
Journalists' Association in 1981. The association was shut down by
the government the following year. He then was foreign editor of a
Warsaw Catholic monthly and of Poland's largest uncensored
underground weekly, Tygodnik Mazowsze. By then in hiding and on an
arrest list, he wrote under the pen name Cassandra.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival in this country, he was named a visiting fellow
at Yale University. His Op-Ed articles on Central Europe and the
Soviet Union soon appeared in The New York Times and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A linguist, he also accompanied Lech Walesa to Capitol Hill when
Walesa, the chairman of Solidarity, Nobel laureate and Poland's
future president, addressed Congress in November 1989. To the
audience, his voice, a radio-trained baritone, became Walesa's,
rendering the speech into idiomatic English as the visitor asked
for support in efforts to make Poland ``the America of the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalabinski's survivors include his wife, Barbara; a daughter,
Marta, 14; and his mother, Maria Kalabinska, of Warsaw.

 &HT;    LEWINSKY GRANTED RARE 'TRANSACTIONAL' IMMUNITY FOR TESTIMONY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky has bargained away her Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent in exchange for transactional
immunity, a form of blanket protection so comprehensive it's rarely
granted by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal guarantees that Lewinsky won't go to jail in connection
with her alleged White House tryst, regardless of any evidence that
might arise against her.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to grant her such immunity, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr has sacrificed his chance to catch a little fish in
order to have a crack at the big one: President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Transactional immunity means basically that he's promised that
there'll be no prosecution of her whatsoever, under any
circumstances, in connection with events coming out of this whole
transaction,'' said Thomas C. Green, an attorney with the
Washington firm of Sidley &AMP; Austin who has defended several targets
of independent counsel inquiries. ''It's something that can be
bargained for, and it would be an exceptional circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, for her part, promised her ''full and truthful''
testimony, in the words of her attorney, Plato Cacheris, who
announced the immunity deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That means Lewinsky must answer any and all questions Starr
might raise when he hauls her before the grand jury probing
allegations that Clinton had a sexual relationship with the former
White House intern and later urged her to lie about it, charges
Clinton has denied.
</P>
<P>
   She will not have the option of hiding behind the Fifth
Amendment, which protects citizens from self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no prospect they're going to be prosecuted, in
essence, there's no possibility of self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are no consequences to your testifying against
yourself, then you cannot keep your mouth shut,'' said Frank
Schuchat, an attorney with the Denver law firm Holme, Roberts &AMP;
Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why immunity is given,'' explained James S. Blumstein,
professor of law at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. ''You have
no absolute rights to remain silent if the government says it will
not prosecute you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Starr interrogates Lewinsky before the grand jury,
Blumstein said, ''they will undoubtedly have in their possession
something that would incriminate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has stated in a sworn affidavit that she had no sexual
relationship with Clinton, a position she contradicted in taped
telephone conversations she had with former Pentagon co-worker,
Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached Tuesday, Lewinsky could testify as
to whether her earlier affidavit was truthful, without fear of
being indicted for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also forfeit their Fifth Amendment rights in exchange
for a more limited, and more widely extended, form of protection
known as ''use immunity.'' Under that form of protection,
prosecutors may not use anything a witness says to prosecute them,
or to seek evidence to prosecute them, though the person can still
be prosecuted if evidence surfaces independently that they have
committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''A grant of 'use immunity' is not an absolute guarantee that
you will not be prosecuted,'' Green, the Washington lawyer, said.

ONCE MISSING, SPACECRAFT EQUIPPED TO STUDY SUN IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Skedded earlier as SCI-LOST-SATELLITE.) 
(th) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Astronomers have located the missing SOHO
spacecraft, which suddenly went silent a month ago while observing
the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Gurman, the NASA project scientist for the joint
U.S.-European Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) project,
said Tuesday that space agency officials still hoped to regain
control of the scientific observatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little better off today than we were a week ago,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the European Space Agency announced that ground-based
radio telescopes situated thousands of miles apart were able to
find the $1 billion satellite last Thursday by sending radar
signals into the area of space where the craft should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, used their radio telescope, which is 990 feet
in diameter, to transmit radar signals toward SOHO's location,
almost a million miles from Earth. NASA's 230-foot Deep Space
Network dish in Goldstone, Calif., picked up signals reflecting off
the satellite and was able to track it for more than an hour,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft is very close to its original position and is
turning slowly at a rate of about one revolution per minute,
scientists said. This slow spin rate is encouraging, they added,
suggesting that minimal structural damage has occurred to the
craft. SOHO is equipped with special instruments to study sunlight
at different wavelengths and to analyze particles and magnetic
fields generated by the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft orbits the Sun at a point between Earth and the
Sun where the gravity of each body cancels out that of the other
and keeps the craft in a stable spot.
</P>
<P>
   SOHO was launched on Dec. 2, 1995, and was designed to stay
operational for at least two years. Scientists had hoped to
continue the mission into the next century as the Sun goes through
a period of maximum activity.
</P>
<P>
   Radio contact with the spacecraft was lost on June 24 when it
was given erroneous computer instructions, causing the craft's
solar power panels to switch positions away from the Sun. Deprived
of sunlight, the satellite lost power and stopped responding to
orders from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Gurman, working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., where SOHO is controlled, said engineers hope
further radar observations will refine the craft's position and
give more precise information on SOHO's orientation and spin. There
is a possibility that the craft will slowly align its solar panels
with the Sun over the next few weeks and get enough power to allow
it to respond to commands, he said. &QL;

CLINTON MAY BE LATEST PRESIDENT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, if independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has his way, would become the first U.S. chief executive to
testify in a criminal proceeding in which he is the target.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton _ no stranger to providing testimony _ would merely
be the latest in a long, recent string of presidents who have
either provided documents to a court or sworn to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon, even during the height of Watergate, was never
subpoenaed to testify. However, Nixon _ after losing a historic
Supreme Court battle _ was compelled to surrender his recordings of
White House conversations to special prosecutor Leon Jaworski as
part of the investigation of the president and his men.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan, under investigation in the Iran-Contra
scandal, provided written answers under oath to independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh's questions. Reagan, a target of Walsh's
investigation, was not indicted in the investigation of the
diversion to Nicaraguan rebels of funds from the sale of U.S. arms
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   One president even appeared as a witness for the prosecution.
Gerald Ford testified against Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who had
tried to assassinate him on Sept. 5, 1975, in Sacramento, Calif.
Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, was convicted and sentenced
to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter, his peanut business under federal
investigation for alleged financial misdeeds, answered questions
under oath from special prosecutor Paul Curran in 1979. The
investigation revealed no wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, President Thomas Jefferson was subpoenaed
to provide documents in the 1807 treason trial of his former vice
president Aaron Burr, accused of scheming to convince some states
to secede from the Union. Burr was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has testified three times since taking office in January
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He gave videotaped testimony in the trial of James and Susan
McDougal, his former partners in the failed Whitewater land deal.
Clinton also answered questions under oath from former Whitewater
independent counsel Robert Fiske.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president provided a sworn deposition in a
since-dismissed lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, alleging that
Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, made unwelcome sexual advances
toward the state employee in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel room. The
truthfulness of Clinton's testimony during that deposition, in
which he denied having had a sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, is part of Starr's wide-ranging
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton may have the Constitution on his side if Starr
persists with his effort to force the president to answer questions
regarding an alleged cover-up of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution is silent on whether a sitting president can be
subpoenaed. However, the Constitution does state that a president
can be removed from office by impeachment in the House of
Representatives followed by conviction in the Senate for ``treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The carefully delineated impeachment process might bar the use
of any other procedure, such as criminal prosecution, for
preventing the president from performing his duties, David Crump, a
University of Houston law professor, said.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional separation of powers between the judicial and
executive branches could prevent courts from ordering the president
to testify. Allowing the federal judiciary to compel presidential
testimony would enable judges hostile to the president to harass
the chief executive by frivolously calling him to testify, Crump
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the commander in chief, the leader of the
free world, and he has scheduling responsibilities that are
dramatic and awesome,'' Crump added. ``Subpoenas could be used to
harass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law
professor, said a president has ``no greater rights or privileges
than an ordinary citizen'' subpoenaed to appear before a grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subpoena was not served upon the president of the United
States,'' Turley noted. ``The subpoena was served upon a citizen,
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor predicted that federal courts ``would make fast
work'' of a White House effort to challenge the subpoena on
constitutional grounds, saying judges would be loath to place the
president beyond their judicial authority. ``The likelihood that
the president could quash the subpoena ranks with an asteroid
hit,'' Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   American University law professor Thomas Sargentich, however,
sees shades of gray in the subpoena dispute. Courts have yet to
decide whether a sitting president can be indicted for a crime, and
just as much uncertainty exists as to whether a chief executive can
be subpoenaed to testify in a criminal investigation that could
lead to his indictment, Sargentich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what exactly a court would do,'' the professor
added. ``To subpoena a sitting president is an aggressive action
that hasn't been done before, but we know that Ken Starr is willing
to break precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena has been a tool Starr has wielded often in trying
to uncover whether Clinton obstructed the investigation of his
relationship with Lewinsky. The independent counsel has
successfully sought to compel the testimony of Secret Service
agents who guard the president and of Bruce Lindsey, the deputy
White House counsel and a long-time Clinton friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's effort to compel Clinton's testimony could set the
stage for a major constitutional challenge not seen since the
Supreme Court ruled 8-0 on July 24, 1974, that Nixon must surrender
his tapes. Shortly after complying with the court order, Nixon
resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A moment of Monica, a full day of 'coverage'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the endgame. There's a sprint to the finish,''
announced Wolf Blitzer, CNN's guy at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That sprint turned out to be a walk. Didn't matter: On Tuesday,
TV finally got the summer replacement series it's been waiting,
waiting, waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's cameras quickly left Blitzer for the Washington office
building where Monica Lewinsky was expected to meet her lawyers.
When she finally arrived, CNN caught her stepping down a narrow
path cleared through a herd of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That's all CNN needed: the 10-second walk would be replayed all
day, eventually unreeled in slow motion and stretched into a more
profound 20 seconds, like a Sam Peckinpah death scene.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as is often the case in these media-made events, TV seemed
in disagreement with itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't exactly ax murder,'' allowed CNN legal analyst
Greta van Susteren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't judge anyone until the final report comes in,'' added
Michael Weisskopf, a reporter CNN recruited from Time magazine to
speculate on events about which he didn't think anyone should
speculate. ``This is only the seventh inning.''
</P>
<P>
   So TV focused on the seventh-inning stretch. CNBC aimed its
cameras unblinkingly at the media waiting for Lewinsky's attorneys
to announce the immunity deal everyone had been reporting all day.
CNBC was covering a news conference that was not yet a news
conference _ these days, a sort of scoop.
</P>
<P>
   We saw a reporter ... turn to her right! Another reporter ...
shifted weight from his right foot to his left! Still another did
... nothing! Just nothing. Nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls show this (the Lewinsky story) has been irritating to
the American public,'' mused CNBC ``Power Lunch'' anchor Bill
Griffeth. ``They'd rather this story go away.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC then ran its own tape of Lewinsky walking from a car into
her lawyers' building.
</P>
<P>
   Now that CNN and CNBC had prepped us with their exhaustive
pre-news conference coverage (``Making sausages isn't always
pretty,'' CNN's Frank Sesno said as cameras caught reporters
laughing cynically after Lewinsky's walk), the broadcast networks
stepped in for live reports.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was this: Lewinsky lawyer Plato Cacheris
taking maybe 20 seconds to say his client had been given
transactional immunity. He didn't take questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does transactional mean?'' a reporter yelled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look it up in the dictionary,'' another reporter advised.
</P>
<P>
   More sausages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case you missed it, here was the sum total of today's
streetside press conference,'' NBC's Brian Williams said with a
hint of irony. NBC then reran the full 20-second drama of a lawyer
in a pinstripe suit making a statement and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' Dan Rather was shorter on irony, longer on acting
straight-shootin' dude. ``A huge coup for her attorneys, bad news
for President Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rather couldn't resist. ``Let me put `if' in italics,''
he said, by way of jumping into the day's speculative pool.
</P>
<P>
   So what did we learn from Tuesday's breathless coverage?
</P>
<P>
   We learned that in covering an event, TV doesn't even need an
event anymore. That it can replace real drama with speculation
about drama yet to come. And that it's not above chastising itself
for doing what it's doing _ and then doing it some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, this matter will come to some kind of end,''
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said at his own news
conference, before sighing for all of us, ``One would hope.''
</P>

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

BLACK LAWYERS NOT LIKELY TO WARM TO THOMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clarence Thomas, as the second black justice in the history of
the US Supreme Court, should be enjoying a hero's welcome Wednesday
when he is scheduled to appear in Memphis before the country's
largest association of black lawyers and judges, the National Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his appearance has already reignited the long-running
firefight that pits him against nearly the entire leadership of the
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the tensions that boiled over when he was named to
succeed Thurgood Marshall not abated, they have hardened into
bitterness and suspicion. Thomas has made it clear that he has no
use for mainstream civil rights thinking. And, in turn, a movement
built largely on judicial action has no patience for the country's
highest ranking black judge.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thomas's decision to show up Wednesday is viewed as a
gesture of defiance. His invitation to speak this spring was
quickly disowned and denounced by much of the association's
membership. But Thomas simply ignored efforts to get him to cancel
his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials deny that they are attempting to silence
Thomas out of disagreement. But they argue that the panel that
invited him had no right to do so, and say Thomas should have taken
the hint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had thousands of speakers who represent every point of
view in the political spectrum,'' said A.J. Cooper, a bar
association board member who supported Thomas seven years ago and
opposes him now. ``We have a right to decide who we want to speak
to us and who we don't. If someone else doesn't like it that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said, and many association members agree with him, that
Thomas has sold out the fundamental values of the civil rights
movement. But the justice and his supporters would argue that many
of the legal tools the civil rights movement used have become
dated, even counterproductive. Thomas has drawn criticism from
black liberals for nearly 20 years, but shows no inclination to
change his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who supported him by and large are dissapointed that he
led them to believe he was going to be a justice who would listen
seriosuly to concerns about minorities and women and poor people in
America,'' said Harvard Law professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr., who
was among those who thought Thomas should steer clear of the bar
association event. Ogletree was an opponent of Thomas's nomination
to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ... said Thurgood Marshall was a hero,'' Ogletree said.
``He led many to believe he would at least respect the precedental
value of decisions of affirmative action and other issues. He has
dissapointed people who were among his staunch supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yale Law Professor Stephen L. Carter, who had been a clerk
for Thurgood Marshall, said Thomas has been been attacked for
deviating from orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't agree with everything he says by a long shot, I
think the notion that we should try to screen for the correct black
position is really dangerous,'' Carter said. ``We should embrace
diversity within the community as much as as we embrace it
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints against Thomas center around his views on voting
rights, affirmative action, and prisoner rights.
</P>
<P>
   In one ruling often pointed to by critics, he voted to reject an
affirmative action policy at the University of Texas Law School.
The retired chief judge of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia, A. Leon Higginbotham argued that the Hopwood v. Texas
decision helped lay the groundwork for the abolition of the
affirmative action efforts in the University of California system.
</P>
<P>
   Association members also feel stung by the fact that the group
endorsed Thomas when he was nominated for the court in 1991 after
being persuaded that that he would eventually ``come around'' to
embrace affirmative action, minority-influenced voting districts
and other civil rights stands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thomas has sided with the conservative wing on the
court and joined the slim court majority that has consistently
voted to weaken all those measures. Those votes are viewed by
opponents as not merely differences of opinion, but as acts of
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a struggle,'' said Ronald Walters, a political
science professor at the University of Maryland. ``As a community
we're faced with a question: Do we go along with him simply because
he's going to be here, or do we fight for our legacy? Most of us
have decided to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Sanders is an attorney and civil rights activist in Selma,
Alabama, home of some of the most dramatic and pivotal protests of
the 1960s. She argues that the voting rights gains of that era have
been eroded as a direct result of Thomas' actions. She said a plan
that could have led to the election of more black judges in Alabama
was recently scrapped because of fears that it would not pass
Supreme Court muster.
</P>
<P>
   Carter notes that Thomas's battles with civil rights activists
date back to his stint as head of the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. Even then, as a rising black star in the
Reagan administration, he was viewed with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite apart from the the issues there's some personal stuff
here, too,'' Carter said. ``There are a lot of people who have
positions silmilar to his on affirmative action who don't generate
the same level of outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   After it became clear that Thomas would proceed with plans to
speak to the association, Ogletree and Higginbotham offered to host
a panel on Marshall's legacy, to be held immediately after Thomas'
speech. That invitation was quickly accepted.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Jones needs to grow up
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what Andruw Jones needs? He needs a good spanking from
my grandmother back in Indiana. If not that, he needs somebody who
is big and bad inside the Atlanta Braves clubhouse to shout in his
ears so often that he either gets the message about hustling at all
times or requires a hearing aid before his 22nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That somebody has to be a player. It can't be a coach or even
manager Bobby Cox. But there is no such player in sight for this
team whose strength overall is its weakness, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the Braves are huge on professionalism. In fact, with
Tom Glavine leading the way, they've won more games than anybody
during this decade by featuring players who haven't needed to be
told by anybody to give their best every second. They've just done
it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, until now. In case you haven't noticed, the Braves are
being held hostage by a highly talented guy who has these spurts of
indifference on the field. Although something must be done about
Jones' growing problem, the options aren't good for Braves
officials.
</P>
<P>
   They could ship Jones back to the minors, but they won't, and
they shouldn't. It isn't practical at this point. Two seasons ago,
Jones became better than Mickey Mantle during a World Series Game,
and Jones often flashes the skills of Willie Mays during his second
full season in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the next option: They could trade Jones, say,
before Friday's deadline for as much as they can get. It also would
be foolish. In spite of Jones' shaky attitude toward the game at
times, he remains a cheap and worthy commodity for the Braves as a
player with less than three years of experience. The only reason
why you would trade somebody as young and as promising as Jones
would be if he were a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't a bad guy. Take it from Cox, who said Tuesday from
the visiting clubhouse at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, where the
Braves are playing the Reds, ``I like Andruw, and we talk all the
time. In fact, I probably talk to Andruw more than I talk to
anybody on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but many of those chats between Cox and Jones haven't
resembled those between Barney and Baby Bop. Cox said, ``If this
were somebody with less talent than Andruw, he would have been gone
(from this organization) about two or three years ago. You just
can't tolerate somebody giving less than 100 percent, and when you
have a team like this that features a good work ethic, somebody who
doesn't really sticks out.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Cox has employed everything shy of capital punishment
to get Jones to resemble his peers on the Braves. Cox even tried
baseball's Bataan Death March last week by yanking a nonchalant
Jones from the outfield before the end of an inning and making him
jog toward the dugout in embarrassment before a packed house at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Four days later in Pittsburgh, Jones loafed after a
ball that shot by him for an inside-the-park home run. Although Cox
defended Jones' effort on the play, it is difficult for the rest of
us to give somebody with Jones' recent past the benefit of the
doubt.

MYANMAR UNDER FOREIGN PRESSURE FOR STANDOFF WITH DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ The United States joined with six other
nations Tuesday in demanding that the army generals who run
Myanmar, formerly called Burma, end their five-day standoff with
the leader of that country's democratic opposition, whose car has
been surrounded by armed security forces on a rural highway since
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was stopped about
30 miles outside Yangon, formerly called Rangoon, the capital of
Myanmar, as she drove to a meeting with supporters. Her party won
an overwhelming majority in a national election in 1990, but the
military junta refused to turn over power to a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to
bring democracy to Myanmar, has refused to budge from her white
sedan, which was reported on Tuesday to have been surrounded by
soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the foreign ministers
of six countries who are here for a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations _ Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand,
South Korea and Austria, representing the European Union _ met on
Tuesday with the Myanmar foreign minister to insist that the junta
end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that the seven nations had urged the
Myanmar government to allow the U.S. and Japanese ambassadors in
Yangon to go to see Suu Kyi on the roadside and to serve as
mediators in the dispute. They said there was no immediate response
to the proposal from the junta, which calls itself the State Peace
and Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leader was freed from house arrest in 1995 after
nearly six years of confinement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright said at a news conference here after meeting
with Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw. ``We hope very much that
there will be a resolution to the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Albright met
with Suu Kyi in Yangon, and she continues to correspond with the
dissident leader. Albright said the United States had received
encouraging reports on Suu Kyi's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is still with her car,'' the secretary said on Tuesday.
``She has enough food and water and medical attention, and her
health is OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it is usually kind of a normal practice for countries
to allow their citizens to travel freely within them and to be able
to meet with whomever they want. I think this is an international
norm that many countries obviously support.''
</P>
<P>
   During this week's meetings in Manila, Albright has repeatedly
singled out the Myanmar junta for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Monday she warned in a speech that Myanmar, which joined the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year, had reached ``a
moment of truth'' and that the nation faced ``a social breakdown or
explosion'' after decades of repression. She said the United States
held the junta directly responsible for Suu Kyi's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Yangon, Suu Kyi's political party, the
National League for Democracy, said she had been visited on the
road Tuesday by her doctors. The statement gave no details on the
doctors' findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provisions in the car _ water and edibles _ are nearly
exhausted,'' the party said. ``Before her health conditions fail,''
it said, she and her two drivers ``should be allowed to proceed on
their journey.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in the last month that Suu Kyi, the
Oxford-educated daughter of Myanmar's national independence hero, U
Aung San, has been stopped as she tried to travel outside Yangon to
meet with members of her party.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by the United States may mean less to the Myanmar
junta than the criticism offered by the governments of Japan and
South Korea, which have much closer economic and diplomatic ties
with Myanmar. The United States has relatively little economic
leverage left, since it has already imposed severe economic
sanctions on Myanmar as a result of its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The junta responded to the international criticism on Tuesday,
issuing a statement in Manila in which it insisted that Suu Kyi had
provoked this week's standoff by failing to give the military
notice of her travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Her car was stopped about 30 miles south of Yangon to prevent an
``untoward incident from occurring which could affect the peace,
tranquillity and security,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It accused her of trying to create ``a political issue'' by
staging the incident during this week's meeting of foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other
countries with an interest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Her car was stopped, the junta suggested, for her own
protection. ``Myanmar authorities,'' it said, ``have always
provided her with meticulous security measures at her request to
ward off any untoward foul play which could impinge on her security
and safety.''

 &HT;    Animal deaths prompt Delta, American to refuse pets
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five guard dogs, en route from Atlanta to South
Carolina for training, died from heat-related stress after
thunderstorms kept their Delta Air Lines flight grounded on a
broiling Hartsfield runway for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The June incident, now under investigation by federal
authorities, has prompted Atlanta-based Delta to join American
Airlines in banning animals from the cargo holds of U.S. passenger
flights through Sept. 15. The carriers cite the deadly heat wave
that's gripping most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want another animal fatality,'' said Delta spokesman
Bill Berry. ``It will probably be an inconvenience to some people,
but the pet owner, the animal lover, will see this is the best
approach to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating Delta for
possible violations of the Animal Welfare Act in connection with
the dogs' deaths. The airline paid for the animals' autopsies,
which determined they died after being subjected to heat stress in
the non-air-conditioned cargo hold, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Welfare Act, among other things, is designed to
prevent animal injury during air shipments. The USDA requires that
animals not be exposed to more than 85 degrees for more than four
hours, or less than 45 degrees for more than 45 minutes, prior to
boarding. There are no specific temperature requirements once the
animals are on board, ``but there's a requirement that they handle
these (animals) in a way that doesn't allow them to expire,'' said
USDA spokesman Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has investigated hundreds of animal welfare complaints
involving U.S. airlines in the past 10 years. American Airlines and
Delta recently settled cases with the department. In 1994, Delta
was fined $140,000 after 32 puppies died when a two-hour weather
delay created unbearable conditions in a cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   Under Delta's new policy, passengers cannot check animals as
baggage through Sept. 15, though if their pet fits in an under-seat
carrier, they can bring it aboard with an advance reservation and a
$60 fee, Berry said. Passengers can also ship their animals on a
Delta Air Cargo flight, if the temperature is below 85 degrees at
the airports where the plane will depart, connect and land.
</P>
<P>
   Delta passengers who are in the middle of a trip with animals
will be allowed to check them on the return flight if the 85 degree
benchmark isn't exceeded; passengers affected by the embargo can
re-book or receive refunds.

BELL ATLANTIC-GTE DEAL DRIVES DOWN TELECOMMUNICATIONS STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't often that a merger announcement drives down the prices
of stocks across an industry. But it happened Tuesday, as investors
absorbed the news that Bell Atlantic was paying $53 billion in
stock for the GTE Corp. in a deal structured as a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day's trading, the Bell Atlantic-GTE
combination looked more like the pin that burst the
telecommunications stock bubble than a go-go megamerger. The group,
which had traded at a price-earnings multiple of 27 earlier this
year, was down to a below-market multiple of 21 Tuesday. Months of
merger hype and investor hopes went pop. Like that.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight stocks that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's
telephone index fell Tuesday. The only stock in the group that rose
was US West, which inched ahead 6.25 cents, to $53.75. To be sure,
most stocks were hurt in a weak overall market, but the deal helped
drive the telecommunications index down almost 3 percent to around
613.82. That was well down from its April high of 658.29.
</P>
<P>
   Most distressing, especially to investors who had bought GTE
shares on takeover hopes, was the action in those shares. They
opened at $51.75, down $4 from Monday's close, but rallied to close
at $53.0625, down $2.6875 on the day. Shares in acquirer Bell
Atlantic fell 68.75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $44.3125.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal were not exactly generous to investors.
Instead of getting a premium to the market price for their stock,
as expected, GTE holders got a discount. Bell Atlantic agreed to
hand over 1.22 of its shares for each GTE share. That translated to
$54.90 a share, below the $55.75 price of GTE stock the day before
the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   It is typical in a takeover for an acquirer's shares to decline.
But the drop in GTE's stock was puzzling to investors who were
positive on the deal. Ray McCaffrey, portfolio manager and analyst
at Pilgrim Baxter Value Investors, who owns the stock for his
clients, said, ``There's no dilution in the deal, it's accretive to
both companies' earnings, and it gives them a chance to be one of
the survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   What was behind GTE's dismal stock performance?
</P>
<P>
   Money managers gave several explanations. Mario Gabelli, a money
manager and telecommunications stock fan, said that although the
deal would create a company with a strong balance sheet and
financial muscle, it fell far short of what is required nowadays
for companies hoping to compete worldwide with giants like Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom and British Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal solves some minor issues,'' Gabelli said. ``But it
doesn't address the globalization of the telecom market. It is
still landlocked, still parochial. They need to accelerate the pace
to create a global alliance.'' Gabelli suggested that a logical
partner for an American company would be British Telecom. ``You
can't draw a Maginot Line at the borders of your country and say
you are going to compete on a global basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the deal wreak havoc on the entire telecommunications
sector? One reason may be a growing belief among investors that the
Bell Atlantic-GTE deal would result in increased scrutiny by
regulators on previously announced deals that are not yet closed.
Ameritech stock, for instance, fell almost 5 percent Tuesday on
fears that its acquisition by SBC Communications, announced in May,
would not pass regulatory muster.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to regulatory fears is the fact that there is little in
the deal that brings more competition to the local service market.
With $110 billion in revenues, local phone service is the biggest
telecommunications market. In exchange for letting some of these
mergers go through, Federal regulators may insist on prying open
those markets to competition, perhaps by requiring a regional
company like Bell Atlantic to offer competitors the chance to lease
the last mile of cable that goes into people's homes for a
reasonable rate.
</P>
<P>
   If the Federal Communications Commission were to release the
grip that regional Bell companies currently have on local service
markets, the impact on all the companies, including GTE, would be
great. Local service generated 28 percent of GTE's revenues last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The tremors that the deal sent through the entire
telecommunications sector Tuesday led some market watchers to
wonder whether the merger signaled a turning point in
telecommunications valuations. GTE was a well-known takeover
candidate, after all; its stock traded as high as $62 in April on
the assumption that it would be bought. At that level, optimistic
investors seemed to think the company could fetch $65 a share in a
buyout, or even more.
</P>
<P>
   For GTE shareholders to accept the equivalent of less than $55 a
share for their stock means that valuations of other companies in
the business, especially the regional Bell operating companies,
will almost certainly be ratcheted down.
</P>
<P>
   So says Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an
institutional investor advisory firm in New York. ``Most people are
surprised that GTE accepted this'' offer, said Burnett.
``Underneath it says to me, `We couldn't get the stock back to $65
or $70 on its own, so we decided to join up with these guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Burnett said, investors Tuesday were busy
reconfiguring values in the industry. ``Reality is very often
different from the hopes and prayers that go into pre-announcement
trading,'' he said. ``The hopes that GTE is a $70 stock have been
dashed.''

LEADERS EULOGIZE SLAIN OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two police officers who considered themselves
ordinary men were hailed by President Clinton Tuesday as
extraordinary symbols of ``quiet courage and uncommon bravery'' as
they were honored in ``the hall of heroes'' at the US Capitol, the
building they died defending.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony fraught with emotion, the grieving families of
Detective John M. Gibson and Private First Class Jacob J. Chestnut
sat before their flag-draped caskets in the majestic Rotunda as
Clinton and congressional leaders extended the nation's sympathy
and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Police officers were shot to death last Friday as
they protected hundreds of tourists and congressional workers from
a gunman who broke into the building, apparently firing
indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   ``In passing, your husbands and fathers brought together this
nation,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. ``Their
devotion to duty, sacrifice to defend freedom and commitment to
life has reminded millions and millions of people that while this
building is the center of freedom in the world, it only lasts as
long as there is courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officers' widows fought back tears, they were surrounded,
in a striking display of support and unity, by Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole, several Cabinet members, US Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, the 535-member Congress and hundreds of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but the officers' immediate families remained standing
throughout the 45-minute service, a moving gesture of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, 58, and Gibson, 42, were the first individuals other
than unknown soldiers of war to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda
who were not widely recognized figures. Flanked by white-gloved
honor guards, their caskets lay on the marble floor where the
coffins of eight presidents have rested.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the near-anonymity of the officers, several leaders
said, that made them powerful symbols of the risks that law
enforcement officers brave daily across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fitting that we gather here to honor these two American
heroes in this hallowed chamber that has known so many heroes, in
this Capitol they gave their lives to defend,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring them, Clinton added, ``We honor also the hundreds of
thousands of other officers who stand ready to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   An overflow crowd of thousands listened silently and bowed their
heads outside the Capitol while the voices of Clinton and the other
dignitaries boomed through loudspeakers. Even scores of tired
children showed remarkable restraint in the 90-degree heat, staring
quietly at the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the officers' families squeezed together near a bust of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a portrait depicting the
signing of the Declaration of Independence. As their eyes glistened
with tears, many of the mourners glanced at the Rotunda's frescoed
dome ceiling, towering nearly 10 stories above them.
</P>
<P>
   The dome is topped by the Statue of Freedom, one of the most
prominent sights on the Washington skyline. ``The monument for
these two heroes is the monument of freedom that is exemplified by
this building,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In a private moment afterward, the Clintons and some lawmakers
met with the officers' families. Gibson is a Waltham, Mass. native
whose wife, Evelyn, is the niece of Representative J. Joseph
Moakley, Democrat of South Boston. The couple has three children,
Kristen, John and Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very brave and very courageous, but clearly they are
just really hurting,'' Senator John F. Kerry said after meeting
with the Gibson family.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the Gibsons are ``very grateful for all the support
they have gotten. They really feel the sense of shared grief, and
they are very grateful for everybody's reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's wife, Wen Ling, attended the ceremony with their
three children, Joseph, Janece and Janet, and his two children from
a previous marriage, Karen and William.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery
after separate funerals Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in the shooting, Russell Eugene Weston Jr.,
underwent surgery Tuesday for his wounds and was in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's ceremonies, members of the House and Senate
paid a private tribute to the officers. Many hugged Representative
Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, whose office Gibson
was assigned to protect when he died. Friends and foes alike hugged
DeLay, from Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, to
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was kind of staggered by it all,'' Kerry said of the
shootings. ``There is a pall over the whole place.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service was part of a day-long tribute to the
officers, as their caskets lay in the Rotunda for 11 hours and were
viewed by thousands of lawmakers, congressional workers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Heads bowed, the mourners slowly circled the caskets in a
clockwise procession of grief, the rhythm of their footsteps
piercing the eerie stillness. Some crossed themselves, others
cried, and nearly all moved through in reverent silence.
</P>
<P>
   Among them strode other ordinary men and women, like Gibson and
Chestnut, who keep the Capitol going every day: apron-clad cooks,
subway drivers, switchboard operators and many others.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by police delegations from around the country.

GAILEY UNLEASHES THE HITTING IN COWBOYS PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey ended Tuesday's
practice with a goal-line session featuring live hitting. It turned
a typical, mundane, technique-oriented workout into something
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The lively drill was topped off by a quarterback sneak for a
touchdown by Troy Aikman. The sight of ravaging defenders piling on
the $50-million man in a training-camp practice had many onlookers
gasping. It's a good bet Aikman had never participated in a live
quarterback sneak in his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't mind, saying ``I scored. They can't hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Chad Hennings jabbed, ``He should be a
fullback; he weighs 235 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to another example of Camp Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is proving to be a Jimmy Johnson-like psychologist. He
said the snippets of ``live'' hitting, compared to the daily doses
of full contact at past Cowboys camps, are by design. He said it
ensures high quality and enthusiastic contact when the players
finally get an opportunity to let go.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that ``chomping at the bit'' premise holds true when
the Cowboys meet Seattle in their preseason opener Friday night at
Texas Stadium. MILLS: SLOWER BUT SMARTER
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys veteran receiver Ernie Mills calls them the good old
days. He watches Jimmy Oliver, Billy Davis and Stepfret Williams
run in practice and remembers the days when he could run fast and
free.
</P>
<P>
   A torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, sustained in
the 1996 Super Bowl, changed all of that. Now, the eight-year
veteran Mills gets by on guile and savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's why they call you a veteran,'' said Mills, 29.
``I have to learn different things to get open. It takes a while to
learn some things. Now, I can run routes without having a marked
field, because I've been running routes for a long time. I just got
a better feel for the game. I know when the quarterback is getting
ready to throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who said he was smaller when he was faster, has turned to
the weight room to add strength and bulk. He also said he's a film
guy now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the league, if you cut on a film, it was a
struggle for me to stay awake,'' Mills said. ``Now, I watch and
study defensive backs.'' GONZALEZ ENDORSEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The release of former TCU quarterback Max Knake was an
endorsement of sorts for rookie free-agent Danny Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cowboys brought in Josh LaRocca to compete for the
third quarterback spot, Gailey said he likes what he has seen in
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong arm and good knowledge of the game,'' Gailey
said. OFFICIALS IN CAMP
</P>
<P>
   Three NFL referees were at practice Tuesday to work with the
Cowboys on rules interpretations. The officials will stay until
tomorrow, when they will conduct a presentation about rules changes
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence was met with approval from Gailey, who said he
told the officials to tell players when they have committed a
penalty and why, while telling the players not to be shy about
asking for clarifications and interpretations from the officials.
MAKING YOU GO HMMM
</P>
<P>
   Following the morning practice, receivers Michael Irvin and
Billy Davis stayed late to catch passes from quarterbacks Jason
Garrett and LaRocca, while the team's corps of young receivers
traipsed off to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   If Irvin or Davis need extra practice, how about Macey Brooks,
who has struggled. Or Jeff Ogden, who has missed several days of
practice due to injury. Or Stepfret Williams, who is fighting for a
starting job. Or roster long shots Michael Hicks and Taj Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Cowboys' coaching staff didn't notice.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON WILL BENEFIT IF LEWINSKY TESTIFIES FIRST 
</HEADLINE>

CLINTON-LEWINSKY-CHRONO) 
(bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's decision to cooperate with
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr added fresh legal urgency to the
political strategy of delay that President Clinton has pursued over
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton and his lawyers have waged in a political war
of attrition against Starr. Delay worked in the president's favor
because in the protracted fights over executive privilege,
attorney-client privilege, and whether the Secret Service should be
allowed to testify before Starr's grand jury, the Independent
Counsel was portrayed as partisan and overzealous.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his lawyers lost many of the legal rounds they fought
against Starr, the president's approval ratings soared and Starr's
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, the president said he wanted to tell the
American people the full story sooner rather than later. Then his
lawyers said that Starr's tactics made further statements from the
president, beyond his initial denial of a sexual relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, too perilous. Then, as they threw roadblocks in front
of Starr, Clinton's defenders complained that Starr's investigation
was taking longer than it took the United States to win World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a more tangible legal reason for Clinton to try to
seek more time before he decides whether to give testimony to Starr
and comply with the subpoena he has received from the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   With prosecution of Ms. Lewinsky all but impossible (she would
only be vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies to the grand
jury), the president himself appears to be the main target of
Starr's expanded, six-month probe of an alleged affair between the
president and the former intern. So Clinton would almost certainly
benefit from having Ms. Lewinsky's version of events be given to
Starr before his, hoping to learn what she said either through
contacts between his lawyers and hers, or from leaks in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would prefer to go in to testify knowing what has gone on
before,'' said Lawrence Barcella, a former Justice Department
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's agreement with Starr creates the potential for a
``he said/she said legal confrontation'' in which Ms. Lewinsky
would be the lead witness against the president. Ms. Lewinsky has
agreed to tell Starr that she did have a sexual relationship with
Clinton, according to lawyers familiar with her talks with Starr,
while the president has denied any relationship. Since Clinton
swore, in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, that they had not
had sex, Ms. Lewinsky's assertions could make the president
vulnerable to a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the details of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony could help the
president develop specific rebuttals and question her credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement with Starr significantly
complicates the most important decision the president must reach in
coming days, whether to comply with the subpoena he received from
Starr, the first summons to a sitting president to appear before a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Lewinsky's deal and his own legal jeopardy heightened,
many lawyers would normally advise someone in Clinton's place to
avoid testifying altogether, either by moving to quash the subpoena
or by citing the constitutional right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is no ordinary witness. Every legal decision he
considers is freighted with political consequence. Whatever the
Constitution says, the American public often views citing the Fifth
Amendment as an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in criminal cases, targets are not summoned before
grand juries. ``An individual who is invited to appear before a
grand jury knowing that he is a target is normally advised that to
do so would not be in his best interest,'' explained Richard Ben
Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the president's advisers believe he must eventually
testify. But in negotiating with Starr over the terms of any
presidential testimony, a process that is itself almost guaranteed
to win further delay, almost all of Clinton's advisers agree that
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony should come first, according to several
lawyers close to his defense team.
</P>
<P>
   The details and scope of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony could become
known to Clinton's lawyers through the press.
</P>
<P>
   A second way Clinton's lawyers could learn about Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony is through the lawyers' network. Several of the lawyers
representing witnesses in the investigation share information and
there is nothing that legally prohibits a witness from discussing
his or her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal Ms. Lewinsky's new legal team struck with
Starr makes such behind-the-scenes cooperation and coordination
much more unlikely, it is not out of the question. Ms. Lewinsky's
lawyers are friendly with the president's team. Plato Cacheris, for
example, is so chummy with Robert Bennett, one of the president's
lawyers, that he has helped him shop for a nattier wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   With Starr quickening the pace of his investigation and reaching
a culmination point, many House Republicans are on edge. The
president's strong political standing is one worry. Another is that
Starr, even with Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation, will wind up where he
began: with an investigation focused on the president's private
life.
</P>
<P>
   As the president proceeds with caution and deliberation,
balancing his political interests against his legal ones, so, too,
is the man who may have to act on Starr's findings, House Judiciary
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who would guide any impeachment inquiry, has indicated no
eagerness to receive a report from Starr. In an interview late last
week Hyde's counsel, Chicago lawyer David Schippers, said ``God
forbid it comes over.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, 68, is a seasoned prosecutor and a lifelong Democrat
who has known Hyde for years. Last winter, he agreed to move to
Washington and handle any impeachment investigation that Starr's
probe might trigger. He has put together a hand-picked team of
eight lawyers and investigators, many of whom he worked with in
Chicago. One is his son.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Hyde said his committee would need more than
evidence of an illicit affair to begin impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't impeach him for a peccadillo,'' Hyde said in a
television interview.

IS THERE DEMAND EVEN FOR COPIES OF COLLECTIBLES?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood-crazed collectors have long been willing to pay
handsomely for original props like Dorothy's red shoes. But
reproductions of collectibles?
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Books, a medium-sized San Francisco publishing house,
is betting that there is a market out there for such items, and
somewhat closer to earth than the Tatooine desert.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle has just issued ``Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential
Collection,'' by Stephen J. Sansweet, a former reporter for The
Wall Street Journal who is revered by other collectors for having
one of the world's most extensive holdings of ``Star Wars''
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars Scrapbook'' ($35) contains a newly printed
reproduction of a ticket to a 1983 screening of ``Return of the
Jedi,'' the third film in the ``Star Wars'' trilogy. The ticket
slips out of an envelope that has been glued to a page in the
scrapbook. There are also silver stickers that were given away in
Japan and a C-3PO mask that was distributed in England.
</P>
<P>
   Sansweet is unusual in an age when publishing houses want their
authors on every talk show: Chronicle said he has an arrangement
with Lucasfilm Ltd. that prevents him from talking about ``Star
Wars Scrapbook,'' which ranges from Ralph McQuarrie's original
poster (``The Star Wars'') to Australian potato chips that came
with Techno Tazos in each bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You needed 50 different Tazos for a complete set,'' Sansweet
writes, confessing to a chip-buying frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Star Wars Scrapbook'' is not the only book that Chronicle
is publishing. ``Star Wars: The Art of Ralph McQuarrie'' contains a
monograph about the sketch artist who translated the producer
George Lucas' ideas into the sketches that convinced the board of
20th Century Fox to give the project the green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like the people at Fox and other people working on the
first film, of course,'' McQuarrie said. ``They all felt we were
into something that might not make money,'' adding that he, too,
felt the film was so quirky that he would never see it on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be able to give you all sorts of lore about `Star
Wars' collecting,'' McQuarrie said, ``but I don't have a `Star
Wars' collection. I haven't been what you'd call a fan, really. I
just received a poster a fan wanted me to sign, and it was one I
hadn't seen before. They don't tell me what they're going to do
with the images I created.''
</P>
<P>
   How ``Star Wars'' spawned a cottage industry in collectibles is
by now something of a legend in Hollywood. Lucas was supposed to be
working on the script. But, as Sansweet put it in his book, Lucas
was procrastinating. And sipping coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of writing dialogue, he scribbled a note about an idea
that had more to do with earthbound collectors than with his
bizarre little universe of odd-looking aliens, robots with
strange-sounding names and something as mysterious as ``the
force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' is considered the first film with tie-ins that
captivated collectors. Sansweet writes that the demand for ``Star
Wars'' toys _ now prized by collectors and worth as much as $5,000
in original packaging _ was so great during the 1977 Christmas
season that the manufacturer ``decided to sell what even its
president concedes were basically `empty boxes' with a promise to
deliver some small action figures within a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   But those items cost $2 to $3, double or triple the price of the
first ``Star Wars'' collectible, a $1 T-shirt with the prophetic
inscription, ``Star Wars Corporation Poster (NU)1.'' Only 1,000
were printed; they sold poorly then, but today they go for $400
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So how hot is the market for ``Star Wars'' collectibles? Jason
Joiner, a British collector who is listed in the Guinness Book of
World Records for his 26,000-item ``Star Wars'' collection, says
there are two categories: ``old'' collectibles, which were
distributed when the films were first released, and ``new'' ones
issued for the re-releases. ``The new market is booming,'' he said.
``The old collectibles, which came out in '77, boomed until they
launched the figures again. They've been in a bit of a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions seem to be doing better. Peter Siegel, an owner of
Gotta Have It, a Manhattan gallery, prizes one of Yoda, which sold
for $250 in the 1970s. In the 1980s a catalogue company sold
reproductions of those originals for $900. Siegel has a
reproduction. ``I've been offered as much as $3,000 for it,'' he
said. ``It's not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   What collectors want most, real ``Star Wars'' props, are locked
away in Lucasfsilm warehouses. ``I've never found an actual prop
used in a `Star Wars' movie that checked out to be real,'' Siegel
said. ``There are reproductions out there. They sold reproduction
copies of the X-wing fighter and light sabers. They display
beautifully, they sell for $300 to $500 but they weren't in the
movie. If you had an actual prop used in the movie, one of the
actual light sabers, you could probably go to six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   But real props are out there. David Elkouby, a California
collector, has one. Well, only a piece of one _ C-3PO's backside.
He will say only that it came from a collection in private hands.
``They worked on the film years and years ago,'' he said. ``A lot
of stuff was being thrown away, and they held onto that one
piece.''

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) Microsoft Corp. denied it
committed any antitrust violations and countersued 20 states that
had charged the software giant with anti-competitive behavior. The
company said the states unconstitutionally undermined its software
property rights. It filed a formal denial to allegations in
antitrust lawsuits by 20 states and the U.S. Justice Department.
The company has been accused of trying to crush competition for the
Internet browser market to protect its virtual monopoly for
operating systems. In its counterclaim, Microsoft said that the
states were seeking ``to impose state-law restrictions on and
thereby impair Microsoft's rights under the Copyright Act and the
Constitution.'' The company also denied allegations contained in
the Justice Department's complaint that it asked Netscape
Communications Corp. executives to illegally divide the market for

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over two solid days, the cream of this city's
civic leadership has courted the Democratic Party's national
convention for 2000 with every carrot at its command, and somewhere
between the margaritas and the mariachis, the exploding wall of
balloons and the flying angel, the intensity of the effort took on
a sweetly comic small-town air.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a chorus of irresistible inner-city children
serenaded the 50-odd members of the party's site-selection
committee Tuesday morning with the soothing strains of ``California
Dreamin,''' the message was clear: The Democrats would be safe and
warm ... if they were in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   For this much-mocked metropolis, winning a national political
convention for the first time since John Kennedy was nominated here
in 1960 would mean more than playing host to thousands of delegates
and journalists, with their attendant tourism and perhaps $150
million in spending. It would also amount to a kind of massive
international coming-out party for a city that has largely
rebounded from the economic, natural and social disasters of the
early '90s and is bursting to tell the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city frankly gets a bad rap in the Eastern press and the
international press,'' said Eli Broad, the billionaire chairman of
Sun America Inc. and one of a bevy of high-powered local leaders,
including the entertainment mogul David Geffen, recruited to lead
the city's lobbying effort and $35 million public-private pledge of
financial support for the convention. ``They think of the Simpson
trial, the recessed economy, the loss of aerospace and defense
jobs, and perceptions lag reality. We want the opportunity to show
what L.A. is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is not alone in wanting the psychic and economic
boost that a convention would bring, and though party officials say
it has a very good chance, senior Democrats both here and in
Washington say that Vice President Al Gore _ who will get the final
say _ has a definite fondness for Philadelphia, where his old
friend Mayor Edward Rendell is making his own strong pitch to
revive a city beleaguered by economic and social woes.
</P>
<P>
   The site-selection committee, which is also considering Denver,
Boston, Minneapolis, New Orleans and Miami and is to make a
recommendation late this year, was supposed to visit Philadelphia
last month. But it arrived only to find picket lines in place for a
bitter transit strike and decided to postpone its visit just hours
after it arrived. The strike has since been tentatively settled and
the visit is to be rescheduled for this fall, but the Angelenos are
pressing every perceived advantage, chief among them California's
54 electoral votes, which all experts agree any Democratic
candidate must now have to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we get it,'' said Susan Estrich, who managed Michael
Dukakis' 1988 campaign and is now a professor at the University of
Southern California law school, as she munched crispy rolled
taquitos at a welcoming reception for the committee in downtown Los
Angeles on Tuesday. Her reasoning: The nominee ``either comes here
in the summer, or he spends the whole fall here campaigning. He's
got to spend the spring here anyway raising money, so he might as
well come in the summer when he can do both effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, as the committee members toured the sprawling
Convention Center downtown, which would serve as media work space
and staging area for the convention, and saw a spiffy video on the
new Staples Arena, the state-of-the art stadium that is being built
just across the street and that would house the convention itself,
the visitors all got Los Angeles Kings hockey jerseys emblazoned
with their names and the number 54.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee members entered the cavernous convention center
through a wall of hundreds of balloons, which spelled out ``LA
2000'' and exploded on cue to let them pass, then sat down to a
breakfast of golden raspberries and other fresh fruits, smoked
scallops and salmon and wild mushroom hash with poached egg. Broad
stood up to welcome a performer, who was slowly lowered, feathery
angel wings and all, from the rafters of the glass-domed center,
bearing the city's official bid to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the committee had dinner on a converted sound
stage at Universal Studios. Tuesday afternoon, it toured the new
Getty Center and prepared for a dinner at Mayor Richard Riordan's
home before heading off to dance at the Conga Room, a new Latin
music nightclub partly owned by the actor Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city that has been the master of self-promotion since
colorful orange crate labels lured frozen Midwesterners here at the
turn of the century, the overall effect was oddly low key, low tech
and homey. The organizers missed no chance to emphasize the city's
racial and ethnic diversity, as a string of union workers from
various trades stepped up to make brief speeches beginning, ``I
want the 2000 Democratic National Convention because ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know what the outreach is in a city to minority
business, we want to know what the labor situation is,'' said
Rosalind Wyman, a Los Angeles native and the doyenne of California
Democratic politics, who is a member of the site-selection
committee and confesses a preference for her hometown. ``We care
about having an environmentally sensitive city, and whether there's
access for the disabled and whether the host committee is
broad-based. Obviously, I think we would put on an incredible
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are said to be leaning to cities in old-line
swing states like Chicago and Philadelphia, and at least some
Democratic officials have worried that the risk of coming to Los
Angeles is that liberal celebrities might overshadow the
proceedings. Then again, since no one expects conventions to decide
anything of importance in an age of primary elections, why not come
to the home of show business in hopes of at least producing
interesting television?
</P>
<P>
   ``The good reason to come here would be if you wanted to try and
re-invent the convention,'' Ms. Estrich said. ``That would be the
exciting challenge. Because the truth is, if they do it the old
way, no one will watch anyway.''

REGULATORS, INVESTORS CAUTIOUS ON BELL   ATLANTIC-GTE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. says its $52.07 billion buyout of GTE Corp.
will create a hot player in the telecommunications market, but the
deal got a cool reception Tuesday on Wall Street and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if completed, would create the nation's largest
telephone company, with over 250,000 employees in 40 states and $53
billion in revenue _ more than AT&AMP;T's 1997 revenue of $51.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the takeover announced, however, than some critics
questioned whether it would benefit consumers under the a two-year
old federal law intended to spur competition in the
telecommunicaitons industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger makes sense for the companies involved, but the
benefits to the marketplace are less clear,'' said Jeffrey Kagan,
an Atlanta telecommunications analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators, whose approval will be needed for the deal
to happen, remained noncommittal while investors dumped shares of
both GTE and Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the parties will demonstrate how this merger advances
the pro-competitive thrust of the Telecommunications Act,'' William
E. Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's stock fell 11/16 to close at 44 5/16. Shares of
GTE, of Stamford, Conn., fell 2 11/16 to 53 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the merger announcement, five GTE shareholders
filed separate civil suits in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan claiming they should receive more for their shares. Bell
Atlantic headquartersa are in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Bell Atlantic will exchange 1.22 shares for
each share of GTE. Based on Bell Atlantic's closing price, that
works out to $54.06 a share for GTE, or a total of $52.07 billion.
Bell Atlantic will also assume $14.1 billion in GTE debt.
</P>
<P>
   Executives defended the deal at a news conference in New York.
Pairing GTE, the nation's largest independent phone company with
Bell Atlantic, which dominates the local telephone market between
Maine and Virginia, is ``a merger of equals in every way,'' said
Raymond W. Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The merged companies _ which will get a new corporate name _
will be run by Bell Atlantic president Ivan Seidenberg, who will be
president and co-chief executive with Charles R. Lee, GTE's
chairman, who will remain chairman and co-chief executive. He will
become sole CEO in three years and succeed Lee as chairman in
mid-2004. Smith will retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal faces close scrutiny in many circles, starting with
investors, concerned about the finanical terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``GTE has never been for sale, '' said Lee, adding that the
terms are ``appropriate,'' and that shareholders will see
significant value in the combination in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with him. Some institutional shareholders
maintain the deal for GTE is too low and does not include the kind
of a price premium found in other megamergers. Several Wall Street
analysts questioned whether the merger terms would change if GTE's
stock price drops.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and GTE management ``will have an uphill battle
convincing GTE shareholders that there are enough strategic and
operational positives to the deal,'' said Scott Wright,
telecommunications analyst at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he doubted another company would offer a
significantly higher price, but noted that Bell Atlantic could
modify the financial terms of agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, which company officials said will
take 12 to 18 months to complete, has also raised questions over
whether the mammoth company will bring long distance competition to
the marketplace. With GTE, a small but but growing provider of long
distance services spread out in the 28 states, a major goal is to
reach the lucrative 13-state Northest region and the District of
Columbia that Bell Atlantic services, where 30 percent of all long
distance calls are made.
</P>
<P>
   But under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Bell Atlantic must
first open up its local telephone markets, known as the local loop,
to competitors in the Northeast. It hopes to fulfill the
requirements in New York by year end with Massachusetts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bell Atlantic does not have any state approvals, the
federal regulators including the Department of Justice should
withhold their approval of the merger, said Congressman Edward J.
Markey, (D-Mass). the ranking Democrat on the House
Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection subcommittee.
``This merger should not happen until all local loops are in Bell
Atlantic's region are open,'' said Markey. ``That should give
tremendous an incentive to other regions to get their regional
phone companies to open their markets. It would be a big mistake if
the Justice Department approved this kind of merger absent
conclusive evidence that these local loops were irrevocably open.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement was the fourth in a series of
consolidations through mergers and acquistions in the
telecommunications industry this year. All have the stated goal of
offering customers a combination of services, including local and
long distance, high-speed Internet access and wireless
communicaitons.

<P>
   STURGEON BAY, Wis. _ From the second inning on, the father
coaching at first base for the Lions Club was on the umpire's case
for refusing to call a balk on the opposing pitcher. A balk, any of
an assortment of illegal movements by the pitcher, is not often
called on 11-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call it if you don't see it,'' the umpire, Clayton
J. Haen, explained in an interview. ``Besides, this is Little
League!''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night at Sturgeon Bay Little League, Haen had
four stitches, and the first-base coach, Thomas N. Torstenson, was
in handcuffs. Torstenson, a 46-year-old carpenter, was charged with
punching out Haen, 60. If convicted of substantial battery, a
felony, he could serve up to two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Little League rage. Adult misbehavior is becoming a
familiar blight on children's games in all sports, say league
officials, coaches and parents. Fathers yell at coaches. Mothers
belittle players. And umpires are attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Game officials have long taken verbal abuse, of course. But now
they are shoved and spat on, even stabbed and shot. While no
official records are kept, assaults on umpires are reported two or
three times a week to the National Association of Sports Officials,
which represents game officials ranging from youth leagues to
professional sports. The association, perceiving a relentless
increase in these attacks, will soon announce a new benefit for its
19,000 members: assault insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although cases of violence against game officials have been
logged in every sport and at every level, the association says the
most dangerous place to call a strike or a foul is anywhere
children play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assaults are so much more common at the Little League levels''
than elsewhere, said Barry Mano, president of the association,
based in Racine, Wis. ``Parents and coaches have lost perspective
on what sports is about. It's getting bad enough that we need to
send a message that we're not going to roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wagoner, Okla., last year, a 36-year-old tee-ball coach was
convicted of choking a 15-year-old umpire during a game. In
Riverdale, Ga., a coach shot a father in the arm after the father
had complained that his son was not pitching enough.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, dealing with adult violence has become as much a part of
running a youth league as working the concession stand. In Houston,
leagues use criminal background checks to weed out volunteers for
violence, alcohol abuse, sexual abuse and theft. A league in
suburban Chicago has a zero-tolerance policy against yelling. A few
leagues have quit keeping score, hoping to tamp down competitive
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires, meanwhile, are seeking protection from the law.
Statutes that set high minimum penalties for assaults on them have
been adopted by 12 states, and sports officials here hope that
Wisconsin will soon join the list.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sturgeon Bay, an old shipbuilding town of 9,000 people
tucked along Lake Michigan in Wisconsin's northeastern corner,
baseball is taken seriously, from tee-ball to adult hardball. It
took the town only three days to raise $12,000 for electronic
scoreboards for the Little League.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, the Lions Club team was losing again to the best
team in the league. The Lions Club pitcher was 11-year-old Tyler
Torstenson. His father, Tom, was coaching at first base, carefully
watching the opposing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely balking,'' spectators heard Torstenson say. He
thought the opposing pitcher was not keeping his hind foot on the
pitching rubber as required by Little League Rule 8.05(g).
</P>
<P>
   Behind the plate was Haen, a former dairy farmer and longtime
umpire, paid $15 a game. (``We have difficulty finding umpires
anymore,'' said the manager of the Lions Club squad, Robert J.
Schlicht, a 48-year-old city alderman. ``Fifteen dollars isn't
worth it.'')
</P>
<P>
   After the Lions Club had lost, 9-6, the teams shook hands. But
Torstenson, witnesses say, cursed the umpire in front of the
children, shoved him and followed him into the equipment room. The
coach's wife, Becky Torstenson, a child-support enforcement
officer, tried to get between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be left-handed,'' Haen said, ``because he came around
her shoulder and got me in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   After the police had taken Torstenson away, his wife and son
returned to give Haen a hug. Haen was back umpiring the next night
and was given a standing ovation by the parents and the players.
Torstenson, who has been banned from Little League for life, has
not yet entered a plea and declined to discuss the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Why do adults misbehave at children's games?
</P>
<P>
   Sports psychologists cite several factors, most of them
connected with an overemphasis on winning. Some parents believe
that competition helps prepare children to succeed. Others fear
that their children will not be able to handle failure. Many suffer
from what sports psychologists call ``achievement by proxy.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help, umpires say, if leagues improved their selection,
training and certification of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Sturgeon Bay Little League does not require background
checks for adult volunteers. So the league did not know that, in
1986, Torstenson had been convicted of ``endangering the safety of
another.'' Court records show that by the account of witnesses, he
barely missed hitting his pregnant former wife with his pickup
after a child-support hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Checks are not necessary,'' said Wisconsin's Little League
chairman, Harlan K. Balkansky, a steel executive. ``You know what's
going on with your neighbors. No matter what safeguards you put in,
something like this can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlicht, the Lions Club manager and alderman, had vouched for
Torstenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely good with kids,'' Schlicht said. ``He's a good
coach. He's been a plate umpire himself. But he still believes the
pitcher was balking.''

WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN JR., LONGTIME FED CHAIRMAN, DIES AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (rl) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William McChesney Martin Jr., the chairman of the Federal
Reserve for 19 years spanning five administrations, from that of
Harry S. Truman to Richard Nixon, died on Monday at his home in
Washington. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a plain-spoken Democrat from Missouri, detested
inflation. He once said that the role of the Federal Reserve was
``to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was criticized alternately for making credit too
easy and too tight, Martin was known as an honest, responsible man
who often stood up against the political pressures of the executive
and legislative branches. And he retained the confidence of five
presidents, even when he opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   Martin set the course of the nation's monetary policy during an
economic golden age. His tenure included the nation's longest
economic expansion, from 1961 to 1969. That growth period ended
when the central bank was forced to begin raising interest rates to
fight the rising inflation that was caused by government spending
during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most controversial moves, in December 1965, Martin
voted to raise the discount rate _ the rate at which commercial
banks borrow from the Fed _ despite President Lyndon Johnson's
objections. After the vote, he was summoned to Johnson's ranch. He
soon emerged to say that the meeting had changed neither man's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Martin often verbally battled with his most bitter critic, Rep.
Wright Patman, a Democrat from Texas, for whom interest rates could
never be low enough. But he largely avoided public squabbles and
had a knack for stating his gloomy predictions in a pleasant way.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of one economic slump, Martin warned Congress that
you can't ``spend yourself prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, he remarked, ``A perpetual deficit is the road to
undermining any currency.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, the current
chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that Martin had set a
``masterful example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crucially, Chairman Martin moved the Federal Reserve from
being an adjunct of the Treasury Department to the independent
status we know today,'' Greenspan's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In private, Martin was known as a relaxed, friendly man who had
an engaging, boyish grin. He was an avid tennis player who often
played on a court across the street from the headquarters of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a prominent banker in St. Louis, had helped
President Woodrow Wilson draft the Federal Reserve Act, which
created the central bank in 1913. Later, his father served as
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Martin
followed, working in his younger years as an examiner at that same
bank.
</P>
<P>
   After a move to New York, Martin, at age 31, became the first
paid president of the New York Stock Exchange, a position that
earned him the nickname of ``boy wonder of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, he left his $48,000-a-year job at the exchange to serve
in World War II, where he began earning a salary of $21 a month. He
rose to the rank of colonel, serving in several key wartime
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Martin became chairman of the Export-Import Bank
and then served as assistant secretary of the Treasury under
President Truman, a fellow Missourian.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's 19-year chairmanship of the Fed under both Democratic
and Republican presidents was longer than the term of any other
chairman so far.
</P>
<P>
   When President Truman interviewed him about taking the
chairmanship, Truman recalled that he had bought some Liberty Bonds
in the First World War that had later declined in value. ``You
wouldn't ever let that happen again, would you?'' the president
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Martin replied that he wouldn't want it to happen, but unless
the Administration followed responsible fiscal and monetary
policies, it probably would happen again.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy had told Martin in 1961 that most of the
Kennedy advisers wanted a new Fed chairman and questioned him
closely about whether he intended to ``flaunt'' the independence of
the Fed. In the end, Kennedy asked him to stay on and explained
that he did so because ``responsible men'' were not easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   A similar conversation occurred early in President Johnson's
administration, with the President telling Martin that he wanted
low interest rates all the time. The chairman replied that he would
have to get another man to achieve that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin stepped down from the central bank in January 1970. He
then served on the board of directors for many corporations and
nonprofit organizations, including IBM, American Express and the
National Geographic Society. For many years, he worked as a lawyer
for Riggs National Bank in Washington. He also served as president
of the National Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Cynthia Davis Martin, and their
three children, Diana Martin of Washington, Cynthia Martin Ghenea
of Portland, Maine, and William McChesney Martin III of Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1985, Martin said
there was much double-talk in most discussions about monetary
policy, which ranks as one of Washington's most arcane subjects.
</P>
<P>
   When he took office, Martin said, he had told himself: ``My
gracious, here I am the new chairman of the Fed and I'm doing my
best _ I'm not the brightest fellow in the world, but I'm working
hard on this _ and I haven't the faintest idea of how you figure
the money supply. Yet everybody thinks I have it at my fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't really know what the money supply is now, even
today,'' Martin continued. ``They print some figures _ I'm not
trying to make fun of it _ but a lot of it is just almost
superstition.''  &QL;

LEWINSKY'S IMMUNITY BROADER THAN THAT OF WATERGATE FIGURES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not all immunity is equal.
</P>
<P>
   Having been granted what lawyers call transactional immunity,
Monica Lewinsky is off the hook as long as she tells the truth.
</P>
<P>
   With transactional immunity, which prosecutors give only when
they want someone's testimony very badly, she cannot be prosecuted
for the wrongdoing she testifies about. To put it another way, not
only is she safe from being incriminated by her own words, but from
the words of others.
</P>
<P>
   That last point is crucial in understanding the difference
between transactional immunity and the more common use immunity.
</P>
<P>
   When granted use immunity, a witness may not be incriminated by
his or her own testimony, nor are prosecutors supposed to use that
testimony to gather other evidence against the witness.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors can and do use other avenues to gather evidence
against witnesses who have use immunity. A quarter-century ago,
more than two dozen witnesses were granted use immunity so they
would testify before a Senate committee investigating the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most important witnesses, John Dean, President
Richard Nixon's White House counsel, and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
deputy director of the Nixon re-election committee, then pleaded
guilty to obstruction of justice. Prosecutors had gathered plenty
of evidence against them before their Senate testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, two important figures in the Iran-Contra scandal,
Lt. Col. Oliver North and Vice Adm. John Poindexter, fared better.
They were granted use immunity for their congressional testimony,
and they were later convicted in court _ on evidence not gleaned
from that congressional testimony, the prosecution maintained.
</P>
<P>
   But an appeals court threw out the convictions, holding that
even though the defendants' congressional testimony had not been
used at trial, it still might have tainted the recollections of
other witnesses who had seen the defendants on television.

LEWINSKY TO TESTIFY FREE OF THREAT OF PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr granted former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky the broadest possible form of
prosecutorial immunity Tuesday, paving the way for Lewinsky to
appear before a federal grand jury as the star witness in the case
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, have reached an agreement
today that for full and truthful testimony, she will receive
transactional immunity in this case,'' said Plato Cacheris, one of
her three lawyers. Flanked by attorneys Jacob Stein and Nathaniel
Speights, Cacheris then walked away from the horde of reporters and
cameramen in silence.
</P>
<P>
   That one sentence, spoken in a soft tone, roared through the
corridors of power here Tuesday with a force unseen since the first
days of the Lewinsky investigation in January.
</P>
<P>
   The grant of immunity virtually assures Starr that Lewinsky will
testify, as she reportedly offered in January, that she engaged in
a sexual relationship with Clinton in 1996 and 1997 _ in direct
contradiction to the president's sworn deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal sources have also hinted that Lewinsky will provide
incriminating information beyond the nature of her relationship
with Clinton but short of explicitly saying that the president
pressured her to lie. Other legal analysts speculated that the
breadth and depth of the immunity offered by Starr indicates that
Lewinsky may be prepared to testify to instances in which Clinton
attempted to obstruct justice in the Jones suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, received the same grant of
immunity Tuesday in her own deal with Starr, according to her
lawyer, Billy Martin. Lewis had testified before the grand jury on
Feb. 10 and 11 before leaving the courthouse in an apparent
emotional state. She has not returned since.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyers, realizing some of the worst fears of the
White House in the six-month investigation, stood on the mobbed
sidewalk outside their downtown office building Tuesday afternoon
to announce the long-awaited deal. Clinton aides immediately
reacted with an outer calm that belied what some officials
privately described as inner frustration throughout the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was called and informed of the deal Tuesday morning by
his personal attorney, David Kendall. Asked about the president's
reaction, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, ``I think
that he's pleased that things are working out for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Told by a reporter that Clinton's reaction indicated sympathy
for Lewinsky, McCurry added, ``He is a human being. I don't think
that would be a surprise to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With the so-called transactional immunity, Lewinsky can no
longer be prosecuted for any matters in the case in which she
supplies testimony. The grant is more far-reaching than the more
common form of judicial or use immunity, in which witnesses cannot
be prosecuted based on their own testimony, but are still subject
to prosecution using outside evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transactional immunity means they agree not to prosecute you
for whatever transactions are covered by your testimony,'' said
Robert Luskin, a prominent Washington defense attorney. ``It is a
promise for non-prosecution. They are saying under no circumstances
will we prosecute you, whereas with judicial immunity they are
saying they won't use what you say to prosecute you.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck Tuesday morning, just a day after Lewinsky
met with prosecutors from Starr's office in a five hour, covert
meeting in New York City to discuss the details of her possible
testimony should she be granted immunity. It serves as the single
most dramatic develepment in the case that has plagued the Clinton
adminstration since the third week of January.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, White House aides have repeatedly dismissed questions
about the Lewinsky probe by saying that both Clinton and Lewinsky,
in respective sworn statements, have denied any sexual
relationship. Lewinsky was captured on secret tape recordings
bragging to colleague Linda Tripp of a lengthy sexual affair with
Clinton, one in which, she said, they met regularly in the Oval
Office and often exchanged telephone calls and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters said that if Lewinsky only testifies to a
sexual relationship with the president, the simple perjury
allegation stemming from the dismissed Paula Jones suit will not
ignite any outrage among the congressional Republicans who would
ultimately decide his fate _ a sentiment echoed for weeks on
Capitol Hill. Still, there appeared to be a new strain of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's serious she is preparing to testify in contradiction to
her previous testimony and in contradiction to the president,''
said Lanny Davis, Clinton's former spokesman on legal issues. ``But
I don't believe this story affects the outcome if that's all she's
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is the status of negotations between Kendall &UR;  &LR; and
Starr over the subpoena that was issued to Clinton two weeks ago.
The two continued to negotiate over such issues as whether Clinton
would be able to testify on videotape, from the White House, in the
presence of an attorney. Normally, grand jury testimony is given at
the US District Court with no attorney present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will testify,'' one Clinton ally said Tuesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He doesn't have any choice.
People are about to get angry at him because he is allowing this
thing to continue and is distracted from the business of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jones deposition, Clinton said in what was reported to be
a voice so quiet and halting that his own lawyer asked him to speak
up, ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've
never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, in an East Room appearance in January, Clinton said
more emphatically, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman _ Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   There were widespread indications from White House officials
that Clinton may try to hold off on testifying until September,
after he returns from an overseas trip to Ireland and Russia that
is expected to be triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, analysts said, Starr may not dare to file a
report to the Congress on the allegations with only two months
remaining until the November midterm elections. Many senior
Republicans have privately indicated to Starr that if he cannot
send them a report by August 1, to wait until after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that Clinton would prefer to
testify after Lewinsky, rather than before, though that point
seemed to be growing moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has no advantage in time,'' said Jonathan
Turley, a George Washington University law professor who has filed
court briefs in support of Starr. ``If he testifies before Monica
Lewinsky, he may be called back to respond to inconsistencies
afterwards. The benefit of timing this testimony will be marginal
at best.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry declined to speculate on the timing of Clinton's
testimony, but said, ``I think he's eager to see it resolved, and I
think that, as you know, we're reager to see that Mr. Starr and Mr.
Kendall make whatever conclusion of their discussions they make.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Clinton's schedule, McCurry added, ``He's going to be a
busy guy. He's the president.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In simple, touching ceremonies beneath the grand
dome of the U.S. Capitol, President Clinton, lawmakers, police and
the public paid tribute Tuesday to the two officers killed last
week during a bloody shootout in the halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after the formal eulogies, thousands of mourners
filed solemnly past the flag-draped coffins of Detective John
Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut resting side-by-side at the
center of majestic Capitol Rotunda. A four-man police honor guard
stood watch over their fallen partners.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers and tourists from across the nation mingled with
politicians and Capitol Hill staff in a common show of grief and
respect. Many stood for hours in a line that began forming before
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, calling Gibson and Chestnut ``quiet men of
uncommon bravery,'' said it was fitting that the two be recognized
with a special service in the Rotunda, where 27 other Americans
have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we mourn their loss and we celebrate their lives. Our
words are such poor replacements for the joys of family and
friends, the turning of seasons, the rhythms of normal life that
should rightfully be theirs,'' Clinton said to the Gibson and
Chestnut families who sat to his right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved justice. They did mercy. Now and forever, they walk
humbly with their God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 42, and Chestnut, 58, will be buried later this week at
Arlington National Cemetery. They were the first police officers to
lie in honor in the Rotunda, and Chestnut was the first black man
to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, only presidents, members of Congress, military
commanders and unknown soldiers from the major conflicts in this
century had been given such a service in the great hall separating
the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the police force charged with protecting
the Capitol community, Chief Gary L. Abrecht praised the two
officers for ``selflessly'' sacrificing their lives ``so that
others might live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have asked any more of them. They would not have
given any less for us,'' he said, as some police officers in the
packed hall wiped tears from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While what we say here will soon be forgotten, the memory of
the heroic actions of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John
Gibson will become as timeless as the building in which they
died,'' Abrecht added.
</P>
<P>
   Before they spoke, Clinton and Abrecht joined Senate and House
leaders in placing large wreaths next to the caskets, which rested
beneath the huge Capitol dome. As they moved the flowers into
place, the mid-afternoon sun streamed through the windows overhead,
bathing the Gibson and Chestnut families for a few minutes in a
brilliant light.
</P>
<P>
   The sun also glinted off the black-taped badges of hundreds of
Capitol police officers, who squeezed into the Rotunda beside
members of the Senate and House, and Cabinet officials, including
Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
Vice President Al Gore, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
also attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   Before the eulogies, Senate and House members also participated
in a private viewing of the caskets. They stood in silence six and
eight deep around a roped perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the side, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, formed a receiving line as lawmakers filed out of
the grand hall and into nearby rooms to offer condolences to the
Gibson and Chestnut families. Many paused to hug DeLay, his wife,
Christine, and daughter Danielle Ferro.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, assigned to the Capitol's protective detail, had been
DeLay's personal bodyguard. He was posted inside a doorway to
DeLay's suite of offices when the suspect in the shooting, Russell
Weston Jr., burst through after allegedly shooting Chestnut with a
.38-caliber pistol. Gibson is credited with bringing Weston down
with three shots as he took fire himself at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 41, has been charged with one count of murdering a
federal police officer and could get the death penalty. More
charges are expected to be filed against him. The suspect, who has
a history of mental illness, underwent another round of surgery
Tuesday at a local hospital. He was still listed in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut and Gibson were the first members of the Capitol Police
force to die while on duty protecting lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   As they filed solemnly passed the caskets, some tourists bowed
their heads in silent prayer. Police officers saluted, and some
members of Congress placed their hands over blue ribbons worn over
their hearts in memory of the slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that it was
``only right'' that the two officers be honored under the Capitol
dome where so many ``heroes of our history'' have been eulogized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two men have proven that they are the very best of us
because they have paid the ultimate sacrifice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House, for the second day, remained in recess as a tribute
to Gibson and Chestnut. And though the Senate continued to debate
various bills, members still took time to praise the two officers
for their sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., also raised the possibility of shifting
$14 million in already-appropriated funds to the Capitol
architect's office to be used in beefing up security. He said it
could include construction of an underground visitors center, which
would be used to control access to the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Rules Committee also said it may consider a
resolution this week naming the ground-floor entrance near where
the shootings occurred after the two slain police officers.

NHL REFEREE STEWART RECOVERING FROM CANCER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Colorful National Hockey League referee Paul Stewart, a native
of Boston, is recovering from colon cancer surgery. Stewart
underwent an operation last month at New England Baptist Hospital
and is receiving chemotherapy halfway through 12 weeks of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expect Stewart, 43, to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year has been a roller-coaster ride,'' said Stewart,
who in the past 12 months has gotten married, become the father of
a son, and is building a house. ``In the last year, I've had the
biggest thrill of my life and the biggest shock of my life. (Being
diagnosed with cancer) was a shock. It was worse than a Terry
O'Reilly punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who is very active in the local community, has been an
NHL referee since March 27, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very optimistic,'' he said. ``The doctors tell me I
am cancer-free and that I am responding well to the chemo. I have a
5-month-old and I intend to be around for his education. And I
think I still have a lot of games left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken with Paul and he is very upbeat,'' Bryan Lewis,
the NHL's director of officiating, said in a statement. ``His
recovery is our first concern. The thoughts of all the NHL referees
and linesmen are with Paul and his family and we wish him well.''

IMMUNITY DEAL SHIFTS GRAND JURY FOCUS TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER   AND ANNE SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``transactional immunity'' that independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr granted to Monica S. Lewinsky Tuesday is
the broadest form of immunity _ a cloak against prosecution for her
and a signal she is almost certain to contradict President Clinton
about whether they had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Lewinsky's lawyers have insisted she be granted
full immunity rather than the more common judicial or use immunity.
Under this partial immunity, the former White House intern could
not be prosecuted for what she tells the grand jury, but could face
charges based on evidence collected independently of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As long as she tells the truth to the grand jury, Lewinsky can
now say anything about any aspect of the investigation without
having to worry about whether Starr will use her own words against
her, or pursue any leads or testimony from others that might
incriminate her. She is also free from prosecution based on
statements she has already made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she's going to testify, the president has to be
worried that if he did something wrong, something criminal, to
suborn perjury or obstruct the investigation, it's going to come
out,'' said Dennis Kelly, a former federal prosecutor in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Former prosecutors and legal scholars Tuesday said the full
immunity agreement for Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis, had
the effect of shifting the focus of the grand jury from Lewinsky to
Clinton. Until Tuesday, Lewinsky was vulnerable to indictment for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that the president's testimony is urgently
being sought under subpoena for one purpose and one purpose only:
the criminal prosecution or impeachment of the president,''
observed Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor.
``Before the deal was struck, it could have been argued that the
president was being forced to testify because Lewinsky was being
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is also likely to put pressure on Starr to prove
he has a case that adds up to more than lying about a possible
sexual relationship as he nears the finish line of his six-month
investigation, current and former prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   If all Starr can come up with is an admission from Lewinsky that
she and Clinton had an affair, it would represent nothing more than
a ``tempest in a teapot,'' according to Peri Arnold, a professor of
presidential history at the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she agrees that she had consensual sex with the president,
but that he never did anything to coerce her to change her story or
obstruct justice, there's no case, no federal crime,'' said Kelly,
who pointed out that a perjury case against Clinton would stem from
his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, which
has since been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the furious reaction to these developments in the
capital Tuesday was a small advantage for the president: He no
longer faces the possibility of being called as a witness in a
public trial against Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much better off if she is immunized, because the worse
case would have been him having to be a witness in a trial against
her,'' said Stephen A. Saltzburg, a professor at George Washington
law school and former associate independent counsel for the
Iran-Contra investigation.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Douglass, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor and now
assistant professor of law at the University of Richmond, also
pointed out that Clinton could use the full immunity for Lewinsky
and her mother as a defense and argue that the deal gave her ``a
strong incentive to shape the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's credibility has already been called into question. In
a sworn statement in the Jones lawsuit, Lewinsky said she did not
have a sexual relationship with the president. And in tape-recorded
conversations with Linda R. Tripp, her former friend, Lewinsky said
she grew up with ``lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Granting Lewinsky full immunity also raises the stakes for
Clinton. Starr's office is now negotiating with Clinton's lawyer,
David E. Kendall, over whether and when the president will have to
testify for the grand jury. Legal scholars say Clinton could bow
out by exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats have already made it clear that they will not
support the president if he refuses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delayed this right up to the '98 elections,'' said Joseph
DiGenova, a former independent counsel. ``Delay is a great thing
when you are the target of a criminal investigation, but not such a
hot thing when you are out there as a Democrat trying to win the
House back.''

 WASHINGTON: this nation.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The service was a rare tribute for men unknown beyond their own
communities before Friday. One speaker, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said they ``should rightly be recognized in
this hall of heroes.'' He called them ``two men who did their job,
who stood the ground and defended freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   After entering the cool rotunda, some of the visitors crossed
themselves or prayed silently; others turned to face the coffins
and salute. Some held hands, others babies. A young boy in baggy
shorts and T-shirt carried his blue Yankees cap in his hands. A
blind man walked with his eyes straight ahead, his white cane
tapping at the stones, his left hand on a friend's shoulder. One
woman in a taupe suit, tortoise-shell sunglasses resting in her
hair, wept silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got inside, I just wanted to be quiet and think,'' said
Doug Smyth, an eighth-grader who came to the Capitol with a group
from a school in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Staigers of Dayton, Ohio, in Washington on vacation,
brought her two grandchildren. ``We decided we'd come here today so
that our grandchildren could see and understand the immense support
for our nation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they had come not just to pay respects but to make a
symbolic point. Rene Bitoun, a teacher in a Montessori school in
Washington, said she wanted to demonstrate that ``terrorism can't
restrain the will of the people to have an open and free society.''
As she spoke, she stood at the back of a line that stretched about
a quarter-mile east from the Capitol steps and south down First
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the line, visitors signed their names in books
for the bereaved families, jotting notes like ``God bless'' or
``You showed me what is courage.'' On the Capitol steps, flowers
that began piling up over the weekend had become a hill of wreaths,
teddy bears, candles and crayon drawings. ``Heroes Forever,'' read
one hand-lettered sign among the flora.
</P>
<P>
   Their badges crossed with black bands, police officers who lined
up came not only from Washington but also from Wilmington, Del.,
Roxbury, N.J., and New York City. There were military police
officers, patrol officers, Secret Service officers and bicycle
officers, some with their helmets strapped to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to show my respect for the brotherhood, one police
officer for another,'' said Leo Flibotte of the Hampton, Va.,
police. ``We're in the same church, different pews.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officers said they were pleased by the public turnout,
although some wondered if the concern would be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel reassured that so many people came out to show their
support,'' said Mike Grossman, an officer from Los Angeles County.
``A lot of people support what we do, but no one talks about it.
Unfortunately I think interest will subside.'
</P>
<P>
   At noon, the line was held up as congressmen poured into the
chamber to stand silently for five minutes, almost as still as the
honor guard of four Capitol Police officers around the caskets.
</P>
<P>
   The senators left quickly, but the representatives lingered as
an impromptu receiving line formed. Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority
whip whom Gibson was assigned to guard when he was killed, stood
with Gingrich, shaking hands and hugging dozens of congressmen as
they filed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressmen said they hoped that the day of shared sorrow
would blunt Washington's partisan edge. In remarks Tuesday
afternoon on the House floor, Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said that he
hoped the city's politicians would now learn ``to love each other
and to be more civil.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans regularly hugged on another Tuesday.
As Vice President Al Gore stood during Tuesday afternoon's memorial
service, he clasped the hand of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. There
was no public talk about the Lewinsky investigation, or about the
partisan stalemate that is making this one of the least productive
legislative years in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   At the service, each speaker said that the men's deaths had
reminded the country of higher ideals. Gingrich said they had
underscored that ``while this is the center of freedom in the
world, and this building is the centerpiece of freedom in our
constitutional system, it only lasts as long as there is courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Abrecht, the chief of the Capitol police, said, ``the
heroic actions of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson
will become as timeless as the building in which they died.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Officer Eric Boggs missed the service because he was
guarding DeLay's office door, which was draped in black. Chestnut
was not only his colleague but also his neighbor, and Boggs said
that the man he called J.J. was ``one of the finest men that I've
known.'' He said that he would have a chance later to go up and
view the coffins quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'd rather do anyway,'' he said. ``I'd rather go
up myself.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Reeves waives lineman Davis
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ The Atlanta Falcons waived defensive lineman
Nathan Davis on Tuesday after he tried to make a return to
football.
</P>
<P>
   Davis showed up at camp at 8 a.m., but was told by coach Dan
Reeves that he would be cut. The 6-foot-5, 326-pound Davis, a
second-round pick in 1997, apparently walked into the locker room
and was asked by equipment manager Brian Boigner to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who could not be reached for comment, quit Friday, on the
second day of training camp, after telling Reeves, ``My heart
wasn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons put Davis on the ``reserve/left squad'' list, which
means he had five days to return or not be eligible to play this
fall. Had he not returned, he would have owed the Falcons
two-thirds of the $662,000 signing bonus that was included in his
three-year, $1.74 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Teams rarely pursue the return of signing bonuses in such
situations, but Reeves said he thinks that it was Davis' motivation
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt like he made a hasty decision,'' Reeves said.
``In my opinion, it wasn't because he wanted to play football. I
think it was strictly ... knowing he had an obligation to live up
to when he signed the contract, and, if he didn't (live up to
them), basically he had to give the money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis will be on waivers for 24 hours. If no other team claims
him, he will count $245,700 against the Falcons' salary cap this
year _ the $220,700 pro-rated portion of his signing bonus, plus a
$25,000 offseason workout bonus he earned. The final $220,700 will
count next year. If he is claimed, all of his remaining signing
bonus and the workout bonus _ a total of $466,400 _ will count
against this year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' agent, Nate Lampley, said Davis made one mistake after
another, including rejecting the Falcons' request last winter to
attend the weight-loss clinic at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have the talent to play at a high level in the NFL? Of
course,'' Lampley said. ``There's a lot of guys out there with
`potential' on their tombstones.''

 &HT;    Boxer aims for the fearless
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ebo Elder used to hear the roar of an engine when he
was a top young supercross rider. Now the 139-pound boxer hears
only the roar of a crowd, but his detour onto dirt tracks helps him
get his motor running in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to not fear anything to race motorcycles
competitively,'' said Elder, 19, of Newnan, Ga. ``If you can fly
through the air 60 mph on a dirtbike, you can go against another
human competitor easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The light welterweight was scheduled to meet Canada's Michael
Strange in a Goodwill Games quarterfinal bout late Tuesday night at
the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Elder started racing motorcycles when he was 10, attained a No.
5 ranking in supercross, and quit when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has always been a serious thing; motocross was more of
a fun thing for a young guy to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also more dangerous, which contributed to his decision to
leave the sport.
</P>
<P>
   He retired uninjured, but with a new name. His given name is
Eben, which announcers couldn't say right.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad just came up with Ebo spur of the moment around when Bo
Jackson was so big,'' Elder said. ``It's kind of catchy; people
remember it once they get it in their head.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Elder also gave his son a love for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had this dream of being the best boxer in the world since
I was 3 years old,'' said Elder, who trains at Biggs Morrison
Boxing in Atlanta. ``My dad, before I was born, prayed to have a
son he could teach boxing to and take what he had done further.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, who is still his coach, won the Southeastern
Championships. ``He was the toughest guy in town,'' Elder said of
his father. Elder fights left-handed, but plays ping-pong and bowls
with his right. Being quasi-ambidextrous, Elder said, helps because
his jabs and hooks are more powerful. While he trains for Sydney,
he's working full-time for his father's construction company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a tough road is better than having it easy,'' Elder
said. ``Working a 9- or 10-hour day, going to the gym, getting home
late and getting up early _ if you can do that, you can win a
five-round fight any day.

 &HT;    Cleveland franchise may cost $1 billion
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The NFL on Tuesday all but assured a record price tag
for a professional sports franchise in fine-tuning the process for
selecting the owner of the resurrected Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners said the franchise fee might approach $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the math,'' Dallas owner Jerry Jones said. ``With the
kind of revenues that team is going to generate, I'm not ruling
anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego owner Alex Spanos said: ``I still think ($1 billion)
is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced after the four-hour
meeting that candidates will make presentations at a league meeting
Aug. 19. ``We will focus on quality and character and planning at
that meeting,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Six groups have announced their intentions to seek the team _
Larry and Charles Dolman, Richard Jacobs, Bart Wolstein, Howard
Milstein, Al Lerner and Thomas Murdough. The commissioner also said
that some interested parties prefer to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Grubman, a managing director for Goldman Sachs, the
investment-brokerage group handling the bid, said his firm is
recruiting potential owners.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the bid process were not divulged, but Tagliabue said
it will be ``in phases.'' The list of candidates will be narrowed
in August, and Tagliabue said the league is on schedule to select
an owner in September.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing red
</P>
<P>
   Red McCombs, a billionaire businessman from San Antonio, was
unanimously approved here Tuesday as the new owner of the Minnesota
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his promises to keep the team in place, the outspoken
McCombs did not rule out the possibility that the franchise might
someday relocate if it is not supported to his satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Following a quick vote, McCombs met the media and stressed
several times the need to sell out the Metrodome regularly.
``That's the only way you get the home-court advantage,'' said
McCombs, former owner of the NBA's Denver Nuggets and San Antonio
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs has championed San Antonio's efforts to land an NFL
team. Asked if that might factor into his future plans for the
Vikings, he issued a poorly veiled threat to Minnesota fans. ``They
should be concerned about that,'' he said. ``I don't expect that
issue to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocking stuffers
</P>
<P>
   The owners approved a plan for stocking the roster of the new
Browns, and it's similar to the one used for Carolina and
Jacksonville. The club will have the initial selection in the 1999
draft, but unlike the Jaguars and Panthers, the Browns will not
have multiple choices in the first round. The club will be allowed
a total of 28 picks in the 1999 and 2000 drafts, but Cleveland will
forfeit its additional choices the second year if it makes the
playoffs in its inaugural season.

 &HT;    SEC NOTEBOOK: Gamecocks' QB cleared for camp
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ South Carolina quarterback Anthony Wright, just
nine months removed from a potentially career-ending knee injury,
has been cleared to participate in next month's preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a 6-foot-2, 192-pound senior from Vanceboro, N.C., tore
two ligaments in his right knee, as well as the hamstring in the
leg, in the Gamecocks' 22-7 loss at Tennessee Nov. 1. Wright
suffered the injury while being tackled by Vols middle linebacker
Al Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm probably 90 to 95 percent,'' Wright said on the
opening day of the SEC Football Media Days. ``One thing I'm lacking
is strength. I can cut on it and I can run on it, but it's just not
as strong as the other leg.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wright and promising backup Phil Petty have been
ruled off-limits for contact by South Carolina coach Brad Scott. In
fact, Scott says Wright won't be hit until the Gamecocks'
season-opener against Ball State in Columbia Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about his condition at this point,'' Scott said.
``At the time of his injury, I think it was the opinion of the
medical people that he'd never play football again. But I expect
him to be back at 100 percent when camp opens in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright threw for 1,685 yards and 18 touchdowns with only five
interceptions in nine games last season before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mealey Ailing
</P>
<P>
   Departed LSU star Cecil ``The Diesel'' Collins isn't the only
tailback that had Tigers coach Gerry DiNardo on edge this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins was dismissed from the team following his arrest
earlier this month, junior Rondell Mealey, second on the team last
season with 664 rushing yards, underwent surgery on his right foot
after spring practice. Mealey had a pin removed from the foot last
week and has started running again. ``Hopefully, he'll be ready for
the first game, Sept. 12 against Arkansas State,'' DiNardo said.
</P>
<P>
   OId Friends
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State running back James Johnson, one of the
league's most underrated players after finishing fourth last season
with 1,069 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, says he believes
Tennessee won't lose much with new quarterback Tee Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson should know. The pair were boyhood friends, living just
five houses apart in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always telling me he wanted to play quarterback,''
Johnson said. ``I told him that he needed to be a running back. I'm
glad he didn't listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   First Commitment
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln County High defensive end Shedrick Wynn became Georgia's
first commitment after picking the Bulldogs over Louisville, South
Carolina, Clemson, Tennessee and Georgia Tech. Wynn, the cousin of
former Bulldogs RB Garrison Hearst, had 76 tackles and 11 sacks for
Lincoln County as a junior.

 &HT;    Nevada dismayed by Tyson's hearing
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The head of Nevada boxing expressed
disappointment in the decision by New Jersey athletic officials to
hold a licensing hearing today for deposed heavyweight Mike Tyson.
Nevada is the state that revoked Tyson's boxing license for at
least one year last July after the former champion twice bit
Evander Holyfield in their title fight in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic
Commission, said he does not want to ``prejudge'' New Jersey
officials until after they reach their decision whether to license
Tyson. But Ratner added, ``I never thought another state would even
go this far (and have a hearing). I thought all states would honor
our disciplinary action.''
</P>
<P>
   The recently passed Professional Boxing Safety Act asks states
to abide by each other's medical suspensions, but the act is not
binding. It also does not refer to suspensions or license
revocations for non-medical reasons, such as Tyson's. ``Legally,
the state of New Jersey is completely in the right (to consider
licensing Tyson),'' Ratner said. ``But whether they're operating
within the spirit of the law is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is expected to regain the license, and he might fight
before the end of the year, pending the resolution of contractual
problems with promoter Don King, whom he is suing for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The boxer will appear with his attorneys and advisers before New
Jersey commissioner Larry Hazzard and three board members. Tyson is
expected to make a statement and answer questions from officials,
who have 45 days to render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokeswoman Rhonda Utley Herring said Tyson's
``character, honesty, integrity and responsibility'' will be
considered. Herring reiterated that New Jersey was not legally
bound by Tyson's situation in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, one of Tyson's new advisers, was quoted last week
as saying he thought Tyson would not regain his license in Nevada.
On Tuesday, Finkel claimed he was misquoted, saying, ``I believe
Nevada would've licensed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Why apply in New Jersey?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed a lot of things,'' Finkel said. ``He's gotten rid
of his promoter and his managers. He wants a new start in a
different state.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has agreed to play himself in the film ``Black and
White,'' the New York Daily News reported. Set in New York, the
script involves white prep school students who have a ``reckless
infatuation with black hip-hop life,'' director James Toback said.

STRONGMAN'S PARTY CLAIMS VICTORY IN CAMBODIAN VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Post-election battle lines began forming
in Cambodia on Tuesday with the dominant party of the incumbent
strongman, Hun Sen, claiming victory and his two opposition rivals
crying fraud and threatening to block the formation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   With only a tiny fraction of the vote count released, the
country appeared to be entering a tense and possibly chaotic period
of protests and maneuvering by all sides, including the two main
opposition candidates, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   International observers, who said they visited about 20 percent
of polling places, declared that the voting on Sunday and the
counting on Monday appeared to have been largely acceptable. But
critics, including some foreign diplomats, charged that the
monitoring was belated and thin and that the count remained open to
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Most projections on Tuesday indicated that Hun Sen had won the
vote, Cambodia's first parliamentary election in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Such a victory would crown a single-minded effort by Hun Sen,
including a coup a year ago that ousted Ranariddh, then his
co-premier, and a later campaign of intimidation in which more than
100 political opponents were killed, according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hun Sen claimed victory, even by his party's own
estimate, he had not won enough votes to take power without forming
a coalition with either the prince or Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   The two opposition leaders, normally political enemies, joined
forces on Tuesday to protest the claim of Hun Sen's party, the
Cambodian People's Party, to have won from 65 to 67 of the 122
seats in Parliament, based on the party's own estimate. The party
projected that the prince's royalist party would win 42 to 45 seats
and that Sam Rainsy's party would win 13 seats, not enough to allow
them to form a coalition of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The party's projection suggested a more powerful victory for Hun
Sen than that of an independent poll-watch group, called the
Committee for Free and Fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   The prince and Sam Rainsy said they would boycott the new
assembly, which would make it impossible for Hun Sen to form a
coalition and reach the two-thirds majority of 81 votes that is
needed to create a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole our vote, and we will disagree with whatever their
result,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``We are going to protest in all legal
and peaceful ways against this unfair election. So we lodge
complaints, we will write petitions, and, why not, organize all
kinds of protest.''
</P>
<P>
   If a government cannot be formed, an official of the ruling
party said on Tuesday that Hun Sen would continue in his current
role as leader. Official preliminary results are not expected until
Saturday and the final official results will only be announced at
the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any declaration of victory is premature,'' said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who is in the Philippines for a regional
conference. ``The only people who deserve congratulations are the
people who voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Solarz, who heads an American observer delegation here,
said the allegations of fraud were premature, and he went so far as
to suggest that the election might become known as ``the miracle on
the Mekong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not have the right to expect that their allegations
will be accepted in the absence of credible evidence indicating
that they are true,'' he told a news conference. ``At the moment we
are not convinced that the concerns they have expressed justify the
conclusions they have reached.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the two opposition leaders complained of
``missing ballots, polling station workers marking ballots for
voters, purposeful miscounting of ballots, threats to observers,
insufficient party agents and observers allowed to watch the
counting, improper moving of ballots at night and unexplained
delays in reporting results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections countered with a
statement saying, ``Problems and irregularities were mainly
isolated and did not represent a prevailing trend.'' The group's
director, Thun Saray, said, ``They can't reject the result just
because they lose. I worry, but perhaps they are just saying this
now and will accept later.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main observer mission, called the Joint International
Observer Group, which is a U.N. umbrella organization that has
coordinated almost 500 monitors here from more than 20 nations,
offered an upbeat assessment early on Tuesday. That judgment was
criticized by a number of diplomats as being premature and
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the impression of the JIOG that what could be observed
by us on polling day and counting day was a process which was free
and fair to an extent that enabled it to reflect in a credible way
the will of the Cambodian people,'' the group said. ``In the end,
efforts to intimidate sections of the Cambodian population appear
not to have significantly influenced the climate of polling day
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this assessment said it discounted the weeks and
months of intimidation that had preceded the vote, the
near-monopoly of the ruling party of radio and television and the
oppressive influence on voters of the ruling party's control of
Cambodia's military, police and government administration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the critics questioned the effectiveness of the
observer process itself. The 500 international observers, working
in teams of two, could visit only a small fraction of the 11,699
voting precincts and could be effective only when they were
actively watching the count, these critics said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the voting and counting procedures generally appeared
to be open and fair and the ballot boxes to be secure and well
guarded, there were also many opportunities for fraud. Visits to a
dozen counting stations on Monday found instances of incorrect
votes being read out and valid votes for opposition parties being
set aside as incorrectly marked. Armed men were observed outside
one polling station in violation of election rules.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot boxes, with multiple locks and seals, were mostly
held overnight from Sunday to Monday in well-guarded, well-lit
municipal buildings. But some international observers interviewed
on Monday said they had not actually spent the night with the
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome to critics was the nationwide vote count that is
now being tabulated at the Phnom Penh headquarters of the National
Election Commission. Like other government agencies, it is
dominated by members of Hun Sen's party.

JUDGE THROWS OUT SUIT AGAINST MCDERMOTT IN TAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With harsh words for both sides, a federal judge
Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit against Rep. Jim McDermott, saying
McDermott's alleged role in leaking an illegally recorded phone
conversation among Republican leaders was protected by the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, who has declined to say what part he played in
providing tapes of the call to newspapers, remains under
investigation by the Justice Department in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan was
particularly critical of McDermott. He said the Seattle Democrat's
alleged actions, although legal, were troubling, and that his
successful legal arguments undermine the nation's anti-wiretapping
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that a United States representative, who had
chosen a position that supposedly illuminated him as a beacon of
ethical behavior, should so eagerly seek to capitalize on the
skullduggery of would-be party operatives to win petty, partisan
victories in the press,'' Hogan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1982 by
President Reagan, was clearly impatient with both sides in the
case, which was brought against McDermott by House Republican
Conference Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case arises out of the unfortunate acrimony, absence of
civility and shortage of honor that pervades the partisan sniping
between some members of Congress and their supporters,'' Hogan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a Dec. 21, 1996, conference call between
Boehner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and other Republican leaders
discussing how to respond to an ethics committee ruling against
Gingrich. Boehner, who was vacationing in Florida at the time,
participated in the conversation from a cellular telephone. The
call was intercepted on a police scanner and taped by a Florida
couple active in Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The couple eventually provided the tape to McDermott, who was
then the ranking Democrat on the House ethics committee. Two days
later a story relying on the tape appeared on the front page of The
New York Times. The newspaper said it had obtained the tape from a
Democrat hostile to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida couple, Alice and John Martin, pleaded guilty to
unlawful interception of Boehner's phone call, and each was fined
$500.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott declined requests for an interview Tuesday, and his
attorneys could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner said he was disappointed, and would consider an filing
an appeal of the legal case or a complaint against McDermott to the
House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Mr. McDermott acted unethically in this case is no longer
in doubt,'' Boehner said. ``We will continue to pursue justice in
this case, and we will insist that Mr. McDermott be held fully
accountable for his reprehensible, cynical and unethical actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Hogan held that McDermott's free speech rights,
protected by the Constitution, outweigh Boehner's right to privacy,
protected by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment prevents the government from punishing the
disclosure of truthful, lawfully obtained information of public
significance,'' Hogan ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is largely blind to motives ... and it
offers protection not only to the noble, but also to the ignoble,''
Hogan wrote. ``Thus, Rep. McDermott's actions are protected under
the Amendment, and the court must grant his motion to dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan noted that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act makes
it illegal to disclose the contents of an illegally tape recorded
telephone call, but not to be the recipient of such a disclosure.
He ruled that once McDermott had legally obtained the tape
recording, his alleged disclosure of the tape was an act of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was clearly uncomfortable with his own conclusions, saying
that the effect of First Amendment protections on cellular
telephone privacy laws are ``illogical,'' and saying that
McDermott's successful legal arguments ``lay siege to the
protections against illicit wiretapping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(McDermott's) theory is a slippery one, as it not only
defends, but even encourages, the circumnavigation of wiretap
statutes, which are designed to prevent the disclosure of private
conversations,'' Hogan wrote. ``Under (McDermott's) theory, the
state has no means to prevent disclosure of private information,
because criminals like the Martins can literally launder illegally
intercepted information.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan went on to say that the sentence imposed on the Martins
was ``almost laughable'' and that because of the ``loophole''
exploited by McDermott ``the effect of the (Electronic
Communications Privacy) statute is diluted into nothingness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan had only minimal sympathy for Boehner's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances of the present case suggest that the
government interest in protecting the privacy of this particular
plaintiff (Boehner), in this particular situation, is diminished,''
Hogan said. ``(Boehner) seeks less to strike a blow for his
personal privacy rights than he does to fire a salvo in the
partisan battle between rival groups in the House of
Representatives.''

   The friend, who dined with Ms. Lewinsky a few days ago and asked
that his name not be disclosed ``because I don't want to be
subpoenaed by Ken Starr,'' added:
</P>
<P>
   ``From knowing her and talking to her, I know she has handled
all this with with a shocking amount of grace and dignity, a lot of
humor _ and a great deal of pain.'' That pain made her stronger, he
said, and more determined to put an end to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears to have shifted her legal stance. After months of
stalemate with Starr, she dismissed her lawyer, William Ginsburg,
whose experience was in malpractice law, not high-stakes political
chess. She retained two criminal defense lawyers well-versed in
Washington's ways and received the services of a skilled publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to Ms. Lewinsky said Tuesday that her new
lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, broke the impasse by
seeing eye-to-eye and talking man-to-man with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also saw resolution for Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's
mother, who suffered a severe anxiety attack when called before the
grand jury to testify about her daughter in February. She also
received immunity Tuesday, presumably in exchange for testimony
about what her daughter told her about her relationship with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is now free from the threat of prison, if she
testifies truthfully about that relationship. Whether she will ever
be free of the experience of being transformed into a hunted animal
and a hot property is another question.
</P>
<P>
   She was betrayed by a confidante, Linda Tripp, who took tapes of
her intimate conversations to Starr. ``The betrayal of Linda Tripp
_ that was devastating,'' the friend of Ms. Lewinsky said. ``To be
betrayed by a friend, that was a tremendous hurt, and a tremendous
lesson. Now, the hardest part is that she has to go on with her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She was stalked by the million-footed beast of the broadcast
media in her beauty salon. She was advised by Ginsburg to pose for
Vanity Fair, and consented, coyly clutching a fan-dancer's plumage
of fuchsia feathers to her breast.
</P>
<P>
   Her e-mail messages and telephone conversations have been
presented in the press as circumstantial evidence that Ms. Lewinsky
had some form of sexual relationship with Clinton, something she
and the president have denied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   She was threatened by prosecutors with spending the best years
of her life in a jail cell unless she testified again, under oath,
about her connection to the president. And she has agonized,
according to members of her family and friends, about spending the
rest of her life as the punchline to an unending off-color joke.
</P>
<P>
   The media have seized the story of her life. Presumably, she
would like her life back. The price is her testimony. ``She is
finally going to tell her story,'' said another family friend.
``She has always wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   As yet another family friend put it: ``She does not want to be a
joke. She does not want to be a punchline. My hope is she can get
on with her life.''

 &HT;    Falcons rookies realizing there's plenty to learn
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons' rookies see bigger and faster players
when they stare across the line in Suwanee this week. They expected
that. What's surprising is how the pro game is so much more mental
and technical.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them, including linebacker Keith Brooking, receiver
Jammi German and right tackle Ephraim Salaam, are learning faster
than the other draft picks and free agents. But even they struggle.
Sometimes badly.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking lined up with the first team during a goal-line defense
drill, and Salaam and Bob Hallen were working in backup roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faster than college,'' said Salaam, a seventh-round draft
choice from San Diego State. He was talking about both team speed
and the learning curve. ``The faster you can assimilate
information, the better off you are,'' the 6-foot-7, 300-pound
Salaam said. ``We put in five or six new plays every night. We
can't go on instinct yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snap counts and other stuff _ that's all running through your
head. The more time you spend studying, the better you'll be. I
study from about 10 to 11:30 (p.m.), after meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys hold 10 times more than in college,'' Brooking said.
``When the refs were here, I was asking, `Is this a hold?' and `Is
that a hold?', and they were pretty much telling me they weren't
going to call it in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are kind of running together. Man, they're throwing a
lot at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons expect their class of nine draft choices and nine
undrafted free agents to contribute. They just don't know how much.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, Brooking and Hallen, who is working at guard and center,
appear to have the inside track on getting playing time. German, a
third-round pick, and punt returner/receiver Tim Dwight, a
fourth-round pick, may also make the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brooking) is working through a lot, but a guy that works that
hard is going to improve,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Jammi is a
natural; he does things you don't teach, as far as making
adjustments and feeling where people are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably put Tim in too many places (receiver, punt
returner, kick returner), but you can see the explosion. He really
uses his hands well, and he's a bigger target than he looks (5-8,
182), because he extends. Ephraim is very smart, has good foot
quickness and recovers extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Each rookie spends extra time on certain things, some off the
field. Salaam eats; coaches want him to add 10-15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   German is learning to get free at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work on shaking off the line, because they play a
lot of press coverage in the NFL,'' he said. ``If you get too
caught up thinking about getting off the line, you forget the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The other draft choices, fourth-round safety Omar Brown,
sixth-round cornerback Elijah Williams, seventh-round running back
Ken Oxendine and seventh-round defensive tackle Henry Slay have
more ground to make up.
</P>
<P>
   A few undrafted college players are making impressions,
including 6-6, 320-pound right tackle Jose Portilla of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose is a big guy that moves a lot better than his size,''
Reeves said. ``But third(-string) guys work mostly against other
third-group guys. A lot will depend on how they look against better
players.

SECURITY FLAW DISCOVERED IN E-MAIL PROGRAMS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A serious security flaw has been discovered in
popular e-mail programs published by Microsoft Corp. and Netscape
Communications Corp. that would permit a malicious person to send a
message containing a virus that could crash a computer, destroy or
even steal data.
</P>
<P>
   So far, security tests have shown that the flaw exists in three
of the four most popular e-mail programs, used by perhaps tens of
millions of people around the world: Microsoft's Outlook Express
and Outlook 98 and Netscape's Web browser, Navigator, which is part
of its Communicator suite of Internet programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft is already providing fixes, the flaw is
particularly worrisome in the Microsoft Outlook 98 program, which
combines e-mail with a schedular, contact list, notes and other
tasks, because this software allows an illicit program attached to
a piece of e-mail to execute without any activity on the part of
the person using the target computer. Most computer viruses can
only infect a machine when the user opens an infected file or
attempts to run an infected program.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Microsoft admitted on Tuesday that the first fix
that was offered on the company's Web site, on Monday, does not
repair the problem. Anyone who downloaded and installed that fix
will have to return to the Web site and download and install the
new version.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported on Tuesday that users of its Outlook Express
program, the e-mail software supplied with Windows 95 and Windows
98, would have to open an infected attachment before a malicious
program could be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape officials said on Tuesday that a user of their
Communicator program would also have to open a file before a virus
could activate. The extra danger of the Outlook 98 program is that
it allows a malicious e-mail attachment to execute at the moment
the e-mail message arrives at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said that the flaw was present in versions
of the Outlook Express shipped with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
or 4.01 on Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
for DEC Alpha, as well as in versions for Macintosh and UNIX
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 3.1 and Windows NT 3.51 versions of Internet Explorer
are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Microsoft said on Tuesday that it had distributed about
2 million copies of the more seriously flawed Outlook 98 program
and at least a million copies of Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape could only report that 70 million copies of its
Navigator/Communicator software had been downloaded, but the
company could not determine how many people used the browser's
built-in e-mail software. Many people use separate, more
sophisticated programs than those that are shipped with browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of these is Eudora, a mail program published by
the Qualcomm Corp. Security researchers said that Eudora was not
vulnerable to the problem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although there is no evidence yet that any computer virus has
been distributed that exploits this newly discovered vulnerability,
security experts say that since word of the flaw leaked on the
Internet over the weekend, virus makers are undoubtedly already
aware of it and will work quickly to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Microsoft was already providing ``patches,''
small programs that repair the flaw in e-mail programs in question
for its Windows and NT operating system. The company said that
fixes for Macintosh and Unix computers would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said that the company's software development
group was attempting to determine how the flawed code made it into
their software.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape officials posted a notice about the problem on their
Web site on Tuesday, noting that the flaw only affects the Windows
and Windows NT versions of Navigator, not those distributed for
Macintosh or UNIX machines. The company said it would post a patch
for its Windows and NT versions within two weeks. Neither company
currently has any plans to notify users of the danger and the
availability of patches other than the notices on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft patches are available at
www.microsoft.com/ie/security. As of Tuesday, none of the virus
detection programs were yet offering protection from _ or even
detection of _ malicious e-mail attachments designed to exploit the
flaw. Officials at Symantec Corp.said that they were now exploring
how they might add new functions to their software to detect this
type of virus, but they said they would not be able to offer any
protection in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate users of electronic mail typically have their e-mail
programs configured to check for mail every 10 minutes or so while
on line and then automatically download any new messages to the
computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said they were astounded that both companies
had distributed software containing a well-known type of
program-design error. The code that resulted in the flaw has been a
widely documented problem for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled that a flaw like this would be in recently
written software, given what we know,'' said Eugene Spafford,
director of the Center for Education and Research in Information
Assurance and Security at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Several security specialists attributed the flaw to heated
competition between Microsoft and Netscape for domination of the
Internet market. Both companies have been rushing programs to
market in record times, giving them away for free and largely
turning millions of Internet users into a massive audience of
software testers.
</P>
<P>
   A number of computer security researchers also said that because
the program had been so widely disseminated on commercial CD-ROMs,
as part of the Windows operating system and over the Internet,
closing the hole might prove to be a particularly vexing task.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, security experts who have been aware of the problem
for several weeks began talking openly about the possibility of
forcing the software publishers to issue a general recall of their
software because of the potential danger. The Federal Trade
Commission, the government agency responsible for such recalls, has
never recalled software and does not have a policy for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is to begin to treat computer security issues
with as much fervor as we treat a medical issue or a financial
issue, said Russ Cooper, a software security expert and the
moderator of a mailing list that deals with Microsoft software
bugs. ``To do this we need a mechanism for software recalls.
Microsoft needs to recall all Windows 98 CDs and all CDs produced
with the affected versions of Outlook Express and Outlook 98, and
Netscape needs to recall all the affected version of their
Communicator suite.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said that the company had begun putting
into place user protection mechanisms that would make software
recalls unnecessary. For example, beginning with its Windows 98
program, Microsoft added a Windows Update feature that notifies
users if their software is not up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   To use the feature, however, the users have to press the Start
button, followed by Settings, followed by Windows Update. What is
more, as of tonight, the automatic update feature offered a patch
for the Outlook Express problem but did not even mention the far
more serious Outlook 98 flaw.

MICROSOFT CALLS ANTITRUST CASE `COMPLETELY GROUNDLESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first court papers it has filed in its defense, Microsoft
Corp. called the government's sweeping antitrust case against it
``completely groundless'' and offered a glimpse of the legal
strategy it will pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's formal answer to the suit filed in May by the
Justice Department and 20 states is an early step preceding a trial
in U.S. District Court in Washington, scheduled to begin on Sept.
8. Other, more detailed, court filings will be made later. Both
sides are scrambling to take depositions from potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government has informed Microsoft that it wants to take a
videotaped deposition from Bill Gates, the company's chairman and
most prominent founder, according to a lawyer involved in trial
preparation. ``We want to see what kind of witness he makes,'' the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Microsoft would only say that Gates has not yet
been deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a deposition from Gates, antitrust experts say, would not
be a surprising tactic. ``It would be just a common-sense strategy
on the government's part, given that Bill Gates apparently has
firsthand knowledge of everything important that goes on at
Microsoft,'' said Kevin Arquit, a partner at Rogers &AMP; Wells, a New
York law firm, and a former senior antitrust official at the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The taking of a pretrial deposition from Gates would not
necessarily be followed by his being called as a witness _ a
hostile one _ for the government side. But that option is open to
the government, and the Justice Department did put the chairman of
AT&AMP;T, John de Butts, on the stand in the government's landmark
antitrust case against AT&AMP;T. That case culminated in the breakup of
the company in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Tuesday that its own trial preparation was being
hindered by a reluctant competitor, Novell Inc. ``We are dismayed
that Novell is resisting a court order to provide information,''
said Mark Murray, a spokesman for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Such delays, Murray said, could present ``significant problems''
for Microsoft as it tried to prepare for a Sept. 8 trial date. But
he added that the company was working with Novell to try to resolve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, Microsoft denied all of the government's
major allegations. For example, the company said that it had
decided to include Internet browsing software in its operating
system as early as late 1994 and early 1995, before Netscape
Communications Corp. had even been founded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not until 1995 that Microsoft licensed from another
company, Spyglass Inc., the technology that became the core of its
Internet Explorer browser. In its defense, Microsoft said it will
argue, with supporting evidence, that the decision to include
browsing capabilities in its Windows 95 operating system was made
much earlier, even though it had not yet acquired the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also denied that it had ever tried to ``illegally
divide the browser market'' in meetings with Netscape, as the
Justice Department contends. Representatives from both companies,
the court papers say, met ``in Redmond, Wash., on June 2, 1995, and
again in Mountain View, Calif., on June 21, 1995, to explore ways
in which the two companies could work together to improve their
respective products.''
</P>
<P>
   Another government allegation is that Microsoft's contracts with
personal computer makers are restrictive, giving Microsoft
tight-fisted control over the main Windows screen that users see
when they start up their machines. These restrictions are important
to the government's antitrust case because, the Justice Department
says, they are intended to allow Microsoft to use its Windows
operating-system monopoly to give the company an unfair advantage
in the newer markets for Internet software and services.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that the Windows main screen serves as a
crucial gateway to these new markets and that Microsoft is trying
to maintain a chokehold on that gateway.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, Microsoft replied that its Windows
licensing deal with personal-computer makers gives them ``broad
flexibility to differentiate their products in response to
perceived consumer preferences.'' The only restrictions it places
on personal-computer makers are those that ensure the ease-of-use
and reliability of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a brief statement late Tuesday
afternoon, saying that the Microsoft filing contained ``numerous
misstatements and mischaracterizations.'' The Justice Department
added, ``We remain confident in our case and expect to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also filed a countersuit against the states Tuesday,
asking the Federal court to toss out claims made under state
antitrust laws instead of the Federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the move was mainly intended to streamline the
case, but it also asked that the states pay the company's legal
fees for researching and responding to specific state laws.
Microsoft could not estimate what those fees might be, but they
would presumably be a small share of the company's total legal
costs to prepare for the trial.

POWERBALL FEVER SWEEPS TEXAS AS LOTTERY PLAYERS DRIVE TO LOUISIANA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (see optional trims) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOOMEY, La. _ Texans sweltering in the Louisiana border heat for
a chance at a $250 million lottery are asking themselves, ``Didn't
we just have a world-record Powerball jackpot?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to math, said Doug Orr, of the Multistate
Lottery Association, which runs Powerball games in 20 states and
the District of Columbia. ``People told us they wanted bigger
jackpots, so in November, we changed the number matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been fewer but bigger jackpot winners, and much
more lotto frenzy. In Connecticut, New Yorkers are standing in line
for nine hours to buy chances at the $250 million, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   The prize _ enough to buy, say the Minnesota Vikings football
team, or five houses as costly as computer billionaire Bill Gates'
new abode, or maybe a different $250,000 limo or sports car every
day for almost three years _ is enough to lure plenty of Texans to
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Trucker Dave Loupo drove a jet fuel truck all day Monday, but
decided he could put in a couple of hundred more miles from his
Houston home to pick up tickets for himself, his boss and some
friends. ``All day long I just kept thinking, that's a quarter of a
billion dollars!'' he said. ``That is just a powerful lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I won,'' he said, ``neither I nor anybody in my whole
family _ both sides _ would ever want for anything again. And a lot
of people in Houston would never want for anything again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Louisiana Lottery Association reported that
1,800 Powerball tickets were being sold in the state every minute.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at Powerball outlets near the Texas border showed why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people sleeping in the parking lot last night so they
could be first in line,'' said the manager of Tobacco Plus, in the
tiny town of Toomey, four miles inside the Louisiana state line on
Interstate 10. By early afternoon Tuesday, a line snaked out of the
little convenience store and gas station, went down the side of the
store and out into the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all those in lines at outlets near the state line were
from Texas, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bureau drove a couple of hundred miles from the Baton
Rouge area after hearing about the big crowds near the state line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought some tickets last Friday over near home and there
wasn't any lines,'' he said. ``I thought it would be luckier to
come over here. There's more luck where there's more people buying
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Butler, who traveled from Houston with her twin, Jan
Fontenot, said she's sure her luck will be good. ``I had a dream
about a green alligator,'' she said. ``That must mean luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take phenomenal luck to win the big prize. Statisticians
say the 1 in 80 million chance of picking the correct six numbers
to win is about as easy as guessing President Bill Clinton's
personal telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Book of Risks'' by Larry Laudan, a former
philosophy professor at the University of Hawaii, a person is 40
times as likely to get killed falling out of bed or being killed by
an animal, and a thousand times as likely to die of complications
from surgery as they are to win the Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against winning the Powerball are more than five times
as steep as winning the Texas lottery jackpot _ which is a mere $4
million Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, $4 million isn't something to sniff at. That would buy 33
new Porsche 911 turbos and plenty of gas to drive to Louisiana to
buy Powerball tickets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning the big Texas jackpot, which has been as
high as $77.1 million, are only 15.8 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Powerball so much harder to win _ and thus
provides the big jackpots _ is the special sixth number that gives
the game its name.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, lottery players pick six numbers from 1 to 50. The
numbers can come in any order.
</P>
<P>
   In the Powerball, players pick five numbers from 1 to 49. They
then pick a special powerball number from 1 to 42. The number drawn
for the powerball can also appear as one of the regular five
numbers, but one of the regular five numbers on a player's ticket
cannot be used for the powerball number.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there's a 1 in 35 chance that a $1 Powerball ticket
will win at least something. A correct powerball wins $3. Five
correct regular numbers without the powerball wins $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of the money players put into the Powerball is used in
prizes. Another 30 percent goes to the state of Louisiana and the
rest goes to pay for running the game.

   Powerball officials aren't yet predicting how big the jackpot
could be Saturday if nobody chooses the numbers drawn at Powerball
headquarters in West Des Moines, Iowa, at 9:59 p.m., CDT,
Wednesday. It would probably reach $350 million to $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is only a 15 percent chance of the jackpot not being won
Wednesday night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas, the Powerball jackpot can be paid out over 25 years.
Most Texans who crossed into Louisiana on Tuesday were buying the
cash option, however, which instantly pays about half of the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   For the cash option, after taxes, that would mean a check for
almost $84 million. That's not the advertised $250 million, but it
is enough to buy a new Harley Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic
motorcycle for yourself and for almost 4,000 close friends.

   At Toomey's Abear's Grocery (phonetically spelled for Texans who
couldn't properly pronounce Hebert), a Powerball player who called
himself simply ``R.K.'' (``in case I win``) was philosophical about
his chances. Last week he bought 50 tickets and won $103. Tuesday
he was planning to put all of his winnings and $15 more into a
chance at the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's all a dream,'' he said, as he stood near the end of
a two-hour line. ``It's as American as apple pie. It's a chance to
just sit on the porch in a rocking chair. Well, two or three
porches.''

   Louisiana Powerball outlets are allowed to sell the tickets from
5 a.m. to midnight every day of the week. The lines, retailers
report, will only get longer before sales on the $250 million
drawing stop at 9 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Texans who don't want to face the long lines in Louisiana do
have an alternative, though. New Mexico sells Powerball tickets as
well, and it's only 645 miles from Houston to Carlsbad.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky received a sweeping grant of
immunity from federal prosecution Tuesday, agreeing to testify that
President Clinton urged her to deny under oath that they had a
sexual relationship, two lawyers familiar with her account said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did deny under oath that they had
a sexual relationship. But in discussions leading to the immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors this week that she and the
president had a sexual relationship that began in 1995 and that he
made several efforts in December to persuade her to deny it in
Paula Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, a 25-year-old former White House intern, now
admits she lied when she denied a sexual relationship with Clinton
in a sworn affidavit she submitted in the Jones suit in January.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions were crucial to reaching the broad immunity deal
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr announced Tuesday. Ms.
Lewinsky pledged her ``full and truthful testimony'' in exchange
for freedom from the threat of prosecution. Ms. Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, received a similar grant of immunity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the immunity arrangement, Ms. Lewinsky is also prepared to
testify that the president told her that he planned to deny a
relationship in his deposition in the Jones suit, and if they both
denied it, no one would know the truth, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   She is also prepared to say that the president encouraged her to
tell investigators that her many visits to the White House after
she lost her job there in 1996 were to see Betty Currie, Clinton's
private secretary, and not the president himself, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's proposed testimony appears to contradict
Clinton's assertions in public and under oath about their
relationship, as well as his statements about his advice to her on
how to handle questions arising from the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton emphatically denied having sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky or encouraging her or anyone else to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal _ which protects Ms. Lewinsky from virtually
any possibility of prosecution except for perjury in her future
grand jury testimony _ poses excruciating problems for Clinton if
he has been less than truthful in his previous public and sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's assertions go beyond the question of whether they
engaged in some form of sexual behavior and reach the marrow of the
inquiry by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr is seeking to
learn whether Clinton committed perjury, witness tampering or
obstruction of justice in seeking to conceal his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, refused to discuss Ms.
Lewinsky's potential grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal came after months of fitful negotiations
between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers and lawyers from Starr's office.
William Ginsburg, the California medical malpractice lawyer who
represented Ms. Lewinsky in the early months of the inquiry, openly
mocked Starr's prosecution team and all but dared them to indict
her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family dismissed Ginsburg in early June and her
new legal team of experienced Washington defense attorneys quickly
opened talks with Starr that led to Tuesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Ms. Lewis, whose grand jury testimony
last winter was suspended after she broke down on the witness
stand, also reached an immunity deal with prosecutors Tuesday,
according to her attorney, Billy Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants Ms. Lewis' complete story because Ms. Lewinsky
shared with her many of the details of her dealings with the
president and sought solace from her after she achieved global
notoriety in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not comment in public about the immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Mike McCurry, said that Clinton told aides he was
``pleased that things are working out'' for Ms. Lewinsky. The
president had nothing more to say about the matter, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   In a testy and abbreviated briefing for reporters, McCurry said
that the president was not concerned about Ms. Lewinsky's impending
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony and if she does, that should present not problem to the
president, obviously,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that he believed Clinton's earlier denials of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky contradicts those denials, McCurry was asked, is
she lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would presume so, yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's account of her conversations with Clinton in
which he urged her to deny a sexual relationship echo a similar
story told by Gennifer Flowers during the 1992 presidential
campaign. She said that Clinton told her to deny a relationship if
reporters asked and he would do the same and no witnesses could
contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denials, Clinton admitted in his January
deposition in the Jones case that he had had sex once with Ms.
Flowers, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, remained in
negotiations with prosecutors over how the president would respond
to a subpoena for his testimony. White House officials and others
involved in the inquiry indicated that Clinton is seeking to delay
his testimony for several weeks, citing the heavy demands of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, seeking to justify the president's desire for delay,
said, ``He's going to be a busy guy. He's the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return telephone calls seeking comment. He was
seen at the federal courthouse this afternoon but the reason for
his visit could not be learned. ``It's under seal so we're all in
Kabuki-land,'' McCurry said.

</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has become familiar since the sensational
sex-and-perjury allegations erupted in January, a horde of
reporters gathered outside the office of Ms. Lewinsky's lead
attorney, Plato Cacheris, in downtown Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, arriving in a taxi, was escorted through the
surging throng by Judy Smith, her spokeswoman. Ms. Lewinsky arrived
in Washington this morning after spending five hours with several
of Starr's deputies in New York yesterday reviewing her proposed
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and his co-counsel, Jacob Stein and Nathaniel Speights,
reached the immunity agreement with the office of independent
counsel this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m., Cacheris walked to the bank of microphones
outside his office and delivered a brief statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, reached an agreement today
which provides that Ms. Lewinsky's full and truthful testimony is
the basis for the OIC's grant of full transactional immunity from
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Transactional immunity is a rarely-granted full guarantee that a
witness cannot be prosecuted for any crime related to the matter
under investigation, in exchange for full disclosure. However, the
witness could face perjury charges and a revocation of immunity if
a prosecutor believes that the witness has lied about a material
fact in sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse Tuesday, Linda Tripp, erstwhile friend
of Ms. Lewinsky's who tape-recorded 20 hours of their
conversations, appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he read the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp was ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr apparently is finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since Michael Price sold the management company
of the Mutual Series funds to the Franklin Templeton Group for a
small fortune two years ago, the funds have labored under a cloud
of uncertainty. Shareholders have nervously awaited the day Price
would give up stock-picking and fly off to his vacation home in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   That cloud has darkened considerably over the last year, as
Price stepped away from full-time involvement in the funds,
splitting his portfolio management duties among a team of seven
analysts. Under that diffuse management structure, the largest
Mutual Series portfolios turned in relatively poor performances,
dropping to the bottom ranks of groups of similar funds and leading
disappointed investors to begin withdrawing their money.
</P>
<P>
   Price cleared the air Tuesday, announcing that he would step
down as chief executive of the group, effective Nov. 1, taking
advantage of an option outlined in his contract that allowed him to
depart on the second anniversary of the company's sale.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, he split his executive and portfolio management
roles at the fund group between two longtime aides: Robert
Friedman, who was named chief investment officer, and Peter
Langerman, currently chief operating officer, who will take over as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Their first order of business, Friedman said Tuesday, would be
``to address the causes of the recent underperformance.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain things will not change at the funds, which will continue
to follow a value investing style, seeking out beaten-down stocks
that have been all but abandoned on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   With Price remaining as chairman of the fund management company,
Franklin Mutual Advisers, and of the funds themselves, the funds
also will continue to have access to a hard-nosed manager who made
a practice of squeezing corporate executives to improve their
performance or put their companies up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But the reins are likely to be tightened on certain aspects of
the fund company's collegial team approach, which has been
emphasized in advertisements and marketing material in the two
years since the acquisition by Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Price said, the company will give
certain managers more authority over individual funds, rather than
continue a wholesale team approach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Friedman, the funds, several of which have
become indistinguishable in objective and portfolio holdings over
the years, will become more focused, and investment ideas will be
screened more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely have been stocks put into our portfolios over
the past year that will not be allowed to go into the portfolio in
the ensuing years,'' said Friedman. ``There have been too many
names in the portfolios. Now we will say if you want to put that
one in, let's take out something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said his departure was not prompted by the funds' recent
underperformance. ``There just comes a time when you go,'' he said.
``The guys who I've brought into the business are champing at the
bit to run it. I don't think it makes sense to sit there when over
the last year or two they are doing more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he acknowledged that recent performance has lagged, he
said that his style has always underperformed in bull markets. In
the two years ended June 30, the three largest Mutual Series funds
ranked in the bottom quarter of their peer group of funds that
invest for growth and income, according to Lipper Analytical
Services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the recent downturn has left at risk even Price's long-term
record, built up in the 23 years since he joined the firm and was
taken under the wing of Max Heine, one of Wall Street's best-known
proponents of the value style of investing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar Inc.'s measures of performance through
June 30, the Mutual Shares fund, the largest of Price's funds, with
$10.8 billion in assets, trailed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in
every time period from one month to 15 years. Similar results have
ensued for the Mutual Qualified fund, with $6.7 billion in assets,
and the Mutual Beacon fund, with $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Price and his funds have taken some hard knocks in recent
months. Sunbeam Corp., in which Price invested in 1990 while the
company was mired in bankruptcy, suffered an embarrassing downturn
in earnings, followed by the very public firing of its much-touted
chief executive, Al Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutual Series funds also recently took a big stake in shares
of Oxford Health Plans, whose troubles earning profits on its
managed care business have caused the stock to continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been big winners in recent years, most
notably Chase Manhattan, which under pressure from Price merged
with Chemical Bank in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That is what attracted the attention of Franklin two years ago.
Best known for its bond funds and its international portfolios,
Franklin lacked a stable of strong domestic equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Just how sought-after it considered Price was demonstrated in
the $550 million in cash and $70 million in stock that it offered
for Price's firm, Heine Securities. In addition, Price had the
ability to earn incentive payments of up to $192 million if his
company met certain revenue targets. Earlier this year, Franklin
said that Price had already earned $64 million of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, cash flooded into the funds, as Franklin began
introducing them to the thousands of brokers at Wall Street's major
brokerage firms who sell the other Franklin Templeton funds. Before
the sale, the Mutual Series funds had been sold directly to
investors, without a sales charge.
</P>
<P>
   But after adding $3.8 billion in net new investments to its six
funds last year, several of the funds more recently have begun to
experience withdrawals, according to AMG Data Services, which
tracks fund flows. Mutual Beacon lost $194 million to withdrawals
over the last five months, while Mutual Qualified saw $71 million
flow out over three months and Mutual Shares lost $3 million in
June.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to comment on specific figures, Price said,
``The outflows have not been significant.'' And, he added,
investors should remain patient. ``I don't view these things in
short time periods. Over the long term, our funds will compound
investors' money in the mid-teens, like they've always done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ General Motors and the United Automobile Workers
union agreed Tuesday to end a nearly eight-week strike at two auto
parts factories here that has shut down GM assembly plants across
North America, pushed hundreds of thousands of workers into
temporary unemployment and slowed economic growth across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's settlement, which is subject to ratification votes on
Wednesday morning by workers at both factories, settles a wide
range of local issues at the two factories and at several other GM
factories where workers had threatened strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the pact did not directly address national issues like GM's
push to open new factories overseas or its effort to shrink its
work force in the United States through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The pact includes a promise by both sides' leaders to hold
regularly scheduled meetings, as a way to rebuild their
relationship and head off further confrontations. But company and
union officials already meet periodically, and have been unable to
bridge disagreements that produce several factory-level strikes
almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   GM promised not to sell or close before January, 2000, either a
struck speedometer and spark plug factory here or a pair of brake
factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers have also threatened a
strike this summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM also agreed to invest $180 million in new equipment at the
other struck factory here, which makes auto body parts, in exchange
for work rule changes, notably a 15 percent increase in the number
of parts that some workers are required to make before stopping
work.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of Tuesday's settlement, which was reached at
3:05 p.m. and announced at 4:30, began to emerge in the first week
of talks. The strike lasted as long as it did partly because of the
two sides' mutual mistrust and partly because GM raised the stakes
by suing the UAW for the first time since 1937, contending that the
strikes here violated the company's national agreement, which runs
until September, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   GM withdrew its lawsuit Tuesday, along with a grievance in which
an arbitrator had been expected to rule as soon as Wednesday. While
UAW leaders insisted at a press conference late Tuesday afternoon
that they had not been intimidated by GM's legal offensive, a UAW
official who insisted on anonymity said that the union had become
worried that it might lose and stepped up the pace of settlement
negotiations on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the threat of litigation deters the UAW from further strikes
until the national agreement expires, this summer's strikes can be
counted as a small but costly victory for GM. But GM was fortunate
in that its case was assigned to a conservative federal judge who
repeatedly prevented the union from stalling during the
arbitration, and the company might not be so fortunate in future
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Each side's gains in the current strike were offset by enormous
losses. Wall Street analysts estimate that GM suffered after-tax
losses of $3 billion from the strike, and suffered a drop in sales
of about $12 billion, the heaviest losses ever incurred by an
American company during a strike, at least before adjusting for
inflation. The UAW's 200,000 members lost paychecks totaling about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM can recoup as much as half of the lost profits by running its
factories around the clock for months to restock dealerships picked
bare of popular models. UAW workers will earn ample overtime in the
coming weeks, although not enough to balance the paychecks foregone
during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   There will be four separate votes on ratification, as each of
the two struck factories will hold separate votes for assembly line
workers and for skilled craftsmen, like electricians.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements to end other recent strikes at GM factories have been
easily approved and UAW officials expected that Tuesday night's
pact would also pass, although they predicted some grumbling among
workers facing higher production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   In a provision that is likely to raise eyebrows on Wall Street
but improve the odds of ratification, GM will give a week's pay to
all striking and laid-off workers who missed a week of holiday pay
early this month because of the strike. GM said that the payments
to more than 100,000 workers would not affect its earnings because
it would use money previously earmarked for joint training programs
with the union.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified, Tuesday's accord would allow more than a hundred GM
assembly plants and parts factories across the nation to clank back
into production over the next week, with production resuming at the
struck factories by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   GM would recall 189,000 workers that it has temporarily laid off
across North America, while its suppliers would bring back tens of
thousands of workers that they have also pushed into unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Restarting the world's largest manufacturing system will be a
formidable task. With the strike costing $75 million a day, GM is
likely to undertake a massive airlift of auto parts to assembly
plants as soon as the two struck factories here reopen, said
Michael Robinet, the managing director of CSM Forecasting, an auto
production consulting firm in Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes by 9,200 workers here lasted so long partly because
both sides came to see them as struggles over principles _ indeed,
Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car
operations, even said early this month that the cost of the strikes
could not be justified in financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikes also dragged on longer than anyone expected
because both sides kept raising the stakes, bringing up new issues
or making new threats in the mistaken belief that the other side
would quickly back down. &QL;

 &HT;    A house near Penny Lane shares memories of ex-Beatle
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England _ Paul McCartney's yesterday is here today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, visitors will be allowed to explore the modest
government housing unit where the former Beatle spent his years as
a teenager and began life as a rock 'n' roll icon.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney and John Lennon often slipped away from school to idle
away their afternoons in the tiny front parlor picking at their
guitars by the coal-fueled heater. Here they scratched out early
tunes such as ``I Saw Her Standing There'' and ``Love Me Do,'' the
song that launched the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still living in the house when the Beatles found
worldwide fame,'' McCartney wrote in a guidebook prepared for the
house. ``My memories of the house are closely connected with those
times.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney was 13 when his family moved into the 3-year-old house
at 20 Forthlin Road, not far from the shops and stores of Penny
Lane. It was 1955 _ the year before McCartney's mother, Mary, died
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He remained there with his father, Jim, and brother, Michael,
until 1964, the year of the group's American debut, when
Beatle-crazed fans forced the McCartneys to flee in the middle of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust bought the two-story council house in 1995
for $91,000 from the woman who moved in after the McCartneys.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting furniture, decorations and other artifacts, the
trust sought to re-create the aura of living in a government-owned
council house during the 1950s and early '60s. There are period
furniture pieces and appliances _ including a small TV bought in
the '50s from future Beatles manager Brian Epstein's music store.
</P>
<P>
   The painting scheme _ a buttery ``corporation cream'' and deep
maroon _ is authentic. Even the flowers bordering the rectangle of
grass in front of the house were selected to match what the
McCartneys had planted.
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white photographs taken by Paul's brother Michael
connect the rooms to his family's daily life there. Among these is
a famous photo of McCartney climbing up a drainpipe to the back
restroom window.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's tiny linoleum-floored bedroom, where he slept until
the Beatles made it big, overlooks the front garden and quiet
street. It is in this spare room that he listened to American
rhythm and blues greats Fats Domino and Little Richard on a
Phillips radio that Jim McCartney rigged for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are familiar things for many people; perhaps reminding
them of somewhere they had been, maybe their grandmothers' homes,''
said Sarah Collins, a spokeswoman for the National Trust. ``It's
meant to be an evocation of what went on here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the judgment of the National Trust, what went on in these
cramped quarters was important. This marks the first time that the
trust, which is most often associated with palaces and castles,
acquired a house connected to a living person, and it is the most
modern property in the organization's inventory. ``I don't think
anybody could argue about the impact of the Beatles to popular
culture in the 20th century,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   And people in Liverpool, a faded port city of 500,000, aren't
arguing with the impact, or at least the potential impact, of the
Beatles on the local economy. Of the 800,000 tourists who visit
Liverpool each year, about 500,000 come because of the Beatles,
according to the Merseyside Tourism and Conference Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's house is only the latest addition to the collection
of Beatles attractions that have sprung up here in recent years.
The city seems to be shedding its ambivalence about its most famous
sons who left at the first opportunity, and in the minds of some
failed to look back often enough.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, there was little evidence that the Beatles had
ever existed here. Now, signs of the Fab Four are here, there and
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of years ago, the city began to recognize the tourism
potential and began to develop an infrastructure to support it,''
said Keith Davis of the Tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool officials are eager to bring people here with the
sizzle of the Beatles and then hook them on the city's history,
fine collection of architecturally interesting buildings and
attractions such as the nearby walled city of Chester. ``Liverpool
is a brand name across the world because of the Beatles, and we
need to find ways to leverage that,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The leveraging is well under way. For a sample _ a big sample _
take a Magical Mystery Tour bus to 59 Beatles sites, including the
Strawberry Field orphanage and the early homes of all four Beatles,
such as No. 9 Newcastle Road, where Lennon lived with his mother,
Julia.
</P>
<P>
   On Mathew Street, where the Beatles debuted in the Cavern
nightclub, you can buy a pint at the Abbey Road bar or get a
``Lennon Burger,'' with fried onions and tomatoes for about $2.50.
The Cavern, the cellar of an old fruit warehouse that was nearly
demolished in the 1970s, has recently reopened. Around the old
nightclub, the city has developed Cavern Walks shopping arcade.
There's the Cavern Pub and Cavern Wall of Fame, which bears the
names of 1,801 acts that appeared there between 1957 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Beatles' Story at the Albert Docks, which
for an admission charge of about $7.50 per adult offers an
underground walking tour that progresses through the stages in the
careers of the four Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   While it is expected to bring only 11,000 paid visitors a year,
the McCartney house will lend an air of dignity to the legacy here.
Moreover, it is creating a nice spate of publicity, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the neighbors on Forthlin Road, the prospect of a fresh
wave of Beatlemania is a bit unnerving. On Tuesday, a number of
cars and vans bearing what appeared to be peering tourists stopped
in at the house and began videotaping people standing outside. A
mother holding her pigtailed daughter's hand complained to a
National Trust official about the danger of the traffic to the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gledhill, who lives next door, is annoyed. ``It's already
like living in a fishbowl,'' he said. ``This is hyped up out of all
proportion. I feel like packing up.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCartney's part, he expressed some pride at the house's
recognition. ``My dear mother Mary had great aspirations for our
family and was very proud and pleased when we moved in,'' he wrote
in a good-luck letter to the Trust. ``Because of its modern design,
it was a house that attracted the admiration of visitors, as I hope
it will now.''

 &HT;    A house near Penny Lane shares memories of ex-Beatle

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England _ Paul McCartney's yesterday is here today.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, visitors will be allowed to explore the modest
government housing unit where the former Beatle spent his years as
a teenager and began life as a rock 'n' roll icon.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney and John Lennon often slipped away from school to idle
away their afternoons in the tiny front parlor picking at their
guitars by the coal-fueled heater. Here they scratched out early
tunes such as ``I Saw Her Standing There'' and ``Love Me Do,'' the
song that launched the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still living in the house when the Beatles found
worldwide fame,'' McCartney wrote in a guidebook prepared for the

 &HT;    Solid planning keeps business going through generations
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bea McQueen and her late husband Joe built their
IEC Corp. over the past 43 years into an international,
multimillion-dollar company by producing industrial devices used in
everything from oil rigs to food conveyor belts.
</P>
<P>
   Now 81, one of Bea's biggest jobs is helping ensure IEC remains
controlled by her family.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 million American businesses, including about 175 of the
Fortune 500, are family-controlled companies, according to one
book, ``Wars of Succession: The Blessings, Curses and Lessons That
Family-Owned Firms Offer Anyone in Business.'' They aren't all
mom-and-pop stores either: Companies like Ford Motor Co., Marriott
Hotels, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. all started as family-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But it is often difficult to successfully keep family-owned
businesses intact as they pass from one generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent of all businesses survive the transfer to a
second generation of family ownership and only 13 percent survive
to a third generation, according to ``Wars of Succession.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred McNair, president of McNairs Appliance Inc., says good
estate planning has helped the company as it begins the transfer to
its fourth generation of McNair ownership. The company has grown
into a $14 million business _ the 57th largest appliance dealer in
the country _ since it was started in 1939 by Fred McNair's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a lot of money with accountants and tax
lawyers,'' McNair says. ``It takes literally years to move some of
these assets out of the estate. Luckily we started a long time
ago.'' Through family limited partnerships, planned gifts, and
generation skipping trusts, the McNair family istrying to soften
some of the tax bite that can hit a company after its founder dies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Business, which
represents 600,000 business owners, has been lobbying for changes
in ``death taxes,'' which can take up to a 55 percent tax bite out
of the value of a business when it is transferred after the death
of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress increased the tax exemption from $600,000 to
$1 million on family-owned businesses being transferred to heirs.
The ``unified tax credit'' is being phased in over 10 years. The
NFIB is still pushing for full repeal ofdeath taxes on family-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While tax issues can be onerous, keeping harmony in the family
while balancing everyone's ownership interest in the company is
equally difficult, McNair says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done it legal, but also as equitably as we
could,'' he says, adding that his 25-year-old son, Adam, has said
he wants to pursue a career with the company. He also has two other
children. ``You don't want to make a family member mad and break up
a family relationship. That's the ticklish part.''
</P>
<P>
   At IEC, Bea McQueen says she and her husband began working with
estate planning consultants 10 years ago on a succession plan for
their company. It wasn't easy, she says, especially since her
husband disliked even discussing the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McQueen died in November 1996 of cancer. He built a company
known for producing highly reliable slip rings _ electro-mechanical
devices that allows the transfer of power between a moving object
and a stationary object. IEC products have been used in everything
from giant conveyor belts to warning devices used by the U.S.
military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 Bea took the helm of the company when her husband
decided he would rather spend more time on their ranch. Bea, then
61, diversified the business into new industries and oversaw its
growth into a company with $3 million in sales in 1997. Last fall,
she received a lifetime achievement award from the Texas Women's
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bea spends only a few days a week in IEC's offices.
Her son-in-law, John Paul Hudson, took over as president in 1994.
``(Joe McQueen) had the philosophy that he would never sell the
company. It would continue to be a part of the family,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the McNairs, the McQueens have tried to ensure that IEC
will stay in the family by setting up trusts that allow for its
stock ownership to proceed to the grandchildren. Such trusts allow
for the company to avoid a second set of taxes by skipping the
second generation of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen says she took out an insurance policy on herself that
would be used to pay off the the company's federal estate taxes
when she dies. (The National Federation of Independent Business
estimates that 68 percent of family business owners take out
insurance for this reason).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, family members are learning the ropes of the
business. Hudson has been with the company since the early 1970s.
Grandson Casey, 18, worked this summer in its machine shop, and
26-year-old daughter Heather has been producing the company's next
catalog of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``(John Paul) has got a sharp brain,'' Bea McQueen says. ``He's
a good leader. Right behind him are his daughter and son. It will
be carried on because they are both interested. We will make it.''
</P>

AS ART MUSEUMS THRIVE, THEIR DIRECTORS DECAMP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2.) 
</HEADLINE>

Cornell'' will be issued in paperback next month.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E.A. Carmean Jr. is one of the most respected museum men in
America, but these days you won't find him anywhere near a museum.
It took him three decades to rise to the upper echelon of his
profession and all of three minutes to bow out: he recently quit
his job as the director of the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Once he went to board meetings. Now he goes to Bible classes. At
54, he has decided to become an Episcopal priest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his decision, Carmean, who still lives in
Memphis, chuckled softly and told a joke. What's the difference
between a church and a museum? ``In church you have bread and
wine,'' he said, ``whereas at museum openings you have bread and
wine and cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, what led him to leave? ``The pressure on museum
directors is nonstop,'' he said. ``The minute you close one
blockbuster, you have to open another one. Museums are competing
with one another for attention, jumping up and down and screaming,
`Look at me, look at me!' If I ever organize a show again, at least
I'll have God on my side!''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at American art museums is skyrocketing, but upstairs
in the director's office, the desk chair is often unoccupied and an
eerie silence prevails. At last count, there were about 20 openings
for directors at prominent museums, and trustees are insisting,
with only partial exaggeration, that they can't find anyone for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, all kinds of institutions, from the Ivy League to
major league baseball, are having a hard time filling top
positions. All around, the theme is the same: money and marketing
are stripping jobs of their character and driving visionaries away.
The help-wanted problem is particularly acute at museums, where
directors are departing with a new haste as stranded trustees
consider alternate models of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of becoming a museum director, this is an
excellent time to apply. The vacancy rate is the highest it has
been in 15 years, according to Mimi Gaudieri, the executive
director of the Association of American Museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have never been so many openings at bigger institutions
especially,'' she noted. They include the Whitney Museum of
American Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of
Arts, the St. Louis Art Museum and, most confoundingly, the Kimbell
Art Museum in Fort Worth, where trustees have been trying since
January to fill what might seem like a plum job.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell claims a $200 million endowment, the largest of any
art museum in this country except the Getty, and can promise its
future director the chance to work in a stylish building designed
by Louis Kahn, care for a collection laden with Old Masters and
earn a salary said to be in the $400,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   One person who won't be applying is Kevin E. Consey, who, just
this summer, at age 46, gave up the directorship of Chicago's
Museum of Contemporary Art. ``Wild horses and pots of gold couldn't
get me to take another museum job,'' he said cheerfully on his last
day of work, adding that he plans to go to business school and
teach arts administration. ``I can't wait to get out of here. I've
got to clear my brain. I'm just going to take some time and go
surfing, which will be hard to do on Lake Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Tucker, 58, the outgoing director of the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in New York, similarly harbors no interest in
applying for another directorship. ``Why would I?'' she asked in a
startled voice. ``To direct an institution nowadays you have to be
an opportunist. You have to use every social situation you get to
think about fund-raising and social contacts. Sorry, but the
cocktail-party conversation is not my preferred mode of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Koshalek, 56, the director of the Museum of Contemporary
Art in Los Angeles, plans on stepping down next year. ``I don't
think I'll miss being a director,'' he said with undisguised
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, is a museum director, and what does he or she do?
For most of us, the job title still conjures a genteel vision _ an
image of someone who is poised and cultivated, who spends his days
conferring with curators, acquiring masterpieces for the collection
and charming wads of dough out of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   We imagine someone who, if asked, could easily instruct us in
the esthetic significance of Rodin bronzes or Chinese scroll
paintings, and who is equally adept at making toasts. We imagine
this person vacations in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, however, the classic image of the
director-connoisseur has gone the way of monocles and white gloves.
Directors have begun to sound like desperadoes. Their time is spent
courting socialites and odd-duck widows, while pining for the
corporate handout bonanza of the 80s. Money is harder to drum up,
though trustees are more demanding and seem to prize profits over
the ideal of civic service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most trustees aren't in it for the love of art,'' said Robert
T. Buck, the former director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and a
current director of the Marlborough Gallery in New York. ``At board
meetings, they go over the financial reports and then look at you
with disappointed faces. I felt like the board was playing Pin the
Tail on the Donkey and I was chosen to be the donkey.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To run a cultural institution is, in some ways, to be a cloven
creature _ half head-in-the-clouds dreamer, half bottom-line
bookkeeper _ and it might seem logical to split the job in two.
That's how it works in the performing arts, where an artistic
director and a general manager tend to reign in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the partnerships have been fabled, like that of Lincoln
Kirstein and George Balanchine, who founded the New York City
Ballet in 1948. Kirstein, who ran the money end of things, kept an
address book stocked with the names of Astors, Warburgs and other
philanthropists, leaving Balanchine free to obsess over dance
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Could it work in the museum world? A few museums have
experimented with the two-headed model, only to conclude that one
head is better than two. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, after 20
years of leadership by a director as well as a salaried president
whose authority was exactly equal, is scrapping the system next
spring and reverting to one-man rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dual leadership doesn't solve any problems,'' said Philippe de
Montebello, the Met's longtime director. ``A director needs a
vision that informs everything from his aura when he walks in the
door to how he looks at a work of art to the attitude of the
guards, and a vision cannot be divided in two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Museum of Art, after splitting its top job
between a director and a CEO for 14 years, similarly decided to
recombine the posts in 1996. ``Double leadership makes more sense
for the performing arts,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's
director. ``A conductor, choreographer or stage director is an
artist who has to spend all his time with the product, the
performance. That isn't the case with museum directors. We're not
artists. We don't have to paint the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves one lone big-city museum to endorse the merits of
dual leadership: the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It added a
paid president to its staff in 1995, after the director, Michael
Shapiro, bolted from his job almost as soon as he unpacked, serving
for just a year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, new paradigms of leadership are emerging. Foremost
among them is the Friendly Manager _ a director with a warm
handshake who is happy to devote endless hours to administrative
details while leaving all esthetic decisions to a team of ace
curators. Glenn D. Lowry typifies the breed. He joined the Museum
of Modern Art in New York in 1995, and in some ways he was an odd
choice: an Islamicist by training to preside over a museum that
owns more than 100,000 works of art, not one of which is Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry, who is 43, previously ran the Art Gallery of Ontario,
where he completed a $58 million building project; he's now
overseeing an elaborate expansion at the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The current expand-or-die mentality has surely found its most
formidable champion in Thomas Krens of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum, another archetypal 90s director. Call him the
Charlemagne-boss, conquering lands far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim's new annex in Bilbao, Spain, is one of the
wonders of the nonancient world, and architecture critics have
praised it extravagantly. Still, the museum's curatorial objectives
remain hazy, and no one is sure what will fill the building over
time. Maybe paintings after all.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, will Krens last long enough to decide? Much like
that of college presidents, the tenure of directors is shrinking.
Directors used to serve for two or three decades; now they clear
out after an average of seven years. Their photographs appear with
increasing frequency in trade magazines like Art News, accompanied
by reports of the latest career jumps _ David Ross, for instance
(who just went from the Whitney to the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art), or Samuel Sachs II (who left Detroit for the Frick
Collection).
</P>
<P>
   Such museum-hoppers stand in contrast to the slow-creeping
stewards of the past, most notably Alfred H. Barr Jr., the founding
director of the Museum of Modern Art. Dismissed from his job in
1943, after supporting, among other things, an unpopular exhibition
of paintings by a retired slipper manufacturer named Morris
Hirshfield, Barr refused to go away; he moved into a tiny cubicle
in the museum's library and stuck around for another two decades,
writing his scholarly books.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to bodily eject him, trustees gave up and left him on
the payroll. As Margaret Barr, his wife, once explained: ``Of
course Alfred would not leave. It was his museum. The museum was
his mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, directors are more fickle. At a time when society
places a high premium on personal fulfillment and encourages
fantasies of starting over _ if you dislike your job, your spouse
or your nose, you can get a new one _ directors seem as willing as
anyone to switch careers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Charles S. Moffett, who, at 52, is known in
the museum world as an authority on French Impressionism. He served
as a curator at various first-tier institutions before being tapped
for his dream job: the director of the Phillips Collection in
Washington, one of the most enchanting small museums in this
country. Yet last April, six years after he arrived, he resigned.
He switched into the auction business, becoming a vice president of
Sotheby's in New York.

 &HT;    Nigerian writer trapped in U.S. by INS red tape
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka fled his native Nigeria in 1994 to
escape imprisonment. Now, though it is certainly no prison, he
feels confined to the United States, unable to leave for fear he
will not be allowed to re-enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Soyinka _ a playwright who lectures at Emory
University in Atlanta and who won the 1986 Nobel Prize for
literature _ declined last week to attend a human rights conference
he had been scheduled to address in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka has opposed a succession of Nigerian military
dictatorships. In 1994, he was charged with treason by the
government of Gen. Sani Abacha and made a harrowing escape from his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Another dissident writer, Ken Saro-Wiwa, was executed by
Abacha's government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha died in June. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
has promised to bring democracy to Nigeria next year.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka came to the United States on an exchange program
administered by the U.S. Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He has applied for permanent residency. But those applications
take time. In the interim, he has been living in the U.S. on what
is called ``advance parole,'' a yearlong dispensation which allows
him to to leave and re-enter the country without a visa.
</P>
<P>
   That expired July 8. Despite Soyinka's application for renewal,
it has not been renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to get comments from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service failed. Officials in Washington referred questions to
officials in Atlanta, who did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Lelia Crawford, director for international
student and scholar programs at Emory, the hang-up is that, under
the rules of the USIA exchange program, Soyinka must return home
for two years if Nigeria needs his skills _ and both theater and
education are on a list of skills Nigeria says it needs _ before he
can be eligible for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has approved Soyinka's request to stay in this country,
based on a provision of the law that applies to Nobel Prize winners
and other people of high achievement, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS cannot proceed until Soyinka fulfills his USIA
requirement. That requirement can be waived if Soyinka demonstrates
a well-founded fear of persecution if he returns home, said Stanley
Colvin, assistant general counsel for USIA.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin said he was not familiar with Soyinka's case but was
speaking only about the legal requirements. He said applications
for waivers based on fear of prosecution are turned over to the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said she plans to submit such proof _ newspaper
clippings, mostly _ to USIA today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Soyinka, who has on occasion criticized the State
Department, hopes to be able to resume his international travel
schedule. And he is aghast that no accommodation could be made for
him to travel to the Ottawa conference even for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm trying to reassure myself that it's a genuine
bureaucratic snarl,'' he said. ``I'm trying not to have a
conspiracy mentality right now. It's very hard.''

 UNDATED: New York.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To ask why he left his museum job is to hear a familiar litany
of complaints. ``I was spending all my time raising money,''
Moffett said with a sigh. ``I knew that if I lost contact with
works of art, I would dry up and turn to dust and blow away. The
job at Sotheby's has given me an opportunity to go back to art and
connoisseurship.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the salary issue. Most art museum directors do
not earn whopping incomes _ the median salary last year was
$110,250, according to a survey by the directors' association _ and
while Moffett declined to specify what Sotheby's was paying him, he
did remark, somewhat jokingly: ``Auction houses have a bonus plan,
and there's a possibility for reward at the end of the year. At the
Phillips Collection, I only received Christmas cards from the
trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it was considered taboo for a museum director
to cross over into the auction field. To sell art was to sell out.
Auction houses, unlike museums, cater to a tiny coterie of people
(tycoons, heiresses, art dealers, etc.) who buy and sell Picassos
and Dubuffets for business or sport. Not even the perkiest
auctioneer at Sotheby's or Christie's could pretend that they play
any role in educating a large public in the higher rewards of art.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these days, defections to the auction houses and Manhattan
galleries are increasingly common (they include Richard E.
Oldenburg, formerly of the Modern), and no one raises an eyebrow.
Perhaps that's because museums are no longer viewed as castles of
purity and scholarship, towering above the world of commerce.
Rather, they're seen as businesses of sorts governed by practical
imperatives, and the prestige of museum directors has been
tarnished in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the throngs pouring into the latest shows of Picasso
or Degas or Bonnard might seem to suggest that museums are
flourishing. And, in many ways, they are. It is not Pollyanna-ish
to speak of the present as a golden age for the American museum.
</P>
<P>
   More people than ever are seeing more ambitious exhibitions; the
complaint that a mass art audience dilutes the quality of shows is
a pious fiction, embraced mainly by cranks. The mobbed Cezanne show
seen in Philadelphia in 1996, to cite an obvious example, proved
that art addicts and the general public can inhabit the same
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the museum boom has come at a high price. Bigger
shows demand bigger budgets, and the need for directors who excel
at raising money is driving a generation of esteemed art historians
right out the door. This poses a real danger to museums,
particularly the new or newly expanded ones, which might never have
the chance to define themselves _ to establish why they matter _
without able leadership, the sort of leadership now being shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Who will guide our museums into the 21st century? True, there
are a few newcomers _ like Robert Fitzpatrick, who has just been
named director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. At 58, he
has never worked in a museum before, and he claims unusual
credentials: dean of the School of the Arts at Columbia University
and, before that, president and chief executive of Euro Disney
outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his vision for the museum, Fitzpatrick questioned
the necessity of having a vision at all. ``I'm not going to sit
here like some kind of French intellectual and say, `Here is the
way I see the universe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he then articulated a vision of sorts. ``What
Disney gave me,'' he said, ``was an enormous respect for what
Disney calls the `guests.' There's a difference between a client, a
customer and a guest. When you go to a Disney theme park you feel
truly welcome. We have five young curators at this museum, and this
summer I'm having them work as guards at the museum for a day or
two. I want them to experience how visitors enter a gallery, to
think, `How can we make this museum a pleasant, welcoming
experience?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the museum specializes in contemporary art, much of
which _ Bruce Nauman's shrieking videos, Cindy Sherman's
photographs of rotting food, Sue Williams' plastic puddle of vomit
_ might not seem to lend itself to the museum's new hospitality
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Told that he seemed uncommonly upbeat for an art
museum director, Fitzpatrick explained, ``Well, I've only been here
for three days.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a pocket of somber calm apart from Washington's
political turmoil, President Clinton and congressional leaders
gathered Tuesday under the Capitol dome to join thousands in paying
tribute to democratic ideals and the two police officers who died
protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Brief memorial services for the officers' families and official
Washington punctuated an extraordinary day of public mourning as
police officers, congressional staff and visitors from as far as
Los Angeles filed through the Capitol's rotunda to pay respects by
the flag-draped caskets of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson died Friday
after a man armed with a 29-year-old revolver and apparently
tormented by visions of an oppressive federal government tried to
shoot his way into the Capitol. Their coffins stood at the center
of the rotunda all day, in a gesture of gratitude and respect that
Congress usually reserves for former presidents and military
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were honored more with silence than with speech.
From eight o'clock Tuesday morning, thousands lined up to make a
wordless, counterclockwise circle across the polished sandstone
floor of the rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   In T-shirts and suits, sundresses and midnight blue uniforms,
they waited for hours in the July swelter to climb the steep
Capitol steps and make a circuit of perhaps 90 paces and less than
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The day's official remarks lasted perhaps 20 minutes, all told.
After following congressional leaders in silently laying a wreath
at a half-hour service Tuesday afternoon, President Clinton said
that in doing their duty, the officers saved lives and
``consecrated this house of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They remind us that what makes our democracy strong is not
only what Congress may enact or a president may achieve,'' Clinton
said. ``Even more, it is the countless individual citizens who live
our ideals out every day, the innumerable acts of heroism that go
unnoticed, and especially, it is the quiet courage and uncommon
bravery of Americans like J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president spoke, facing the two coffins, he was flanked
by dozens of members of each officer's family, some clutching
handkerchiefs. Around the sitting families, hundreds of standing
police officers and legislators filled the rotunda, pressing up
against bronze statues of Jefferson, Jackson and Martin Luther King
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the president, Speaker Newt Gingrich said that
the two officers ``brought together this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The service was a rare tribute for men unknown beyond their own
communities before Friday. One speaker, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said they ``should rightly be recognized in
this hall of heroes.'' He called them ``two men who did their job,
who stood the ground and defended freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   After entering the cool rotunda, some of the visitors crossed
themselves or prayed silently; others turned to face the coffins
and salute. Some held hands, others babies. A young boy in baggy
shorts and T-shirt carried his blue Yankees cap in his hands. A
blind man walked with his eyes straight ahead, his white cane
tapping at the stones, his left hand on a friend's shoulder. One
woman in a taupe suit, tortoise-shell sunglasses resting in her
hair, wept silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got inside, I just wanted to be quiet and think,'' said
Doug Smyth, an eighth-grader who came to the Capitol with a group
from a school in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Staigers of Dayton, Ohio, in Washington on vacation,
brought her two grandchildren. ``We decided we'd come here today so
that our grandchildren could see and understand the immense support
for our nation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they had come not just to pay respects but to make a
symbolic point. Rene Bitoun, a teacher in a Montessori school in
Washington, said she wanted to demonstrate that ``terrorism can't
restrain the will of the people to have an open and free society.''
As she spoke, she stood at the back of a line that stretched about
a quarter-mile east from the Capitol steps and south down First
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the line, visitors signed their names in books
for the bereaved families, jotting notes like ``God bless'' or
``You showed me what is courage.'' On the Capitol steps, flowers
that began piling up over the weekend had become a hill of wreaths,
teddy bears, candles and crayon drawings. ``Heroes Forever,'' read
one hand-lettered sign among the flora.
</P>
<P>
   Their badges crossed with black bands, police officers who lined
up came not only from Washington but also from Wilmington, Del.,
Roxbury, N.J., and New York City. There were military police
officers, patrol officers, Secret Service officers and bicycle
officers, some with their helmets strapped to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to show my respect for the brotherhood, one police
officer for another,'' said Leo Flibotte of the Hampton, Va.,
police. ``We're in the same church, different pews.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officers said they were pleased by the public turnout,
although some wondered if the concern would be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel reassured that so many people came out to show their
support,'' said Mike Grossman, an officer from Los Angeles County.
``A lot of people support what we do, but no one talks about it.
Unfortunately I think interest will subside.'
</P>
<P>
   At noon, the line was held up as congressmen poured into the
chamber to stand silently for five minutes, almost as still as the
honor guard of four Capitol Police officers around the caskets.
</P>
<P>
   The senators left quickly, but the representatives lingered as
an impromptu receiving line formed. Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority
whip whom Gibson was assigned to guard when he was killed, stood
with Gingrich, shaking hands and hugging dozens of congressmen as
they filed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressmen said they hoped that the day of shared sorrow
would blunt Washington's partisan edge. In remarks Tuesday
afternoon on the House floor, Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said that he
hoped the city's politicians would now learn ``to love each other
and to be more civil.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans regularly hugged on another Tuesday.
As Vice President Al Gore stood during Tuesday afternoon's memorial
service, he clasped the hand of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. There
was no public talk about the Lewinsky investigation, or about the
partisan stalemate that is making this one of the least productive
legislative years in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   At the service, each speaker said that the men's deaths had
reminded the country of higher ideals. Gingrich said they had
underscored that ``while this is the center of freedom in the
world, and this building is the centerpiece of freedom in our
constitutional system, it only lasts as long as there is courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Abrecht, the chief of the Capitol police, said, ``the
heroic actions of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson
will become as timeless as the building in which they died.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Officer Eric Boggs missed the service because he was
guarding DeLay's office door, which was draped in black. Chestnut
was not only his colleague but also his neighbor, and Boggs said
that the man he called J.J. was ``one of the finest men that I've
known.'' He said that he would have a chance later to go up and
view the coffins quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'd rather do anyway,'' he said. ``I'd rather go
up myself.''

TWO U.S. OFFICIALS DETAINED IN CHIAPAS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pro-government Indians detained the assistant
United States army attache and an American army sergeant for nearly
five hours on Monday in a conflict-ridden village in Chiapas state,
a spokesman for the United States embassy said Tuesday. The two
diplomats were released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Thomas Gillen and Sgt. Elizabeth Krug, both assigned to the
military attache's office in the embassy here, were stopped by
villagers in the mountain hamlet of Los Platanos. The Indians
blocked the road with rocks to keep them from leaving after the
Americans refused to allow a search of their vehicle, citing their
immunities as diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington that
the officials' Chiapas visit was ``part of their regular and normal
duties'' to report on political events in Mexico. Several shooting
incidents have occurred recently in the hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas state police and government officials stepped in to
persuade the villagers to let the diplomats go.
</P>
<P>
   The government has mounted a campaign among its followers to
blame foreigners for the crisis in Chiapas, where pro-government
groups are squared off against Zapatista rebels.

INDONESIA REDUCING FORCES IN EAST TIMOR

   DILI, Indonesia _ Indonesia began withdrawing 1,000 combat
troops from East Timor on Tuesday, but critics and residents
remained skeptical about the more than 11,000 troops and police
officers who will continue to patrol the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized withdrawal is an attempt to demonstrate
Jakarta's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the fate of the
former Portuguese colony, which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and
annexed in 1976. Since then, the disputed territory has been the
scene of fierce fighting between security forces and separatists,
that along with disease and starvation, has left an estimated
200,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, the Indonesian military has been accused of repeated
human rights abuses against the people of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 398 departing troops, representing the elite Special
Forces and the Strategic Reserves Command, boarded a vessel docked
in the harbor here in the capital while several hundred residents
watched from behind an iron fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are removing the combat troops because the number of rebels
in the jungle is getting smaller,'' said the military's information
officer, Capt. Tri Yoga Budi, who estimated the current number of
rebels at fewer than 200.
</P>
<P>
   While the threat from rebels seeking independence for the area
may have been reduced, the decision to pull out the combat troops
is believed to have more to do with the talks between Indonesia and
Portugal planned for Aug. 4 and 5 in New York under the auspices of
the United Nations secretary general.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Requests for demilitarization have also come from Jamsheed
Marker, the United Nations' special envoy for East Timor who
recently visited the territory, and from the Roman Catholic bishop
for the territory, Carlos Ximenes Belo, who has repeatedly called
for freedom of movement on the tiny island 1,300 miles east of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are soldiers there will be threats,'' said
Manuel Carrascalao, a founding member of the Movement for the
Reconciliation and Unity of the East Timorese People.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and activists said security officials were still
stopping East Timorese at random and that the military retained a
presence in each of the villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers are repressive as usual,'' said Anis Neves from
the local Rights Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the need to keep on so many troops if so few
rebels remained to pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The official answer is that the troops will be employed in the
territory's ``development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers help the farmers with planting, some help teach
and others are involved with development activities,'' said Lt.
Col. Saragi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Carrascalao said only a complete withdrawal of troops would lead
to peace and confidence-building in East Timor, where 85 percent of
the population of 850,000 is Catholic in predominantly Muslim
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Timorese don't have a problem with religious
differences or with the Indonesians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do have a problem with ABRI,'' he said, using the
initials for the Indonesian military.

   Carrascalao called the troop withdrawal a ``charade'' staged for
the outside world at a time when the new administration under
President B.J. Habibie has offered the territory a degree of
autonomy in return for international recognition of East Timor as a
part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations still recognizes Lisbon as the administrative
authority over the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta's officials have ruled out the possibility of a
referendum on East Timor's fate, asserting that a vote on whether
to integrate with Indonesia or become independent would separate
the people of East Timor and possibly lead to a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have never been any problems solved by referendum,''
said Abilio Soares, governor of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer dialogue as a means of bringing about a better
future for the people of East Timor,' he added.

   MARK TWAIN'S AMERICA IN 3-D &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Imax film at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square in Manhattan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Anne Bancroft &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Stephen Low &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 47 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low tries to fit the life of Samuel L. Clemens (1835-1910) into
the sweep of American history, a tall order for a 47-minute film.
But then this is a tall movie, projected onto a eight-story-high
screen with figures floating and leaping out at one through a 3-D
headset.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enlivening effects, an earnest and rather plodding
narrative only grazes highlights from the author's boyhood on the
Mississippi, his riverboat-piloting days and Civil War experiences,
his career as a reporter and writer, and his later days as a
humorist and public figure. (Sadly, his rapier wit is reduced to a
few ponderous chuckles.) &QL;

<P>
   AGES 3-7 The headsets are a bit of a load for the youngest
children, but they will enjoy the 3-D sights. The story, however,
will be confusing and boring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-12 They, too, will like the effects. They might also have
appreciated a livelier, more imaginative historical account. The
wooden tone of this one may turn off brighter and more restless
children, even in 47 minutes. &QL;
</P>

   Disney has freshened up its 1961 classic about twins separated
more or less at birth who meet at summer camp and scheme to bring
their divorced parents back together. Ms. Lohan, a freckle-faced
redhead, plays both twins, as Hayley Mills did in the original.
</P>
<P>
   The poor-little-rich-girls story is even more improbable now,
because divorce and child-custody questions are so common. But it's
still a rosy fairy tale, and the 90s touches include blue
fingernail polish, a Napa Valley vineyard and the Concorde. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Some lusty kissing and a reference to sex. &QL;

   AGES 3-5 The practical jokes and slapstick will make them laugh,
although they may not understand much of the plot. &QL;

probably feel like the poor little guy who got on the wrong bus and
ended up at the all-girls' camp. &QL;

   It's hard to believe, but in high school in the middle 80s there
was this gorgeous girl named Mary (Ms. Diaz) who was so nice she
actually asked the very uncool Ted (Stiller) to go to the prom with
her. Thirteen years later, Ted has lost touch with Mary, but he's
still in love so he hires Healy (Dillon), a private eye, to find
her.
</P>
<P>
   The trail leads to Miami, where Mary is a doctor and as
good-hearted as ever. Problem is, everybody in South Florida is
also in love with her, and that soon includes Healy, who schemes
and lies for her affections. This being a concoction of the
Farrelly brothers (``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``Kingpin''), get set for
gross occurrences and riotous complications. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   VIOLENCE Ted gets banged around but gamely carries on through

and ``Casino.'' Flashbacks allude to tough but funny times in the

FOR ULLRICH, A TASTE OF VICTORY, AND DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBERTVILLE, France _ Jan Ullrich is a great Tour de France
rider, as he proved Tuesday by storming away from all but one rival
to win the demanding second of three daily stages in the Alps. It
was exactly the sort of dominating performance that could be
expected of a man defending his championship in the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ullrich, the ride Tuesday followed a rare off
day in cold rain, a day in which he lost 8 minutes 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Equally unfortunate for Ullrich was that the one rival who
managed to stay with him up and over the fearsome Madeleine Peak
was Marco Pantani, the very man Ullrich lost both the 8:57 and the
leader's yellow jersey to on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So Ullrich, a German who leads the Telekom team, moved up from
fourth place over all to third and almost to second, but did not go
far toward winning the world's greatest bicycle race for the second
successive year.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, on the other hand, moved close to victory. By finishing
second in a sprint finish Tuesday, he widened his leadership to
5:42 over the American Bobby Julich and by 5:56 over Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour de France is lost,'' Ullrich conceded after the 16th
of 21 stages. ``But my victory today was extremely important for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich continued by praising Pantani's victory Monday as
``incredible,'' considering the daylong cold rain that crushed
Ullrich, a notorious summer soldier and sunshine patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected him to race so well after the hard last week
he had in the Giro,'' Ullrich said, referring to Pantani's victory
last month in the three-week Giro d'Italia. ``There's no doubt that
he's the best mountain climber in the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With one day left in the Alps, where the Italian leader of
Mercatone Uno has been outstanding, Pantani's big obstacle is a
32-mile individual race against the clock on Saturday. Although
such time trialing is not Pantani's strength, he is unlikely to
lose a lead of over five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That gap was obviously on Ullrich's mind when he accelerated
away from a group of leaders with 9 miles to go on the Madeleine
climb, 13 miles long with a grade of 7.6 percent. It is rated
beyond category in difficulty and followed four less demanding
climbs during the 127-mile trip from Vizelle to Albertville.
</P>
<P>
   Only Pantani was willing or able to follow him. As the overnight
second- and third-place riders _ Julich and Fernando Escartin, a
Spaniard with Kelme _ watched, Ullrich did all the work in the lead
position. He was looking back constantly to see where the others
were.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Pantani, they were soon out of sight. Within a few
kilometers, the pair caught and left behind three riders from an
early breakaway and then passed over the peak, 2:06 ahead, or
enough to allow Ullrich to rise from fourth to second place.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sun was out and the temperature balmy, the German
did not repeat his error Monday, when he failed to bundle up
adequately against the frigid wind on the descent. Then he wore
only a lightweight jacket over his yellow jersey; Tuesday he donned
a heavier one. Pantani, more a traditionalist, jammed some
newspaper pages into his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At speeds up to 52 mph on the broadly curving 25-mile descent
into Albertville, the two did their best to maintain their lead.
Ullrich did about 75 percent of the work from the first attack
until Pantani began taking his turn at the head, allowing his
companion to rest in his slipstream.
</P>
<P>
   They even jawed at each other as they rode side by side at one
point, with Ullrich appearing to berate Pantani for lack of
cooperation. The new man in the yellow jersey had much to gain by
widening their lead. Even if it helped the German move up in the
standing, he would gain no time on Pantani, but the Italian would
gain on everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, Julich was riding with eight teammates and rivals,
intent on guarding second place and slicing away at the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a very good day today,'' Julich, the rider for
Cofidis from Glenwood Springs, Colo., said later. ``I was suffering
on the climbs and afraid of being dropped. But the cheering from
the crowd kept pushing me on. I kept cramping badly in the last
descent and could barely push the pedals for about five
kilometers.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ullrich and Pantani approached the finish, they broke into an
unlikely sprint, the great puncher against the great climber.
Neither one is Mario Cipollini, the king of the sprinters, but
Ullrich was first by a few inches. In four stages in the Pyrenees
and the Alps, Pantani has won twice and finished second twice.
</P>
<P>
   Julich finished third, 1:49 later, or enough to keep second
place, with Escartin fourth and Axel Merckx, a Belgian with Polti,
fifth. Escartin dropped from third place over all to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The American was typically upbeat afterward. ``The race isn't
over until the time trial,'' Julich said. ``Never say die.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about winning this 85th Tour, not about holding
on to second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ullrich lost nine minutes yesterday and gained back two
today,'' Julich said. ``Next time, maybe it will be Bobby Julich's
time.'' &QL;

DISNEY CRUISE LINE NOT FINDING SMOOTH SAILING FOR INAUGURAL VOYAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co.'s much-hyped cruise line, set for
launch this week, continues to navigate in rough waters.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents have reported less-than-expected demand for summer
cruises on the Disney Magic, with rooms still available as early as
Aug. 14. The Cruise Week newsletter has reported that 72 percent of
more than 300 agents polled said they were booking few or no
customers on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible there are still rooms available next month,
because a typical new ship would be sold out,'' said newsletter
publisher Michael Driscoll of Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed Disney's newcomer status and delays in the inaugural
cruise, which added up to 4{ months, for the tepid reception.
``It's tough to sell something sight unseen,'' Driscoll said,
adding that his polling found that 88 percent of agents think
business will pick up once the first cruise is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Barry, an analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates, agrees
that the delays -- brought on by a lack of cruise-ship construction
-- have probably dampened early interest in Disney Magic. ``Once it
starts, the word-of-mouth should be very strong even though it's
priced significantly above competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Severini, the cruise line's vice president of sales and
passenger services, said advance bookings have topped internal
estimates. ``We are launching an incredible product, and our phones
have been ringing off the hook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fares are about 30 percent higher than those of its
rivals, reflecting the strategy that the strong brand name and
larger-than-average rooms will carry considerable customer appeal.
The two-person rate for an outside room with a veranda on its
three-day cruise from Port Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 14 is $2,565;
Carnival's balcony room on a three-day cruise, starting Aug. 13
from the same port aboard the Fantasy, is $1,882.

LANDMARK BOSNIA RAPE TRIAL: A LEGAL MORASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ She is known as Witness A in the
courtroom, but what happened to her is no longer a secret.
</P>
<P>
   She lived in the Lasva River valley, once a peaceful part of
central Bosnia. A Muslim, she was married with two children. One
day in 1993, a Bosnian Croat soldier ordered her to strip naked as
he interrogated her. He rubbed his knife over her thigh and
stomach, then raped her. Next he locked her in a house where, for
about two months, he and some fellow soldiers raped her again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents describing these events do not say if
Witness A became pregnant. But she suffered shock and depression,
according to the evidence of a doctor and a psychologist. In her
testimony she talked about nightmares, nervous skin rashes and
stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   This month, after eight days of hearings, the judges at the
court investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia seemed
ready to give their verdict in the case of one of four indicted
soldiers. It was meant to set an early precedent in the tribunal's
first trial charging rape as a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the verdict, the startled courtroom heard a
bitter fight among lawyers over procedures. And there was a murmur
when the defense said the rape victim could not be trusted as a
witness because she had had memory problems and had misidentified
the accused. The defense demanded that the victim's testimony be
annulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a new trial,'' said Luka Misetic, the Chicago lawyer
defending Anto Furundzija, a soldier charged with aiding and
abetting the crime. The lawyer said the woman had been treated for
post-traumatic stress syndrome, but the prosecution had hidden this
fact and was guilty of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   While the treatment grew out of the crime, the three-judge panel
conceded that the prosecution had indeed made some procedural
errors. As a result, they ruled, the trial would have to reopen,
meaning that witnesses and the victim can be called to testify
again.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing an early precedent, the case is
highlighting some of the problems involved in punishing wartime
crimes against women.
</P>
<P>
   And it has raised such crucial questions as where the balance
lies between the right of the accused to a fair and public trial
and the right of the victim to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As it is shaping up so far, the trial is a setback to the
prosecution, because it has been ordered to hand over medical
documents about the victim that it wanted to keep private.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing rape cases to the tribunal was expected to be
straightforward, given the widespread abuse of women in the Balkan
war. The lowest estimates hold that 20,000 women were raped, most
of them Muslims. Much of the evidence was collected by women. They
set out to demonstrate that sexual assault in Bosnia was systematic
and used as a weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   It was the outcry over the use of mass rape as a weapon to
impregnate women and to ``humiliate, shame, degrade and terrify''
an entire ethnic group, as one U.N. report put it, that gave sexual
crimes their first foothold in international humanitarian law. And
the outcry led this U.N. tribunal to include sexual assault in its
statutes as a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the case of Witness A has now shown, trying rape at a war
crimes tribunal has its own pitfalls. Other trials that include
sexual assault among a list of charges are under way, but this case
revolves around rape only and serves as a stark example.
</P>
<P>
   For one, to protect the victim, most of the proceedings were
held behind closed doors. The indictment, often an immense
document, in this case is less than four pages long and full of
deletions. It does say that Anto Furundzija, 29, was a commander of
the Jokers, a paramilitary unit that took part in a Croatian
campaign to drive Muslims out of the area. The unit operated from a
bungalow near Vitez in central Bosnia. There, the indictment says,
Furundzija and another soldier, nicknamed Cicko, first interrogated
the Muslim woman in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When Cicko beat her and then raped her, Furundzija was present
and did nothing to stop this, the indictment says. Therefore he is
charged with aiding and abetting the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija, who pleaded not guilty, was arrested last December
by Dutch NATO forces. Complicating the case is that the three
people indicted on charges of rape are still at large and possibly
abroad and the tribunal has no police force to track them down.
Their names have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Little else has been disclosed about the case involving Witness
A. At the tribunal's special sex-crime unit, officials say they go
to great lengths to protect a victim's identity and, if necessary,
that of other witnesses. They argue that abused women have suffered
enough and may become outcasts if their plight is known to family
and friends. For the same reason, prosecutors say they do not
reveal details of a victim's mental or physical problems resulting
from the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A rape trial at the tribunal is different from trials in many
other courts. There is no jury to decide the case, but instead a
panel of three judges. And the tribunal's rules of evidence say
that the victim's testimony need not be corroborated. Because the
rape happened during a war, in most situations the defendant cannot
claim there was consent.
</P>
<P>
   It is such limits that infuriate Misetic, the defense lawyer. He
insists that his client was not in the room during the first rape
and that the troubled victim was manipulated into naming him by
others who wanted to settle scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's on the money in the case of the physical perpetrators,''
he said in an interview outside the court, ``but when it comes to
Furundzija she is inconsistent and confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the trauma be used against a victim, he was asked, when
the trauma was caused by the crime in question? ``I'm not slamming
the victim for having problems,'' Misetic said. ``But people who
suffer a trauma often have memory troubles and are open to
suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was unacceptable that the prosecution had held back a
statement from a psychologist, saying the victim had been treated
at a women's counseling center and had shown symptoms of
post-traumatic stress syndrome. He said he had learned this only
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Hollis, the prosecutor, who is on loan from the U.S.s
military, dismissed those arguments. The defense was duly informed
of the victim's counseling and heard a physician and the victim
herself testify about her symptoms, she said. Ms. Hollis added that
the psychologist's statement was not disclosed because ``it would
be a gross invasion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding a label of post-traumatic stress syndrome does not
change the picture,'' Ms. Hollis said. Victims of rape and sexual
assault experience trauma and many seek counseling, she added.
``Such psychological counseling does not affect a person's
credibility or memory.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, during one of the trial's rare public sessions, the
courtroom was tense and more observers than usual sat in the public
gallery. The accused, Furundzija, dressed in a dark gray suit, did
not move or look sideways.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge, Florence Mumba, a jurist from Zambia,
overruled the prosecutor's argument for privacy and ordered that
all relevant medical documents be handed over to the defense. And
she ordered the trial to be reopened. It may resume in September.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling aspect of this turn of events is that the rape
victim, whose whereabouts are secret, will almost certainly be
called to The Hague again to go through adversarial
cross-examination. Attorneys dealing with sex crimes here call this
``re-traumatizing the witness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is shocking,'' said one tribunal official. ``Of course
the rights of the accused must be protected. But the witness must
not be made to suffer over and over again. It's what rape victims

DUTCH TEAM IS SUBJECTED TO A DRUG SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBERTVILLE, France _ The doping scandal enveloping the Tour de
France intensified Tuesday when police officers, seeking illegal
performance-enhancing drugs, searched the hotel of the Dutch TVM
team and took away four riders for questioning and blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the riders were identified as Jeroen Blijlevens and Bart
Voskamp. The team's assistant coach, Hendrik Redant, also left with
police. He was first questioned last week, when two officials of
the team were held in judicial custody.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a third team became embroiled in the
controversy when the van belonging to the Big Mat-Auber team was
stopped on a highway near Albertville, the end of the daily stage
in the race, for what was termed a routine inspection. More than
100 medical substances were reported to have been found and sent to
a laboratory in Lyons for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Jacques Henry, the assistant coach of the Big Mat team,
which is based in France, said: ``We're not concerned. Most of it
was simply recovery medication'' like glucose.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the development cast a cloud over yet another team
after the inquiry into TVM and the earlier expulsion of the entire
Festina team.
</P>
<P>
   In the TVM case, about 20 police officers entered the Hotel
Million here and searched the riders' rooms. Police also searched
cars and the team bus. They confiscated three suitcases, a sports
bag and a large plastic bag. The contents were not immediately
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials of the TVM team _ Cees Priem, the coach, and Andre
Mihailov, the team doctor _ were taken into custody last week in
the Pyrenees and transferred to the French city of Rheims on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A TVM team car carrying what was described as a large amount of
illegal drugs was seized in Rheims in March, and two team mechanics
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   All nine of the Festina riders in the Tour were expelled after
the team's coach, Bruno Roussel, was arrested and admitted through
his lawyer that he had supplied riders with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine have since admitted using such drugs as EPO, an
artificial hormone, which is illegal in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel was released from jail Tuesday, pending further charges
and possible trial for violating French laws against supplying
drugs. &QL;

   Team of dreamers &QL; 
a refreshing change
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Shuffling through the Grand Casino in Monte Carlo
like day-trippers who had been bused in from across the border,
they were anything but celebrities among the royalty and the
moneyed elite.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along the Via Veneto in Rome, they were just another
dozen in the summer tourist flock, drawing no stares or comparisons
to the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Settled in now at a seaside resort on the outskirts of
democracy's birthplace, there is no mob scene in the hotel lobby.
No hungry hordes of autograph seekers. No throngs of pushy media.
No personal bodyguards. No limos.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Dream Team. Just a collection of real dreamers
who will start to work today to fulfill an obligation for their
country and a dozen fantasies for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ever would have believed it?'' said the basketball gypsy,
the only man in history to play for all three NBA franchises in
Texas. ``David Wood pulling on a jersey to play for the ol' USA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even dreamed of this,'' said Jason Sasser, Texas Tech,
class of '96. ``I thought trying to win a gold medal for America
was, frankly, beyond my level of ability.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it would have been if the locked-out NBA players
had not used the World Championship of Basketball as a misguided
bargaining chip in their labor war with team owners.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke of luck for players
</P>
<P>
   So instead of a ``Who's Who'' list of slam-dunking talent, the
disappointed Greek organizers get a ``Who's He?'' American team
made up of Continental Basketball Association scrappers, undrafted
collegians and overseas exiles, coached, so fittingly, by the
Rockets' Rudy Tomjanovich, patron saint of the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you don't get an almost-guaranteed gold medal this
way,'' Rudy T said. ``But you know, this just might be more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention refreshing. Rather than bringing in a roster of
NBA Godzillas to stomp on the world as if it were a movie set of
Manhattan, the ol' USA will have to fight, hustle and labor against
a lineup of challenging competitors from Australia, Russia,
Yugoslavia, Lithuania and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of this being a 12-day window to flex, pose and sell
souvenir NBA T-shirts and jerseys to every man, woman and child on
the planet, the World Championship turns back into an
honest-to-goodness tournament where almost anybody can win.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe without the Dream Team likes of Grant Hill, Tim Duncan and
Gary Payton, it's not sexy enough for NBC and TNT, which pulled the
plug on plans to air all of the games live in the United States.
The real dreamers have been relegated to appearances on ESPN2,
sandwiched between a couple of ``World's Strongest Men'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   But with players such as Wood and Sasser and Jimmy King and
Michael Hawkins and the rest, those viewers who tune in will see
guys playing for patriotic pride and maybe another chance at an NBA
life instead of multimillionaires playing to get one more
endorsement contract.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The Dream Team concept had become old and
heavy-handed. When Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and
Charles Barkley led the original bunch to a staggering gold-medal
performance in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympics, the point had been
proved: We bad.
</P>
<P>
   Dream Team wore out welcome
</P>
<P>
   But Dream Team II in Toronto in 1994 gave us just
crotch-grabbing and trash-talking, and by the time Dream Team III
hit Atlanta in 1996, the world applauded politely and yawned. They
were exhibitions, and we have seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   Let the NBA go back to the task of repairing its product, which
suffers in personality and quality of play. Let FIBA, the
international basketball federation, fight its political battles
within the Olympic movement in another way.
</P>
<P>
   And let's go back to using these international tournaments as a
test track, a proving ground for young and hungry American talent.
Can't win that way? Check out the U.S. gold medal won last week at
the Goodwill Games by a bunch of college kids against some of the
same national teams that will play here. It was much harder than
any won by a Dream Team but much more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three weeks, this bunch has traveled on first-class
flights, stayed at four-star hotels, trained in Monaco and Italy,
dined on crisp Greek salad and fresh shrimp while overlooking the
Aegean, lived a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll bust their butts trying,'' Rudy T said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a Dream Team, just dreamers.

POWERBALL IS SAID TO HURT REGULAR STATE LOTTERIES

<P>
   Powerball, the pastime of multimillionaire wannabes, was created
to enable small states to sell tickets for potentially huge lottery
jackpots. But as its prizes and popularity have soared, Powerball
has become a concern to lotteries in some states where sales appear
to be lagging as bettors defect across state lines, lottery
officials in several states said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With longer odds than the individual state lotteries and usually
a larger number of players, Powerball jackpots start higher _ at
$10 million _ and can climb quickly to more than $100 million,
making local jackpots in the tens of millions sound puny by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The current Powerball bonanza is at a record $250 million, and
thousands of ticket-hungry dreamers from the New York region
continued to swarm Tuesday across the border into Connecticut, one
of 20 states where Powerball tickets are sold. The pilgrimage was
repeated across the country: from California into Arizona, from
Texas into Louisiana or New Mexico, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   While some lines to purchase Powerball tickets have stretched
for hours in Delaware and Indiana, lottery officials in New Jersey
and Ohio said there had been a recent slump in their states' ticket
sales. This, despite the fact that New Jersey's Pick-6 jackpot was
more than $21 million on Tuesday and that Ohio's Super Lotto
jackpot is $20 million for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a $21 million jackpot last night and sales were down
about 10 percent compared to the same jackpot in November,'' said
Holly Behr, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Lottery Commission.
``We believe some of that decrease is probably due to Powerball.''
New Jersey, which previously declined to join Powerball, is now
rethinking that decision, Ms. Behr said.
</P>
<P>
   Any state can join the game, said Charles Strutt, the executive
director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs
Powerball. ``Pretty much they say, `Hey, we'd like to join.' We
say, `OK' It's a simple process,'' he said. ``I frankly don't
understand why more states don't join. I think they just don't
understand the benefits of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For ever $1 Powerball ticket, the state where it is sold keeps
50 cents, Strutt said, and the other 50 cents pays the prizes.
Because Powerball is run from the association's offices in West Des
Moines, Iowa, the states also save money by sharing operating
costs. Tickets are printed on the same machines used for local
lottery games and some states also pool resources for Powerball
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But many larger states, including New York and New Jersey,
declined to join Powerball, confident that they could sell enough
of their own state lottery tickets. In lotto lingo, a multistate
game like Powerball gives states with small populations access to
the kind of ``large player base'' that allows bigger states to
generate multi-million dollar jackpots on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had to create what we already have,'' said Stephen
Dolan, a spokesman for New York state Lotto. ``This week is an
exception. But you know a month from now, if you check the
Powerball and you check the New York Lotto jackpots, we're able to
do just as well. We're able to offer just New Yorkers what these
states had to band together in order to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state lottery officials had been concerned about the
impact of Powerball, Dolan said, and had been carefully monitoring
ticket sales. So far, however, they have detected little change in
the numbers. The New York Lotto jackpot this week is $40 million
and so far sales have remained strong, Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials scrutinized sales for last week's $25 million
jackpot when the Powerball jackpot was $185 million, he said, and
concluded there had been no decline. ``It was surprising to us as
well because we know about all of the cross-border traffic,'' Dolan
said. ``All the publicity and the hype surrounding Powerball is
stimulating demand for all lottery products.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not happening this week in Connecticut. Missy
Simard, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Lottery Corp., said sales
for the state's other games were down this week, although overall
sales were up. ``People are pumping so much into Powerball,'' she
said.

ANALYSIS: WHAT'S GOOD FOR GENERAL MOTORS? BETTER LABOR RELATIONS
WOULD HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related GM-STRIKE, GM-WORKERS) 
(HLW) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Like estranged spouses who reluctantly realize
they have little choice but to live together again, the General
Motors Corp. and the United Automobile Workers union have ended
their quarrel here but remain trapped in a tattered relationship.
</P>
<P>
   GM factories are generally the least efficient in the industry,
partly because labor and management so deeply distrust each other.
The factories tend to have the least flexible work rules of the Big
Three auto makers, forbidding assembly line workers, for example,
from performing other tasks when the line stops. Workers fear there
would be unreasonable demands from foremen if the work rules did
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing element of the settlement today is a
provision calling for the leaders of the two sides to meet
periodically to discuss their differences. In a sign of how poorly
GM and the UAW get along, this was hailed as an important
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps one of the very good things that might come out of
what has been a very difficult and very intractable situation,''
said Gerald A. Knechtel, GM vice president for North American
personnel, ``is a constructive focus by both of us to work very
hard to avoid these kinds of situations in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, though, that company and union leaders have been
quietly meeting for a long time _ and have nothing more to show for
it than 16 factory-level strikes over the last five years. Indeed,
in separate news conferences, each side's top negotiators first
mentioned the plans for future meetings but within minutes were
questioning the other's trustworthiness and ability to keep
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good way to start building that trust level is to start
keeping commitments,'' said Stephen P. Yokich, president of the
UAW.
</P>
<P>
   GM's strategy in the strikes at two factories here in Flint also
seems like the least likely approach to produce a lasting
improvement in the relationship. The company put a weekly recorded
message on a toll-free number, called by many UAW workers, that
strongly criticized the competence of union leaders. GM also sued
the union for the first time since 1937 and insisted on binding
arbitration of a claim that the union could not strike over
investment issues, yet the final settlement today dealt with some
of the same factory investment disputes that GM had said it would
not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   A senior UAW negotiator, who insisted on anonymity, said on
Tuesday night: ``The only way GM will change is if the players
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Making GM factories more efficient is critical if the company is
to address its main problem, a long slide in market share, from 50
percent in the 1970s to 31 percent now. Each lost percentage point
means about $3 billion in lost sales, several hundred million
dollars in lost profits and about 6,000 more factory workers GM no
longer needs.
</P>
<P>
   In private, the two sides seldom have had anything good to say
about each other. GM officials accuse the union of dogmatically
defending even the most outdated practices, like a work rule that
has allowed some auto parts workers here to collect a full day's
pay for a half day's work. Union officials accuse GM of repeatedly
breaking promises to protect jobs and invest more money in new
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The accord on Tuesday did not affect staffing and investment
disputes at any factories other than the two struck factories and
three others here and in Ohio and Indiana where there were strike
threats. The only way to address the company's broad problems is
through its three-year national agreement with the union, which
next comes up for renewal in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW is so unhappy with GM that some local leaders were
planning even before the settlement on Tuesday to start urging
members this fall to begin saving for a strike during contract
talks next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be real tough _ as soon as this is over, the UAW
members of GM need to start preparing,'' said Joseph Lovvorn, the
chairman of a 3,000-member local union unit that makes parts in
Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Labor relations are not always this bad in the auto industry.
The Chrysler Corp. has had only a few strikes over the last decade,
and the Ford Motor Co. has not had one since 1986. Ford views its
cordial relations with the union as a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW cooperated last year with Ford in the closing of an
unprofitable car factory in Lorain, Ohio. Ford transferred 1,000
Lorain workers to a highly profitable factory in Louisville, Ky.,
agreeing to pay them $45,000 each to move. It cost $45 million but
avoided a costly strike.
</P>
<P>
   Closing factories is always expensive for Detroit auto makers
because their contracts with the UAW require that workers continue
to draw 95 percent of their pay even when idled. Workers also have
the right to turn down transfers to other factories more than 50
miles away. Because of strike threats by the UAW, GM has had a
harder time than its rivals in trying to close factories and move
workers; indeed, even as GM executives have been talking lately
about closing more factories, they still have not followed through
on plans announced in 1992 to close some particularly unprofitable
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler both entrust labor relations to top executives
who report directly to the chief executive officer, while General
Motors' top labor executive is buried three layers lower in the
management of the world's largest auto maker. Partly because of
close relations between Ford executives and union leaders, the
union negotiated national agreements first with Ford in 1993 and
1996 and then demanded that GM and Chrysler accept the same
pattern. Ford has used both opportunities to put GM at a
disadvantage, by negotiating lower wages for newly hired workers at
a time when Ford is hiring thousands of workers and GM is hiring
almost none.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler also make a point of removing factory managers
who cannot get along with workers, while GM tends to transfer them.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with dozens of auto workers around the nation, a
consistent theme is that GM allows less worker involvement in how
its factories are run than do Ford and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Nihla M. Hall is married to a striking GM worker here and has a
brother who works for Ford and a daughter who works for Chrysler.
The consensus in the family, she said, is that Ford and Chrysler
``treat their people a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers on the picket line understand the long-term problem and
many wish their union and GM could get along better. ``A separation
like this gives you a lot of time to think,'' said Geno Gomez, an
assembly line worker who toted a green strike placard on Sunday in
front of a struck auto body parts factory here. ``GM and the UAW
are going to have to get their marriage back on track and run their
house together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts have suggested that GM try to break the UAW
someday, using replacement workers. But that would be extremely
difficult, given that GM has 200,000 workers at more than 100
factories. The strikes here have shown that closing even a couple
of factories can cripple production across North America.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at rival auto makers believe the deal announced today
will make no difference to GM's competitiveness because its
relationship with workers and the union remain so poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think,'' said a top executive from another auto maker
who insisted on anonymity, ``it'll change a thing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the first Viewpoints conference, held earlier this year at
New York University, about two dozen young actors jogged onto a
tiny stage. ``Go!'' ordered the instructor, Barney O'Hanlon, who
was teaching a specific Viewpoints technique.
</P>
<P>
   The actors formed a line and paired off, lunging toward each
other like cartoon city dwellers about to collide. ``Stop!''
O'Hanlon yelled. The pairs of actors paused, noses inches away.
Each pair then quickly turned a near-collision into a confrontation
imagined out of daily life: a man made a woman drop her groceries;
two long-lost friends met; in a schoolyard, a bully hovered
menacingly over a nerd.
</P>
<P>
   Invented in the 1970s by two dance choreographers, Mary Overlie
and Wendell Beavers, Viewpoints has recently become part of the
contentious debate currently going on in America about actor
training.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Konstantin Stanislavsky's Moscow Art Theater visited
the United States in 1923, actor training in this country has
focused mainly on naturalism on the stage. The most extreme form _
and the most influential _ has been the Method, Lee Strasberg's
idiosyncratic interpretation of Stanislavsky's theories emphasizing
psychological realism.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1960s, theater artists who felt constrained by the
Method were searching for non-naturalistic ways to approach acting.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration has come from many directions. Television and film
acting breaks down continuity into staccato moments on camera. The
stylized traditions of Japanese and Indonesian theater, for
example, have allowed performers to explore the use of puppetry and
masks.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like the director and designer Julie Taymor, who employ
a variety of ethnic theatrical styles, have helped popularize
non-Western movement and performance techniques. The American
director Robert Wilson's works, in which movement and sometimes
fragmented text are slowed or speeded up, have influenced a
generation of performers. And the self-conscious ironies of gay
theater have long since entered the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that in the last few years, naturalism has
sometimes seemed unequal to the task of portraying characters on
stage. And there is renewed interest now in discovering ways to
train actors that go beyond the Method.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the theater believe the itch to explore is a
reaction to the longtime dominance of the intense, psychologically
based style preached by Strasberg, who died in 1982. Others argue
that these alternative theories merely reinterpret the Method for a
new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Viewpoints is worlds away from the self-referential style that
Strasberg expounded. Focusing on formal elements, like movement and
space, Viewpoints is both a compositional tool and a series of
actor exercises. Its most recognizable style comes from what its
advocates call ``sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the word, borrowed from computerized digital
technology and used by rap music, means the free juggling of
incongruous dramatic techniques, arcane literary sources, news
articles _ almost any artifact from the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a post-modern way to train actors,'' said Anne Bogart,
the director who has used Viewpoints in work as diverse as Bertolt
Brecht's ``Baal,'' Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``South Pacific'' and
Tennessee Williams' ``Streetcar Named Desire.'' In ``Streetcar,''
Ms. Bogart cast 8 Stanleys and 12 Blanches _ one of whom was a man.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Culture of Desire,'' another theatrical collage, this time
about Andy Warhol, Ms. Bogart stitches together words and texts
from Warhol interviews and writings, Dante's ``Inferno'' and French
literary theory. The production begins previews on Aug. 28 at New
York Theater Workshop in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Many directors maintain that Viewpoints is a long-overdue
correction to what they call the American theater's indifference to
staging. ``Historically, where you stand on stage has generally
been related to where you're going to fix the highball,'' said Jon
Jory, the artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in part because of its emphasis on movement, Viewpoints
is creating excitement. Last year, when New York University was
planning the first Viewpoints conference, about 80 people were
expected. A month before the conference was to begin, registration
had soared to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, theories like Viewpoints are gaining
currency as actors demand a variety of approaches. The biggest bete
noir seems to be that of sticking too rigidly to any one theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas 10 years ago, students wanted to learn one method,''
said Michael Kahn, the director of the drama division at the
Juilliard School, ``today there is no gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   True, there have always been iconoclastic acting teachers. In a
class at the H.B. Studio in Greenwich Village, Uta Hagen watched
her toy poodle lick a morsel of brie from her fingers as she
emphasized that she has never been in the service of any one
theory. ``The point is to bring a human being on stage _ electric,
alive, human,'' declared the actress who played Ophelia in Eva Le
Gallienne's ``Hamlet'' in 1937.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen's point of view seems increasingly popular as teachers
of acting agree that more options are better.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time coming. In the 1940s, Strasberg
developed the Method at the famously exclusive Actors Studio _ a
kind of members-only club that emerged from the ashes of the Group
Theater, the revered Depression-era rep company.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s and 50s, the heyday of stage naturalism and
playwrights like Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, the Method
pushed actors to exploit their inner lives as material for the
characters they played, and it inspired a lot of grittily dazzling
theater and film. Perhaps it was no accident that audiences were
becoming interested in Freud's theories at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But there were complaints that the Method ignored Shakespeare
and movement and too often collapsed into tic-filled performances
that were more appropriate to an analyst's couch than the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible _ a tyranny,'' said Robert Brustein, the
artistic director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge,
Mass., and a longtime critic of the Method. Brustein even wrote a
play, recently produced at ART, excoriating Strasberg.
</P>
<P>
   Acting programs today are reflecting the changes that are under
way in the profession. Until recently, training had been split into
two static categories.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatory and university programs offer regular classes and
semesters that can take two or three years and cost up to $100,000;
graduation means a degree and a union card.
</P>
<P>
   Private studios, on the other hand, for about $5,000 a year,
provide a narrower range of courses, but appeal because the
teachers are often living links _ however distant _ to the hallowed
Group Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, American conservatories and studios alike are trying to
create new theatrical languages, said Jory in Louisville, who
characterized the time as ``the most exciting period in acting in
35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all of this activity, what is an actor to do?
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dundas-Lowe, who received good reviews last season in
New York in the nihilistic English comedy ``Shopping and ...'' by
Mark Ravenhill, is pragmatic. ``It's really about anything that
works,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Jones, a Tony Award winner who starred in Tina Howe's
play ``Pride's Crossing'' last season at Lincoln Center, emphasized
the importance of working with actors from many backgrounds. ``I
learn from my peers more than from any one technique,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As more actors seek a variety of influences, the Method may well
become less central to American acting. In fact, two of the most
popular new approaches to actor training _ Viewpoints and a
technique created by the playwright David Mamet known as Practical
Esthetics _ are cool frontal attacks on Strasberg's concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet himself is so opposed to actor training that in his book
for performers published last year, ``True and False: Heresy and
Common Sense for the Actor,'' he called such training ``nonsense''
and those who teach it ``charlatans.'' Mamet declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright's dislike of actor training programs may be
extreme. However, there is no doubt that actor training in America
has changed because the theater has also. Opportunities to polish
skills in repertory are dwindling. At the same time, tuition costs
of MFA programs are spiraling.
</P>
<P>
   The director JoAnne Akalaitis, who teaches at the Juilliard
School, complains that by the time acting students graduate, ``they
are saddled with enormous debt and have to do boring television
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of Melissa Smith, director of the actor training
program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, such
problems are also forcing acting programs to become more flexible.
``People who are going to work in film, television and theater are
looking for a range of ideas about training,'' she said. ``After
all, the Group is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Moscow Art Theater, which inspired the
formation of the Group Theater during its 1923 visit to New York,
celebrated its 100th anniversary with the troupe's first trip to
the United States since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   One stop was the Actors Studio, where Studio members and Moscow
Art Theater representatives held a summit on the future of acting.
The actresses Lee Grant and Estelle Parsons, now artistic director
of the Studio; the director Arthur Penn, its president, and Anatoly
Smeliansky, the literary manager of the Moscow Art Theater, agreed
that Stanislavsky's tradition has lived on in America through
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   After the Group Theater fell apart in the late 1930s, its
members began to teach. And as the last of these masters die _
Sanford Meisner and Robert Lewis both last year _ Ms. Parsons
worries that the Group's ideas will vanish. ``That's the problem in
the American theater _ we don't record the way we train actors, so
we can't reproduce it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some studios tried to solve that problem by relying on
theatrical dynasties. In the late 1960's, Strasberg set up the
Strasberg Institute as a two-year training program where he could
disseminate on a more regular basis what he taught informally at
the Actors Studio. After his death, his third wife, the actress
Anna Strasberg, took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from around the world want to come to hear what Lee had
to say,'' said Mrs. Strasberg, who teaches a class in directing at
the institute. ``Why change what we do?''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But other studios are leaving the old acting gurus behind. Since
the death in 1992 of Stella Adler, a former Group member, the
studio she founded in 1949 has broadened its focus. ``We're hiring
teachers who never trained with Stella,'' said Tom Oppenheim,
Adler's grandson and the studio's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, the financially ailing Actors Studio is
throwing open its doors. Four years ago, it joined forces with the
New School for Social Research to create a three-year MFA program.
The idea, said Penn, was to give the Studio a regular income while
providing a place to teach for its members, who are scattered all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those associated with the program stress that the Studio is just
part of the picture. ``We teach Stanislavsky's legacy,'' said Sam
Schacht, the director of acting. Penn said the program has gone to
considerable lengths to address complaints about Strasberg's
limitations, adding classes in movement, voice, text analysis and
theatrical styles.
</P>
<P>
   But some who believe the Method has had more influence than it
should on American acting have sought alternatives. ``In general,
American actor training has put too much focus on emotional
authenticity,'' said the playwright Tony Kushner, about the
Method's emphasis on emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, after spending a year at the Neighborhood
Playhouse studying with Sanford Meisner, David Mamet began to teach
a method of acting at New York University with the actor William H.
Macy that they called Practical Esthetics. They wanted a place
where they could teach without the kind of mystery that has
surrounded the Method, Macy said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of these classes grew the Atlantic Theater Company School,
which offered part-time instruction until 1996, when a two-year
program was established several blocks west of where the company
performs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that Mamet boils down American naturalistic
dramaturgy to spare, tough-guy talk, so Practical Esthetics
condenses naturalistic acting into a blunter, street-wise style in
which emotion itself seems excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to not feel the lines, you have to just say
them,'' said Scott Zigler, who directed ``The Old Neighborhood,''
Mamet's recent, critically well-received play on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Although the author has subsequently distanced himself from his
own acting technique by attacking actor training in general, the
faculty at the Atlantic Theater Company School remains faithful to
his original vision: the actor's job on stage is to concern himself
with the action of the character, not to become the character.
Practical Esthetics, whose alumni include Felicity Huffman, Kristen
Johnston and Macy, is highly popular among young actors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCann, who played Deeny, a stoic Mametian heroine in ``The
Old Neighborhood,'' and who teaches acting at the school, said that
Practical Esthetics does not lend itself to categorizing. ``It's
just about good acting,'' she said. But others argue that actors
trained in the theory have a very specific look on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confrontational,'' said Jory, likening it to ``lawyers in
a criminal case pursuing the witness.'' Indeed, some critics argue
that Practical Esthetics works best on the tightly wound dialogues
in Mamet's plays.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brustein, whose ART in Cambridge originally
produced ``The Old Neighborhood'': ``David doesn't believe in
characterization or interpretation. His approach is basically,
`Read my lines.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the NYU conference on Viewpoints, the issue of what it is
exactly arose again and again, with anxious panelists arguing that
it is a method, a compositional tool or an approach to actor
training. Heated disagreements erupted over whether it could work
with classical theatrical texts. There was even debate on how many
Viewpoints exist (some said 12; others 9; still another faction
said 6).
</P>
<P>
   It was, recalled Una Chaudhuri, the chairwoman of the NYU
undergraduate drama department, which sponsored the conference,
strangely reminiscent of the quarrelsome debates that erupted over
the Method in the middle of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Viewpoints is taught widely at universities around the
country, as well as at the Saratoga International Theater Institute
(SITI) _ the actor-training program that Ms. Bogart founded five
years ago with the Japanese director Tadashi Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater critics are skeptical of its results. In a 1995
review of ``Small Lives/Big Dreams,'' Ms. Bogart's adaptation of
five Chekhov plays, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times: ``The
approach is, finally, reductionist, turning all dialogue into a
homogenized series of epitaphs for an age.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Bogart believes that Viewpoints is an ideal
tool for creating theatrical irony, which, in terms of describing
contemporary life, gives it an edge that psychologically based
training lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a fragmented world and so our actor training
has to be fragmented,'' Ms. Bogart says.

POLISH POET ZBIGNIEW HERBERT DIES AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
  (With sidebar, OBIT-HERBERT-POETRY) 
(rl) 
 By HARVEY SHAPIRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zbigniew Herbert, the Polish poet and essayist who insisted that
civilization depended on artists' staking out clear moral positions
resistant to the winds of history and ideology, died Tuesday in
Warsaw. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not disclosed, but a longtime friend and
fellow poet, Krzysztof Karasek, said Herbert had asthma and serious
circulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, a 1996 Nobel laureate, told the
PAP news agency that Herbert was a ``great artist and thinker'' and
that he would have an eternal place in Polish literature.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert's poetry defied categorization. It spoke for no
philosophy or school and favored no party or dogma. Although he was
a political poet who explored the mechanisms of power and ideology,
he resisted fascism and communism, nationalism and the church and
was willing to pay the price for such moral independence. He gave
the impression of being a man alone, answerable to no one except
his own conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Place and history determined Herbert's career as a poet. He
lived much of his adult life under the ideologies of national
socialism and communism. The impingement of the political, the
political becoming personal, informed all of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert was a witness to the chaos of the 20th century, and
brought to it a mind trained in law and disciplined by classical
literature. It was a mind that would not succumb to self-pity or
nostalgia, a mind steeled against chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pebble,'' one of his best-known poems, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pebbles cannot be tamed
</P>
<P>
   to the end they will look at us
</P>
<P>
   with a calm and very clear eye''
</P>
<P>
   Those lines could describe his stance as a writer. Poet Robert
Hass once said that Herbert wrote as if it were ``the task of the
poet, in a world full of loud lies, to say what is irreducibly true
in a level voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert was born in the city of Lvov, then part of Poland and
now in Ukraine, in 1924. (The name Herbert is pronounced as in
English; in fact, Herbert claimed 17th-century English poet George
Herbert as a distant relation.) In 1939, as a 15-year-old, he
experienced the annexation of his hometown by the Soviet Union.
When the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact collapsed, the city was then
seized by the Germans. At the end of the war it was recaptured by
the Soviet Union, which retained control over the Baltic republics.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert wrote his first poems during the Nazi occupation of
Poland. As Stanislaw Baranczak, a critic who teaches at Harvard
University, has observed, ``The image of a city under siege, one of
the several symbols that constantly recur in his work, has a
historical poignancy that makes it much more than just a figure of
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert took part in the Polish resistance to the Nazi
occupiers. When the war ended, he enrolled at the University of
Kracow, where he received a master's degree in economics. Later he
earned a law degree from Nicolas Copernicus University and a degree
in philosophy from the University of Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Stalinist restrictions on writers after the war, and Herbert's
refusal to bend to communist dogma and the party functionaries in
the Writers' Union, impeded the publication of his poetry for 15
years. During that period he developed his distinctive voice, a
style, as author Eva Hoffman has written, ``that functions as a
sort of antidote to the dangers of sentimentality or inflation _
restrained, ironic, stripped of punctuation, averse to `tricks of
the imagination' and passionate in its insistence on precision.''
</P>
<P>
   His first three volumes of poetry, ``A String of Light'' (1956),
``Hermes, a Dog and a Star'' (1957) and ``The Study of an Object''
(1961), established him as a dominant figure in Polish literature.
His search for moral and humanistic values would make a strong
impression on his contemporaries and earn him an international
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Many poems in those books also appear in the volumes of his
poetry available in English: ``Selected Poems,'' translated by
Czeslaw Milosz and Peter Dale Scott (Ecco Press, 1986); ``Selected
Poems'' (Oxford Press, 1977), translated by John and Bodgana
Carpenter; ``Report From the Besieged City,'' translated by the
Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1985), and ``Mr. Cogito,'' also translated
by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1993).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herbert was a modernist in that he wrote in free form, without
rhyme and meter. He was an antimodernist in that his work
frequently jumped off from Greek myth, Shakespeare and the Latin
poets, and in his refusal to ape chaos. In an essay in praise of
the great Dutch painters of the 17th century, he explained, ``A
major part of contemporary art declares itself on the side of
chaos, gesticulates in a void or tells the story of its own barren
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this attitude, he posed the painters of that period in
the Netherlands, who ``believed in the purposefulness of their work
and the possibility of interhuman communication. They affirmed
visible reality with an inspired scrupulousness.'' And they did
that, he maintained, ``as if the order of the world and the
revolution of the stars, the permanence of the firmament, depended
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is nothing in Herbert's poetry to suggest that a
traditional, conventional art, one imitating the art of the past,
could carry today's meanings. On the contrary, in one of his
strongest poems, ``Apollo and Marsyas,'' he describes how pain can
dictate a new art. Marsyas, a mortal in the myth on which the poem
is based, loses a musical contest to Apollo, the Greek god of
beauty, who signifies classical control (``absolute ear/versus
immense range''). Apollo punishes Marsyas for daring to challenge
his authority by flaying him alive. Describing Marsyas' pain,
Herbert writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``only seemingly
</P>
<P>
   is the voice of Marsyas
</P>
<P>
   monotonous
</P>
<P>
   and composed of a single vowel
</P>
<P>
   Aaa
</P>
<P>
   in reality
</P>
<P>
   Marsyas relates
</P>
<P>
   the inexhaustible wealth
</P>
<P>
   of his body
</P>
<P>
   bald mountains of liver
</P>
<P>
   white ravines of aliment''
</P>
<P>
   As Apollo departs to that sound, he wonders ``whether out of
Marsyas' howling/there will not someday arise/a new kind/ of art
... ''
</P>
<P>
   And to describe the effect of that art, Herbert writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``suddenly
</P>
<P>
   at his feet
</P>
<P>
   falls a petrified nightingale
</P>
<P>
   he looks back
</P>
<P>
   and sees that the hair of the tree to which
</P>
<P>
   Marsyas was fastened
</P>
<P>
   is white
</P>
<P>
   completely''
</P>
<P>
   And so the poem ends, moving the myth completely into the 20th
century. The pared-down rhetoric, its terse description, is
classical (seen with Apollo's eye) but the poem is savage, because
it was written in a savage time and because its author believed
that art must find a way to reconcile beauty with the reality of
human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert's stark rhetoric is more than a stylistic
characteristic. It signals a moral concern, openly stated in many
of his poems, that the path to such reconciliation is to see the
world clearly, steadily, with an eye toward understanding it and
then writing about it truthfully. His poem ``Mr. Cogito and the
Imagination,'' for example, begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cogito never trusted
</P>
<P>
   tricks of the imagination
</P>
<P>
   the piano at the top of the Alps
</P>
<P>
   played false concerts for him''
</P>
<P>
   (He took ``the piano at the top of the Alps'' from Rimbaud's
``Illuminations,'' a source of the surreal in modern art.)
</P>
<P>
   Later in the poem Herbert focuses on his theme:
</P>
<P>
   ``he adored tautologies
</P>
<P>
   explanations
</P>
<P>
   idem per idem
</P>
<P>
   that a bird is a bird
</P>
<P>
   slavery means slavery
</P>
<P>
   a knife is a knife
</P>
<P>
   death remains death''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cogito inhabits many of Herbert's poems, a character in
search of moral certainties. He is an ordinary man who enjoys
reading trashy newspaper stories and who fails when he tries
transcendental meditation: ``his stream of consciousness brings up
detritus like a tin can.'' He is also Herbert's mouthpiece, a way
of distancing himself from himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cogito poems Herbert became his own subject, but they are
not confessional poems in the tradition of Robert Lowell, Sylvia
Plath and Anne Sexton. They do not dramatize the ego; they
dramatize a mind and the way it looks at the world. Ultimately,
they return us to the world, as do all of Herbert's poems, and the
search for what is durable in our lives, for what is attainable.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Envoy of Mr. Cogito,'' he appears to be looking back on
his life in Poland during the long years of war and repression. It
begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``Go where those others went to the dark boundary
</P>
<P>
   for the golden fleece of nothing-ness your last prize
</P>
<P>
   go upright among those who are
</P>
<P>
   on their knees
</P>
<P>
   among those with their backs
</P>
<P>
   turned and those toppled in the
</P>
<P>
   dust
</P>
<P>
   you were saved not in order to live
</P>
<P>
   you have little time you must give testimony''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert was co-editor of a poetry journal, Poezja, from 1965 to
1968 but resigned in protest of anti-Semitic policies. He traveled
widely through the West and lived in Paris, Berlin and the United
States, where he taught briefly at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   His essay collection ``Barbarian in the Garden,'' translated by
Michael March and Jaroslaw Anders (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,
1985), depicts the poet as a barbarian from the Slavic world
traveling through the ``garden'' countries of Western Europe. In
another essay collection, ``Still Life With a Bridle,'' translated
by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1991), he goes in search of the
Dutch bourgeois in the golden age of Dutch culture, the 17th
century.
</P>
<P>
   After a break of several years from writing, Herbert, who is
survived by his wife, Katarzyna, wrote new poems in 1997 when his
health improved slightly. The result was ``Storm's Epilogue,''
published this year.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert once gave this advice to younger writers: ``Life is more
complicated, more mysterious and more convoluted than the party,
the army, the police. Let us detach ourselves a little from this
truly horrible everyday reality and try to write about doubt,
anxiety and despair.'' &QL;

HONG KONG FILM: EXIT THE DRAGON?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It's opening night for ``Young and Dangerous: The
Prequel,'' a follow-up to one of the most successful Hong Kong
movies of 1997, but the South China Theater in the busy Mong Kok
neighborhood of Kowloon is practically empty.
</P>
<P>
   As the lights dim, there are 35 people seated in a theater built
for more than 1,000. ``It's not too bad,'' says Ryan Law, a walking
encyclopedia of Hong Kong film who runs an Internet site called the
Hong Kong Movie Database, as he surveys the audience. ``I've seen
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the movie starts, a preview of Disney's ``Mulan'' flashes
across the screen. ``This is terrible,'' complains Tim Youngs, who
runs his own World Wide Web site about Hong Kong film. ``I've never
known this theater to screen a Hollywood film before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young and Dangerous: The Prequel'' is the sixth installment in
a series of youth-gone-wild gangster films to be released in the
last two years. This movie, like most of the others in the series,
was made in about a month, and the audience at the opening can
tell. They don't laugh; they don't gasp.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant noise in the theater is the ringing of cell phones
and the beeping of pagers. Other than repeated stabs at the
Communist government _ ``You're as rude as the Communists,'' says a
police receptionist _ there's virtually no substance to this
formulaic movie.
</P>
<P>
   After they leave the theater, Law and and Youngs walk across the
street to a shopping center called Chic. Off the escalator is a
tiny white storefront. Its walls are lined with illegal VCD's _
movies recorded onto compact disks _ in plastic wrappers. Inside
the store and waiting outside to get in, there are more people than
were at ``Young and Dangerous: The Prequel.''
</P>
<P>
   VCDs of ``Young and Dangerous: The Prequel,'' along with dozens
of other new as well as not-yet-released films, are on sale here
for $2.50 in American dollars, less than half the price of a movie
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like the quality,'' says the guy running the
stall, ``you can bring them back and exchange them for something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Within this all-too-common anecdote _ and within the space of
two hours spent watching just about any Hong Kong movie these days
_ can be found nearly everything that's killing the film industry
here. Until just a few years ago, Hong Kong films were among the
most exciting things happening in cinema, and Hong Kong was second
only to Hollywood in exporting movies.
</P>
<P>
   Talented directors were casting charismatic stars in movies that
were by turns stylishly violent, breathtakingly magical,
beautifully tender or balletically humorous.
</P>
<P>
   And those films were not just selling out theaters in Asia but
were being featured in festivals in the United States and, in the
case of Jackie Chan action-comedies, actually beating out Hollywood
blockbusters at the American box office.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Hong Kong-style art direction, action choreography and
even plot elements began to appear in American films, most
blatantly in Quentin Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs'' in 1992. Today,
nearly every action film released by Hollywood is influenced by
Hong Kong. In fact, they're often directed by a Hong Kong star gone
to Hollywood, like John Woo (``Broken Arrow,'' ``Face/Off'').
</P>
<P>
   But as Hollywood discovered Hong Kong film, events leading up to
fiascos like the premiere of ``Young and Dangerous: The Prequel''
were being set in motion. Some blame it on Steven Spielberg. In
1993, ``Jurassic Park'' became the first foreign film to come in
No. 1 at the box office in Hong Kong since before the days of Bruce
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After that, audiences here began to flock to Hollywood films,
especially ones filled with special effects, and ignore ones made
in Hong Kong, which were becoming schlocky imitation
cops-and-gangsters flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse was the incursion of real gangsters _
organized crime, or the so-called triads _ into the Hong Kong movie
business. Film executives were murdered; stars were forced to
accept roles in triad-backed productions. Then came the pirate-VCD
market, which has robbed the Hong Kong industry of an estimated 40
percent of its business, forcing theater and video rental chains to
close.
</P>
<P>
   As if things weren't bad enough, the Asian economic downturn
hit, slashing movie budgets and destroying crucial ancillary
markets and sources of investment in places like South Korea and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sticking around to help clean up the mess, many of
Hong Kong's biggest stars fled for a better shore. Actors like Chow
Yun-Fat (``Replacement Killers'') have pledged not to return until
they see better scripts. At last count, there were at least 17 Hong
Kong actors and directors working on projects in Hollywood _ from
Jet Li in ``Lethal Weapon 4'' to Woo directing Tom Cruise in
``Mission Impossible 2'' to Michelle Yeoh landing a starring role
in ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   And where Hong Kong directors once remade Hollywood hits, now
Hollywood is remaking Hong Kong films. Jim Carrey, for example,
just agreed to remake the Hong Kong comedy ``God of Cookery,'' with
the Hong Kong star Stephen Chiau as director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like paintings left in the sun,'' Bey Logan, a
producer and screenwriter and the author of ``Hong Kong Action
Movies,'' says of Hong Kong films. ``They keep getting paler and
paler.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year since the British handed control of Hong Kong
over to China, and although this transition doesn't seem to have
intimidated directors politically, it has led many of them to gear
their films toward mainland China in the belief that the last hope
for Hong Kong cinema is to find an audience in China.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, China lets in only 10 foreign films a year _ and it
still considers Hong Kong a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except during World War II, when the film industry came to a
total stop during the Japanese invasion, it's never been as bad as
it is now,'' says Paul Fonoroff, a film critic for The South China
Morning Post who has reviewed more than 700 Hong Kong films since
1988. ``I think the film industry is over as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers left in Hong Kong are no less pessimistic.
Sitting in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel in the Wanchai
neighborhood, Gordon Chan, a top Hong Kong director who has made
movies with Jet Li (``Fist of Legend'') and Jackie Chan
(``Thunderbolt''), has all the time in the world, a fact that's
very depressing to a director who once cranked out three films a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Chan's most recent movie, the police action drama ``Beast
Cops,'' is generally acknowledged as one of the best Hong Kong
films of 1998. But that apparently isn't going to do him any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to the company that released it, and they said
they lost money on it,'' says Chan, a skinny man with a thin black
goatee. ``They told me it wasn't my fault, I did a good film. But
still it lost money. So what's happening? It's really alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already cutting staff salary at a very quick rate,'' he
continues. ``I cut almost 75 percent of my salary. Remember the
scene with the car chase between the Hummer and the bus? We're so
poor that we borrowed the Hummer and we borrowed the bus, and there
was no budget for any car chase and especially no budget for any
car crash. So we had to use special effects to do the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished a film at a little more than 10 million Hong Kong
dollars'' _ $1.3 million in American dollars _ ``and still it lost.
It's very disappointing, especially when everybody came to me and
said, `Wow, that was great, I saw it on pirate VCD.' That really
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Hong Kong movies took in about $153 million in American
dollars at the box office. Though ticket prices have practically
doubled here since, annual income has dropped by more than half, to
just under $72 million in 1997. As a result, average film budgets
have shrunk from several million American dollars to as little as
$200,000 or $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the announcement of a feature production starring a
popular actor brought in so much money from other Asian markets
that the film was profitable before a single frame had been shot.
As a result, directors got lazy and shot films without scripts, and
all-purpose pop stars like Andy Lau appeared in as many as 12
movies a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the triads became heavily involved in the industry,
pressuring stars to appear in films for which they were providing
the money. Actors and other film professionals who refused to
cooperate were reportedly kidnapped, raped and even, in the case of
two producers, killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the triads are more interested in making money from VCD
sales than in film production, and the industry is looking
desperately for new sources of investment now that gangster, local
film studio and foreign money has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually anyone with money to invest _ bankers, construction
workers _ can finance a film by a major director. Gordon Chan, for
example, says that his next film is being paid for by the
management team of a factory.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to fight this state of affairs, Chan and four
other directors have formed a group called Creative Alliance. The
organization is trying to find new sources of revenue so that they
can regain control of their films and focus on restoring the
standards of Hong Kong film and bringing audiences back into the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is give alternatives,'' says Chan.
``But to be honest, we are not very optimistic. We still think the
market is going to go lower because so much less money is being
invested in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to sustain a film industry, and there's no
point in rushing to the production line with more movies that are
going to be pirated. We need to wait and see what's happening and
then find the solutions. The Creative Alliance is to tell everybody
that in the meantime we're still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Back across the harbor, in Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood,
Clarence Fok, the director of the cult-classic film ``Naked
Killer,'' sits and stares at his latest work on an Avid editing
machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the monitor, two characters sit across from each other in a
room bathed in lime green and deep purple. One fires a gun from
underneath a glass table, and as shards of glass scatter in slow
motion, a bullet hits the other man in the forehead. He stares at
the camera for a moment, then topples over, with blood squirting
thickly out of the wound.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant, denim-clad Fok watches the scene raptly and then
announces proudly, ``Cheap.''

BROWNS OWNERSHIP RACE REALLY AN AUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   D/FW AIRPORT, Texas _ For all the talk about tradition and fans
and experience, the NFL yesterday made its position regarding the
battle for ownership of the new Cleveland Browns clear.
</P>
<P>
   Money talks.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was no coincidence that at his news conference
after yesterday's NFL owners meeting at the Hyatt D/FW West,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue was accompanied by Eric Grubman,
managing director of the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, there are features other than price,''
Grubman said. ``I can assure you, however, in establishing an open
and level playing field, the primary feature for establishing
front-runners in this is indeed value.''
</P>
<P>
   To maximize that value, the NFL has turned the ownership race
into an auction and is prepared to award the Browns, who will take
the field in 1999, to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   And how high might that winning bid have to be? Three hundred
million dollars? Five hundred million? A billion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn right,'' San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos said when
asked if the team is worth $1 billion. ``In my mind, a billion is
not unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   While a significant faction of owners, including the Cowboys'
Jerry Jones and Tampa Bay's Malcolm Glazer, share that view, others
scoff at such astronomical figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation out there,'' Denver Broncos owner
Pat Bowlen said, ``but a billion is way out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the league will try to drive the price as high as
possible with a series of escalating bids from among the six groups
that have announced their intention to own the Browns, as well as
several others that have chosen to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins at another meeting on Aug. 19 in either
Dallas or Chicago, at which the contenders will be invited to make
presentations to the 30 NFL owners. Tagliabue said he expects to
name an owner for the Browns in early September, and the winner
will likely be the one with the biggest check.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to make Alfred Lerner, who has recently added former
San Francisco 49ers president Carmen Policy to his ownership group,
the favorite, thanks to his estimated net worth of $2.5 billion.
Other bidders include billionaire Howard Milstein, Cleveland
Indians owner Dick Jacobs and a group led by brothers Charles and
Larry Dolan that features Don Shula and Bill Cosby. A group that
includes former Cowboys running back Calvin Hill still might be in
the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them would make excellent owners for the Browns,''
Jones said. ``This thing is going to be resolved on the basis of
who wants to make the biggest financial commitment. Ultimately, it
will go to the owner who wants it the most. Whoever wants to make
that kind of commitment will be the best owner.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, owners also approved a plan for stocking the
Browns. Tagliabue said the Browns will get at least 30 veteran
players from other teams and 14 extra draft picks in their first
two years, including next year's first overall pick.

 HONG KONG: proudly, ``Cheap.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Chan, Fok's stunt choreographer, shakes his head. ``I can
create 10 good scenes like that,'' he says. ``But all they have the
money for now is two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time when annual film production here has been cut in half
(from more than 200 films five years ago to fewer than 80), Fok is
still busy. Producers like him because he comes in on budget, he
gives the people what they want (sexy women and stylized gunplay),
and he works fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fok plans to crank out five films, spending two
months on each and giving them titles like ``A Better Tomorrow 98''
and ``Naked Killer 2'' to capitalize on past Hong Kong successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of them like exercises,'' he says of the movies. ``Out
of these five experiments _ all are sensational with sex, seduction
and violence _ I want to work toward something new. Then I want to
spend some time in America and learn more about stunts, effects and
camera movements so I can go into another stage of my filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   His one-man plan to save the Hong Kong film business also
involves searching China for a young male actor and molding him
into a new martial-arts star.
</P>
<P>
   Fok is one of the lucky filmmakers remaining here. In this
financial and artistic recession, he gets his scripts and money
from one of the few people in Hong Kong film who still has access
to money: Wong Jing. Jing is a populist director and producer who
helped turn the work of innovative Hong Kong filmmakers like John
Woo and Tsui Hark into likable and successful, albeit formulaic,
movies.
</P>
<P>
   As his colleagues jumped ship for the cash and cachet of
Hollywood, he stayed behind to become the king of Hong Kong film.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, ``The Storm Riders,'' a special effects-filled film
he produced, actually beat the record set by ``Jurassic Park: The
Lost World'' for first-day ticket sales. With a budget of $10
million, it is a Hong Kong equivalent of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The other hope for Hong Kong cinema this year is ``Enter the
Eagles,'' the debut of Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce. Where
``The Storm Riders'' is attempting to steal an audience back by
imitating Hollywood special effects, ``Enter the Eagles'' is trying
to emulate another Hollywood approach: a glitzy marketing campaign
meant to turn a film into an event, the result of a new deal
between Hong Kong's biggest studio, Golden Harvest, and the
marketing company DBB.
</P>
<P>
   Though it might seem as if these companies have deep pockets,
the truth is that Golden Harvest reported a $6 million dollar loss
in the first half of this year and last month laid off 70
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jackie Chan, Hong Kong's perennial action star, is
suffering in Hong Kong. About to appear in the United States with
Chris Tucker in ``Rush Hour,'' he's hoping he can gain some new
knowledge to help reinvigorate Hong Kong movies.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he is offering $130,000 to anyone who can write him a
good script. Good scripts, an element lacking even in some of the
best Hong Kong films, are what many feel will help restore audience
faith in Hong Kong films _ especially because they cost a lot less
than special effects, an arena in which Hong Kong will never really
be able to compete with Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The bright side of this grim situation is that the defections to
Hollywood and the shrinking budgets have created an atmosphere in
which younger directors and actors have a chance to compete _ and
to be creative with their art direction and camerawork.
</P>
<P>
   Wong Kar-Wai, the director of visually innovative, cerebral
films like ``Chungking Express'' and the recent ``Happy Together,''
has gained enough international prominence to keep working
regularly. But beyond him, young, talented directors like Fruit
Chan, Eric Kot and Wai Ka-Fai are coming into their own, making
either experimental narratives or offbeat portraits of youth
culture.
</P>
<P>
   But this burst of originality may be too late. Already, the
period of Hong Kong film from the late 1980s to the early 90s has
been categorized and filed away as ``the golden age of Hong Kong
film,'' as if it were the equivalent of the New Wave for France.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that Hong Kong films will flourish once again as soon
as the economy in Asia improves and a handful of new stars and
auteurs appear. But most industry insiders here are pessimistic,
believing that Hong Kong will become like Taiwan or Mexico, just
another Third World country from which a movie or director of note
occasionally emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are hard,'' says Richard To, the head of the Hong Kong
Film Critics Society. ``And the future is still very unclear. A lot
depends on whether the mainland Chinese market will be more open
than now to Hong Kong films. And a lot matters on whether pirate
VCDs can be stopped. Otherwise, there's simply no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best evidence of this comes during an elevator
conversation with the assistant of a Hong Kong director. Asked if
he wants to become a director, he replies quickly, ``No way.''
After a few seconds of silence, he shyly adds, ``Are you interested
in buying a digital camera while you're here? I can sell you one
for very cheap.''

FPA'S FALL SPELLS TROUBLE FOR HMOs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Local HMOs are still scrambling to reassign
thousands of patients and hundreds of physicians displaced last
week by the bankruptcy of FPA Medical Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Since the nation's No. 2 physician management group announced
July 19 that it was unable to meet its financial obligations,
managed-care companies including Foundation Health Systems,
CareAmerica Health Plans and WellPoint Health Networks -- all based
in suburban Woodland Hills -- have sought to cut their dependence
on the firm.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based FPA represents tens of thousands of physicians
nationally and is paid by HMOs to care for their members. With FPA
in financial trouble and thousands of FPA-affiliated physicians due
back pay from the company, stability-seeking HMOs have been
shifting members from FPA to other physician groups.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, members have been able to remain with the same
doctor, because most physicians are affiliated with more than one
group. In such a case, if a member's HMO cuts ties with FPA, their
doctor essentially switches hats to one of the other physician
groups to which he or she belongs.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to distance themselves from the faltering physician
management group, some HMOs moved faster than others. CareAmerica
Health Plans, a subsidiary of the nonprofit Blue Shield of
California, canceled its contract with FPA three weeks ago when
rumors first began to spread that FPA physicians were refusing to
treat patients until they were paid by the company for past work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision was that their administrative and financial
difficulties could jeopardize our members' access to care, so we
terminated the contract,'' said CareAmerica spokesman Ross
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Though the switch was seamless for most of CareAmerica's 55,000
members, about 200 had to be assigned a new primary-care physician
and hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Health Systems, which in California operates the
HealthNet HMO, last week began shifting 24,000 members in Los
Angeles and Ventura counties away from FPA. About 1,300 of those
people are being reassigned to new physicians, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential HealthCare is moving about 20,000 members away from
FPA, though it is unclear how many will need new doctors, said
Prudential spokeswoman Peggy Lyle.
</P>
<P>
   At WellPoint's Blue Cross of California, about 10,000 of the
company's 50,000 FPA-affiliated members will have to be reassigned
to new doctors, said Blue Cross spokeswoman Elise Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, Blue Cross has received inquiries from
about 200 physicians left stranded by FPA's bankruptcy. The
doctors, who depended on FPA for the bulk of their income, are now
scrambling to affiliate themselves with other physician groups that
contract with Blue Cross, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to meet them as quickly as we can,'' she said.
``We're very busy handling that.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one case, FPA's bankruptcy has been a dream come
true for an HMO member. Northridge resident Gerald Lustig, a
retired microscope repairman, had been wrestling with FPA
management to approve treatment of several open sores on his legs
resulting from chronic diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we went to get authorization from FPA, they refused
it,'' said Lustig's wife, Janet. Knowing that untreated sores in
diabetics can require amputation, the family had resigned
themselves to paying for treatment out of pocket at a specialty
wound center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we found out FPA went bankrupt,'' Janet Lustig
said. The family's HMO, Los Angeles-based Maxicare, reassigned them
to a new physician with the Facey Medical Group. That doctor
admitted her husband to a local hospital and began aggressive
treatment of the sores and several other ailments afflicting him,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only been with Facey Medical this past week, but we're
impressed,'' Janet Lustig said. ``I still have no idea why (FPA)
refused to pay.''

BELL ATLANTIC, GTE AGREE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local phone company,
announced its $52.9 billion acquisition of GTE Corp. Tuesday, but
critical questions began to mount about its structure and
significance to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme coming from the companies Tuesday was that the
deal would be a true merger of equals, despite its financial setup
as Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE.
</P>
<P>
   That is a fairly standard thing for companies in takeovers to
say, but in the case of Bell Atlantic and GTE the facts actually do
appear to support the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell Atlantic's shareholders would own most of the
combined carrier, each company would appoint an equal number of
directors. Ivan Seidenberg, who is scheduled to be promoted from
chief executive of Bell Atlantic to chairman on Jan. 1, agreed to
wait until 2004 to become chairman of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Charles Lee, GTE's chairman, would hold the top job.
Seidenberg would share the post of chief executive with Lee until
2002, when Seidenberg would take over the entire job.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing the concept of a merger of equals, GTE agreed that
its shareholders would not receive a premium for their stock.
</P>
<P>
   The companies agreed that GTE's shareholders would receive 1.22
shares of Bell Atlantic for each GTE share. Based on Bell
Atlantic's closing share price Monday of $45, that made the deal
worth $54.90 for each share of GTE.
</P>
<P>
   GTE's shares closed Monday at $55.75.
</P>
<P>
   The companies pointed out that the ratio of 1.22 accurately
reflected the comparative valuation that the market had placed on
the two companies. As part of their negotiations the companies
produced a chart showing that over the year ended July 17, GTE's
shares traded at an average price 1.19 times that of Bell
Atlantic's. Over the final month of that period the ratio was 1.22.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic would also assume GTE's debt of about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said shareholders of both companies would realize
a premium as the combined entity accelerated its growth of revenue
and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the Northeast's dominant local phone company, has
been itching to get into the markets for long-distance calling and
advanced data services, where GTE is growing quickly. GTE has
wanted to expand geographically beyond its local telephone base,
which is highly rural.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Bell Atlantic had challenges, and
the biggest challenge was our revenue growth,'' Seidenberg said
Tuesday in a joint interview with Lee at Bell Atlantic's New York
City headquarters. (Last year Bell Atlantic posted a 3.6 percent
gain in revenue over 1996, while GTE's sales grew by 9 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do in this transaction is address the No. 1 issue
that we have in terms of accelerating the growth of our company,''
Seidenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said: ``Our biggest challenge was to get a big urban center
that served Fortune 500 companies. There is no company better in
the world to do that than Bell Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the deal would allow them to save $2 billion
in annual costs and generate an additional $2 billion in annual
revenue within three years. That would help the combined company,
which would take a new name that has not been determined, to
consistently increase its annual per-share earnings by 15 percent
after three years, Lee and Seidenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street was not happy with the deal, with many analysts
and investors saying GTE's shareholders deserved a premium.
</P>
<P>
   GTE's shares fell $2.6875, to $53.625, on the New York Stock
Exchange while Bell Atlantic's shares lost 68.75 cents, closing at
$44.3125.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at Paine Webber,
said he had upgraded his recommendation for GTE stock to a buy, but
that did not mean he was thrilled with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``GTE gives its equity away at a discount and the larger
company, Bell Atlantic, can't even keep management control in order
to do it,'' he said. ``It's not a beautiful deal for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mahoney, manager of the AIM Global Telecommunications
Fund, which owns 675,000 shares of GTE and 350,000 shares of Bell
Atlantic, said, ``I think Bell Atlantic is getting a steal on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cynic in me says that it's because Chuck Lee wanted to
preserve his job as chairman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee denied that, but the perception that his job was a key part
of the negotiations was widespread on Wall Street. In fact, people
close to the negotiations said GTE had been approached about a
possible merger by BellSouth Corp., and that one reason that deal
did not happen was that Lee and F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's
chairman, disagreed on who would run the company.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth was also approached about a possible merger by SBC
Communications Inc., but similar issues arose between Ackerman and
Edward Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman, according to people close to
the talks. SBC ended up agreeing to acquire Ameritech Corp. earlier
this year for $62 billion after Richard Notebaert, Ameritech's
chairman, agreed to cede authority to Whitacre.
</P>
<P>
   The low price for GTE's shares fueled speculation that an
unsolicited bidder for GTE, perhaps BellSouth, could emerge. To
help thwart that possibility, Bell Atlantic and GTE agreed on a
breakup fee of around $1.85 billion and exchanged options to buy 10
percent of each other's outstanding stock at pre-deal prices.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise of the options would dilute the shares of any other
company that tried to bid for GTE and could scuttle another
company's ability to use the pooling of interests method of merger
accounting. Pooling allows an acquirer to avoid taking charges
against future earnings to cover the difference between what it
pays and the acquired company's assessed value.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians also expressed wariness, fearing that the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 had not produced the broad
competition that its backers promised.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate antitrust subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Herb
Kohl of Wisconsin, said that since the act became law, ``we have
had lots of consolidation but not a whole lot of competition. If
this trend continues unabated, you can be sure that next year
Congress will consider cracking open the Telecom Act like a raw egg
_ that is, if the Telecom Act still matters.'' &QL;

7-28 -- Liz Kaplan should not be alive. As an infant she developed
a rare cancerous tumor within her pelvis. She survived surgery,
chemotherapy, and more surgery only to discover in 1985 that she
had been transfused with HIV-infected blood. Twenty-five patients
received the same blood, and today all but two of them are dead.
``I feel very sad that they all died,'' she says. ``It's very
strange to feel I am connected to all these dead babies, but I am.
So maybe part of them is in me.'' (Suzanne Kreiter/Boston Globe

Horseneck Beach. Blackledge's son Matthew, who died of HIV tainted
blood transfusion, spent many happy hours on the beach. By the time
doctors discovered that the blood was tainted, 15 patients had

behalf of Matthew generated a $500,000 settlement from Boston's
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where the blood originated. ``It was
horrifying,'' Blackledge says. ``You realize you cannot save your
kid.'' (Wendy Maeda/Boston Globe Photo)

JUDGE THROWS OUT SUIT AGAINST MCDERMOTT IN TAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With harsh words for both sides, a federal judge
Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit against Rep. Jim McDermott, saying
McDermott's alleged role in leaking an illegally recorded phone
conversation among Republican leaders was protected by the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, who has declined to say what part he played in
providing tapes of the call to newspapers, remains under
investigation by the Justice Department in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan was
particularly critical of McDermott. He said the Seattle Democrat's
alleged actions, although legal, were troubling, and that his
successful legal arguments undermine the nation's anti-wiretapping
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that a United States representative, who had
chosen a position that supposedly illuminated him as a beacon of
ethical behavior, should so eagerly seek to capitalize on the
skullduggery of would-be party operatives to win petty, partisan
victories in the press,'' Hogan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1982 by
President Reagan, was clearly impatient with both sides in the
case, which was brought against McDermott by House Republican
Conference Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case arises out of the unfortunate acrimony, absence of
civility and shortage of honor that pervades the partisan sniping
between some members of Congress and their supporters,'' Hogan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a Dec. 21, 1996, conference call between
Boehner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and other Republican leaders
discussing how to respond to an ethics committee ruling against
Gingrich. Boehner, who was vacationing in Florida at the time,
participated in the conversation from a cellular telephone. The
call was intercepted on a police scanner and taped by a Florida
couple active in Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The couple eventually provided the tape to McDermott, who was
then the ranking Democrat on the House ethics committee. Two days
later a story relying on the tape appeared on the front page of The
New York Times. The newspaper said it had obtained the tape from a
Democrat hostile to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida couple, Alice and John Martin, pleaded guilty to
unlawful interception of Boehner's phone call, and each was fined
$500.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott declined requests for an interview Tuesday, and his
attorneys could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner said he was disappointed, and would consider an filing
an appeal of the legal case or a complaint against McDermott to the
House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Mr. McDermott acted unethically in this case is no longer
in doubt,'' Boehner said. ``We will continue to pursue justice in
this case, and we will insist that Mr. McDermott be held fully
accountable for his reprehensible, cynical and unethical actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Hogan held that McDermott's free speech rights,
protected by the Constitution, outweigh Boehner's right to privacy,
protected by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment prevents the government from punishing the
disclosure of truthful, lawfully obtained information of public
significance,'' Hogan ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is largely blind to motives ... and it
offers protection not only to the noble, but also to the ignoble,''
Hogan wrote. ``Thus, Rep. McDermott's actions are protected under
the Amendment, and the court must grant his motion to dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan noted that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act makes
it illegal to disclose the contents of an illegally tape recorded
telephone call, but not to be the recipient of such a disclosure.
He ruled that once McDermott had legally obtained the tape
recording, his alleged disclosure of the tape was an act of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was clearly uncomfortable with his own conclusions, saying
that the effect of First Amendment protections on cellular
telephone privacy laws are ``illogical,'' and saying that
McDermott's successful legal arguments ``lay siege to the
protections against illicit wiretapping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(McDermott's) theory is a slippery one, as it not only
defends, but even encourages, the circumnavigation of wiretap
statutes, which are designed to prevent the disclosure of private
conversations,'' Hogan wrote. ``Under (McDermott's) theory, the
state has no means to prevent disclosure of private information,
because criminals like the Martins can literally launder illegally
intercepted information.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan went on to say that the sentence imposed on the Martins
was ``almost laughable'' and that because of the ``loophole''
exploited by McDermott ``the effect of the (Electronic
Communications Privacy) statute is diluted into nothingness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan had only minimal sympathy for Boehner's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances of the present case suggest that the
government interest in protecting the privacy of this particular
plaintiff (Boehner), in this particular situation, is diminished,''
Hogan said. ``(Boehner) seeks less to strike a blow for his
personal privacy rights than he does to fire a salvo in the
partisan battle between rival groups in the House of
Representatives.''

MOST WORKERS EMBRACE GM SETTLEMENT, BUT MANY WORRY ABOUT THE
FUTURE

   FLINT, Mich. _ Along the road leading into the sprawling General
Motors metal fabricating plant here, where the first of two strikes
that eventually paralyzed the company began on June 5, picketing
workers embraced news of a tentative agreement with shouts, tears
and a few two-step dance moves.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment hoped for so long that striking workers outside
the plant, and a nearby parts plant, sought to savor it by
extending their normal two-hour picket line rotations.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were joined by their spouses, local business owners,
city and county politicians and others who wanted to be on hand for
the end of ``The Big One,'' as many here referred to the 53-day
dispute, the costliest strike against General Motors in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over!'' Craig Layman shouted as he and other pickets
outside one of the gates of the Delphi East instrument-parts
factory complex received word that an agreement had been reached.
As a part of the tentative agreement, General Motors agreed not to
sell the plant before December 1999 where Layman, 40, has worked
for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Few battles between General Motors and the union have lasted
longer, been as bitter or wrought as much financial damage as the
walkouts at the metal factory and the Delphi East complex. The two
strikes have cost GM an estimated $2.2 billion in profit, shuttered
27 of its 29 North American assembly plants and put approximately
190,000 employees temporarily out of work.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, some workers said they expected labor relations to
fray even further once the company's national contract with the
United Automobile Workers expired.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just the mention of those coming negotiations seemed to
temper today's jubilation, for many already think that they will
have to pick up their picket signs once more against General
Motors. Indeed, the company had asked for an agreement barring the
UAW from striking at other troubled factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the union agreed to a no-strike clause only for a factory in
Dayton, Ohio, which the company promised not to sell until at least
January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little hard to be too excited,'' said Kendall Martin, a
27-year employee at the metal plant. ``I don't think I'll relax
until next year, when we've got a national agreement. ``Then it'll
really be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that one of the first things he intended to do after
he returned to work was to begin putting away ``a few thousand'' to
weather another long strike. ``We're going to have to be back out
here, and next time GM is going to be more prepared to stay out
even longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Roe, 56, also said he believed another battle loomed. For
30 years, he said, he has watched General Motors promise
investments to his union and then turn around and break such
promises. But this time Roe will not be around to see what happens
to the promises made here Tuesday or the outcome of the national
talks. He said he would retire the day after he reported back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for the younger workers; they need to get back to
work. But I've been through too much of this,'' he said, standing
outside the metal factory as he and others huddled around a tiny
television set watching the union's news conference. ``General
Motors used to provide a good, easy living. Now it's too much
stress and too much worry. You can't count on a future anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratification votes were scheduled here Wednesday morning, though
both top UAW officials and striking workers like Layman called the
meetings ``a small formality.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of his co-workers had used their time off to complete
projects around the house, golf and spend time with their families,
Layman said he could concentrate on nothing but the escalating
tensions between the company and the union.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not walking the picket line, Layman, and his wife
and two children sat outside the suburban hotel where top
negotiators were meeting, snapping pictures and searching for signs
that progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it all over again if I had to,'' he said on his way to
the hotel one last time, hoping for a chance to personally thank
top UAW leaders. ``What we did was historic.''

   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky received a sweeping grant of
immunity from federal prosecution Tuesday, in exchange for a
promise to testify that she and President Clinton had agreed to
deny that they had a sexual relationship, two lawyers familiar with
her account said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did deny under oath that they had
a sexual relationship. But in discussions leading to the immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors this week that she and the
President had a sexual relationship that began in 1995. The
25-year-old former White House intern now admits she lied in the
sworn affidavit she submitted in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit in January.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said Tuesday that Ms. Lewinsky had indicated
to prosecutors that the president discussed with her how to
characterize their relationship in December, when they were both
under subpoena in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions were crucial to reaching the broad immunity deal
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr announced Tuesday. Ms.
Lewinsky pledged her ``full and truthful testimony'' in exchange
for freedom from the threat of prosecution. Ms. Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, received a similar grant of immunity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the immunity arrangement, Ms. Lewinsky is prepared to
testify that the president told her that he planned to deny a
relationship and if they both denied it, no one would know the
truth, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is also prepared to say that the president
encouraged her to say that her many visits to the White House after
she lost her job there in 1996 were to see Betty Currie, Mr.
Clinton's private secretary, and not the president himself, the
lawyers said.

 &HT;    GM, UAW reach tentative agreements
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
on Tuesday reached tentative agreements that could end two
paralyzing strikes in Michigan and prevent two Dayton brake
factories from being sold or closed before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikes have crippled the world's largest automaker
for 54 days, idling 200,000 workers nationwide and nearly half of
GM's Dayton-area work force of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,200 strikers at the two Flint parts plants will vote on
the proposed agreements today, UAW officials said. If they approve
a settlement, the Flint workers could begin returning to their jobs
late tonight. Analysts believe local workers idled by the strikes
could return to other area GM plants in Dayton, Kettering, Moraine
and Vandalia early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive settlement that includes the plants in Flint,
Dayton and Indianapolis means GM will likely not face more
crippling strikes this summer. GM officials were pushing for a
comprehensive deal throughout the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Ratified settlements in Flint would end GM's longest walkout
since 1970. The dispute forced GM to shut down 27 of 29 North
American assembly plants and cost the automaker close to $3
billion, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the future that the UAW and GM can sit down and find
a different way of doing things, as we do with other automakers,''
said UAW president Stephen Yokich.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, GM pledged not to sell or close two troubled Delphi
brake plants, which employ 3,400 workers, until at least January
2000, said sources close to the Dayton plants. In return, UAW Local
696 agreed not to organize a strike against the automaker during
the same time period. The International UAW will seek to extend the
no-close-or-sale pledge in national contract talks, and in return,
possibly agree to a four-year contract instead of the usual
three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   But a source familiar with the Dayton agreement said GM was
unable to eliminate a quota clause that requires workers to produce
a certain number of parts in an 8-hour workday. Workers sometimes
complete the work in five or six hours, but get paid for a full
shift. Because of the quota clause, the brake plants have the
lowest productivity rating among any of GM's parts plants, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement in Dayton secures jobs until 2000,'' said Gary
Hill, president of Local 696. ``The plant (on Wisconsin Boulevard)
has been here for 59 years and I'd like to see it around for
another 59 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton dispute was the last obstacle to a comprehensive
settlement on Tuesday, said union officials in Flint. UAW Vice
President Richard Shoemaker and GM officials in Dayton said the
agreement includes ``a framework'' to improve the competitiveness
of the brake plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we must begin working together with the union and all of
our employees to address the significant competitive challenges
that these plants continue to face,'' said Gerald T. Meier,
director of operations for the brake plants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the local agreement, the brake plants still face a
gloomy long-term future unless the union and company can overcome
massive financial losses. The plants, located on Needmore Road and
Wisconsin Boulevard, have lost more than $40 million in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any change from general trends that affect the
U.S. auto industry, said Steve Dandaneau, a labor expert at the
University of Dayton. ``It remains a bleak outlook for auto workers
and the union, and a strong one for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandaneau said the strikes didn't solve the core problems facing
the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It displaces the same conflicts into the future,'' he said.
``If anything, it wore down the workers a bit. It strengthened the
resolve of Wall Street and (GM) executives to take drastic action
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming ratification in Flint, GM's attention will turn to
catching up on production of 600,000 cars and trucks canceled by
the strike-related parts shortage. Analysts said GM probably will
be able to make up only about two-thirds of the shortfall, or about
400,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about a week or two to get all the assembly plants
producing again, said Mike Robinet, an auto industry consultant
with CSM Corp. in Farmington Hills, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The company said last month it expects July sales to fall as
much as 40 percent below the year-earlier period as dealers face
short supplies of some models.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM will have a killer 1999, since they've got to make up
production lost during the strike,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an
automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lobaccaro estimates the strikes will cost GM $3 billion in lost
profit by the time production gets up to speed. That includes $1.2
billion in lost second-quarter profit the company has already
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico could resume
production within 10 days and begin months of heavy overtime to
fill back orders. More than 15,000 idled workers at GM suppliers
also could return to work soon.
</P>
<P>
   While details weren't released of the pacts in Flint, some
elements of the agreement emerged from company and union officials.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW pledged to boost productivity and GM said it would
invest in the Flint Metal Center, where 3,400 workers have been on
strike. The plant makes truck hoods, fenders and metal cradles that
attach engines to frames.
</P>
<P>
   GM also pledged not to sell the other Flint plant that is on
strike. The dispute was in its 54th day, the longest walkout
against the automaker since a 67-day national UAW walkout in 1970.
The Flint strikes, however, are more costly, and solidify the
central Michigan city's place in GM labor lore. It was in Flint in
1937 that sit-down strikes first led GM to recognize the UAW. The
Flint Metal Center strike began June 5 and was followed by the
Delphi East walkout June 11. The disputes centered on the UAW's
effort to preserve jobs and GM's effort to shed them to match its
shrinking market share and catch more efficient rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations intensified Saturday as GM and the union concluded
a four-day binding arbitration hearing with umpire Thomas Roberts.
The arbitrator hadn't said when he would rule, but negotiators said
both sides were worried about losing.
</P>
<P>
   GM had sought the arbitration, alleging that the walkouts were
illegal because they concerned national issues such as plant
investments. The UAW maintained the strikes were allowable under
the contract because they concerned health and safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   A break came Saturday, when GM agreed to return metal-stamping
tools to the Flint Metal Center. Workers cheered Sunday as the
trucks entered the factory.
</P>
<P>
   GM had removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend, two weeks
before the first strike, in an effort to keep its redesigned
Chevrolet and GM pickups on track for fall. The dies are used to
form truck body panels. The removal infuriated the UAW, which said
it violated the UAW contract and provoked the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to resolve the Flint strikes languished for weeks as costs
mounted for GM and idled thousands of workers who missed paychecks
and depended on unemployment benefits. Strikers receive about $150
in weekly strike benefits. UAW members in the U.S. make about $800
a week, excluding overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dayton-area workers idled by the Flint trikes are
represented by the International Union of Electronic Workers and
received about 95 percent of their wages and benefits during the
shut down. But about 1,000 UAW members at the Dayton brake plants
will find out in about two weeks whether they will receive
unemployment for the work they missed.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing was held Tuesday in Columbus by the Ohio Bureau of
Employment Services to determine if the strike-related layoffs are
due to a labor dispute or a lack of work as the result of a parts
shortage, said OBES spokesman David Garick.
</P>

   If the state finds a parts shortage triggered layoffs, the local
workers could be eligible for checks in about two weeks at the
earliest, Garick said.

 &HT;    Passenger arrested after allegedly becomming abusive
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What authorities say started with a fondled
breast and a demand for more vodka ended Monday night with an
emergency landing at Dayton International Airport and a Michigan
man in Montgomery County (Ohio) Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Kuchukian, 39, of Royal Oaks, Mich., was arrested after the
landing about 10 p.m. Kuchukian was one of 160 passengers on Spirit
Airlines Flight 632 from Tampa to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local authorities said no charges were filed Tuesday
against Kuchukian. But airport spokesman John Sears said the FBI
was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right about over Kentucky, the gentleman decided he wanted
additional alcohol,'' Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two years that a reported unruly
passenger caused an emergency landing in Dayton. Richard Josephson
of Wilmington, Del., pleaded guilty in December to endangering the
safety of an aircraft, by making a false bomb threat. He was
sentenced to six months in prison and forced to pay $40,653 in
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Unruly passengers are an increasing problem, with 296 reports in
1994 and 921 in 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration told
Congress last month. For the first three months of 1998, there were
258 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchukian wanted more alcohol, but flight attendants had cut
Kuchukian off after he touched the breast of a female passenger
next to him, according to Dayton police. Kuchukian responded by
threatening to turn on his laptop computer, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Use of laptops is barred because they can interfere with
airplanes' instruments and gauges, Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   After the threat, the flight attendants went to the captain, who
left the cockpit to speak to Kuchukian, police said. The laptop was
on, and Kuchukian said he would disrupt the aircraft's
communications. The captain then returned to the cockpit, declared
an emergency landing and contacted Dayton International Airport
authorities, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchukian then tried to force his way past flight attendants to
enter the cockpit, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the landing, airport police arrested him and took him to
their holding cell. Since he was initially cooperative, they
removed his handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchukian later beat on the cell door, demanding to smoke,
police said. After a warning, police entered the cell to recuff
him, and scuffled with him.
</P>
<P>
   One officer suffered a sprained wrist, Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   After Kuchukian complained of chest pain, he was treated at Good
Samaritan Hospital and Health Center and released, police said. He
was then taken to jail.

RUSSIAN SYMPHONY: AN ORCHESTRA THAT RESOUNDS WITH THE BRILLIANCE OF
YOUTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many things about the Russian Symphony Orchestra seem to
resonate of formative youth. The ensemble was organized just six
years ago, and the average age of its members is 25. But to judge
from a collection of exceptionally well-produced recordings, the
sapling Russian Symphony might be as old as its musical roots.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the youth of its players is belied by an intensity,
insight and precision that usually come with more years on stage
than most of these musicians have lived.
</P>
<P>
   The five CDs at hand, all of Russian music, stem from a
collaboration between the orchestra's veteran conductor, Mark
Gorenstein, and Gene Pope III, a New York producer driven by a zeal
to create disks that sound better than most. Pope's mission is not
novel. Boutique ``audiophile'' labels pop up here and there, often
bringing uncommonly fine sound to commonplace performances.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little of the routine in the forays by Gorenstein
and his young company. The weight of the evidence _ major works by
Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Schnittke and Shostakovich _ suggests that
Pope has discovered a genuine cultural treasure of the new Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Gorenstein's smart, versatile troupe, one can't
help but think of its American counterpart, Michael Tilson Thomas'
New World Symphony, based in Miami. I recall listening to the New
World's recent RCA CD of several Villa-Lobos ``Bachianas
Brasileiras'' and marveling at the absence of signs of
inexperience. If anything, the aplomb, the all-around maturity of
the Russian Symphony is even more discombobulating.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thomas' charges, who, performance prizes in hand, come
mostly straight from top music schools in the United States,
Gorenstein's players are touted as blue-ribbon graduates of
Russia's great institutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is something Olympian about these youthful all-star teams,
a thrilling aura of strength and purpose and renewal. And what
message could be more significant in a time when classical music _
especially the recording side of it _ is widely viewed as moribund?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Pope is betting on a vitality lingering below the
surface of the classical market; more than that, he has aimed his
Pope Music releases at consumers with fairly broad taste who are
willing to pay a premium price. These meticulously produced disks,
finished in gold, which is said to reflect a tracking laser beam
better than the conventional silver, sell for $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   Such, at any rate, is the tariff in record shops. Like many
another entrepreneur of the Internet era, Pope plans to sell his
disks on-line; such direct sales, he says, could allow him to drop
the price to around $17, the cost of new classical releases in the
standard silver format at record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Are Pope's CDs actually worth an arm and a leg? Let's just say
that through the hours I spent listening and relistening to the
five Russian disks (there are other releases in the series as well,
offering core repertory), I found myself swallowing less hard at
the price.
</P>
<P>
   This is a happy marriage of art and technology. It is surely
safe to say that Pope's recordings represent the standard for CDs
as we know them. Some impressive new technologies, like Sony's
Super Audio Disk and DVD audio, requiring new types of players, are
coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   But among orchestral disks that you can take home and play now,
these are exemplary for their dynamic range, natural timbres and
palpable sense of immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the musical contents measure up to the sonic
packaging. Not by chance, the orchestra's disarming mix of poise,
opulence and virtuosity matches the basic recipe of Russian
Romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Witness a hothouse treatment of Scriabin's Symphony No. 2 (Pope
Music PMG2919-2), the latest addition to the series. This grandly
framed, five-movement work, from 1901, reflects Scriabin's singular
fusion of Tchaikovsky's urgent intimacy with the more venturesome
harmony of Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   At Gorenstein's indulgent tempos, the Russian Symphony allows
the music to unfold on a cosmic time scale. The harsh climate of
the turbulent fourth movement owes much to Tchaikovksy's
``Francesca da Rimini,'' and here, conductor and orchestra show
that they can whip up a proper tempest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francesca'' itself is the subject, or at least an
afterthought, of a Tchaikovsky disk, which presents a radiant,
finely drawn ``Pathetique'' Symphony (PMG2006-2). Pope acknowledges
that veteran players from other orchestras occasionally sit in with
the Russian Symphony, and the scintillating flight through the
famous march of the ``Pathetique'' is a team achievement that would
do the Moscow Philharmonic proud.
</P>
<P>
   One might say as much for the young Russians' dark, searching
way with the finale. Gorenstein asks for an expression of gripping
psychological depth, and his well-coached musicians deliver.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer brilliance, with a large dose of wit, the Russian
Symphony outdoes itself in Alfred Schnittke's bumptious ``Gogol
Suite'' and his mordantly mischievous ``(K)ein Sommernachtstraum''
(PMG2007-2). Take Weill's sardonic cabaret style, stir with a
strain of Mahler at his most conflicted, color brightly, and you
have Schnittke's Gogol music. The Russians have great, and
infectious, fun with it.
</P>
<P>
   In a more temperate vein, Gorenstein and company bring much the
same spirit and edge to Rodion Shchedrin's clever ``Carmen,'' for
strings and percussion (PMG2002-2). Here, too, is a sterling
instance of the vibrant Pope sound driving home the power of a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But another disk stands out as the most remarkable and
compelling, the place to start: a pairing of Shostakovich's Fifth
Symphony and his Chamber Symphony for strings (PMG2009-2). As the
performance of the slow movement of the ``Pathetique'' stirs the
soul, that of the Shostakovich Largo breaks the heart; here and
throughout the Fifth, Gorenstein perfectly matches musical tempo to
life-pulse.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately touches the imagination is the knowledge that
this brave mirror of Shostakovich's old world rests in the hands of
a new generation. How deeply we can see into it is amazing.

FOR A VULNERABLE CLINTON, FAMILIAR GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton Conundrum was on full display in the
capital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment lawyers for Monical S. Lewinsky were announcing
that the one-time White House intern was being granted the broadest
form of immunity for her testimony, bringing the investigation that
threatens the president and the presidency one step closer to its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later Bill Clinton was in the Capitol Rotunda, at the
symbolic center of American national life, presiding with gravity
and sensitivity at the memorial service for the two Capitol guards
who stood and died for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And there, during the blink of an hour in one of the most torrid
and tense days of the Clinton presidency, was a vivid portrait of
the unusual, unconventional, and enigmatic role that the 42nd
president of the United States plays in a nation whose politics
more than ever seem like theater.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton is at once the most vulnerable and most
indispensable figures in American life.
</P>
<P>
   Few modern presidents _ perhaps John F. Kennedy, perhaps Ronald
W. Reagan _ have so effortlessly spoken for the American people at
times of tragedy and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   And yet few modern presidents _ perhaps only Richard M. Nixon _
have ever had an administration so constantly under attack, so
constantly at the verge of disintegration, so constantly in the
position of mounting a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the case of Nixon, where petty political crimes
intermingled with historic constitutional questions, the Clinton
presidency is being assailed by a combination of possible sexual
dalliances combined with more serious allegations of obstruction of
justice _ charges that even some of the president's most dedicated
opponents are troubled about pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   The president's political destiny may be determined by Congress,
and so it was fitting that on a day of national loss and personal
challenge the president traveled the 16 longest blocks in American
political life, from the White House to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting of remorse and remembrance, under the gravest
personal political pressures, President Clinton Tuesday nonetheless
captured the senselessness of the two guards' deaths _ and the
hopelessness Americans feel when confronting the violence that
pockmarks our national life. ``We thank their families for enduring
the pain and extra burden of joining us here today,'' the president
said, his eyes overflowing with feeling, ``for they remind us that
what makes our democracy strong is not only what Congress may enact
or a president may achieve; even more, it is the countless
individual citizens who live our ideals out every day, the
innumerable acts of heroism that go unnoticed, and especially, it
is the quiet courage and uncommon bravery of Americans like J.J.
Chestnut and John Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   In that short passage were the moral and political touchstones
of the moment _ the grief of the families, the American creed of
democracy and freedom, the signature American idea of the
individual and the modern ideological conviction that the people,
and not the government, are what make the country strong. No one
could say it better and, in a parade of speakers that included
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Vice President Al Gore, no one did.
</P>
<P>
   At times like these, when even passersby on Washington streets
sense that historic events are unfolding, the strange echoes
between Clinton's predicament and Nixon's _ and the similarities
between his seldom less-than-astonishing political gifts and those
of Kennedy and Reagan _ seem vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was criticized, in turn, for his ``Vietnamization'' policy
designed to end American involvement in Southeast Asia; for his
invasion of Cambodia; for his economic policies, which included
wage and price controls; and for the entire tragic cycle of
Watergate, from break-in to coverup to stonewall. Clinton began his
presidency in controversy, from his mishandled effort to end
discrimination against gays in the military to botched nominations,
from an economic stimulus package that failed to a comprehensive
overhaul of the health system that also failed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Reagan epitomized the power of the word in politics,
of knowing what to say and exactly how to say it. One was able to
mobilize the nation for the space race; the other to lead the
nation in mourning when the space shuttle Challenger exploded on
live television on an unforgettable morning. Clinton has perfect
political pitch, and his ability to anticipate the wrinkles of
public opinion has given him astonishing public-approval ratings
even as his Republican opposition and the political establishment
were ready to count him out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, Clinton is struggling for survival in an
atmosphere of almost unbearable pressure on the president, the
presidency, and the political system.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Clinton recedes into lame-duck status, as the
presidency recedes from the center of American life and as politics
takes a secondary role in the nation, a constitutional drama is
unfolding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It involves high principles and trivial charges _ and enduring
questions or private behavior and public morality. At stake is the
midterm congressional election, the credibility of the Republican
Congress, and the historical legacy of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Many decisions beckon in the next week or so, most of them to be
made on behalf of a onetime University of Arkansas professor of
constitutional law by some of the priciest lawyers in the nation.
In the space of only a few days, independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr issued a subpoena for Clinton to testify, won a victory on
attorney-client privilege, granted immunity to Lewinsky, and put
the White House on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the White House has found itself during most of the
last six years. Yet Clinton, more vulnerable than ever, is in a
strangely familiar position. For this is a man whose road to the
Democratic nomination and passage through the presidency has been,
from the start, a counteroffensive.

STREET &AMP; SMITH'S TOPS THE LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best sports magazine on the market is not Sports
Illustrated, a venerable institution that's been around since 1954
and has its own cover jinx.
</P>
<P>
   It is not ESPN The Magazine, either, the precocious offspring of
the cable network that has a hip-hop take on sports, complete with
migraine-inducing graphics and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it dated The Sporting News, any of the dozen or so
annuals which flood the market each season, and certainly not any
of the fantasy magazines aimed at stataholics.
</P>
<P>
   The best sports magazine actually happens to be a four-month-old
magazine the everyday sports fan is likely to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is Street &AMP; Smith's Sports Business Journal, and its
50-plus pages each week provides an extensive education on the
size, shape and growing nature of sports' financial underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   The average fan cares most about the Dodgers and Angels standing
in the pennant race, Michael Jordan's plans for 1998, and what NFL
games are on television each Sunday. After 25 years in the business
of covering sports, I've learned Joe Fan is liable to tune out
whenever stories include more dollars signs and legalese than bunts
and punts.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the way owners keep digging deeper into the
pocket of fans, the way corporations are investing in franchises,
and the way players keep turning their heels on fans, the Journal
should fall into the must read category.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of these headlines and news items culled from the
first 12 issues of Street &AMP; Smith's Sports Business Journal:
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch plans to spinoff part of his News Corp. empire,
including its cable TV unit and the Dodgers, and take 20 percent of
it public.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, owner of the Ducks, Angels, ABC and ESPN, is facing
shareholder discontent over the way its sports units are dragging
down its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers will spend $200,000 in an effort to
market NFL-less Los Angeles and bring some ticket buyers south.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire stands to make $200,000 from a ticket incentive in
his contract if the Cardinals break 3 million in attendance. That
doesn't make him greedy; 3 million fans will generate $2.5 million
in revenue for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas is considering taking himself public -- part of his
salary and endorsements -- meaning a fan could buy shares of The
Big Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The laws the NBA players are using in bargaining with David
Stern were created to protect coal miners.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's birth can be traced to a former publisher of the
Wall Street Journal, Ray Shaw, who went about his retirement buying
up small newspapers and business journals. In the process, he
bought the Street &AMP; Smith line, heretofore best known for its
baseball and football annuals. Shaw's son, Whitney, thought there
was a place for a sports business journal in addition to the other
S&AMP;S titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sports industry is a $324 billion industry,'' said John
Genzale, the Journal's editor. ``To put it in perspective, the
automotive industry in America is an $80 billion business. When
you're dealing with an industry that big, there are literally
thousands of stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports has always been about business, Genzale says, but that
fact has only been grudgingly accentuated in the last two decades.
Journal research indicated a lot of information was going
unreported because of a basic fact of sports life for newspaper:
Its readers prefer box scores to stock tickers.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers attempt to cover this field, but it's a delicate
balance. Spend too much time writing about stadium economics or the
terms being discussed in the NBA lockout, and the reader very
likely will tune out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to recall what (the late) Jack Kent Cooke said when
asked why he doesn't spend more on marketing,'' said Genzale. ``He
said `I fill the stadium every week. What do I need marketing for?'
Things have changed since owners cared only about gate receipts and
television money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have corporations investing, and teams are vitally
involved in stadium signage, merchandising and maxing out their
concessions, and it impacts the cost of tickets and whether
stadiums are built and whether a franchise is likely to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aiming the magazine at anyone who makes a buck and
spends a buck in sports. It's the same concept for the Wall Street
Journal in business and Variety in entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Between stories about stadium financing and corporate
investment, the Journal puts some information into fan-friendly
formats. A weekly feature called The List, for example, recently
broke down what it costs a fan to park, buy a program and dinner --
a dog, beer and soda -- at each major league park (it's $17 for a
Dodgers game, $20.75 for an Angels game).
</P>
<P>
   Another showed what the most and least expensive tickets were in
each sport. The average ticket price for a Pittsburgh Penguins
hockey game is $56, $52 to see the Redskins and $51 to watch the
Raiders' Commitment to Excellence. You can catch a Twins game for
$8, and the Clippers for $24, the best bargain in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concept of what a billion dollars is, nor what it
can do, and I'm sure most fans feel the same way. These are
staggering numbers,'' said Genzale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But fans are still the substance of the money. Without them,
there are no sports. So we try to explain where the money comes
from, and whether a team can create the revenue to justify a $300
million stadium, and what exactly it will cost the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also find out the names of the agents for each NFL and
NBA first round pick, the impact McGwire has on road attendance,
the 21 new stadiums scheduled to open between today and 2002, and
that the Dodgers have had only a .2 percent fluctuation in
attendance over the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   All that may not hold the same thrill as watching Mark McGwire
hit 62 home runs, but it's nice to know someone is watching our
sports bottom line.

CONSPIRACY THEORIES FLY IN BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angry Brazilians continue to seek for answers 2{ weeks after
their team's collapse in the World Cup final, and some of what
they're coming up with is fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk concerns Ronaldo, the wunderkind striker whose
disappearance in the title match set the tone for the 3-0 loss to
France on July 12. What, all wonder, is wrong with the ``world's
greatest player''?
</P>
<P>
   Or is something far more nefarious at work, some sort of
conspiracy that prevented Brazil from winning its fifth World Cup
title? Were the French promised the crown? Did Brazil trade victory
for something more? What role did Nike, or FIFA, play, and what
might all this mean for 2002?
</P>
<P>
   These are sticky questions, on the surface ridiculous, but
stranger things have occurred in this sport; nothing can be
discounted. Not even the simplest, and likeliest, explanation: That
Ronaldo suffered a seizure of some sort, tried to play anyway, and
struggled, as did his teammates, against a superior team.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't wash in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Something more must be at stake ``This is going down as one of
the eternal mysteries in football history,` one Brazilian scribe
declared and the search has centered on Ronaldo, who has admitted
that he suffered a seizure before the match after denying so
earlier. Whether it was epilepsy, an allergic reaction, severe
stress or something else hasn't been determined, but what appears
clear is that the 21-year-old forward was in no shape to play.
</P>
<P>
   That he did Coach Mario Zagallo, dismissed Monday, first said
his other players ``panicked'' when Ronaldo wasn't on the original
starting lineup, then that Ronaldo demanded to play has been
ascribed to Brazilian corporate sponsor Nike (wanted to unleash a
new shoe in the wake of Brazil's expected triumph) or to the CBF,
the governing body for soccer in Brazil (forced him to play).
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what occurred in the hours before the final has had fans
in an uproar, the team's doctor before a review board and Ronaldo
defending his mental health.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronaldo was left off the roster, it was because of an
``injured ankle.'' Then it was his knee. Then it was a stomach
ache. Then something else. When he did take the field, he looked
like a zombie.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, twice the world player of the year, says he was fine
until mid-afternoon the day of the final. ``Before the game I had
lunch, returned to my room, shaved and laid down to watch
television,'' he told Brazil's Globo television network. ``Then I
started shaking all over. I had a convulsion. I don't remember
anything else other than waking up with pain all over my body. It
was as if someone had beaten me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told me I wouldn't be able to play. I said that I
had to. ... I know a lot of people were expecting much more of me,
but I did the best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested a row with his girlfriend, Susanna Werner (who
got nearly as much World Cup air time as her boyfriend), caused the
convulsions; others thought he might have been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   And still others believe Brazil allowed France to hoist the
trophy in exchange for the 2002 World Cup, which according to this
line of thought the Brazilians would host when FIFA takes it away
from South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As farfetched as that one sounds, it just might be possible.
South Korea, in particular, is struggling with the demands of the
World Cup in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. It doesn't
have the money needed to improve stadia or build infrastructure,
and there has been speculation it would resign, or be replaced, as
host.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Koreans asked for a three-month postponement of
the tournament, to September 2002, because it realized, suddenly,
that the scheduled summer dates conflict with their rainy season.
Most believe cash, not weather, is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   England has made it clear it would step in to host, and its
facilities are certainly in better shape than Brazil's. But the
Koreans insist they'll be ready the Japanese claim they're raring
to go and FIFA has shown no signs it will take any action soon.
</P>
<P>
   So, could it be that Brazil's loss was just that, a loss? Was it
just not their night?
</P>
<P>
   Someone has to take the blame, and so far that someone is
Ronaldo. ``The problem,'' he said, ``was that the team played
poorly, and they found an excuse in me for the defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they found lots of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-STARS?
</P>
<P>
   The fans voted for Major League Soccer's All-Star Game starters,
so there's not much sense in questioning the choices, although
Preki? Alexi Lalas? Tab Ramos? It's the national team, really, that
will take on the World All-Stars on Sunday in Orlando: Only Tony
Meola and John Harkes, of the starters, weren't in France.
</P>
<P>
   The World team, with Jorge Campos in goal and Jan Eriksson and
Geoff Aunger in defense, has some questionable selections as well,
and why did Coach Octavio Zambrano include San Jose's Richard Gough
on his bench rather than the Galaxy's Martin Machon?
</P>
<P>
   The two most exciting selections are on the U.S. bench:
Colorado's Ross Paule, who has emerged as a force in midfield this
season, and D.C.'s Ben Olsen, a future World Cup star and the
rookie-of-the-year favorite. What they have in common: Both left
college a year early to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   CORNER KICKS
</P>
<P>
   Americans are on the move in Germany. Defender David Regis, the
Frenchman naturalized just before the World Cup, is leaving the
Bundesliga after one season to play for Metz, the French
runners-up. Jovan Kirovski, who hasn't evolved as hoped for at
Borussia Dortmund, has been loaned to fellow German club Fortuna
Cologne; and then there's Frankie Hejduk, whose World Cup
performance paid off with a Bayer Leverkusen contract. Lots of
movement in Holland, too: World Cup alternates Gregg Berhalter
(Sparta Rotterdam to Cambuur Leeuwarden) and John O'Brien (Ajax
Amsterdam to FC Utrecht, a loan), both defenders, also have new
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Reyna, the most important player at VfL Wolfsburg last
season, isn't guaranteed a starting job by the German club this
season. Coach Wolfgang Wolf, apparently concerned with how Reyna
deals with physical play, has given the playmaker job to Ghanian
Charles Akonnor; Reyna is battling three players for a spot in the
first 11.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna and Hejduk are the only Americans in the Bundesliga, but
there are five ``Amis'' in 2Bundesliga, the second division:
Kirovski, Michael Mason (St. Pauli), Matthew Okoh (SpVgg
Unterhaching), John van Buskirk (FKC Uerdingen) and David Wagner
(Guetersloh).
</P>
<P>
   Lotta big names on the move in Mexico, too, including the
Tricolor's (and Necaxa's) striking tandem, Luis Hernandez and
Cuauhtemoc Blanco. Hernandez transfered to Monterrey and Blanco to
America in the annual ``draft.'' Other big transfers: Ricardo
Pelaez (America to Guadalajara), Luis Garcia (Atlante to
Guadalajara), Pavel Pardo (Atlas to UAG) and Braulio Luna (Pumas to
America).
</P>
<P>
   Sigi Schmid named five of his UCLA players to the U.S. Under-20
team that will attempt next month to qualify for the FIFA World
Youth Championships next April in Nigeria. Bruin goalkeeper Nick
Rimando, defender Carlos Bocanegra, midfielder Shaun Tsakiris and
forward McKinley Tennyson will be joined by recruit Ryan Futagaki
(Fountain Valley HS) in the Aug. 5-9 CONCACAF tournament in
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago. The Americans, Canada, Costa Rica and the hosts
are fighting for two berths. Others on the 18-man roster include
Maryland-bound Dan Califf (Orange HS), Indiana sweeper Nick Garcia,
and MLS youngsters Jamar Beasley (New England), Nino DaSilva
(Kansas City) and Tim Howard (New York/New Jersey).
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who enters his 19th season this fall in Westwood (he's
305-59-33 with three NCAA titles, including last year's), wants to
consider John Thorrington
</P>
<P>
   (Manchester United) and Jacob Lisek
</P>
<P>
   (Fortuna Duesseldorf) for Nigeria, if he can. Both grew up in
the United States, but Thorrington was born in England and Lisek in
Poland, and neither have citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Burn may be faltering in MLS, but they're still on
target to repeat as U.S. Open Cup champs. The Burn takes on Chicago
and Columbus faces New York/New Jersey in a semifinal doubleheader
Monday night in New Orleans with the winners advancing to the final
Aug. 26 in Virginia Beach, Va. The Open Cup has been contested
since 1914 it's the United States' oldest soccer trophy but tight
schedules have persuaded the Galaxy to skip it in each of the
club's three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad &AMP; Tobago looks ready to wrest the Caribbean title from
Jamaica; it should get the chance Friday in the Shell Cup final.
Columbus' Stern John
</P>
<P>
   guided T&AMP;T into today's semifinal against Haiti, scoring both
goals to beat Martinique, 2-1, then getting four more in an 8-0
romp over Dominica. The Jamaicans take on Antigua and Barbuda
today.
</P>
<P>
   European club champ Real Madrid has a new coach, another one,
after Jose Antonio Camacho resigned after just 22 days on the job.
Guus Hiddink, the Netherlands' World Cup coach, will guide the
Spanish power, which won the European title in May, then dumped
coach Jupp Heynckes. Hiddink was hired after Nevio Scalaturned down
the post.

A LITTLE NURTURING OF NATURE, THE FRENCH WAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ The twin colonnades of plane trees
that line the Cours Mirabeau in this ancient French city to the
south are not there by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some human eye devised the spacings, guided the beginnings, then
let nature take its course. The hand of man is everywhere to be
observed on France's natural beauties. Nature is to be revered, but
it is also to be improved on.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a bad way to look at the Peter Brook production of
``Don Giovanni'' that played at the Festival Internationale d'Art
Lyrique here this summer. Brook offered not much of a production at
all: a few benches on the big courtyard stage of the Archbishop's
Palace, the Don in a vanilla suit and Panama hat, his colleagues in
street clothes and party dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mozart was treated exceptionally well: not with visual
effects or theatrical coups that drew the audience into the events
but by an attempt to look at the opera's people from the inside
out. Brook, returning to the medium after years of boycott,
carefully prepared his young cast members to follow their own
natures, and seldom has the swollen rhetoric of opera been more
effectively curbed. So articulately demonstrative were the
recitatives that the non-Italian-speaker could follow every nuance
without the need of words.
</P>
<P>
   Brook's singers, uniformly good at a recent performance, were
none very old. Equally young were the musicians of the Mahler
Chamber Orchestra, who seemed mesmerized by their distinguished
conductor, Claudio Abbado. Roberto Scaltriti's tall good lucks and
firm baritone promised a very workable Don for the future. Nicola
Ulivieri, a thinking man's Leporello, avoided buffoonery.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the Donna Anna, Monica Colonna, for her intensity. Donna
Elvira's cold fury seemed to emanate as much from the natural
personality of the singer (Veronique Gens) as from the nature of
the role. Alessandro Guerzoni's Commendatore substituted
considerable, if light-voiced, dignity for the usual cavernous
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Tarver, a young American singing Don Ottavio, negotiated
the rigors of ``Il mio tesoro'' with understandable caution but
allowed ``Dalla sua pace'' to emanate with cool beauty. This is a
nice Mozart voice, fastidious and elegant. Nathan Berg and Catrin
Wyn Davies were the attractive Masetto and Zerlina.
</P>
<P>
   Brook's ``Don Giovanni'' did have a few tricks up its sleeve.
The orchestra rose for the finale, and members stamped their feet
as the Commendatore's ghost knocked for admission. At the
concluding sextet, the Don reappeared, now a disembodied observer
removed from life. The touches were all nice, but it was the
exercise of believable human discourse through artifice that made
the difference. The people who planted those trees would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Aix festival, which ended on Friday, was at once 50 years
old this summer and brand new. Its early postwar seasons served to
reacquaint culture-minded summer residents with the operas of
Mozart, and every June and July, Parisians descended from the
north, giving these events a cachet competitive with that of
Salzburg or Glyndebourne.
</P>
<P>
   But festivals multiplied and found new themes, and in recent
years Aix has faded. The city, whose project the festival largely
was, lost heart. Then Stephane Lissner arrived, a couple of years
ago, with restoratives. In Paris, Lissner had practiced similar
first aid on the Theatre du Chatelet, spending lavishly on
distinctive projects.
</P>
<P>
   He could. To his good fortune, Lissner became the handy cultural
weapon with which Jacques Chirac, then the mayor of Paris, thumped
political rivals in the national government, which owned and
operated the competing Paris Opera. When Chirac became president,
his good will toward his protege survived.
</P>
<P>
   The government and, to a lesser degree, the city and the region
are now the major players at Aix, and one-half of the festival's
$10 million budget will be subsidized (the rest to come from ticket
sales).
</P>
<P>
   Last year's lull (there were two operas in concert) was used to
build and rebuild: new studios and production plants, an overhaul
at the Archbishop's Palace (the scene this summer of Bartok's
``Bluebeard's Castle'' and Monteverdi's ``Orfeo'') and the
beginnings of work on other spaces.
</P>
<P>
   New to the festival was a kind of postgraduate school where
young professionals, recruited worldwide, learned by doing. They
were in good part responsible for the smaller productions of
``Curlew River'' and ``Dido and Aeneas'' in another nearby
courtyard theater, at Hotel Maynier d'Oppede.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The two operas, along with ``Don Giovanni,'' are to tour Europe
and Japan now that the festival has closed. At their courtyard
space, a raised rectangle of flagstones, a small fountain in its
middle, served as a stage, with amphitheaterlike seating on three
sides. Four big plane trees provided shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits and disadvantages of youth were represented in both
pieces. Purcell's magnificent torso of an opera was prepared by
David Stern, a young American conductor, and its attractive crew of
singers was maneuvered by Marcel Bozonnet (director) and Caroline
Marcade (choreographer).
</P>
<P>
   No one except perhaps Andrew Rupp, as Aeneas, had the
ingredients for international success, but at the new Aix, ensemble
skill was more to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these voices were in surprisingly poor health. Sandrine
Rondot labored uncomfortably as Belinda. Depending on your point of
view, matching Myriam Boucris' damaged technique to the part of the
Sorceress was either apt casting or poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   I hope it is not a comment on the pushiness of the opera world
these days that a singer can have so many troubles at such an early
age. English diction from the international cast was cloudy at
best, Rupp being the exception. But since the French in general
don't like to speak English or listen to it, I guess it didn't
matter much.
</P>
<P>
   Rinat Shaham sang Dido with taste. Youth gave her music an
attractive bloom; it also largely disconnected her from Dido's
sufferings. At the moment, Ms. Shaham imitates the tragic heroine
well. Perhaps with a little more living, she will become one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curlew River'' shared the virtues of Aix's ``Dido'' and
largely avoided it problems. The conversational tone of Britten's
piece was particularly helped by the nearness of the performers.
Written for the church but inspired by Noh plays, ``Curlew River''
is less an opera than an lllustrated homily, a parable set to music
revealing God's mercy to those in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a ferry crossing. A child's death is remembered. A
Madwoman is reconciled to its loss and is healed. ``Curlew River''
is framed by plainchant as processional and recessional and modal
scales carry Britten farther from major and minor than he was used
to going.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshi Oida's direction was reticent, and Michael Bennett,
playing the Madwoman in Britten's all-male cast, touched his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and Britten, separated by 300 years, have much in
common. Both love uneven phrase lengths that surprise and delight.
Both are descriptive composers: Britten with his delicate arpeggio
river swells, Purcell with his cave of witches and echo effects.
Britten's tiny instrumental ensemble, led again by Stern, was a
constant wonder of discreet and suggestive coloration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluebeard's Castle,'' here conducted by Pierre Boulez and
splendidly sung by the Hungarian bass Laszlo Polgar, has never been
much of an opera to look at, so Aix hired the choreographer Pina
Bausch, who had done an earlier dance production of the work, seen
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1984, to be its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dialogue became dancing images, repeated and multiplied.
Obsessions and fears could be looked at. Ms. Bausch got her quota
of boos at the end, but this simply showed an audience that was
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, indeed, added much to these events, being silent,
attentive and, if not always knowledgeable, at least eager to know.
People make festivals, and these people had evidently made an
effort to be where they were and knew precisely why they had come.

Owners OK McCombs' acquisition of Vikings
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
GRAPEVINE _ Red McCombs was approved as owner of the Minnesota
Vikings on Tuesday, gaining admission to a club he had sought to
join for more than 30 years. But the San Antonio businessman made
it clear his heart remains well south of Mankato, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs reiterated his view that there is no reason to move the
Vikings _ ``a Minnesota institution,'' he said _ but he indicated
he hopes to see improved attendance as well as progress in dealing
with, as he put it, the team's ``facility problem.'' He also said
he has not abandoned his dream of seeing an NFL team in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In short, McCombs wasn't in the club long before he was talking
like a member.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs, who is paying a reported $250 million for the Vikings,
was approved unanimously by NFL owners meeting at the Dallas-Fort
Worth Airport Hyatt. The vote became basically a rubber stamp after
McCombs won the unanimous approval of the NFL's finance committee
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Tuesday vote, McCombs greeted Dallas Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones, a key supporter, with a hug and ``Hail to the chief.''
After the vote, McCombs and his associates entered the owners'
meeting room to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs, who made his fortune primarily through his auto
dealerships, previously owned the Denver Nuggets and San Antonio
Spurs of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Author Tom Clancy originally had outbid McCombs for the Vikings
and was in line to buy the team before failing to appear before the
finance committee in May.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the owners laid the groundwork for stocking the
new Cleveland Browns, which will enter the league as an expansion
team in 1999. The Browns will receive at least 30 veteran players
from other teams and gain 14 extra draft picks in their first two
years of operation, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced. At
least seven groups are bidding to own the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs' chief business associate, Gary Woods, cited three
factors for the relative ease with which McCombs was approved as
owner of the Vikings: single ownership, a background in sports and
sound financing.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs is expected to close the deal and assume control of the
team by the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, president of McCombs Enterprises, smiled when asked where
McCombs, 70, gets his energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genes,'' he said. ``Retirement is not in his vocabulary.
Vacation is not in his vocabulary. Anything he has ever done for
fun has always involved working. He combines the two. To him, this
is a challenge, fun, but also a business.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs has tried to become an NFL owner since 1962, with most
of his efforts focused on getting a team for San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he said he was excited about ``being a part of
Minnesota'' but acknowledged his primary wish is to see the NFL
come to his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (buying the Vikings) is a dream for me,'' he said, ``but
if I could wave a wand and create anything I wanted and had one
choice _ the choice of owning a team outside of San Antonio or
having the power to see that San Antonio had a team and that I
would not be involved in it at all _ I would definitely choose the
latter. It would not even be a choice, because I think the fans of
San Antonio, Austin and South Texas dearly expect and deserve to
have a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was not an issue here. The issue here was a team for
sale in Minneapolis, and that team has a storied tradition in the
state of Minnesota. I can do the hypothetical, but the hypothetical
didn't come to pass. Having said that, as I said hello to (Buffalo
Bills owner) Ralph Wilson in the lobby last night, his first
comment was, `Well, I guess now you won't be calling me to see if
I'm interested in moving my team to San Antonio,' and I said,
`Well, don't bet on it, because San Antonio still doesn't have the
team.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people in Minnesota should be interested in the
fact that a guy from Texas who for years has supported the program
to get a team in San Antonio now owns their team. They should be
concerned about that. I don't expect that issue to go away. But I
will do everything I can to see that the Vikings are competitive in
Minnesota, and I fully expect them to be. Having said that, I will
still work within the league to see if there is any way San Antonio
could have an NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs' ownership and a vacant Alamodome could hover over a
franchise with lagging attendance and a stadium, the Metrodome,
that is less than optimal as a revenue producer even when full.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs sounded like an NBA owner when he spoke of the Vikings
regaining their ``home-court advantage,'' but the message won't
need translation in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say, `Well, this guy just paid a lot of money. What he
really wants to do is increase revenue,''' he said. ``That's true.
I do want to increase revenue. But it is a very, very solid fact:
Home-court advantage comes from the players knowing in advance that
there's standing room only, that their extended families are going
to be watching them and that everybody in the stands loves them and
hates the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings have not had that advantage for several years. It
will be my job to see that they get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the stadium issue, he said: ``The facility problem for
the Vikings is very real. I think every person in Minnesota is
aware of it. That's ongoing. We will be trying to find ways to
relieve that problem, still working within the framework of
Minnesota. We don't have any answers yet, but obviously that is a
problem that has to be addressed. We will be talking to members of
the (Metropolitan) Sports Commission. They know far more about this
than we do. And I suspect the people of Minnesota will address this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, McCombs and Woods will evaluate the team's
front-office personnel, the first step in putting their stamp on
the team. Woods said he would go to Minneapolis immediately.
McCombs is expected to arrive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been involved with many companies other than sports
(franchises),'' McCombs said. ``We always find, in taking over any
company, there are assets we were not aware of, and they are always
people. To us, organization from a team aspect is just as important
as the team on the field. We have to be sure we have everybody in
the Vikings organization that has a passion for his or her job.''

 &HT;    Women's rift spurs founder to quit board
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three days into the 41st annual Southern Christian
Leadership Conference convention and still there has been no public
mention of the rift with the women's division.
</P>
<P>
   But the board has met privately on four occasions. During one of
those meetings, Evelyn Lowery, founder of SCLC/WOMEN, resigned from
SCLC board, said Chairman Claud Young. But he refused to accept her
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an angry outburst,'' Young said Tuesday afternoon
following an awards luncheon. ``So I left the door open to set up a
means of working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery, who apparently has left Washington, did not return phone
calls to her home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the convention, which began Saturday with the
installation of Martin Luther King III as president, SCLC was
caught up in a controversy when it was reported that the board had
voted 10-9 in April to sever ties with SCLC/WOMEN.
</P>
<P>
   King, who voted in favor of the move, said the intent of the
board's vote was to restructure the organization so that SCLC/WOMEN
would function as a department, rather than a separate entity.
Additionally, Young said, there was a need to build in some
``accountability.'' Some board members have said privately that it
has been difficult to merge the two groups because Lowery's
husband, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, had been president of SCLC for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue started before Martin,'' Young said. ``We've just
got to have one organization.''
</P>
<P>
   When Evelyn Lowery established the women's group in 1979, it was
set up as a department of SCLC. It was incorporated 10 years later
to secure a grant but never returned to its original setup.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday what role, if any, Lowery will play
within SCLC/WOMEN, but one board member noted that she had retired
from the presidency of the group months ago.

   UNION, GM REACH PACT TO END STRIKES AT 2 PLANTS
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union agreed to
end nearly eight weeks of strikes at two auto parts plants in
Flint, Mich., that had shut down car assembly plants across North
America, pushed hundreds of thousands of workers into temporary
unemployment and slowed the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which must be approved by workers at both
factories, settles a wide range of local issues at the two
factories and at several other GM factories where workers had
threatened strikes. But it did not address any national issues,
such as GM's push to open new factories overseas or its effort to
reduce its work force in the United States through attrition.

   NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX FALLS 1.9 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 36.73 points, or 1.9 percent, to
1,896.53. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down 212.15
points before bargain hunters trimmed the loss, closed at 8,934.78.
The market declines were caused by continuing concerns about
corporate profits, Asia's financial crisis and the specter of
political upheaval in Washington.

<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.74 percent,
from 5.71 percent.

   BMW ACQUIRES ROLLS-ROYCE NAME
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen was forced to agree to hand over the Rolls-Royce name
to BMW in 2003. Volkswagen and BMW had competed for the British
luxury car company with Volkswagen agreeing to pay $780 million for
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. But analysts now say BMW appears to be the
real winner because the name is considered by many to be
Rolls-Royce's most valuable asset.

   SENATE APPROVES A CREDIT UNION BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill that would help credit unions compete

in April. If approved, the legislation would override a Supreme
Court ruling by letting federally chartered credit unions continue
to include more than one group in their memberships.

CENDANT CHAIRMAN, 9 OTHERS STEP DOWN AFTER ACCOUNTING FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks of intensifying pressure from an accounting scandal,
Walter Forbes, the chairman of Cendant Corp., resigned Tuesday,
saying that his departure would help the company ``focus all of its
attention and resources on restoring the faith of its shareholders,
its customers and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   The board immediately elected Henry Silverman, the company's
chief executive, to the additional post of chairman of Cendant, a
direct marketer and franchiser, which owns brands that include
Century 21 real estate, Avis car rentals, and Howard Johnson and
Ramada Inn motels.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in December from the merger of HFS Inc.,
led by Silverman, and CUC International, led by Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation comes 14 weeks after Cendant announced that
serious ``accounting irregularities'' had been uncovered at
businesses that had formerly been part of CUC International.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who will get a severance package worth more than $35
million, insisted Tuesday night that he had ``absolutely no
knowledge'' of those problems and that ``the actions of a few have
profoundly hurt us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' resignation was announced after a six-hour board meeting
at the New York City offices of the company's law firm, Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Forbes, E. Kirk Shelton, the former president of
CUC and seven other former CUC directors on the Cendant board also
resigned. A ninth ex-CUC director, current audit committee chairman
Frederick Green, announced he would leave the board by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those departures will reduce Cendant's unwieldy 28-member board
to 18. The board also eliminated rules adopted as part of the
merger that required an 80 percent majority for key board action,
including the removal of the top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Forbes' decision and the corporate governance changes
approved today end any uncertainty about the future direction and
leadership of Cendant,'' Silverman said. ``That uncertainty was a
serious impediment to conducting our business and the process of
restoring trust in our company.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations came after representatives of Arthur Andersen
and Deloitte &AMP; Touche gave the board a long and sobering account of
the magnitude and mechanics of the deceptive accounting practices
under investigation at the former CUC operations.
</P>
<P>
   The board is still waiting for Deloitte &AMP; Touche's formal audit
of its restated financial results for the last three years, and
Arthur Andersen's full report on who was responsible for the
apparent fraud, which may mean that more than 60 percent of CUC's
1997 profits were fictitious.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of those accounting irregularities caused
Cendant's stock to fall 46 percent on April 16 and caused a
firestorm of alarm among shareholders, employees and franchise
customers. More than 55 shareholder lawsuits have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' resignation was announced after the market had closed.
Shares of Cendant rose $1.25 Tuesday, to $17, on earlier reports
affirming the company's estimates of the financial damage caused by
the accounting irregularities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Forbes, according to people formerly associated with HFS, began
negotiating the terms of his possible resignation early this month.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement approved by the board Tuesday preserves Forbes'
severance package, which the company valued at $35 million. In
addition, the company agreed not to sue Forbes, provided he is not
found to have been involved in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation Resource Group, executive compensation consultants
based in Pasadena, Calif., estimated that the stock options
available to Forbes under the severance package increased the value
of his severance arrangement to $44 million. The company announced
that it would record a one-time expense of approximately 3 cents a
share in the third quarter to cover the expense of the severance
package.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company warned Wall Street that its
revised operating profits would be affected considerably more than
it had estimated in April, but the auditors Tuesday reassured the
board that no additional surprises are likely to hit the company's
financial statements as result of the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also confirmed that it is meeting regularly with
federal prosecutors in Newark, N.J., who are investigating the
case, and with lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant has disclosed that the accounting problems under
investigation affected not only the shopping-club membership
program at CUC, as it had reported in April, but also ``all the
major business units of CUC,'' extending back to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Revised financial statements for Cendant are expected by early
August, which will allow the company to move toward completion of
its pending acquisition of American Bankers Insurance Group. That
acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, and regulators
cannot review the deal without valid financial statements and a
corporate management team that can withstand scrutiny. &QL;

HERMOSILLO CONTINUES QUEST FOR GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As Carlos Hermosillo continues his quest for
a Major League Soccer goal _ an interminable wait, it seems -- Los
Angeles Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano is trying his hardest to be
patient.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy, but the rewards, should they arrive, could be
handsome. The 33-year-old Mexican striker scored 275 goals in 457
games south of the border; once he finds the net for the Galaxy,
the logic goes, the floodgates should open.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get another chance to start the deluge this evening, when
the Galaxy (16-5, 46 points visits the Dallas Burn (10-11, 22), a
matchup that -- if the previous meetings are any indication --
could provide Hermosillo the perfect opportunity to score. The
Burn, which snapped a nine-game regulation winless streak on
Saturday, has surrendered 12 goals in two games against the Galaxy,
eight in the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he steps on the field, it's a new opportunity for
him,'' says Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano, whose worries concerning
the lumbering center forward aren't solely about production.
``Every opportunity is an important opportunity for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a pure goalscorer, has five assists, but no goals,
in seven games since joining the Galaxy in early June, and he has
found it difficult to fit into L.A.'s fluid attacking scheme
involving Cobi Jones, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Welton, Martin Machon,
Clint Mathis and Ezra Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, Zambrano says, is in a transitionary phase, trying
to redefine itself with Hermosillo, toil that would be made easier
by a few goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the transition proves to be fruitful or not remains to
be seen,'' says Zambrano. ``I always think a player like Carlos can
add to a team. At the same time, we need to make sure the things
that were working in the past don't get completely erased. ...
We're not used to dealing with a true striker. We've never really
had one. There are pluses and minuses that come with that. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can talk about disappointment yet. It's too
early to evaluate. More time has to pass. Now it's a matter of
giving him the confidence to perform, be patient and do his best,
and eventually that will translate into goals.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Hermosillo, acquired primarily as a box-office draw,
sees things. He's still coming to terms with the faster-paced, more
physical American game and continues to work on his fitness, which
lagged during nearly two months of inactivity before joining the
Galaxy; he says he's not frustrated -- Zambrano says he is _ just a
little anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with my experience realizes that sometimes the goals
don't fall,'' he said Tuesday. ``I'm very confident that when I
score my first, a bunch of others will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had his first on Saturday, a miskicked roller that
sneaked into D.C. United's net but was disallowed because of an
offside call. Tonight, he'll try to do it right. He'd better soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, coaches get judged by results and
goalscorers get judged by goals. We have to think the time is now
for him to perform. We have to believe that the next games will be
the ones where we see who Carlos Hermosillo is. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The time will come when we look back and evaluate what Carlos
has contributed. It it is deemed a positive (contribution), we'll
definitely continue on the road we've set for ourselves. If not,
something has to change.''

Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky received a sweeping grant of
immunity from federal prosecution Tuesday, in exchange for a
promise to testify that she and President Clinton had agreed to
deny that they had a sexual relationship, two lawyers familiar with
her account said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did deny under oath that they had
a sexual relationship. But in discussions leading to the immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors this week that she and the
president had a sexual relationship that began in 1995. The
25-year-old former White House intern now admits she lied in the
sworn affidavit she submitted in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit in January.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said Tuesday that Ms. Lewinsky had indicated
to prosecutors that the president discussed with her how to
characterize their relationship in December, when they were both
under subpoena in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions were crucial to reaching the broad immunity deal
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr announced Tuesday. Ms.
Lewinsky pledged her ``full and truthful testimony'' in exchange
for freedom from the threat of prosecution. Ms. Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, received a similar grant of immunity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the immunity arrangement, Ms. Lewinsky is prepared to
testify that the president told her that he planned to deny a
relationship and if they both denied it, no one would know the
truth, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is also prepared to say that the president
encouraged her to say that her many visits to the White House after
she lost her job there in 1996 were to see Betty Currie, Clinton's
private secretary, and not the president himself, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's proposed testimony contradicts Clinton's
assertions in public and under oath about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after the alleged affair became public, Clinton
emphatically denied in a public statement having sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky or encouraging her or anyone else to lie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton did not comment in public about the immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Mike McCurry, said Clinton told aides he was
``pleased that things are working out'' for Ms. Lewinsky. The
president had nothing more to say about the matter, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal _ which protects Ms. Lewinsky from virtually
any possibility of prosecution except for perjury in her future
grand jury testimony _ poses serious problems for Clinton if he has
been less than truthful in his previous public and sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's assertions go beyond the question of whether they
engaged in some form of sexual behavior and reach the marrow of
Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is seeking to learn whether Clinton or close advisers
committed perjury, witness tampering or obstruction of justice in
seeking to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawyers familiar with her account, Ms. Lewinsky
is prepared to testify that no one from the White House helped her
prepare the ``talking points'' that she gave to her colleague,
Linda Tripp, who recorded 20 hours of their conversation. It was
not known Tuesday night whether she identified anyone as helping
her prepare them The talking points seemed intended to coach Mrs.
Tripp in possible testimony about Clinton, and for months they had
been seen as a centerpiece of the obstruction of justice inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly refused to discuss Ms. Lewinsky's
potential grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal came after months of fitful negotiations
between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers and lawyers from Starr's office.
William Ginsburg, the California medical malpractice lawyer who
represented Ms. Lewinsky in the early months of the inquiry, openly
mocked Starr's prosecution team and all but dared them to indict
her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family dismissed Ginsburg in early June and her
new legal team of experienced Washington defense lawyers quickly
opened talks with Starr that led to Tuesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Ms. Lewis, whose grand jury testimony
last winter was suspended after she broke down on the witness
stand, also reached an immunity deal with prosecutors Tuesday, said
her lawyer, Billy Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants Ms. Lewis' complete story because Ms. Lewinsky
shared with her mother many details of her dealings with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis' lawyer sought immunity to protect her from any
charges that might arise from advice she gave her daughter about
how to respond to the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, McCurry said in a testy and abbreviated briefing for
reporters, was not concerned about Ms. Lewinsky's impending
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president, obviously,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that he believed Clinton's earlier denials of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky contradicts those denials, McCurry was asked, is
she lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would presume so, yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's account of her conversations with Clinton in
which she said he urged her to deny a sexual relationship recall an
account told by Gennifer Flowers in the 1992 presidential campaign.
Ms. Flowers said that Clinton told her to deny a relationship if
reporters asked and he would do the same and no witnesses could
contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denials, Clinton admitted in his January
deposition in the Jones case that he had had sex once with Ms.
Flowers, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, remained in
negotiations with prosecutors over how the president would respond
to a subpoena for his testimony. White House officials and others
involved in the inquiry indicated that Clinton is seeking to delay
his testimony for several weeks, citing the heavy demands of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, seeking to justify the president's desire for delay,
said, ``He's going to be a busy guy. He's the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return telephone calls seeking comment. He was
seen at the federal courthouse this afternoon but the reason for
his visit could not be learned. ``It's under seal so we're all in
Kabuki-land,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has become familiar since the sensational
sex-and-perjury allegations became public in January, reporters
gathered outside the office of Ms. Lewinsky's lead lawyer, Plato
Cacheris, in downtown Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, arriving in a taxi, was escorted through the
surging throng by Judy Smith, her spokeswoman. Ms. Lewinsky arrived
in Washington this morning after spending five hours with several
of Starr's deputies in Manhattan on Monday reviewing her proposed
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and his co-counsels, Jacob Stein and Nathaniel
Speights, reached the immunity agreement with the office of
independent counsel Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m., Cacheris walked to the bank of microphones
outside his office and delivered a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky,'' Cacheris said, ``reached
an agreement today which provides that Ms. Lewinsky's full and
truthful testimony is the basis for the OIC's grant of full
transactional immunity from prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Transactional immunity is a rarely granted full guarantee that a
witness cannot be prosecuted for any crime related to the matter
under investigation, in exchange for full disclosure. But the
witness could face perjury charges and a revocation of immunity if
a prosecutor believes that the witness has lied about a material
fact in sworn testimony.

 WASHINGTON: sworn testimony.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse today, Ms. Tripp, onetime friend of
Ms. Lewinsky, who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations,
appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he interpreted the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Starr as ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is apparently finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

ADVERTISING: `XANAX. JUST DO IT.' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember that old slogan for Bufferin asking ``Why
trade a headache for an upset stomach?'' A new survey on a hot
trend in advertising _ aiming sales pitches for prescription drugs
directly at users rather than at doctors _ indicates that consumers
may be pondering a similar question today.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the results of the survey, which was sponsored by
Prevention magazine, are generally favorable toward what is known
as direct-to-consumer advertising. Such ads are appearing virtually
everywhere since the Food and Drug Administration decided in August
to relax rules governing prescription drug ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some cautionary aspects to the survey data.
For one, consumers say they worry whether these ads diminish
prescription drugs by likening them to heavily advertised packaged
goods. And the ads seem to get subpar grades for usefulness and
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line shows the consumer is benefiting,'' said
Stephen Giannetti, the New York-based associate publisher of
Prevention, published by Rodale Press Inc. ``But this is still in
its early stages, and it's too soon to tell what may happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the survey, conducted nationally among 1,200
adults in March and April by Princeton Survey Research Associates,
are to be presented at a luncheon Wednesday afternoon in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-to-consumer advertising is beneficial, Giannetti said in
a telephone interview Tuesday, primarily because ``it's encouraging
a dialogue between doctor and patient.'' Indeed, the survey found
that 33 percent of those who have seen such ads have spoken to
their doctors about an advertised drug. Of those consumers, 28
percent asked for prescriptions _ and 80 percent of such requests
were granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about empowering people with information,'' Giannetti
said, ``which they're thirsting for because they're a little
disenchanted with the health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before self-medication and self-care were in vogue,
Prevention had advocated that consumers take control of their
health care regimen and familiarize themselves with data on drugs,
nutrition, diet and exercise. In fact, 74 percent of the survey
respondents agreed strongly or mostly with the statement that
direct-to-consumer drug ads ``allow people to become more involved
with their health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct advertising has increased substantially since the
regulations were eased. Consumers are now being bombarded by slick
campaigns hawking medications like Allegra, Prozac, Valtrex and
Zocor. Until recently, those products had been advertised almost
solely to physicians. But to be aimed directly at consumers, the
FDA has declared, TV commercials must include some information
about the potential risks associated with the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Slaughter, market research director for Prevention at the
Rodale headquarters in Emmaus, Pa., said that means ``the
advertising includes what are essentially reasons not to buy the
product at the same time you're being sold the product.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When have we ever seen that before?'' he asked, adding, ``It's
a whole new genre of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that those who are taking medicines they see
being advertised say the ads make them feel better about the drugs,
make them more likely to take the drugs and remind them to have
their prescriptions refilled. Yet 61 percent of the respondents
agreed strongly or mostly with the statement that such ads
``confuse people about the risks and benefits'' of prescription
medicines _ just shy of the 67 percent who said they agreed
strongly or mostly with the statement that such ads ``educate
people about the risks and benefits'' of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That can be seen in another part of the survey showing that
respondents _ ``even those suffering from the conditions the
products are intended to treat,'' Slaughter said _ often were
unaware of that information. For instance, 59 percent of the
intended audience for Imitrex said they did not know it was meant
to treat migraine headaches, even after seeing ads for that brand;
the figure for Pravachol, a drug for high cholesterol, was 79
percent. And 55 percent said they agreed strongly or mostly with
the statement that direct-to-consumer ads make prescription drugs
``seem harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legitimate concern,'' Slaughter said, ``that if we
start advertising this like corn flakes, does it trivialize
medicine?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it seems as if it will be a mighty long time
before consumers see ads carrying catchy slogans like ``Xanax, just
do it'' or watch cute lizards disparaging frogs that croak
``Cla-ri-tin.''

U.S. swaggers into opener
<TEXT>
<P>
   Team members confident; Rudy T remains cautious
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Fifteen nations will send out their best players
today as the FIBA World Championship of Basketball begins.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the United States, which has none of its top
400 players on the roster of 12 brave men led by Rudy Tomjanovich.
But what the team of non-NBA players has is one of the same
admirable qualities Dream Teams before it also shared _ an
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not the same swagger Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley,
Shaquille O'Neal and others had in the past two Olympics or at the
'94 World Championship. But this team of little-known players knows
how to act the part of the big bully on the basketball block.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team opens the tournament today against Brazil at 9:30
a.m. CDT. It will be the first of three preliminary-round games
against the other three teams in the group.
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans expect nothing but good things in the opening
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't go 3-0, it's going to be an embarrassment to
ourselves and our country,'' starting power forward David Wood said
Tuesday after the team's final practice before the tourney. ``They
are all good teams. But we have the tradition. It would be like the
Celtics or the Lakers not making the playoffs in the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   First-round success is critical for the United States or any
team that hopes to contend for a medal in this 12-day tournament.
The field will be pared to the top three teams in each of the four
groups after preliminary play. Records will be carried over into
the second round, which will trim four teams from medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are seeded after the second round, and an eight-team,
single-elimination tournament begins.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is considered a gold-medal contender. But with a
relatively easy group that includes Lithuania and South Korea in
addition to Brazil, going 3-0 would seem a realistic goal in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to finish first in our group after the first three
games and get in a rhythm for the whole tournament,'' Wendell
Alexis said. ``Especially playing three nights in a row. You want
to be at your best for three nights in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a disappointment (going anything less than 3-0),
because I think we're the best of the four teams. But that doesn't
mean anything if you get on the court and don't execute. If the
other team gets confidence, it can get very difficult. You can't
lighten up on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't go 3-0 until you are 1-0. That's a point
Tomjanovich has stressed to his team during the days leading to the
World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's monumental that we get off to a good start,''
Tomjanovich said. ``But things happen. If we did come out and lose,
we'd just have to come out and tighten up some more and make sure
we don't lose again. But we're trying to win every game. That's why
you compete. You have to give respect to your opponent, but you
have to compete very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this team, we're playing to win. Nobody expects us to
win. And those kind of challenges are great. I don't know what's
going to happen with this team, but I do know that I have a bunch
of hungry, proud players who look at this opportunity as something
that most people don't get a chance to experience. Emotionally, I'm
going to be so much more involved in this thing because of how hard
these guys have worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich's team is made up of players who have been
basketball nomads, moving from Continental Basketball Association
teams to European clubs to South America. One of them, Duke's
Trajan Langdon, is a collegiate star. But he also is one of the
players trying to prove himself because two years ago he was a
member of the U.S. junior team that was a disappointment in the
FIBA age-group tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worn the USA jersey two other times, before my freshman
year and after my freshman year,'' Langdon said. ``And after my
freshman year was the junior world championships here in Athens and
we just had a really bad showing. We went 4-4, and it was kind of
embarrassing the way we performed as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, obviously, back here in Athens for the World Championship
to represent the USA at a time when the NBA players decided not to
come, it's exciting. Throwing on the jersey, I'll probably have
chills going onto the court.''
</P>
<P>
   As will many of the U.S. players. Before one of the exhibition
games leading to the tournament, Jimmy Oliver had his wife
videotape him while he was putting on the uniform in the hotel
room. It was something he wanted to remember for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Brazil, which is not considered a medal threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at their roster, and they've got a 7-footer
(Josuel dos Santos) who had some good games at the Goodwill
Games,'' said the 6-9 Wood, who could be matched up against the
260-pound Brazilian. ``And they've got a few other guys who can
score. Any professional team in this tournament can beat any other
team if the favored team plays terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned a little more after we played Italy. I thought
we could get into people defensively and control the game
defensively, but the Italians didn't seem to have much trouble with
our defense. We're going to have some really hard, tough games, and
it'll boil down to how well we execute in the last five or six
minutes of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are cautious, but they also are confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of anybody,'' point guard Michael Hawkins
said. ``We fear no team when we step on the court. We're coming out
to win every game. That's our goal for these next three games, and
I think we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that attitude, at least the Americans sound like a Dream
Team, even if that's the only resemblance.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be easier for Chris Schwartz, rap producer
and high school dropout, to reveal the secrets of his success if
his cellular phone would stop ringing. Or if he would stop
answering it. Not that he's not apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I REALLY am sorry,'' Schwartz says; then, to a distressed
artist on the other end of the line one suspects is singer Lauryn
Hill, about to come out with her first solo album:
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he didn't say you were going to look like an icon; he's
afraid that's what people are going to THINK.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause. ``I think it's very roots, very cool, everybody digs
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause. ``You just have to look where he is in the corporate
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of Ruffhouse Records, in
the corporate culture?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion is taking place in the Manhattan offices of Sony
(which owns Columbia Records, which distributes Ruffhouse), but
Schwartz's phone style, which is more colorful and direct than his
interview style, leans toward the street: ``Yo, man,'' or ``Dude, I
know nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as this is the music business, maybe street talk is
the correct corporate style.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Schwartz, 37, is certainly doing something right.
Operating out of Conshohocken, Pa., Ruffhouse Records, which
Schwartz and his partner, Joe Nicolo, founded nine years ago with
$400, has been home to some of the biggest names in hip-hop: Kriss
Kross, Cypress Hill and the Fugees. The Fugees' ``The Score,'' with
sales of 17 million copies, is the all-time best-selling album by a
rap group. Schwartz is now a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Schwartz special, however, is his salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career managing Philadelphia gangsta rapper
Schoolly D, one of the first rap artists to cross over to a
mainstream audience. Schwartz also claims to have been the first
producer to take to the streets to sell his records, giving records
and stickers to club deejays and teen-agers rather than depending
on radio play.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics proved a little aggressive for New York _ last
winter, the leader of one of Ruffhouse's promotional street gangs
was arrested on charges that he was illegally posting stickers for
the group Sporty Thiev$. Columbia Records executives were publicly
displeased, and Schwartz is enough of a corporate creature to
decline to discuss the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Schwartz consider the subject of his race important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're black or white,'' Schwartz says.
``What's important is to sign the right people, to get your stuff
out there. I do that. I make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolly D is recalling how he hooked up with Schwartz: ``You
know West Philly? It's a black neighborhood. When Chris called, I
thought he was a black dude pretending to be white. It was rap, it
was hip-hop, I didn't know anybody white who was even remotely
interested. This is '84, '85, it's a black thing, yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren, my attorney at the time, never told me Chris was
white. I'm in the shower, Chris is ringing my bell, I go
downstairs, say, `Who are you?' I let him in. I'm just sitting
there in my towel. We start talking, we start laughing. Anybody who
can make me laugh is all right with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Schoolly D have a given name he uses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only around my mother,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times is somewhat like one's mother.
</P>
<P>
   No response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 30 or 40 guys around us, we were the only two who had the
killer look in our eyes,'' Schoolly D says regarding the old days.
``Everybody else just wanted drugs or they were chick hounds,
typical rock 'n' roll. When it was time to be real and the smoke
cleared, he was standing over there and I was standing over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is a gene for salesmen. This seems to be the case
with Schwartz. He was born in Devon, Pa., his father was a
furniture salesman, and all but one of Schwartz's nine brothers and
sisters would grow up and go into sales. Schwartz dropped out of
school in the 10th grade and joined the Navy at 17. He also formed
a band, which set up on the deck of an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like the warm-up act for the Blue Angels,'' Schwartz
says.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz worked as a musician, then hooked up with Schoolly D.
Schwartz persuaded the owners of a small record company in New
Jersey to produce records on credit _ a move that was particularly
impressive because the company produced children's records, and
Schoolly D, a gangsta rapper, was not producing material that was
Disneyesque.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffhouse was created in 1989. Cypress Hill, a Los Angeles group
that championed marijuana, was the label's first success, with a
debut album that was on the Billboard charts for more than 100
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a more alternative following than core hip-hop, and
we took advantage of that,'' Schwartz says. ``We put them on the
cover of High Times magazine. But our promotions are always
changing. When you sell a record, you are vying for a slice of a
kid's awareness. With all the media glut, it's hard to hold
somebody's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Schwartz believe it takes to be a good salesman?
</P>
<P>
   His answer puts the street talk in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be able to read people.''

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S DEPOSITION ON LEWINSKY IN JONES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-TACTICS, CLINTON-LEWINSKY,
CLINTON-LEWINSKY-CHRONO) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from President Clinton's
deposition, given on Jan. 17, 1998, in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, and released by the Jones legal team as part of
its opposition to dismissal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Clinton was questioned by Mrs. Jones' lawyers
about former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who had been
subpoenaed by Mrs. Jones' lawyers. In separate sworn testimony, Ms.
Lewinsky and the president denied that they had had a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Jones case has been dismissed and is under
appeal. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a federal grand jury is
investigating perjury, suborning of perjury, witness tampering and
obstruction of justice in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION. Now do you know a woman named Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   MR. CLINTON. I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you know her?
</P>
<P>
   A. She worked in the White House for a while, first as an
intern, and then in, as the, in the legislative affairs office. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that when she worked at the White House she met
with you several times?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know about several times. There was a period when the
Republican Congress shut the government down that the whole White
House was being run by interns, and she was assigned to work back
in the chief of staff's office, and we were all working there, and
so I saw her on two or three occasions then, and then when she
worked at the White House, I think there was one or two other times
when she brought some documents to me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. At any time were you and Monica alone together in the Oval
Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the
legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the
weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd
bring me things on the weekends. She _ it seems to me she brought
things to me once or twice on the weekends. In that case, whatever
time she would be in there, drop it off, exchange a few words and
go, she was there. I don't have any specific recollections of what
the issues were, what was going on, but when the Congress is there,
we're working all the time, and typically I would do some work on
one of the days of the weekends in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So I understand, your testimony is that it was possible,
then, that you were alone with her, but you have no specific
recollections of that ever happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's correct. It's possible that she, in, while she
was working there, brought something to me and that at the time she
brought it to me, she was the only person there. That's possible. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you recall ever walking with Lewinsky down the hallway
from the Oval Office to your private kitchen there in the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let me try to describe the facts first, because you
keep talking about this private kitchen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Now, to go back to your question, my recollection is that, that
at some point during the government shutdown, when Ms. Lewinsky was
still an intern but was working the chief staff's office because
all the employees had to go home, that she was back there with a
pizza that she brought to me and to others. I do not believe she
was there alone, however. I don't think she was. And my
recollection is that on a couple of occasions after that she was
there but my secretary, Betty Currie, was there with her. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever met with Monica Lewinsky in the White House
between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I certainly don't think so. . . . Now, let me just say, when
she was working there, during, there may have been a time when we
were all _ we were up working late. There are lots of, on any given
night, when the Congress is in session, there are always several
people around until late in the night, but I don't have any memory
of that. I just can't say that there could have been a time when
that occurred, I just _ but I don't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Certainly if it happened, nothing remarkable would have
occurred?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, nothing remarkable. I don't remember it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. When was the last time you spoke with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm trying to remember. Probably some time before Christmas.
She came by to see Betty sometime before Christmas. And she was
there talking to her, and I stuck my head out, said hello to her. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she tell you she had been served with a subpoena in this
case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I don't know if she had been.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that
Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she was, I
think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I want to be
as accurate as I can.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you talk to Lindsey about what action, if any, should be
taken as a result of her being served with a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever talked to Monica Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure, and let me tell you why I'm not sure. It seems
to me the, the, the __ I want to be as accurate as I can here.
Seems to me the last time she was there to see Betty before
Christmas we were joking about how you-all, with the help of the
Rutherford Institute, were going to call every woman I'd ever
talked to, and I said, you know __
</P>
<P>
   And I said that you-all might call every woman I ever talked to
and ask them that, and so I said you would qualify, or something
like that. I don't, I don't think we ever had more of a
conversation than that about it, but I might have mentioned
something to her about it, because when I saw how long the witness
list was, or I heard about it, before I saw, but actually by the
time I saw it her name was in it, but I think that was after all
this had happened. I might have said something like that, so I
don't want to say for sure I didn't, because I might have said
something like that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall. Do you know what they were?
</P>
<P>
   Q. A hat pin?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't, I don't remember. But I certainly, I could have.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A book about Walt Whitman?
</P>
<P>
   A. I give __ let me just say, I give people a lot of gifts, and
when people are around I give a lot of things I have at the White
House away, so I could have given her a gift, but I don't remember
a specific gift. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has Monica Lewinsky ever given you any gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Once or twice. I think she's given me a book or two.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she give you a silver cigar box?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she give you a tie?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, she had given me a tie before. I believe that's right. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you
beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think I used the term ``sexual affair.'' And so the record
is completely clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as
modified by the Court. . .
</P>
<P>
   A. I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've
never had an affair with her.

`GODZILLA' HOPING TO ROAR LOUDER ON HOME VIDEO

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Godzilla,'' who promised far more than he
delivered in the box office or at the cash register, will hit home
video shelves in early November amid moderately sunny forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives believe the video version of ``Godzilla,'' which
grossed a disappointing $135 million domestically, will outsell the
estimated 8 million copies of ``Air Force One'' the company sold
last year. With a suggested price of $14.95, gross revenues from
video could top the domestic box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grossing $135 million is nothing to sneeze at,'' said analyst
Barbara McNamara of Alexander and Associates. ``I expect (the
video) to do respectably.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, video chains like Blockbuster may wonder about the appeal
of ``Godzilla.'' The movie's downbeat results were blamed by
Carmike Cinemas and Hershey Foods, a major ``Godzilla'' partner,
for holding down profits during the fiscal second quarter. And
analysts believe slow movement of ``Godzilla'' merchandise hurt toy
sales, although toy retailers didn't single out the giant lizard
for any fiscal woes.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's timing of the announcement also reflects the fact that
the film has virtually disappeared from multiplexes. Usually,
studios wait until after Labor Day to announce video plans for
major summer films in order to maximize the box-office potential.
</P>
<P>
   Duracell and Dreyer's Ice Cream will launch tie-in promotions
for the video this fall, and TV ads are designed to make more than
1.2 billion consumer impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives also have predicted that a simultaneous release
of ``Godzilla'' in the DVD format, priced at $24.95 with
documentary footage and background commentary, will top 400,000
copies in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The record for video sales of live-action films is estimated to
be 20 million copies by ``Independence Day,'' although ``Titanic''
may beat that when it arrives in stores Sept. 1.

NO RACISM IN PROBLEMS WITH SOX, VAUGHN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn said Tuesday that his problems with
the Red Sox are not racial in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a racial thing,'' said Vaughn, contradicting
assertions made by guest Ken Ford on WBZ-TV in Boston Sunday night
that the club had conveyed the message, ``OK, black boy, you can go
out and play but keep your mouth shut,'' to the first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, ``Sports Final,'' Channel 4's Steve Burton
said Vaughn informed him that general manager Dan Duquette asked
Vaughn point-blank whether he used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday if Duquette ever asked him about drug use, Vaughn
said, ``A couple of years ago, when I had an irregular heartbeat in
spring training, Dan said it must have something to do with
substance abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his other assertion that the Red Sox had him followed by a
private investigator, Vaughn offered no specifics but said he was
certain it was true. ``I can't tell you how I know,'' he said,
``but that's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with both Channel 4 and the Globe, Duquette denied
that the Red Sox had ever had Vaughn followed by a private
investigator or that the club had ever accused him of drug use. The
club did ask Vaughn to submit to an alcohol evaluation this past
spring, which he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was booed throughout last weekend at Fenway Park after he
told a Toronto reporter that he wanted to play for the Blue Jays
next season. By the end of the weekend, however, the boos were
mixed with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt relief to get away from Boston for the next two
weeks while the Red Sox play 12 games in four cities, Vaughn said,
``It's really a relief just to play, man. I'm glad we won three out
of four.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who had at least one hit in all four games of the Blue
Jays series, said he did not speak with Duquette last weekend.
``What's he going to say?'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was asked if he thought there was a chance he would be
traded before Friday's deadline. ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I
don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was learned Tuesday that within the last couple of weeks, the
Red Sox had internal discussions about trading Vaughn to the
Chicago White Sox for Frank Thomas, the first baseman who is having
an off season (.257 average). What is not known is whether the Red
Sox approached the White Sox about such a deal. Duquette, who
remained back in Boston when the team went on the road, said last
week it was ``doubtful'' he would trade Vaughn before Friday's
deadline.

 WASHINGTON: sworn testimony.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse today, Ms. Tripp, onetime friend of
Ms. Lewinsky, who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations,
appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he interpreted the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Starr as ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is apparently finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

LEWINSKY AGREES TO TESTIFY IN CLINTON INVESTIGATION AFTER RECEIVING
IMMUNITY DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky was granted immunity from
prosecution Tuesday after she agreed to tell a federal grand jury
that she and President Clinton engaged in sex at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern, who previously denied under oath
having an affair with the president, also will testify, sources
said, that Clinton suggested they both deny the relationship was
sexual.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a five-hour session in New York with prosecutors
from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's office, Lewinsky met with
her attorneys in Washington on Tuesday and signed the agreement
that puts her in a position to pit her word against the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyers announced that she was being granted full
immunity in return for cooperating in Starr's investigation. The
immunity deal also extends to Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, who
reportedly talked by telephone with her 25-year-old daughter about
the relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, have reached an agreement
today that, for her full and truthful testimony, she will receive
transactional immunity in this case,'' attorney Plato Cacheris told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Transactional immunity is a rarely granted guarantee that a
witness will not be prosecuted for any crime related to the matter
under investigation. However, the immunity can be withdrawn and the
witness could face perjury charges if a prosecutor can prove the
witness lied while testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Citing two unnamed attorneys familiar with the case, The New
York Times reported Lewinsky is prepared to testify that in late
December the president told her he planned to lie under oath when
asked if they engaged in sex and that if they both denied it, no
one would know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also is prepared to say Clinton urged her to tell
investigators that her visits to the White House were not to see
him but to chat with Betty Currie, the president's private
secretary, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's immunity deal was announced nine weeks to the day
after Cacheris and lawyer Jake Stein joined Lewinsky's legal team.
Since then, the two lawyers and defense lawyer Nathaniel Speights
revived talks with Starr that had broken down after he rejected an
immunity deal _ somewhat similar to Tuesday's agreement _ brokered
by former Lewinsky attorney William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   A break in the apparent impasse came last week, according to The
Associated Press, which quoted unnamed sources saying that Stein
received a telephone call from Starr saying he was reluctant to
indict Lewinsky and that they should cut a deal before it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers wanted immunity for Lewinsky because of the legal
trouble posed by an affidavit, or sworn statement, she provided to
lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In that
document, Lewinsky denied having sex with Clinton. Telling grand
jurors something different would mean one version was perjury,
which is a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's immunity-for-testimony deal increases the pressure on
Clinton _ who has denied having sex with the former aide or urging
anyone to lie _ as he mulls how to respond to a subpoena to appear
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to downplay this latest development in the six-month
sex-and-perjury investigation, White House spokesman Mike McCurry
said the president ``is pleased that things are working out'' for
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside assertions that Lewinsky's impending grand jury
testimony would contradict Clinton's statements, McCurry said that
under the agreement ``she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony, and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the situation is working out for the president,
McCurry replied: ``It will eventually ... because sooner or later,
this matter will come to some kind of end. And it would help.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president and White House lawyers had not
decided yet whether to ask the Supreme Court to overturn a federal
appeals court ruling issued Monday compelling Deputy White House
Counsel Bruce Lindsey, Clinton's longtime friend and confidant, to
cooperate with Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton also talked with his private lawyer, David
Kendall, about the subpoena from Starr seeking the president's
testimony before the grand jury. Later, Kendall and representatives
from Starr's office were seen entering the federal courthouse for a
meeting with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who is
overseeing the grand jury being used by Starr in the Lewinsky case.
The lawyers left an hour later without commenting.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton could challenge Starr's subpoena, it appeared that
the president was prepared to provide testimony for grand jurors if
he could do it without a history-making trip to the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grand jurors were hearing testimony from Secret
Service officers and from Linda Tripp, whose secret tape recordings
of conversations with Lewinsky triggered Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by her spokesman, Tripp said she was
encouraged by the deal worked out to secure testimony from
Lewinsky. ``It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to tell
at least a portion of the truth,'' Tripp said. ``I encourage her
and all other witnesses not only to tell the truth but to tell the
whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tapes reportedly caught Lewinsky describing an 18-month
sexual affair with Clinton and efforts by the president and his
associates to keep it from becoming a part of Jones' lawsuit.

SENATE VOTE IS BIG WIN FOR CREDIT UNIONS  
 BY PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - CREDIT   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The U.S. Senate gave a big boost to credit unions yesterday in
their battle to reverse a U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely
restricts their ability to add new members.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By a 92-to-6 vote, the Senate passed a bill that would let
credit unions add members from outside groups so long as they come
from organizations with fewer than 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The motion follows a 411-to-8 vote by the House in April to
overturn the Supreme Court decision that banned federally chartered
credit unions from including more than one group in their
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an overwhelming victory for consumers and credit
unions who serve them,'' said David Chatfield, president of the
California Credit Union League, which represents more than 600
credit unions serving close to 8 million California members.
</P>
<P>
   Once differences between the Senate and House bills are ironed
out and the resulting bill is signed by the president in an
estimated four to six weeks, Chatfield said, ``Credit unions once
again will be able to serve businesses too small to have credit
unions of their own as they had been able to do before being
stopped by lawsuits by banking associations.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Credit Union League estimates that the ban on
adding members has kept 1,000 consumers a day from joining their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area institutions that have been hit particularly hard
include Embarcadero Federal Credit Union in San Francisco and New
World Federal Credit Union in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's 11,500 nonprofit credit unions have
presented themselves as David-fighting-Goliath banks, the banking
industry has cried foul because credit unions compete with them for
the same customers but pay no corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit unions have a tax subsidy exceeding $1 billion a
year,'' noted Bill McQuillan, president of the Independent Bankers
Association of America. ``A hot dog vendor in any ball park pays
more in federal taxes than the entire credit union industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1934 federal act that established credit unions limited
their membership to ``groups having a common bond of occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the National Credit Union Administration interpreted
this to mean that credit unions could have several groups of
employees so long as each group had its own common bond.
</P>
<P>
   After credit unions proceeded to add millions of new members,
some banks and the American Bankers Association filed suit in 1990
claiming that the NCUA violated the original Federal Credit Union
Act. The banks won their suit on appeal in 1996, and this past
February, the Supreme Court upheld the bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But in an election year, politicians including California
Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer have overwhelmingly
backed the credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the legislation passed by the Senate yesterday
faces a few hurdles. It lacks a House provision favored by Clinton
that would require credit unions to follow some of the same
fair-lending rules required of banks. That difference between the
two bills needs to be resolved before it is sent to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything in the Senate bill was good news to credit
unions. Patelco Credit Union chief executive Ed Callahn said he
opposed a provision that sets a cap of 12.25 percent of credit
union assets that can be lent to businesses. But he said that,
overall, the bill was good for U.S. credit unions and their 72
million members.

COMMENTARY: THIS WAY LIES MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK RICH   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitol police officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson had
hardly been declared dead when Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sent
out a press release arguing that tighter gun control could have
prevented the tragedy. Not missing a beat, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott was soon arguing that a $125 million bunker-barricade
camouflaged as a visitors' center would repel future assailants.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where most politicians are so ignorant about
mental illness that they still think that Whitewater, not the
disease of depression, drove Vincent Foster to suicide, no one said
the obvious: It is the gaping cracks in American mental-health
care, not in Capitol security or gun-control laws, that most
clearly delivered Russell Weston Jr. to his rendezvous with
history.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's paranoid schizophrenia surfaced long ago. Yet, as The
New York Times reported, this now 41-year-old man ``received no
regular psychiatric treatment or medication over the last two
decades and (his) family seemed to understand little about how to
seek help for him.'' This is hardly an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist who campaigns for better
mental-health care through the Treatment Advocacy Center in
Arlington, Va., says that of the 2 to 2.5 million Americans with
schizophrenia, ``40 percent are not receiving treatment on any
given day.'' Cases like Weston's _ in which a mental patient eludes
follow-up care and medication after a hospital release _ number
``in the hundreds of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   How does this happen? Nearly as heartbreaking as the preventable
murders of officers Chestnut and Gibson is the plight of Weston's
family. They obviously love their child; they knew he was sick;
they wanted to get him help. But, as Russell Sr. said: ``He was a
grown man. We couldn't hold him down and force the pills into
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive system of mental-health services, including
support for parents with sick adult children who refuse treatment,
doesn't exist. If it had, the Westons might have had more success
in rescuing their son _ as might the equally loving family of
Michael Laudor, the Yale Law School prodigy charged last month with
murdering his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   That safety-net system doesn't exist because mental illness is
still in our culture's shadows _ stigmatized, misunderstood and
therefore the beggar of American health care. Though Weston's home
state of Montana offers particularly skimpy services, the national
baseline is ``not high,'' says Torrey. Poorly covered by health
insurance and spottily served by overcrowded and underfinanced
public institutions, mental illness is ``the last discrimination,''
as Michael Faenza of the National Mental Health Association puts
it, even though we now have the science to treat mental illness at
a success rate comparable to physical illness.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only politicians who are complicit in this
discrimination. The media sometimes compound the ignorance that
feeds it. Too many commentators look at Weston's symptoms _ such as
his paranoid delusions about the CIA _ and lump him in with
gun-toting, anti-government ideologues, making no distinction
between the clinically ill and political extremists.
</P>
<P>
   A Time reporter, on the hapless CNN show ``Newsstand,''
expressed surprise that Weston would so easily be diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic given that he had no previous ``episodes of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the majority of those ill with paranoid schizophrenia
are not violent, and the disease has no ideology. As Sylvia Nasar's
new book, ``A Beautiful Mind,'' documents, many of Weston's oddest
symptoms (including the conviction he was being beamed encrypted
messages) also characterized the paranoid schizophrenia of John
Nash, the brilliant, nonviolent Princeton mathematician who won the
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1835, one of the first patients at Washington's
government Hospital for the Insane _ as St. Elizabeth's Hospital
was then known _ was Richard Lawrence, a pistol-armed man who tried
and failed to assassinate Andrew Jackson in the Capitol's Rotunda.
He was pronounced not guilty by reason of insanity in a trial whose
jury deliberations took five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century and a half of medical and economic advances
later, what kind of progress is it that we still so often fail to
treat the mentally ill until after tragedy strikes?

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ General Motors and the United Automobile Workers
agreed Tuesday to end the nearly eight-week strike at two auto
parts factories here, a dispute that has shut down GM assembly
plants across North America, pushed hundreds of thousands of
workers into temporary unemployment and slowed the nation's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which is subject to ratification votes Wednesday
morning by workers at both factories, settles a wide range of local
issues at the two factories and at several other GM factories where
workers had threatened to strike.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement does not directly address national issues that
the union had publicly declared to be driving the strike, such as
GM's push to open new factories overseas or its effort to shrink
its U.S. work force through attrition. These issues can only be
changed through GM's national agreement with the UAW, which expires
in September 1999 and was not changed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement deals with a series of narrow issues. GM promises
not to sell or close before January 2000 either a speedometer and
spark plug factory on strike here or two brake factories in Dayton,
Ohio, where workers had threatened a strike this summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM also agrees to invest $180 million in new equipment at the
other factory on strike here, which makes auto body parts. In
exchange, the automaker gets changes in work rules, notably a 15
percent increase in the number of parts that some welders are
required to make before stopping work.
</P>
<P>
   In February, GM canceled its plans to invest the $180 million
because workers were drawing eight hours pay for four to six hours
of work and were resisting increases in production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a somewhat surprising element, a promise
by both sides' leaders to have regular meetings as a way to rebuild
their relationship and head off further confrontations. But company
and union officials already meet periodically and have been unable
to bridge disagreements that produce several factory-level strikes
almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   Each side suffered enormous losses. Analysts estimate that GM
lost $3 billion after taxes and saw its sales drop by $12 billion,
the heaviest losses ever incurred by an American company during a
strike, at least before adjusting for inflation. The UAW's 200,000
members lost paychecks totaling $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM can recover as much as half of the lost profits by running
its factories around the clock for months to make up for lost
production. UAW workers will earn ample overtime in the coming
weeks, although not enough to balance the paychecks lost during the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM had been rising for the last few days on optimism
about an end to the strike. They rose $1.125 Tuesday, to $74.25,
the highest since their $75.25 price when the dispute began on June
5.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of Tuesday's settlement began to emerge in
the first week of talks. The strike lasted so long partly because
the two sides mistrusted each other and partly because GM raised
the stakes by suing the UAW for the first time since 1937,
contending that the strikes violated the national agreement.
</P>
<P>
   GM withdrew its lawsuit Tuesday, along with a grievance in which
an arbitrator had been expected to rule as soon as Wednesday. While
UAW leaders insisted at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that
they had not been intimidated by GM's legal offensive, a UAW
official who insisted on anonymity said that the union had become
worried that it might lose and stepped up talks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the threat of litigation deters the UAW from further strikes
until the national agreement expires, this summer's strikes can be
counted as a small but costly victory for GM. But GM was fortunate
in that its case was assigned to a conservative federal judge who
repeatedly prevented the union from stalling during arbitration,
and the company might not be so fortunate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street analysts said that the company's losses far
exceeded its gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems like it's just exactly the way it was before,''
said Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber. ``I think the
market expected GM to deliver a knockout blow, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be four separate votes on ratification; each of the
factories on strike will hold separate votes for assembly line
workers and for skilled craftsmen like electricians. Agreements to
end other recent strikes at GM factories have been easily approved,
and UAW officials expected that Tuesday's agreement would also
pass, although they predicted some grumbling among workers facing
higher production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   In a provision that is likely to raise eyebrows on Wall Street
but improve the odds of ratification, GM will give a week's pay,
about $800, to all striking and laid-off workers who missed a week
of holiday pay early this month because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified, Tuesday's accord would allow more than a hundred GM
assembly plants and parts factories nationwide to resume production
over the next week, with the factories on strike going back to work
by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   GM would recall 189,000 workers that it temporarily laid off
across North America, while its suppliers would bring back tens of
thousands of workers who had been pushed into unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   GM desperately needs to restock its dealerships, many of which
have been picked bare of popular models during the strike. Ronald
Zarrella, GM's group vice president for sales and marketing, warned
earlier this month that GM could lose thousands of customers, never
to return, if it did not settle the strike by mid-July.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   GM's greatest asset has been the millions of Americans who keep
coming back to its dealerships every several years for a new car.
But once these customers try rival brands, they seldom come back,
which is why GM's market share has shrunk from 50 percent in the
late 1970s to 31 percent this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Restarting the world's largest manufacturing system will be a
formidable task. With the strike costing $75 million a day, GM is
likely to undertake a huge airlift of auto parts to assembly plants
as soon as the two factories here reopen, said Michael Robinet, the
managing director of CSM Forecasting, an auto production consulting
firm in Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes here were particularly acrimonious because both
sides came to see them as struggles over principles. Indeed, Donald
Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car
operations, even said early this month that the cost of the strikes
could not be justified financially. Both sides kept raising the
stakes, bringing up new issues or making new threats in the
mistaken belief that the other side would quickly back down.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, GM executives saw the strikes as a challenge
to their right as managers to decide which factories deserved new
investments and which did not. Union leaders viewed the strikes as
necessary to hold GM to past announcements of investment plans,
notably the $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   GM's decision to remove parts-making equipment from one of the
factories over Memorial Day weekend, fearing a strike, not only
prompted the walkouts but also caused the union's rank and file to
worry that their livelihoods were being threatened, making a
compromise even more difficult. GM returned the equipment on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the strikes wore on, the UAW began publicly depicting them as
a struggle over whether the world's largest company would remain
committed to investing in its home market or would pursue fatter
profits in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the final settlement here did not address GM's plans to
build assembly plants in Argentina, Brazil, China, Poland and
Thailand, as well as auto parts factories in dozens of countries.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been refurbishing factories in the United States but
seldom building new ones, mainly because its steadily falling
market share has already left it with too many inefficient
factories.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, GM aggravated workers' fears about job losses by
talking publicly about possible factory closings after the strike.
Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
Tuesday afternoon that GM officials had not even mentioned the
possibility of factory closings during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker and Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North
American personnel, said in separate news conferences Tuesday that
there had been no changes in the national agreement, particularly
in the sections dealing with how quickly GM can reduce its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   So even if GM chooses to eliminate unprofitable car models and
close factories _ a decision that GM's board will consider Monday _
it will have to continue paying any workers for whom there are no
longer jobs. This makes it unlikely that GM will embark on an
ambitious reorganization, although it might make a few small moves.
</P>
<P>
   GM began calling for arbitration on June 23, contending that the
strikes here violated the company's national agreement with the
union. The national agreement only allows factory-level strikes
over increases in assembly line speed, subcontracting and health
and safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW had cited all these issues here but also demanded that
GM invest more money here and guarantee that jobs be preserved _
the same demands that the union has made in more than a dozen other
local strikes over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   When the UAW balked early this month at prompt arbitration, GM
filed suit and won a federal court order requiring that both sides
proceed without delay. UAW leaders concluded on Saturday, the last
of four days of testimony in the arbitration case, that there was
at least a chance that the arbitrator might issue a
precedent-setting decision barring investment issues from
discussion in future factory-level strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement covers the two factories on strike here as
well as a car assembly plant here and parts factories in
Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, where workers had also threatened
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement did not include the Saturn factory in Spring
Hill, Tenn., the Corvette factory in Bowling Green, Ky., or a sport
utility vehicle factory in Janesville, Wis., where workers have
also asked permission from the UAW's national leadership to strike.
These factories are unlikely to receive that permission any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   During the strikes here, GM has lost the production of nearly
500,000 vehicles, the equivalent of four full weeks of production,
and could lose an additional 100,000 or more vehicles as factories
gradually reopen when they receive fresh shipments of parts.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes would have been even costlier had they not included
GM's regularly scheduled summer shutdown over the first two weeks
of July, when all GM factories are closed anyway. By comparison, a
1996 strike at the two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, lasted only
17 days but prevented GM from producing 180,000 cars and light
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, who was the Federal Reserve's expert on the auto
industry for many years and who is now the chief economist at J.D.
Power &AMP; Associates, said that the current strike slowed economic
growth by half a percentage point in the second quarter and by an
additional eight-tenths of one percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But once GM has finished converting factories to the 1999 model
year over the next couple months, it is likely to run many assembly
plants around the clock, which could increase the nation's economic
output this winter. &QL;

<P>
   Sparlha Swaby gleefully pumped her fists last year when she won
two prestigious national scholarships worth a total of $12,000 for
college. But her delight turned to dismay when Stanford University,
upon learning of the awards, took away more than $11,000 from
grants it had promised her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swaby's net gain for her efforts was less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just really, really angry,'' said the normally upbeat
18-year-old from Oyster Bay, N.Y., who will enter her sophomore
year at Stanford in the fall. ``I thought I would get the excess
money. That's the reason I put in so much work trying to get
scholarships my senior year in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Swaby still received a generous Stanford grant, the
university's refusal to use her outside academic prizes to reduce
thousands of dollars in student loans illustrates a long-simmering
debate between families and private scholarship donors on one side
and colleges on the other. Many colleges will reduce some of their
own grants to students who win outside merit-based scholarships,
arguing that it helps them spread around financial aid to the
neediest. The question is just how much of a reduction is fair and
just.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in response to complaints from donors that their gifts are
not making much difference and to criticism that some colleges use
generous national scholarships to shore up their own financial aid
accounts, some colleges appear to be moving toward letting students
keep more of the outside scholarships they win.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, for example, recently announced that it was doing away
with its policy of drastically reducing university grants to offset
any outside awards. Following suit, Williams College and Columbia
University have said they will permit students to keep their
university aid and to apply the outside scholarships first toward
reducing student loans and then federal work-study obligations.
Both Dartmouth College and Yale University say they are looking
more closely at the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that we're attracting such outstanding students
that there's a lot more money they're bringing in and we feel we
should allow students to keep more of that,'' said Karl
Furstenberg, Dartmouth's dean of admissions and financial aid. He
added that contributing to the decision was the college's growing
endowment, fed by a booming stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships have grown, both in number and demand, as families
seek ways to offset costs and reduce college loans, education
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away an award of almost any size, students feel
the pinch,'' said William Nelsen, president of the Citizen
Scholarship Foundation of America, the nation's largest private,
nonprofit scholarship organization. Moreover, he said, donors are
increasingly vigilant about their gifts. ``When they began to
realize that their work did not really result in a gain for the
local student, we heard about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to arrive at a precise tally for the
amount of outside scholarships awarded each year because countless
local church and civic groups, like Rotary and Lions clubs, offer
scholarships in every community in the country. But the figure is
at least in the tens of millions of dollars and growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Scholarship Foundation, for instance, plans to
award 88,000 scholarships worth about $80 million this fiscal year,
up from 49,000 scholarships worth about $58 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation runs the grass-roots Dollars for Scholars
program, which has 780 chapters in the United States that award
scholarships of $500 to $3,000 to high school seniors. The
foundation also manages the scholarship programs of nearly 200
corporations, including Chrysler, CBS and Pepsico. The corporations
alone will give away more than $40 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, after donors large and small complained
that their scholarships were disappearing into financial-aid black
holes, the foundation began requiring colleges to sign a pledge
that they would use at least $1,000 of the awards to reduce student
loans and work-study aid rather than reduce a university
scholarship by a similar amount. About 320 colleges have signed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Others have refused. In the Byzantine world of college financial
aid, every college has its own method and rationale for dealing
with outside awards. Some institutions, like Rhodes College in
Tennessee, DePauw University in Indiana and Bucknell University in
Pennsylvania, say they allow students to keep 100 percent of
outside scholarships, although those who receive federal aid, like
a Stafford Loan, cannot under federal law keep other scholarships
that exceed their financial needs. Students who do not receive any
financial aid can keep any outside scholarships they earn, no
matter what college they attend.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of many public colleges, the University of Virginia does
not have a formula but lets students on financial aid keep a large
proportion of merit scholarships. ``Some agencies will come to us
and say, Before we make this award to this student, tell us what
you are going to do with it,'' said James Ramsey Jr., a longtime
financial aid official at Virginia. ``If they don't like the
answer, they just might not award it to the student who's coming
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Federation of Teachers of New York City, which awards
about 250 scholarships each year totaling more than $1 million to
city students, says it has waged a 20-year battle with colleges
over their use of the scholarships. ``With the cost going up so
much, shortchanging these students with a partial award is hard on
these kids,'' said the union's scholarships director, Jeffrey
Huart, who called the policies ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The union keeps a list of about a dozen institutions it
considers less than generous. The list reads like a who's who of
America's most prestigious universities: Brown, Dartmouth,
Princeton, Yale, the University of Chicago, Georgetown, Duke.
</P>
<P>
   At these institutions, students usually receive a preliminary
financial aid award when they are accepted, but colleges often
reduce the award after students report additional income, including
scholarships.

 UNDATED: including scholarships. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard University, for instance, subjects all outside
scholarships to a ``60-40 split.'' For a student who receives a
$3,000 merit scholarship, the university will deduct 60 percent, or
$1,800, from its own scholarship award and use $1,200 to reduce the
student's loan or work study-aid, usually referred to as ``self
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, Yale and Brown use the first $500 from any outside
scholarship to reduce ``self-help'' aid, then employ a 50-50 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``These local groups that are having these bake sales and
holding these lotteries, if they knew where their dollars were
going, if they knew that 50 percent wasn't going to the kid, they'd
be real ticked off,'' said Michael Mallory, director of the Ron
Brown Scholars program, the most lucrative scholarship in the
country for black students.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory was beside himself when he learned how the Ron Brown
scholarships were used at some institutions last year to reduce a
large share of university scholarship awards. Some of the student
recipients, he said, come from poor backgrounds and could not
afford simple necessities like a winter coat or health insurance,
even after receiving the $10,000-a-year scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should know that they should always wait to get
initial letters from institutions before they notify them of
outside scholarships,'' Mallory advised. ``Then they can compare.''
</P>
<P>
   The elite colleges defend their methods, noting that unlike most
other colleges, they practice ``need blind'' admissions, meaning
they admit students regardless of whether they can pay and provide
tens of millions of dollars a year in university grants to offset
the cost of tuition. Outside scholarships, they say, help them
spread out aid to students who may need it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we feel we're a little unfairly compared to other
schools because we are meeting full need,'' said Donald Routh,
Yale's director of financial aid. But he said the university was
looking at a possible change in policy because of critics like the
United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   While some education experts counsel families to shop around for
the best deal, others caution that academic rigor _ and not a few
thousand dollars in scholarships _ should determine college choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to borrow ten to twelve thousand dollars to fund a
Dartmouth education is a good investment that we know repays itself
many times over in the course of a lifetime,'' said Furstenberg,
the college's financial aid director, noting that consumers gladly
plunk down more for a luxury automobile. ``To single out education
seems a bit odd to me.''

 WASHINGTON: sworn testimony.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse today, Ms. Tripp, onetime friend of
Ms. Lewinsky, who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations,
appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he interpreted the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Starr as ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is apparently finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

COMMENTARY: AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When I was a teen-ager, in the '60s, I never told
people that my father was a cop. It wasn't cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vietnam era, with the National Guard killing kids at Kent
State, with the Chicago police billyclubbing yippies, with the
stench of tear gas and class hatred everywhere, the last thing you
wanted to do was admit you were related to someone in a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Cops were pigs. The military was fascist. Shaggy-haired Ivy
Leaguers like Bill Clinton were protesting Vietnam and writing
letters about ``loathing the military.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed easier to say my father was in politics. After he
retired from the police force, he was an aide to a senator and a
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   For his last 13 years on the force, he was an inspector in
charge of Senate security. In those days, D.C. detectives were
assigned to guard the Capitol, and the Capitol police worked on a
patronage system.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a high-risk job day to day, compared with his earlier
assignments walking beats or in homicide. The most treacherous part
was the temper of the Democratic Senate leader, Lyndon Johnson, who
would fire underlings at any provocation.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes crazy people, or people made crazy by a cause,
would show up. And then the job of guarding lawmakers and tourists
could suddenly turn very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, 1954, three Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out
guns and randomly fired down from the spectators' gallery above the
House floor. Five congressmen were wounded. My father ran over from
the Senate and wrestled one of the shooters to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   He marked the Puerto Rican's gun by carving his initials with a
penknife on the handle. Later, at the trial, when the defense
lawyer superciliously grilled him about how he could be sure that
the gun in evidence was the same one used in the crime, my father
told him to look on the bottom of the handle. There was the
``MJD.''
</P>
<P>
   That bloody day 44 years ago was the most famous outbreak of
violence in the Capitol until last Friday, when two Capitol police
officers died heroically trying to stop a crazy man from shooting
up the place.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an intense emotional response to the deaths of
John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. So much that happens in Washington
now seems trivial and craven and tawdry. But these two men died
doing something large and brave and important, defending freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched their memorial service, it struck me that my
generation had come a long way from the days when anyone in uniform
was a fit target for an epithet. Bill Clinton may have once shunned
the military, but as president he has given respect and support to
police and armed forces. His eulogy for Officers Gibson and
Chestnut was spare and elegant. ``They consecrated this house of
freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some who came of age in the painful Vietnam era are now making
movies glorifying the military and TV shows celebrating cops.
</P>
<P>
   Law and order, once a phrase that elicited elitist contempt, is
now the coolest entertainment pitch going. Old Mayor Daley is dead.
Long live Sipowitz and clans of Irish cops.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg has been giving interviews, talking about
having made ``Saving Private Ryan'' to honor the men who fought in
World War II and risked so much for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, baby boomers realize that, despite a buzzing economy
and a passel of luxury goods, we are going to die without
experiencing the nobility that illuminated the lives of our parents
and grandparents. They lived through wars and depressions, life and
death, good stomping evil. Our unifying event was ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a culture more concerned with celebrity than
morality, more centered on self than others.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the flag-draped coffins in the Rotunda, the thousands of
mourners, it seems a long time from the days of cops as pigs.
Seeing the long queues for the patriotic ``Saving Private Ryan,''
it seems a long time from the days of the military as fascist.
</P>
<P>
   We understand now that it was the politicians who sent out the
Chicago cops and the Ohio National Guard. It was the politicians,
Johnson, McNamara and Kissinger, who sent all those young men to
die after they knew Vietnam was unwinnable. We may be more cynical.
But we're no longer demonizing the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, I never say my father worked in politics. I simply
say, with the greatest possible pride, that he was a cop.

FORMER ARIZONA GOV. SYMINGTON ASKS REPAYMENT ORDER BE OVERTURNED

   PHOENIX _ Former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington has asked a
superior court to overturn a judgment that ordered him to repay
$8.8 million he used to develop a downtown Phoenix property.
</P>
<P>
   Symington borrowed the money in the late 1980s to build the
Mercado shopping complex at Seventh and Van Buren streets and did
not repay the money when the project failed. In 1995, Symington
sought refuge from the debt in U.S. Bankruptcy court, shortly after
the pension funds obtained the $8.8 million judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed last week in Maricopa County Superior Court,
Symington claimed that pension funds that loaned him the money had
concealed vital information from the court that could have reduced
the size of the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds pursued Symington into Bankruptcy Court to
keep the debt from being erased, and that case is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   With interest on the judgment, Symington now owes the pension
funds more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   All his other debts have since been discharged by the bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   To block discharge of Symington's Mercado debt, the pension
funds must prove that the former governor defrauded them by lying
about his financial condition when he landed the loan in the late
1980s. Symington personally guaranteed the loan, which went into
default.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy dispute could go to trial late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new battle in superior court is a sidelight to the
bankruptcy case, but it is important to Symington.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1995 judgment is vacated, the amount Symington owes the
pension funds would again be open to legal debate. A vacated
judgment could reduce the sum he owes the pension funds if the
bankruptcy court refuses to erase the debt completely.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Manning, attorney for the pension funds, predicted the
ex-governor's debt would be reduced by no more than one third if he
prevails in the motion he filed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that would leave Symington owing more than $10 million
to the pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Manning called Symington's latest filing ``another delaying
tactic, an act of pathetic desperation. It'll cost the pension
funds more money and more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shull, Symington's attorney, countered that the action
``isn't a delay tactic at all.'' He said Symington ``has been
regularly asking the court to set this case for trial. It is they
who keep asking for more time.'' &QL;

BROTHERS GROW NEW VISION`S REVENUE TO $200 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 VISION-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   UNDATED - Jason Boreyko was carrying bags and driving golf carts
at a Phoenix resort when he asked for a 25-cent-an-hour raise and
was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   B.K. Boreyko worked his share of nights and weekends as a
wedding photographer, then got ``a real job'' in direct-mail
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Both were frustrated with long hours and low wages. So the
brothers, who got their start packing boxes for their father's
Amway business, turned back to their roots: network marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the prime aspects of network marketing is
self-development. I'm a prime example,'' Jason said. ``I couldn't
get a 25-cent raise, but the hotel's reservations manager now runs
my convention department.''
</P>
<P>
   Schooled by their parents' years in Amway and Matol Botanical
International distributorships, the Boreykos started New Vision
International Inc., which sells nutritional and other products
through a national network of independent distributors. Since its
founding in 1995, the company has grown so rapidly that this year
it earned the Boreykos recognition as Emerging Entrepreneurs of the
Year in the annual competition sponsored by Ernst &AMP; Young
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision is already working out of its third building, having
outgrown 2,000-square-foot and 9,000-square-foot locations in the
Phoenix area. The company moved to Tempe, Ariz., last fall after
pouring $5 million into renovating and equipping a vacant furniture
store.
</P>
<P>
   The company ships 7,000 to 10,000 packages per shift, filling
three tractor-trailers daily for U.S. Postal Service delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' growing interest in alternative medicines and in
home-based businesses have helped fuel their success, the Boreykos
say.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneur of the Year judges first were impressed by the
company's growth, to nearly $190 million in sales in two years,
said Quinn Williams, a Phoenix lawyer who headed the selection
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second was their personal commitment and vision to create
a company focused on helping others,'' a vision the brothers are
able to communicate to their distributors and customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision distributors sell 32 products across four product
lines: nutritional supplements, sports supplements, diet aids and
skin-care products.
</P>
<P>
   The products are made according to the company's proprietary
formulations and under a private label by four manufacturers, B.K.
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 700,000 customers who, following a Price
Club-like philosophy, are referred to as ``members'' and allowed to
buy products at wholesale prices. California, Arizona, Washington,
Texas and Florida are the biggest states for New Vision sales,
although 40 percent of its orders come from east of the
Mississippi, B.K. said.
</P>
<P>
   Of its customers, about 35,000 have part-time, home-based
businesses selling New Vision products, he says. The company soon
will go national with an infomercial promoting network marketing
and New Vision's potential as a home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things that affects a family's life is that
they're able to have common goals. Even if it's little kids helping
out doing mailings to their downline members, the family can get
together as a group and go in the same direction. And that's unique
in today's society,'' B.K. said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boreyko family's solidarity, though, was tested more than
once in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Dorothy fell ill with a brain tumor, and the search for
treatment failed to save her life and bankrupted the family. Later
that year, Matol Botanical filed for bankruptcy reorganization,
leaving distributors without paychecks and others in the network
turning to the Boreykos to start something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had 27 years invested into his network. . . . He's
thinking his whole life's work is going to unravel because of bad
decisions at corporate. And he told Jason and me, `I got you this
far. You take it the rest of the way,' '' B.K. recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The odds were against them, Jason says, because running a
company takes quite different skills from selling products.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers, their two sisters and father kicked in to
start New Vision. B.K. took the name from a Sunday sermon. The
family developed the health and fitness focus from their mother's
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite saying, ``Dream big dreams. Small ones have no
magic,'' has become their motto.
</P>
<P>
   Whether New Vision-type products would have helped Dorothy
Boreyko is a question the family can't answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it too much. . . . Cancer is a weird
thing,'' B.K. said.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision catalogs note that its statements about products
influencing everything from mood swings to athletic performance
have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA doesn't regulate the nutrition industry, but the Boreykos
admit they've benefited from Congress' 1994 act lifting
restrictions on companies' claims.
</P>
<P>
   The company is debt-free, Jason said. His parents' experience
taught him the importance of not accumulating debt, something New
Vision tries to instill in its distributors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision's growth has not come without problems. For a year
callers were greeted with busy signals from a phone system that
couldn't handle the high volume of calls and had to be continually
upgraded. Early on, New Vision also outsourced its computer
services, but when sales hit $500,000 and the contractor couldn't
keep up, Jason scrambled to find a location and equipment to take
the service in-house.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 United Parcel Service strike nearly paralyzed the
company, leaving about 40,000 boxes sitting in Kentucky and costing
the company a couple million dollars to ship duplicate orders.
</P>
<P>
   Competition looms, too, from network-marketing rivals and local
health-food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers wonder whether New Vision can sustain its growth.
But the brothers say they've brought in an experienced management
team to help carry out their vision. They added operations in
Canada this year and plan to move into the Mexico and South America
markets in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company's in-house research-and-development department is
constantly looking for new studies and research on health
discoveries, B.K. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to empower people with knowledge on why they need to
take these supplements, rather than just hyping them on the
benefits. Because if you teach a person why they need to take an
antioxidant, they're going to take it for the rest of their life,''
he said. ``And that really is the key to our long-term growth and
stability.'' &QL;

AT COMFORT LEVEL, COWBOYS' '97 ROOKIES EXPECT MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The thing to remember about an NFL rookie
is that he's really just a college kid a few months removed from
being a Big Man On Campus.
</P>
<P>
   Drop him into his first pro training camp with a group of
skeptical veterans and he's probably going to feel a lot like a
college freshman: uncertain, uncomfortable, a bit out of place. Not
only does he not know the plays, he doesn't know the players.
</P>
<P>
   His performance can suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Cowboys second-year players say, that one year of
experience makes all the difference in the world of pro football.
And that offers hope for a team looking to build a foundation for
the future. The Cowboys draftees and rookie free-agent class of
1997, featuring starters Dexter Coakley and Richie Cunningham, met
or exceeded expectations of most observers last season, and class
members say they should be even better in 1998 with a year of games
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of pressure is relieved off of you in your
second year,'' said tight end David LaFleur, the former Louisiana
State star who was the Cowboys' top draft choice last year. ``In
your second year, you know what to expect. You're more relaxed.
You're not all wigged out about what camp's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Cowboys' second-year players will be counted on to
take on more prominent roles this season. LaFleur will start at
tight end. Place kicker Cunningham and punter Toby Gowin are
expected to duplicate their success of last year. Coakley has all
his physical assets plus a year's experience at outside linebacker.
Reserves such as defensive backs Kevin Mathis and Omar Stoutmire,
defensive tackle Antonio Anderson, wide receiver Macey Brooks and
fullback Nicky Sualua are expected to improve and provide quality
depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good group last year,'' LaFleur said.
``Everybody pretty much stood up and contributed. Hopefully, we'll
grow together. We've got a great nucleus. We've got a great veteran
group with three Super Bowl rings, and they're going to be around a
long time, but obviously you've got to start building for the
future some time. Hopefully, we can stick together and bring more
championships to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur says his rookie NFL camp and his freshman college camp
were his two worst, and for some of the same reasons. Not all those
reasons are related to football technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like college,'' LaFleur said of a rookie's camp
life. ``You get an empty feeling sometimes. You're back in a dorm
room _ and a dorm room's not the most glorious place to be. It can
get awfully lonely if you're just practicing and coming back to the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wheaton, a second-year cornerback from Oregon, agrees.
``The first year you come in, you don't know the guys so you keep
to yourself,'' Wheaton said. ``You can feel kind of lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he says, things change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season goes along, (the veterans) take you under their
wing,'' Wheaton said. ``The second season you're a lot more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the personal side of a rookie's life, there is the
football element. There, too, major leaps forward can be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a huge difference from last year just by my first two
weeks in camp,'' said Anderson, a fourth-round pick in 1997 from
Syracuse. ``You get a full off-season. You get to watch more film.
Leon Lett's back this year, and I get to work with him and Chad
(Hennings). Those guys have been instrumental. And Coach (Jim)
Bates, the technique he's gone over with me has helped
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches expect significant improvement from second-year
players, offensive line coach Hudson Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year of experience, it's a big difference,'' Houck
said. ``It's having that many more snaps knowing what to expect,
and knowing what our coaching philosophy is. It's knowing the
techniques and knowing the people around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Houck said a player's ``surroundings are a factor. Just where
they're living,'' he said. ``Their personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he said, are ``the surroundings of the
football team: who's playing on the right and who's playing on the
left side of them. The more you know what your job is the more
aggressively you can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said that despite their success last season, 1997's
rookies can't take it easy this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't become complacent,'' Cunningham said. ``You can't
think that just because it's your second year you can take it easy.
If we don't do our jobs, they'll find someone else to come in and
do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, for one, said he's not going to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little rap on me saying I faded toward the end of last
year, and I want to show the coaches I won't fade out,'' Anderson
said. ``I want to show them that I'll play the whole 16 games like
I did at the beginning of the season. I wasn't as prepared as I
should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's rookies say they share something more than a work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we feed off each other,'' Wheaton said. ``We see each
other doing good, and we want to do good, too. We take pride in the
'97 group and just feel we have something to prove.''

LAVER IS CONSCIOUS, IN SERIOUS CONDITION AFTER STROKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUSAN B. ADAMS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rod Laver, the only tennis player to twice win the four Grand
Slam tournaments in one year, was conscious and off the critical
list Tuesday, a day after he had a stroke while being interviewed
for a television show about the century's greatest athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Laver, who turns 60 on Aug. 9, was in serious condition in the
intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely not paralyzed,'' Dr. Neil Martin, co-director
of the hospital's stroke center, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But, Martin said, Laver ``is not entirely out of the woods
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver was still having some difficulty speaking and had some
problems with his right arm and right leg. He will probably remain
in the hospital for a week to 10 days, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   An ESPN spokesman, Rob Tobias, told The Associated Press that
Laver had sustained the stroke Monday afternoon during an interview
at the Westwood Marquis Hotel, only a few blocks from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic, left-handed redhead, Laver not only won two Grand
Slams, but also inspired players like John McEnroe, Martina
Navratilova and Pete Sampras. Laver epitomized the all-court attack
that brought Australians to the forefront of the game in the 1940s
and '50s, but he also integrated heavy topspin to create a style
uniquely his own. After Laver, topspin became an elemental part of
the world-class game, practiced most notably by Bjorn Borg.
</P>
<P>
   Laver's formidable combination of power and spin, as well as his
foot speed and desire, more than offset his modest size. He was the
world's No. 1-ranked player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969, and was
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Laver won the coveted All-England singles crown four times and
was a finalist six years, including four straight (1959-62), before
being banned for five years when he turned professional.
Professionals were not allowed to play against amateurs until 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to Wimbledon, Laver won the singles title in
1968 and '69. By advancing to the fourth round in 1970, he set a
Wimbledon record for men by winning 31 consecutive matches from
1960 to 1970. Borg topped that record in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Laver won 11 major singles titles, which places him in second
place with Borg and Sampras on the men's career list, behind Roy
Emerson with 12.
</P>
<P>
   Laver's total of 20 major titles in singles, doubles and mixed
are fifth behind Emerson (28), John Newcombe (25), Frank Sedgman
(22) and Bill Tilden (21). &QL;

 &HT;    Miller to become professor at UGA
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Following in the footsteps of other Georgia
elected officials, Gov. Zell Miller will move from the political to
the educational realm when he returns to his alma mater, the
University of Georgia, as a chaired professor in the Institute of
Higher Education after his terms ends in January.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree at
Georgia in the 1950s, will be the first holder of the Philip H.
Alston Jr. Chair, UGA officials said Tuesday. Emory University and
Young Harris College also have announced that Miller will teach at
their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when the history of Georgia, and maybe American
education, is written, there will be few American governors who've
had as profound an effect on schools and learning as Zell Miller,''
said Rep. Louise McBee (D-Athens). ``What a wonderful thing it is
for students to have the privilege of learning from a practitioner
and a scholar with four books. He'll be a real asset to the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   UGA President Michael Adams will make a formal announcement
about the appointment today at a 10 a.m. ceremony, which will be
attended by Miller, McBee, state officials and Alston family
members. Miller was on campus Tuesday for a closed reception with
Adams and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bentley, Miller's press secretary, said the governor would
not comment Tuesday on the appointment. It is unclear how Miller
will split his time between the three schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elkin Goddard Alston gave the university $1 million to fund the
chair in honor of her late husband, a UGA alumnus, prominent
Atlanta civic and business leader and a partner in the law firm of
Alston &AMP; Bird.
</P>
<P>
   A 1932 graduate of the university, Philip Alston earned a law
degree from Emory and further studied at Harvard before joining
Alston, Miller &AMP; Gaines, founded by his father and uncle. Alston
served as U.S. ambassador to Australia during the Carter
administration and on the state Board of Regents. He died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Among politicians-turned-part-time-professors, Miller joins the
likes of Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who began teaching at Georgia Tech
after resigning from the U.S. Senate, and President Jimmy Carter,
who began teaching at Emory University after leaving the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) became president of the University of
Oklahoma after resigning from the U.S. Senate, while former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander briefly served as president of the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, UGA has seen an influx of former state
government employees into its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Hank Huckabee, former director of the state
Office of Planning and Budget and of Georgia State University's
Georgia Fiscal Research Program. He is now the director of UGA's
Carl Vinson Institute of Government, where former state Department
of Family and Children Services Director Michael Thurmond is on
leave from a one-year appointment as a distinguished practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Also on staff at the Institute of Government are Steve Wrigley,
who worked as executive secretary in Miller's office; Grady
Cornish, who worked in the secretary of state's office; and Larry
Gess, a former Office of Planning and Budget employee who worked
with Huckabee at Georgia State.
</P>
<P>
   At UGA, Miller is expected to teach political science and to
work with graduates and undergraduates in the Institute of Higher
Education and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. He briefly
taught history and political science at UGA and Young Harris
College before launching his political career decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came to UGA intending to study law but was, he has said,
``mesmerized'' by history professor E. Merton Coulter, who
supervised Miller's master's degree in history. UGA officials said
that one of the governor's most prized possessions is a letter from
Coulter telling Miller that he expected him to some day be governor
of Georgia.

IVANISEVIC SINKS FURTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(WILL BE UPDATED) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Goran Ivanisevic doesn't handle disappointment
well. Three weeks ago he lost the Wimbledon final and mused about
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   So one only wonders what dark emotional depths the Croation was
exploring Tuesday afternoon after a straight-sets loss to France's
Guillame Raoux at the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all anyone could do was wonder, because Ivanisevic the
Irritable wasn't talking after Raoux ousted him 6-4, 6-4 in a
first-round match at Los Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Ivanisevic had already said it all DURING the match,
when he held an impromptu debate with umpire Bjorn Bork, muttered
to linesmen and on one occasion slammed his racket into the
sea-blue Pacific Pave.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear is that Ivanisevic had barely touched a racket
since Pete Sampras beat him in England, an event so devastating
that the Croat said afterward, ``I cannot cheer anybody now. I can
only kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Only his game was dead Tuesday, to the delight of Raoux, who
registered the tournament's second upset of the day by knocking off
the No. 3 seed. Sixth-seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like someone who practiced hard for three
weeks,'' said Raoux, who beat Ivanisevic for the first time in
three tries. ``It was very tough for him to lose the (Wimbledon)
final. Maybe he's still thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic never had control of his game, or his emotions, and
his vaunted serve was erratic. His 14 aces were offset by eight
points lost on double faults in the second set, including three
straight in the third game (which he won anyway).
</P>
<P>
   It was during that marathon game, which went to deuce five
times, that Ivanisevic began to unravel. He kicked the ball after
squandering the advantage the second time, and after the third lost
opportunity he sat on the net post and chatted with Bork, while
Raoux waited patiently at his end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended after Ivanisevic grabbed a bottle of water,
opened it and handed it to the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for his mistakes,'' Raoux said. Of Ivanisevic's
antics, he said, ``It's part of the game. I don't care. I just
concentrate on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, ranked 17th in the world, was scheduled to play an
evening doubles match, paired with Paul Kilderry against Doug Flach
and Michael Tebbutt.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Henman of England, a Wimbledon semifinalist, was only the
third seeded player to win this week. The No. 2 seed easily
defeated Grant Stafford of South Africa 6-3, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   With seeded players falling, and two having dropped out with
injury (Sampras and Thomas Enqvist), Henman's first L.A. appearance
might become a memorable one. He's not assuming anything, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very good (seeded) players that have lost.... Those
are so-called upsets, but when you've got (Andre) Agassi and
(Patrick) Rafter in the draw, that shows the depth of men's
tennis,'' Henman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other matches Tuesday: Sargis Sargsian of Armenia defeated
Ferreira 6-1, 6-2; eighth seed Vincent Spadea of Chicago defeated
Marcos Ondruska of South Africa 2-6, 6-3, 6-3; Manhattan Beach's
Jeff Tarango defeated Mexico's Alejandro Hernandez 6-2, 6-2, and
Santa Monica's Michael Joyce defeated Australian Michael Tebbutt
7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the late match, No. 1 seed Patrick Rafter of Australia was
scheduled to play Ramon Delgado of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Australian Sandon Stolle (subbing for injured No. 4
seed Thomas Enqvist) defeated 17-year-old Taylor Dent of Newport
Beach 6-3, 6-2.

U.S. TEAM SURPRISES CUBAN BOXERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In terms of the U.S. Boxing team, youth and
inexperience, like ignorance, is bliss _ at least as it pertains to
having to face the Cuban boxing team, traditionally one of the
toughest in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest upset of the Goodwill Games quarterfinals was turned
in early in the evening Tuesday by Roberto Benitez, a 17-year-old
New York native who had fought just five times internationally.
Behind a point in the final round of his 112-pound bout, Benitez
overtook Manual Mantilla, the world champion from Cuba, by 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the Americans' record against Cuba to 3-1 for the day,
far beyond expectations for a squad which failed to win a medal in
the last world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proving to the world,'' said Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said he regretted being caught in reckless exchanges
with Mantilla, but they also gave him confidence. `'I was thinking,
wow, here I am 17 years old and just taking it to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez tied Mantilla at 8-8 with a looping left, then surprised
him with a series of rights to take a 10-8 lead with a minute left.
A fatigued Mantilla dropped his hands, and Benitez drilled him with
two more lefts before the final bell sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning upset of the afternoon session was pulled off
by the youngest member of the U.S. team, Ricardo Williams Jr. of
Cincinnati, who recently turned 17. Williams defeated Damian
Echemendia, 24, of Cuba by 6-2 in a 139-pound bout. Earlier in the
afternoon, Teaunce Shepherd, 20, of Marquette, Mich., beat
Rudinelson Bell of Cuba, 16-3, in the 125-pound division.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Cubans' veil of invincibility had been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a long camp and they cried a lot, but it's working,''
said Al Mitchell, who is listed as adviser to the U.S. team. ``It's
a young team and we're pushing them right out into the fire. We've
got a good group of young guys. Half of the team is under 19 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd dropped Bell with a left hand in the third round,
igniting the pro-U.S. crowd and lighting a fuse for his teammates.
But Anthony Stewart of Chicago could not help the U.S. team get an
afternoon sweep as he lost, 7-2, to Israel Alvarez of Cuba in a
178-pound bout.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who was the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing coach, was
ebullient over the performance of his team and its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right time to be meeting the Russians and the
Cubans,'' Mitchell said Tuesday of his youngsters. ``The experience
they're getting here at these matches is going to help them get
ready for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   During the quarterfinals on Monday, the U.S. team didn't fare as
well against the Cubans, posing an 0-2 mark. But Benitez, Williams
and Shepherd made amends Tuesday, taking their fights right to
their Cuban opponents, frequently beating them to the punch and
establishing their jabs.
</P>
<P>
   Echemendia, who is vastly more experienced than Williams, is
probably the most technically sound boxer on the Cuban team. He won
an amateur world championship in the 139-pound weight class in
1993. If Williams was afraid, it didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach had been telling us in training camp that you have
to take the Cubans' heart,'' said Williams, who is making his debut
in international competition after an intense four-week training
camp in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Lake Placid, N.Y. &QL;

PUERTO RICAN PHONE WORKERS VOTE TO END STRIKE, WITH GOAL UNMET 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, _ Telephone workers here voted Tuesday to
end their 41-day strike, with their goal of halting the
government's sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   After a tentative agreement was negotiated on Friday, the 6,400
workers voted for the settlement by an overwhelming majority, union
leaders said. The workers are expected to return to their jobs on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike interrupted telephone service to 300,000 homes on
this island of 3.7 million residents, and strike-related vandalism
caused an estimated $10 million in damage to telephone company
installations. But the strike by two unions did not stop the sale,
which the unions feared would cause layoffs or force the government
to hold a referendum on the deal. In the end, the unions succeeded
only in protecting themselves from legal action by the company, and
gaining the support of many Puerto Ricans who saw the state-owned
utility as a symbol of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ended the strike, but the struggle against the sale
continues,'' said Jose Juan Hernandez, president of the Independent
Telephone Workers Union, the larger of two unions, representing
4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the unions will continue to fight the sale
through protests, a court battle and by lobbying Federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began on June 18, when the proposed sale of the
telephone company to a consortium led by the GTE Corp., based in
Stamford, Conn., was still awaiting approval by the island's
legislature. The legislature has since approved the measure, which
was signed into law by Gov. Pedro Rossello. The deal must still be
approved by the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the strike was a 48-hour general strike by
tens of thousands of workers from more than 50 unions who walked
off their jobs on July 7 to support the 6,400 telephone strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they created an environment that forced GTE
to better its original offer. During the strike, Spain's Telefonica
Internacional S.A. put in a counteroffer for the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that bid, GTE increased its offer to $2.01 billion
from $1.85 billion. The company also agreed not to dismiss current
employees without just cause and pledged not to increase local
calling rates. The government said it had accepted GTE's new bid on
July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, strikers will receive a letter of
reprimand that is to be removed from their personnel files after
six months.
</P>
<P>
   The government pledged not to take any legal action against the
unions for the strike but said it would press criminal cases
against workers involved in sabotage.

SPORTS COLUMN: GENERAL MANAGER PUTS FEATHER IN GIANTS CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For the first time since Ernie Accorsi succeeded
George Young as the New York Giants' general manager on Jan. 8, he
had a chance to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the agent finally called me back,'' Accorsi said, ``we
got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   With the signing of Joe Jurevicius (pronounced Jur-a-vicious) to
a three-year $1.4 million contract, all the Giants' draft choices
were signed and in training camp at the State University of New
York at Albany. Even better, the Giants were about $1.4 million
under the National Football League's salary cap of $52.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``George used to tell me, `The cap is the first thing I think of
when I wake up and the last thing I think of before I go to bed,'''
Accorsi said. ``And I would ask him, `When do you sleep?'''
</P>
<P>
   At least Accorsi can sleep knowing that all his players are
signed, which isn't true of every NFL team. In too many other
years, that wasn't true of the Giants either. Young endured long,
bitter holdouts with Lawrence Taylor, Phil Simms and Carl Banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants prepare to defend the National Conference East
title, Accorsi is the big change from last year to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be under the cap,'' he said, ``because you never
know when you'll need to use that money.''
</P>
<P>
   The new general manager was sitting in his second-floor office
in the recreation and conference center just up the grassy slope
from the football fields where the Giants were perspiring. But he
doesn't consider the team's restored stature to be a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the team did last year made it better for me,'' he said.
``It made it more acceptable that we had the right people here. I
don't mean me. I mean everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all those right people, the most important is Jim Fassel,
knighted as pro football's coach of the year following the Giants'
10-5-1 season that was dimmed by the 23-22 playoff loss to the
Minnesota Vikings. Fassel, who had been hired by Young, is working
with Accorsi, who was Young's assistant for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, Ernie was the only person I didn't know,''
said Fassel, who had been a Giants assistant coach in 1991 and
1992. ``I figured Ernie was the heir apparent to George, but I
wondered, `What if our personalities clash?' But they don't. We're
always on the same page. Our philosophy is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is that philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Build through the draft,'' Fassel said. ``Sign your good young
players. The coach coaches the team. We talk two or three times a
day and Ernie has told me, `If things get rough, I'll be right
behind you.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the usual divisional rivals plus visits by the Super Bowl
champion Denver Broncos, the Packers and the Chiefs as well as
visits to San Francisco and Tampa Bay, things could get rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie knows what to expect,'' said Wellington Mara, the
Giants' co-owner. ``He's paid his dues. Before he came to us, he
was the Colts' general manager for two years and the Browns'
general manager for seven years. He knows the league. He knows the
collective bargaining agreement. He knows the cap. And he
communicates well. He makes it his business to be sure I'm
informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed about what?
</P>
<P>
   ``About everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rooney, now in his 14th season as the Giants' director of
pro personnel, described how Accorsi and Young have different
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie is more open initially,'' Rooney said, ``while George is
the elephant in the trees; he takes the measure of the man before
he commits.''
</P>
<P>
   But in evaluating scouting reports, Rooney considered them alike
as general managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They defer to the information,'' he said. ``They trust you.
They ask the right questions, such as an injury or a character
situation in a player's background.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi is still asking Young questions.
</P>
<P>
   For quite a while, negotiations with Jurevicius stalled because
the wide receiver's agent, Neil Cornrich, refused to return
Accorsi's phone calls. Finally, last Friday, Cornrich phoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I gave him our offer,'' Accorsi said, ``I called George
to ask his advice. In one word with decibels that got louder and
louder, George said: `Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Jurevicius agreed, Accorsi phoned Young to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All George said,'' he recalled with a laugh, ``was, `See.'''

Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky received a sweeping grant of
immunity from federal prosecution Tuesday, in exchange for a
promise to testify that she and President Clinton had agreed to
deny that they had a sexual relationship, two lawyers familiar with
her account said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did deny under oath that they had
a sexual relationship. But in discussions leading to the immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors this week that she and the
president had a sexual relationship that began in 1995. The
25-year-old former White House intern now admits she lied in the
sworn affidavit she submitted in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit in January.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said Tuesday that Ms. Lewinsky had indicated
to prosecutors that the president discussed with her how to
characterize their relationship in December, when they were both
under subpoena in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions were crucial to reaching the broad immunity deal
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr announced Tuesday. Ms.
Lewinsky pledged her ``full and truthful testimony'' in exchange
for freedom from the threat of prosecution. Ms. Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, received a similar grant of immunity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the immunity arrangement, Ms. Lewinsky is prepared to
testify that the president told her that he planned to deny a
relationship and if they both denied it, no one would know the
truth, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is also prepared to say that the president
encouraged her to say that her many visits to the White House after
she lost her job there in 1996 were to see Betty Currie, Clinton's
private secretary, and not the president himself, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's proposed testimony contradicts Clinton's
assertions in public and under oath about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after the alleged affair became public, Clinton
emphatically denied in a public statement having sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky or encouraging her or anyone else to lie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton did not comment in public about the immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Mike McCurry, said Clinton told aides he was
``pleased that things are working out'' for Ms. Lewinsky. The
president had nothing more to say about the matter, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal _ which protects Ms. Lewinsky from virtually
any possibility of prosecution except for perjury in her future
grand jury testimony _ poses serious problems for Clinton if he has
been less than truthful in his previous public and sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's assertions go beyond the question of whether they
engaged in some form of sexual behavior and reach the marrow of
Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is seeking to learn whether Clinton or close advisers
committed perjury, witness tampering or obstruction of justice in
seeking to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawyers familiar with her account, Ms. Lewinsky
is prepared to testify that no one from the White House helped her
prepare the ``talking points'' that she gave to her colleague,
Linda Tripp, who recorded 20 hours of their conversation. It was
not known Tuesday night whether she identified anyone as helping
her prepare them The talking points seemed intended to coach Mrs.
Tripp in possible testimony about Clinton, and for months they had
been seen as a centerpiece of the obstruction of justice inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly refused to discuss Ms. Lewinsky's
potential grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal came after months of fitful negotiations
between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers and lawyers from Starr's office.
William Ginsburg, the California medical malpractice lawyer who
represented Ms. Lewinsky in the early months of the inquiry, openly
mocked Starr's prosecution team and all but dared them to indict
her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family dismissed Ginsburg in early June and her
new legal team of experienced Washington defense lawyers quickly
opened talks with Starr that led to Tuesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Ms. Lewis, whose grand jury testimony
last winter was suspended after she broke down on the witness
stand, also reached an immunity deal with prosecutors Tuesday, said
her lawyer, Billy Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants Ms. Lewis' complete story because Ms. Lewinsky
shared with her mother many details of her dealings with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis' lawyer sought immunity to protect her from any
charges that might arise from advice she gave her daughter about
how to respond to the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, McCurry said in a testy and abbreviated briefing for
reporters, was not concerned about Ms. Lewinsky's impending
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president, obviously,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that he believed Clinton's earlier denials of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky contradicts those denials, McCurry was asked, is
she lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would presume so, yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's account of her conversations with Clinton in
which she said he urged her to deny a sexual relationship recall an
account told by Gennifer Flowers in the 1992 presidential campaign.
Ms. Flowers said that Clinton told her to deny a relationship if
reporters asked and he would do the same and no witnesses could
contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denials, Clinton admitted in his January
deposition in the Jones case that he had had sex once with Ms.
Flowers, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, remained in
negotiations with prosecutors over how the president would respond
to a subpoena for his testimony. White House officials and others
involved in the inquiry indicated that Clinton is seeking to delay
his testimony for several weeks, citing the heavy demands of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, seeking to justify the president's desire for delay,
said, ``He's going to be a busy guy. He's the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return telephone calls seeking comment. He was
seen at the federal courthouse this afternoon but the reason for
his visit could not be learned. ``It's under seal so we're all in
Kabuki-land,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has become familiar since the sensational
sex-and-perjury allegations became public in January, reporters
gathered outside the office of Ms. Lewinsky's lead lawyer, Plato
Cacheris, in downtown Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, arriving in a taxi, was escorted through the
surging throng by Judy Smith, her spokeswoman. Ms. Lewinsky arrived
in Washington this morning after spending five hours with several
of Starr's deputies in Manhattan on Monday reviewing her proposed
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and his co-counsels, Jacob Stein and Nathaniel
Speights, reached the immunity agreement with the office of
independent counsel Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m., Cacheris walked to the bank of microphones
outside his office and delivered a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky,'' Cacheris said, ``reached
an agreement today which provides that Ms. Lewinsky's full and
truthful testimony is the basis for the OIC's grant of full
transactional immunity from prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Transactional immunity is a rarely granted full guarantee that a
witness cannot be prosecuted for any crime related to the matter
under investigation, in exchange for full disclosure. But the
witness could face perjury charges and a revocation of immunity if
a prosecutor believes that the witness has lied about a material
fact in sworn testimony.

 WASHINGTON: sworn testimony.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse today, Ms. Tripp, onetime friend of
Ms. Lewinsky, who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations,
appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he interpreted the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Starr as ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is apparently finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Martinez looking for more work
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It has been 57 days since Dennis Martinez caught
Juan Marichal, and he came to the park Tuesday, as he has every
day, hoping this would be the game he becomes baseball's leading
Latin American game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday wasn't the day. Martinez pitched three innings and gave
up two hits and one run, raising his ERA to 4.61.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is a chance,'' Martinez said, ``but at the same
time, as it gets longer, when I haven't had a chance to pitch for a
week or eight or nine days, I feel like, what am I going to the
ballpark for? I've been in that situation off and on and I feel
sometimes I'm not there. I'm just here for the sake of being here.
I want to be here to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bullpen has solidified in recent weeks, Martinez's
opportunities have become more sporadic, even though his
performance has remained statistically consistent. Over his past 25
appearances, his ERA is 3.12, including Saturday's ludicrous
two-run inside-the-park homer by Turner Ward in Pittsburgh. Stuck
at 243 career wins, he has worked just 6 1/3 innings this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chance to do it consistently because everybody
in the bullpen is doing great, which is fine,'' he said. ``But I
feel like I got put in a situation where sometimes, there is no
need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason is Rudy Seanez, who has gone from the last
man in the bullpen to taking over the right-handed set-up role.
Martinez most frequently finds work when a starter lasts just five
or six innings, which isn't happening often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying my best to help them in the bullpen,'' said
Martinez (2-4). ``But I still believe I can start. I can help some
other clubs that need one.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of the deal
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz is known for waiting until the
last hours before the trade deadline, but the longer this week
goes, the suspicion grows hat the Braves can't get what they want.
Schuerholz has not been able to make a late July trade since 1995
(Mike Stanton to Boston) and has rarely had to deal from this
position _ highly specified needs (lefty set-up man and closer) in
a seller's market.
</P>
<P>
   Danny &AMP; Walt
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Danny Bautista was hobbled but available Tuesday
night while shortstop Walt Weiss is greatly improved but on the
bench. Bautista sustained a Grade 1 sprain to his left ankle when
chasing down a Guillermo Garcia double Monday night and would not
have been able to start if the Reds sent out a left-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss missed his 11th game of the last 12 Tuesday while resting
his left quadriceps. And while Cox could not commit to playing him
before this road trip ends Thursday afternoon, Weiss has begun
limited sprinting and is expected to be near 100 percent when the
club returns home.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones is hitting just .246 since the All-Star break, but
in his first 18 games, he also had five doubles and six stolen
bases. ... Andres Galarraga began play with a .297 average, the
lowest it has been since April 27th, when he was batting .292. ...
Chipper Jones entered Tuesday's game hitting exactly .320 from both
sides of the plate. But he was out for extra batting practice at 2
p.m., honing his left-handed swing.

 &HT;    Millwood folds early in debacle
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Kevin Millwood was poorly treated again Tuesday
night. If an 11-game winner can have a crisis, Millwood sniffs one.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds dropped the Braves 13-1 on the merits of a four-run
second inning. Millwood was lifted by manager Bobby Cox after three
innings, having yielded five runs (four earned runs, including a
Sean Casey home run) on five hits. The night marked Millwood's
third start in his last six that he failed to reach the fourth
inning and upped his ERA to 4.39.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of crises, Mark Wohlers saw his first action in six
days and the results were mixed. He pitched a scoreless seventh but
then stumbled in the eighth, giving up a walk to Eddie Taubensee, a
single to Pokey Reese and back-to-back walks to Melvin Nieves,
Reggie Sanders and Barry Larkin. The Reds scored five times, the
second on a passed ball that almost went over catcher Javy Lopez's
head, the last three after Russ Springer relieved him.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds used a three-hit, one-error second inning for a 4-1
lead, though the trouble was all Millwood's. After Dmitri Young
opened the inning with a walk, Millwood had Willie Greene, Bret
Boone and Taubensee all in 1-2 counts but could retire none of
them. Greene and Boone both singled to load the bases before
Millwood allowed Young to score on a wild pitch before Taubensee
doubled over Ryan Klesko's head.
</P>
<P>
   Reese next grounded to shortstop and while Ozzie Guillen was
playing deep and conceding the run, Greene scored to make it 3-1
and Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, for what should have been the
third out, brought in Taubensee.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went out 1-0 when Barry Larkin couldn't handle
Young's relay throw following a Lopez double.

LAW FIRMS THAT GOT CONTRACTS GIVE TO COMPTROLLER'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The legal contracts were potentially among the most
lucrative ever granted by New York state, offering the dizzying
prospect of tens of millions of dollars in fees. Fourteen law firms
sought the work last year from the state comptroller, H. Carl
McCall, and he retained three, deeming them the most qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the three firms have distinguished themselves in
another way: they have become major financial benefactors of
McCall's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The three firms and their lawyers gave a total of more than
$165,000 to McCall, one of the state's most powerful Democrats, in
the seven months after he chose them in June 1997, according to
disclosure records. Those donations represented more than 10
percent of the campaign money he collected in that period.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers did more than write checks. At two of the firms,
they also organized fund-raisers for McCall that generated hundreds
of thousands of dollars in additional contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller retained the firms, all of which have close ties
to the Democratic Party, to represent the huge state pension fund
in class-action securities litigation. The job is so potentially
profitable because the firms could reap enormous contingency fees
from the lawsuits that they file on behalf of the $105 billion
fund, which is controlled by McCall and has extensive stock
holdings. Typically, such fees can run as high as 30 percent of the
damages awarded in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McCall said that campaign contributions and
political connections had nothing to do with the decision to retain
the three firms. But he also acknowledged that the money
represented what he termed an ``appearance problem.'' He added,
though, that lawyers in his office selected the firms after
rigorously reviewing the qualifications of the 14 that applied,
emphasizing that he merely approved the choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing inappropriate about the money that has been
given to me,'' he said. ``It's all within the rules. The lawyers in
my office who made the recommendations to me had absolutely no
knowledge of who gave me money or wanted to give me money.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms denied that their contributions were linked to
McCall's decision to retain them for the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are unrelated,'' said Leonard Barrack, a senior partner
at one firm. Barrack, of Barrack, Rodos &AMP; Bacine of Philadelphia,
was named finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee
last February. He is charged with overseeing the party's
fund-raising across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the three firms have experience in class-action securities
cases and the comptroller described them as the best of the
applicant pool, his office has declined to reveal the names of the
11 firms that were passed over, even though most state agencies
routinely release such information and state law generally requires
it.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has collected nearly $5 million for his re-election
campaign, among the highest totals for candidates for statewide
office this year, and he has $3.5 million in the bank. He is facing
a little-known Republican, Bruce A. Blakeman, a Nassau County
legislator who entered the race in early June and has just begun
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barrack, Rodos, the two other firms that McCall selected
are no strangers to Democratic politics. Trial lawyers have long
been influential in the party because they are among its largest
donors. But most of the donors from the three firms had not
contributed to McCall's campaign before June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Weiss, a senior partner at another of the three firms,
Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach of Manhattan, was vice
chairman of the New York delegation to the Democratic National
Convention in 1996, and gave a party for delegates at the state
Democratic convention in May.
</P>
<P>
   The third firm is Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &AMP; Grossmann, one
of whose partners, Max Berger, has also been a big contributor to
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions by lawyers to elected officials who
control legal contracts have come under growing scrutiny in recent
years, and some lawyers' groups are considering banning the
practice, known as ``pay to play.'' If they do, the groups would be
following the lead of the bond industry, which tightly restricts
political giving.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that he was concerned about ethics in government,
McCall said he favored a law barring donors who do business with
the state from contributing to candidates for state office. But he
said that until such a ban exists, he would not unilaterally stop
collecting such money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time that this happens, there is going to be an appearance
problem,'' he said, contending that all prominent state officials
face similar situations. ``That is why we have to change the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The retainer arrangements with the three firms do not include a
fixed duration, so it appears that the comptroller can dismiss any
firm at will. Each firm signs a new contract with the office when
he asks it to pursue a lawsuit. The comptroller has discretion in
choosing which firms get cases, said Steven Greenberg, his
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack, Rodos has received one case, and Bernstein, Litowitz
has received two. Milberg, Weiss has not yet received one. Because
no cases are completed, none of the firms has been paid fees so
far.
</P>
<P>
   For the firms, being selected was a coup because of changes in
1995 in Federal law involving class-action securities lawsuits.
Under the new rules, the parties with the biggest financial
interest at stake in a class-action suit are supposed to become the
lead plaintiff, meaning their lawyers handle the case for all the
participants in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York state pension fund joins a class-action
lawsuit, its stock holdings in the company being sued are often so
large that it is in a position to become the lead plaintiff. The
lawyers for the lead plaintiff earn their fees from the entire
class-action award, not just the part that goes to the lead
plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of the new rules, the comptroller's office decided
for the first time last year to retain lawyers that specialize in
class-action securities lawsuits, the reason it chose the three
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers typically file class-action securities lawsuits on
behalf of the shareholders in a company after the price of its
stock has plunged. The lawyers often charge that the change in the
price is due to some wrongdoing by the company, like fraud, and
demand that shareholders be compensated for their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, these suits fail to garner any money. But if they are
successful, the damages can run to tens or hundreds of millions of
dollars, depending on the losses to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after his firm was selected in June 1997, Barrack
gave $28,000, the legal limit, to the McCall campaign, according to
disclosure records. Barrack's wife, Lynne, also gave $28,000. In
the last five years, Barrack, his wife and his firm have given more
than $500,000 to Democratic committees and candidates on the
Federal level, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack said he contributed to McCall because he wanted him to
run for governor. At the time of the contributions in July 1997,
McCall was considering entering the gubernatorial race, but a month
later, he decided to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a very important state, and I was encouraging him
to do that,'' Barrack said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack, Rodos and its lawyers have given a total of $110,000 to
McCall's campaign, including $84,000 after being retained. Earlier
this year, the campaign returned $7,000 that was over the legal
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Berger of Bernstein, Litowitz said members of his firm
contributed $43,050 to the McCall campaign in the seven months
after June 1997 to show their gratitude for McCall's decision to
criticize Texaco at a time the firm was representing Texaco workers
in a lawsuit over hiring and promotion practices.
</P>
<P>
   The McCall campaign collected most of the money at a fund-raiser
at the Harvard Club that Berger sponsored in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a quid pro quo,'' Berger said. ``We thought what he
did was really extraordinary, to come out as a large institutional
investor in Texaco and speak out against workplace
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at Milberg, Weiss gave $11,000 to the McCall campaign in
June 1997, soon after the firm was selected. Weiss, the senior
partner at the firm, later was co-chairman of a large McCall
fund-raiser at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a big supporter of Democrats, and I have been for a long
time,'' Weiss said. ``Carl was our only incumbent at the state
level, and I felt that it was an important race for our party.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the money that the three firms and their lawyers
gave in the seven months after they were retained, Bernstein,
Litowitz contributed $5,000 to the McCall campaign in June.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts with the firms became an issue in July in
litigation that the state pension fund has joined against the
Cendant Corp., which owns such brands as Avis car rentals and
Howard Johnson hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has formed an alliance with the pension funds of
California and New York City, and that alliance is seeking to
become lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against Cendant.
The other funds have agreed that Barrack, Rodos and Bernstein,
Litowitz will represent the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who has brought his own lawsuit against Cendant said
the pension funds should be disqualified from becoming lead
plaintiff because the campaign contributions from Bernstein,
Litowitz to McCall called into question whether the funds could
insure that the lawyers would receive the lowest possible fees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Howard Sirota, said he had not been aware of the
contributions from Barrack, Rodos and Milberg, Weiss to McCall.
When told of them, Sirota said: ``There is more here than I knew
about, and there is clearly at this point a lot of fire, not just
smoke. These numbers are staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's aides refused to say what percentage of any damage
award in the Cendant case would be paid to the two firms. But they
stressed that the fees were on a sliding scale, with the firms
receiving far less if the case is settled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant's market value dropped $14 billion in the spring after
accounting irregularities were discovered at CUC, a discount
shopping club business that had merged with HFS Inc. to form
Cendant. Cendant's chairman, Walter Forbes, resigned Tuesday after
coming under fire for the irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit to recover some of the shareholder
losses could lead to damages in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.

SPORTS COLUMN: SLUGGING IT OUT FOR MVP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There is excitement here, not electricity. What you
feel is the excitement of a novelty, not the electricity of a
pennant race, where every at-bat is crucial, every pitch matters,
every run is precious.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players don't sit nervously in the dugout watching the
scoreboard. They sit and watch Mark McGwire hit towering home runs
at a record-setting pace.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere surrounding Busch Stadium is as festive as a
state fair. Fans come from far and near to witness McGwire's
startling exhibition of strength and hand-eye coordination as he
chases Roger Maris' single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's game with Milwaukee, McGwire led a
four-player race with 44 home runs. Sammy Sosa of the Cubs, with
two home runs on Monday, had 40, as did Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle.
Greg Vaughn of San Diego had 37.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the difficult task of determining who should be the
National League's most valuable player: McGwire, who has created a
national sensation with his towering blasts; or Sosa who is trying
to carry his club to the playoffs, possibly a pennant, or Vaughn,
the power player on a first-place team?
</P>
<P>
   As St. Louis returned to Busch Stadium on Tuesday night for a
homestand, McGwire contemplated an award he has not won. ``I truly
believe that MVP should go to a position player,'' he said. ``It
should be the guy who has the best overall year, numbers-wise, no
matter if his team is in last place or is in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this series my vote was cast: Sammy Sosa should be the
MVP, hands down. McGwire has 44 home runs on a losing team. Sosa
has 40 home runs and is propelling his team to the playoffs,
possibly a pennant. For Sosa there is more at stake than a home run
chase. He doesn't have the luxury of swinging from his heels every
time at bat. There are runs to drive in, games to win.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game, Sosa said: ``I'm not looking for the
record. I'm not looking to chase nobody. I'm just trying to go out
there, do my job every day and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sosa hit a crucial home run against New York, then on
Monday he hit two more _ including a grand slam _ to help Chicago
keep pace in the division race. If the award is being given in the
spirit of Roger Maris, whose record is being chased, Sosa is the
MVP. Maris not only broke Babe Ruth's single-season record, but he
also did it in the context of helping his Yankees win a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   No one escapes pressure in this scenario; it just comes from
different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on a team with good players surrounding you it could
make things a little easier, but it could make things difficult,''
McGwire said. ``Sosa is playing on a great team, but he has a lot
of pressure because a lot of people are looking at him. The
pressure may be greater on him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a different kind of pressure on McGwire. He is like the
carnival strongman who comes to work each day with thousands of
paying customers expecting to see him perform feats of strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are talking about, the home run hitting, I don't
have any control over it,'' McGwire said. ``I only have control
over swinging the bat. If I get a hit, I'm excited. But I can't
control whether or not it's going to go out of the ball park.
That's a difficult thing to do. The whole weekend in Colorado
people were saying, `Come on, Mark, hit one out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vaughn is having a terrific season, his team leads its
division by 13 games. If Chicago makes the playoffs and Sosa keeps
up the pace, he should be rewarded for performing under the
pressure of a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   As for McGwire, it's clear after walking around St. Louis, whose
playoff hopes are buried, that he is more or less performing a
civic duty. Even he admitted that ``when you're playing on a team
that hasn't been consistently winning all year, it's tough to come
to the ball park every day knowing that you don't know how your
team is going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Sosa keeps up his pace and McGwire keeps up his, MVP
voters will be forced to make a sophisticated decision and a
critical distinction between who helped baseball and who helped his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' McGwire said. ``It's not easy to play
consistently well over a whole year on a winning team; it's not
easy to play consistently well the whole year on a losing team.
There's so much pressure to deal with on both sides of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he added, ``it's going to be a tough
task for the voters.'' &QL;

PORTALS: DOORMEN OF THE INTERNET  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PORTALS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
There's a new fad in the Internet market, and it sounds
supiciously like a real estate mantra: location, location,
location.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major online services like Netscape and Yahoo are constructing
gated communities on their virtual real estate, and they want
consumers and advertisers to become permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   These mega-sites, called portals, are ``doorways'' to the rest
of the Internet. They aim to be the first place Web surfers go
online, and the home base for all their Internet activities.
Vendors contend that they are the most efficient way to corral Web
users and generate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, portals offer a single convenient stop on the
Internet from which they can converse (e-mail, chat rooms and
instant messaging), shop (e-commerce), get up-to-the-minute
information (news, weather and stock quotes), look for information
(search engine, directories) and download free software.
</P>
<P>
   Once the portals hook Web surfers, the logic goes, advertisers
and content providers will flock to them with cash to buy space on
their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a scarce resource in our economy, and portals solve
that,'' Infoseek CEO Harry Motro said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Excite co-founder Joe Kraus said many of the 100 million-plus
consumers online want a convenient, easy-to-use site where they can
get news and information and ``there is no reason to go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said users choose a virtual home base through brand-name
recognition and then ``stick with it if they feel comfortable with
a personalized community.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said you can expect to see a lot of advertising
from online companies attempting to create a brand image, and a
myriad of free online services from vendors in an all-out effort to
keep customers.
</P>
<P>
   The potential payoff is astronomical: Net advertising is
expected to hit $7.7 billion by the year 2002 and e-commerce sales
could balloon to $37.5 billion this year, according to market
researcher Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, portals have taken the Internet industry by
storm. They are changing the way companies design their sites and
how consumers surf the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portals are a recognition that search engines alone are not
the end-all for the mass market to view the Web,'' said Barry
Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services. ``The common view a
few years ago was that people would (sign up with) an ISP, choose a
browser and then do all their own searching. Aggregators like AOL
supposedly were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That view was wrong,'' he said. ``The Internet experience is
all about creating a brand name to attract an audience and building
loyalty so they stick.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet has gone portal, Wall Street has bought into the
craze.
</P>
<P>
   A recent run up in online stocks has much to do with the new
strategy, according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the Net will be big, and what they want is a
piece of the action,'' said analyst Jim Balderston of Zona Research
Inc. in Redwood City. ``But many would rather invest in a company
they understand, like a Yahoo, which is selling road maps to the
Net, than a router or hub company that is laying the cement for the
information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   Major media companies are scrambling to get into the portal
business. Many have either invested in Internet companies (NBC sunk
a substantial amount of money into Cnet, while Disney bought nearly
half of Infoseek) or attempted buyouts (AT&AMP;T Corp. offered $30
billion for AOL, while Zapata Corp. bid $1.7 billion for Excite.)
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied market reaction has resulted in stratospheric
market caps among the swelling ranks of portal players.
</P>
<P>
   _AOL's $25 billion market evaluation dwarfs Caterpillar Inc.,
Eastman Kodak Co. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. Not coincidentally, AOL is
credited with originating the concept in mid-1997 after its
subscriber revenues started drying up when it switched to flat-fee
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement its subscription and advertising income, the
company began striking million-dollar deals with retailers to carve
out real estate on its site. Amazon.com, a popular Web-based
bookseller, paid AOL $19 million over three years to be the
principal book retailer on aol.com, AOL's Web site. And
1-800-FLOWERS agreed to pay AOL $25 million over four years to be
displayed on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices have become the industry norm.
</P>
<P>
   _Yahoo, at $9 billion, is worth more on paper than Union
Carbide, the 13th-largest chemical-maker. ``Chief Yahoos'' David
Filo and Jerry Yang, who co-founded the Santa Clara company in
1994, are billionaires despite dental-floss-thin profits.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the company's success is due to its widespread
brand-name recognition and its decision early on to layer a wide
variety of content on its popular search engine _ a strategy that
was parroted by its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Portals) are an extension of what we have always done,'' Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to aggregate everything and anything
possible,'' company CEO Tim Koogle said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Netscape Communications Corp. yesterday became the latest
company to polish its portal plan. It unveiled My Netscape, a
personalized front page that combines news, browser, e-mail and
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft is readying a mega-portal site, code named
``Microsoft Start,'' that will showcase all its online properties _
from auto and travel services to news content, free e-mail, instant
messaging and an online directory.
</P>
<P>
   _Infoseek _ once given up for dead as a hopeless also-ran to
Yahoo and Excite _ has combined services with Disney to ``offer a
major media portal play,'' Motro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney-Infoseek partnership includes deals for exclusive
content from ABC News, ESPN and Disney. ``You can't be a me-too
service and expect to survive,'' Motro said. ``All of our content
is ours and no one else's.''
</P>
<P>
   _HotBot, the San Francisco-based search engine that is part of
Wired Digital, announced Monday that it is launching a $10 to $15
million branding campaign to increase traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
   _Even Zapata, a Houston-based oil exploration
company-turned-fish-oil specialist that unsuccessfully bid $1.7
billion for Excite in May, has acquired 24 Web sites and is
stitching them into a super site, called Zap.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a site consumers will visit and stay in
permanently because we own all of the properties,'' CEO Avie Glazer
said. ``We're different from a Yahoo or AOL. They rent space to
other sites and run the risk of promoting them until consumers
become more interested (in the rented sites) and go straight to
them, bypassing an AOL or Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The stampede of online heavyweights into a narrow market has
created congestion and prompted speculation that there will be a
shakedown separating the winners from losers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts assert that the portal market is too crowded and will
undergo consolidation during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a shakeout because there are too many players,''
said analyst Jill Frankle, of International Data Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zona Research's Balderston said investors &UR;  &LR; will continue to plow
money into online stocks until the market ``winnows out the haves
from the have nots.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Eventually, they'll realize that eyeballs aren't translating
into revenues and justifying these market caps,'' Balderston said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that day arrives _ and no one has a clue when _ investors
will continue to go gaga over portal companies and major media
companies will eye further investments and potential acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing real revenues flow into public companies,''
Motro said. ``This isn't like the push market. This is a real
market.''

INTERNET FIRM GIVING AWAY ITS STOCK  
 BY DAN FOST 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - TRAVELZOO   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
At a time when Internet stocks are fetching astronomical prices, an
obscure Bahamas-based company is giving away its shares.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company, travelzoo.com, says that by distributing free
shares, it generates that valuable Internet commodity: traffic.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 people have visited the site, according to a
counter on the home page. The site's main line of business is
advertising discount airfares and resort packages culled mostly
from other Internet sites. On July 15, DoubleClick, a New
York-based Internet advertising company, began selling ads on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledges that it's ``hard to say at the moment''
how much the shares are worth. It's operating on the theory that
the shares will be valuable when the company launches an initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is home to no shortage of scams, and Web watchers
are cautious about travelzoo.com's too-good-to-be-true offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a good deal or one of the best scams I've ever
heard of,'' said Ira Winkler of Severna Park, Md., an Internet
privacy expert and the author of ``Corporate Espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   John Heine, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which is aware of the site, declined to say whether the
company is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it is based in the Bahamas to take advantage of
``the freedom and flexibility to pursue exciting, cutting-edge
business concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the SEC says it still can investigate an offshore
company if the firm sells securities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's Web site, people can sign up for
three free shares. The shares are held electronically in the
Bahamas. If a shareholder gets a friend to sign up, the shareholder
gets another free share, up to a maximum of 10 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company goes on to say that shareholders ``are eligible to
receive dividend payments'' and can sell their stake for a profit
when travelzoo.com goes public, which it claims could happen
``fairly soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a co-owner of travelzoo.com is risk-free,'' the site
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Bartel, the company's chief executive, was in Germany
yesterday and was unavailable for comment, said his brother, Holger
Bartel, a Bay Area resident.
</P>
<P>
   Holger Bartel, who said he is not affiliated with the company,
said his brother plans to open an office next month in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Travelzoo.com's Web site described Ralph Bartel as a 32-year-old
former reporter and news editor with German television. It said he
holds an MBA from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Subrahmanyam, a finance professor at University of
California at Los Angeles, said the site is not necessarily a scam
even though its business plan sounds unusual.
</P>
<P>
   By spreading the word through e-mail, Subrahmanyam said, the
company hopes to drum up interest in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site says the founders will keep 3 million shares while
giving up to 700,000 people as many as 7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, the author, said that means the company is either
stupid or fraudulent. ``Nobody ever gives away 70 percent of their
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler also warned that the site could sell shareholders' names
to direct marketing companies, which pay as much as $50 a name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The site claims that it won't sell names, but Winkler said,
``If they lie, big deal. You would have to go to the Bahamas to sue
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But Holger Bartel maintains that the shares are not worthless.
``Yahoo, Excite _ they didn't make any revenues for the first year.
Would people have said it's not worth anything?''

BERKELEY PUBLISHER FIGHTS TO PREVENT BOOK SALES BAN  
 BY AMY DOAN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - NOLO   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Nolo Press, the Berkeley-based publisher of self-help books and
software, has filed a court petition for information that it says
it needs to fight a possible sales ban in Texas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nolo says a committee working under the jurisdiction of the
state's high court has been quietly investigating Nolo's sales of
books and software in Texas to determine whether they constitute an
illegal practice of law in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the lack of information on the investigation, Nolo
asked the Texas Supreme Court last week to force the committee to
publicly disclose its rules, the identity of members and
information it has about the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're operating in a total vacuum,'' said Steve Elias, Nolo's
associate publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo has sold its books and software in Texas since the
mid-1970s without any complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley publisher, whose titles include ``Fight Your Ticket
... And Win!'' and ``Good Divorce,'' has a hearing scheduled for
August 20 before the so-called Unauthorized Practice of Law
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of six lawyers and three nonlawyers, the committee has
the authority to determine on a case-by-case basis which services
and acts constitute the practice of law. Should the committee rule
against Nolo, it could ban sales of its products in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Elias said the committee is ``simply trying to stamp out
self-help law'' and preserve Texas' traditional law business.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ticer, chairman of the Dallas subcommittee overseeing the
UPL Committee, said Elias' comments were ``highly inaccurate'' and
that the committee's objective is to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ticer declined comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is the only state that continues to apply
unauthorized-practice-of-law regulations to books, Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a 1967 New York case involving the best-seller
``How to Avoid Probate,'' New York's highest court ruled that
published materials may not be considered legal advice and that
they should be covered under the First Amendment.  &LR;

MARK VEVERKA/STREET SMARTS  
 GEOCITIES MAY BE THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF INTERNET MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Coming soon to a brokerage near you: Internet IPO Madness III _
featuring online service provider GeoCities. First there was
Inktomi, that madcap maker of search engine software. Then there
was Broadcast.com, that wacky online provider of audio and video.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now there's GeoCities, that nutty Web site of ``online
communities,'' which critics expect to be the summer's next
blockbuster initial offering.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the big screen analogy is over the top. But during this
summer of trepidation over Asian instability and domestic corporate
profits, Internet-related IPOs have been responsible for some of
the biggest megahit-deals of the season.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo-based Inktomi saw its shares soar as high as five
times their initial value since its June IPO. And Dallas-based
Broadcast.com shares have risen as high as four times their initial
value since its IPO earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The lights-out performance of these IPOs are likely to presage
an equally successful rollout of GeoCities shares to the public,
investment banking and brokerage sources say.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities management and bankers are currently conducting their
road show for institutional investors, which is expected to wind
down during the second week of August. The shares could be priced
as early as August 10.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the
shares are supposed to be priced between $12 and $14. But judging
by the massive popularity of the Broadcast.com issues, it's a fair
guess that the shares will get priced a few bucks higher, bankers
and fund managers say.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling much of the lofty expectations for the offering is the
fact that its lead manager is Goldman Sachs, the same investment
bank that brought Yahoo and Broadcast.com public. (Inktomi was
lead-managed by Morgan Stanley). Co-managers on the deal are
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.8 million shares may be offered. In addition, another
712,000 shares may be sold to the underwriters if the original
allotment sells out, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is known for identifying and representing the leading
companies it thinks will dominate particular technology sectors, or
in this case, a subsector such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers contend that a Goldman-led technology IPO can
often become a self-fulfilling prophecy, giving a little-known
company with no profits and an iffy business model (such as
GeoCities) the ability to attract wads of quality capital from the
world over.
</P>
<P>
   They may have a point. Once again, Goldman seems to have hitched
its wagon to one of the strongest players in a particular area of
the Internet. (Strong, that is, if you throw traditional financial
measurements out the window.)
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities is the big dog among ``online communities,'' with one
of the fastest growing Web sites of its kind. Its cyber-community
of personal Web sites are segregated into some 40 different areas
of interest, or ``neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have people talking about their pets and their
personal lives,'' but their neighborhoods ``could evolve into a
very targeted audience that (eventually) could be very lucrative,''
says Chris Elwell, vice president of Internet.com, an online
division of Mecklermedia in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities attracts Web surfers by giving away sites for free,
calling owners of such sites ``Homesteaders.''
</P>
<P>
   And the community's popularity is exploding. GeoCities has grown
from a mere 10,000 sites in October 1995 to more than 2.1 million
sites at present, according to the filing. (GeoCities executives
were unable to comment due to quiet-period requirements.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, in June GeoCities attracted 14.8 million viewers to
its site and was the third-most visited Web site on the Internet
among home users, according to independent Internet research firms
cited in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, GeoCities is one of the busiest gateway Web sites that
has yet to go public. And when you look at the
market-capitalizations of those that have gone public, almost all
boast market-capitalizations of more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So the motivation for taking GeoCities public may seem like a
no-brainer in so far as the bankers and management are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But should individuals own the stock?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it's nearly impossible to buy initial shares
because institutions and high-net-worth brokerage customers get top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you want to buy and hold for the long haul, Internet
stocks are probably not where you want to be, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same fundamentals weaknesses in other Internet
stocks exist with GeoCities. The companies' losses are mounting,
swelling from $3 million in 1996 to $8.9 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Its revenues from advertising depend on short-term contracts
that last only one to two months, which makes for very murky
visibility of quarter-by-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
   Morever, the company relies on one customer for about 12 percent
of its revenues: Egghead Direct, the software retailer that has
re-invented itself as an electronic commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some observers question the quality of the eyeballs
that are attracted to online communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at GeoCities, its audience tends to be more
downscale than those of some of the search engine sites,'' says
Craig Gugel, a vice president of Organic Online, a San
Francisco-based Internet advertising firm. Still, the public
curtain is likely to go up on GeoCities in less than two weeks, and
investors are expected to give the new issues a big thumbs up. The
madness continues.

ON A TIMES SQUARE BLOCK, BARRICADES AND ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the ordeal of cleaning up Times Square entered its
second week Tuesday, city officials said that a block to the north
of the Conde Nast building's construction collapse _ 44th Street
between the Avenue of the Americas and Broadway _ would likely
remain closed at least through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on a day when tempers flared on the block,
which is home to several hundred people who have been forced out of
their residences since the July 21 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't live like this,'' said Arleen Getzel, an office
manager and resident at the Church of the Nazarene on 44th Street.
Unlike residents and property owners on 43rd Street, who live
directly under the Conde Nast construction site and have been told
that their block would be closed for weeks, those on 44th Street
said they were exasperated by the continued delays, particularly
since there were indications that the block would be reopened
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' said Ms. Getzel, who normally spends most of
her days working with the homeless. ``Now we are homeless. I have
been sitting alone in a miserable hotel for a week now, and they
should just let us go in, get our stuff and make plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials at the site of the construction
accident, considered the city's worst in more than a decade, said
enough progress had been made so that they could reopen sections of
the Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street to rush-hour traffic
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   All that would remain closed Wednesday, they said, are 43rd
Street, 44th Street and the north sidewalk of 42nd Street _ all
between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But for those still kept behind police barricades, the city's
assurances that work was proceeding as fast as possible apparently
provided little consolation. Business people displaced by the
accident said the ordeal may not end when all Times Square streets
are opened. Simply being kept away from their offices, computers
and clients could result in long-term losses, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid my business will just go to someone else,'' said
William Rogan, an architect who lives and works in an apartment
behind the 44th Street barricades. Among his biggest clients is
Ralph Lauren, for whom he is rushing to complete the designs of
women's clothing display areas for more than 400 stores, all of
which are needed for the fall fashion season.
</P>
<P>
   His problem now, Rogan said, is that all his plans are locked
away in the computer in his home office. ``I have not even begun to
calculate my future losses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Zlotnick has been kept out of his graphic design business
at 120 W. 44th St. ``They might give us a bone but it won't make up
for the aggravation the loss of business and loss of momentum we've
suffered,'' he said. ``My cell phone bill is already sky high.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gubin, who works in advertising, was trying to get into
his office Tuesday morning at the barricaded street corner of 44th
Street and Seventh Avenue. ``I have friends around town,'' he said,
``I've been using their offices to make calls. I've been stalling
my clients, deferring business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Jerome Hauer, director of the
Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, offered little hope of
relief for those on 44th Street. He said he saw little chance that
they would be allowed to return to their homes or businesses until
sometime Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, he said, was the result of the same problem that has
afflicted cleanup efforts since the collapse: the unpredictable and
often harrowing work necessary to shore up the broken scaffolding
on the Conde Nast building before taking it down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for instance, workers dangling in a construction bucket
more than 20 stories above the street nearly got into a serious
accident while trying to drape nylon mesh from the east side of the
damaged scaffolding. When a sudden wind gust turned the bucket
halfway around, one of several cables that secured it to the
building snapped like a rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   That left engineers on the site to reconsider their schedule.
Although the entire east side of the scaffolding earlier had been
expected to be draped in nylon by Tuesday morning, he said much of
that work still needed to be done. Similar work on the north side
of the scaffolding was only half-completed Tuesday, and must be
finished before police barricades can be removed from 44th Street,
Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration over the tedious process was not confined to those
who live and work on 44th Street. For instance, there was an
exchange of court challenges over the fate of pets apparently still
stranded in buildings on 43rd Street. While city officials said
that all the pets they could find had been removed from the other
streets affected by the construction accident, a small number of
pets are known to remain inside buildings on 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Luis Gonzalez of the State Supreme Court in the Bronx
agreed to a court petition by 43rd Street residents Monday and
issued a temporary order that directed the police to allow the
residents to enter their buildings and retrieve their pets if they
signed waivers absolving the city from liability.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours of that court order, and before any of the pet
owners had crossed police lines, lawyers for the city filed an
appeal that prompted the judge to issue a stay of his order.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the blocks of 43rd and 44th Streets under the
shadow of the Conde Nast building remained abandoned Tuesday, even
as throngs returned to the center of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Roundabout Theater Company's productions of
``Side Man'' and ``You Can Never Tell'' reopened after each show
had canceled eight performances, together costing $200,000 in lost
ticket sales. Although forced to negotiate police barriers that
separated the Times Square sidewalks from vehicular traffic, those
attending the plays were allowed to arrive at the theater at 45th
Street and Broadway from the sidewalks on the east side of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   The company in charge of the Conde Nast construction site,
Tishman Construction Corp., and its insurer, Liberty Mutual,
continued to process claims for financial relief from displaced
businesses and residents.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, senior vice president of Tishman Realty &AMP;
Construction Co., said late Tuesday that 407 claims had been
approved, and $216,000 in money had been distributed by the
insurer.

VICTIM IN TIMES SQUARE ACCIDENT REMEMBERED AS LOVING LIFE IN NEW
YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Robert Feliconio urged his aunt, Thereza,
to move to Florida, saying New York City was too dangerous for a
woman her age.
</P>
<P>
   But Thereza Feliconio, who was in her 80s, refused, saying she
could take care of herself. Now, he wishes he had pressed harder,
he said Tuesday after attending a memorial Mass in her honor at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feliconio died in her one-room apartment on July 21 when the
collapse of scaffolding at the Conde Nast building in Times Square
sent a chunk of metal through the roof and into her top-floor room
in the Woodstock Hotel, a 12-story single-room-occupancy building
that caters to the elderly poor. Not only did the accident take Ms.
Feliconio's life, but it also forced city officials to close the
heart of Manhattan for days because of concerns about the unstable
scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands have been inconvenienced by the collapse,
perhaps none have suffered more than Ms. Feliconio's family, and
Tuesday, she was remembered at her favorite church by about 70
people, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; Douglas Durst, the
developer of the Conde Nast building, and Richard Kielar, senior
vice president of Tishman Realty and Construction Co., whose unit
was the site's construction manager.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of five children, Ms. Feliconio grew up in Sao
Paulo, Brazil. She was married briefly in her 20s and was a partner
in a bus company, her nephew said. She sold her interest in the
company before moving to New York 30 years ago, but it did not make
her rich.
</P>
<P>
   Once here, she worked as a health care worker until her
retirement more than a decade ago. She moved to the Woodstock from
a one-bedroom apartment after her retirement, Robert Feliconio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been trying to get her out of New York City, to be very
honest, for quite a few years,'' said Feliconio, a 62-year-old
retired schoolteacher from Odessa, Fla. ``But she was just in love
with this city, in love with the New York way of life. We just
couldn't get her out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing Thereza Feliconio loved most about the city was its
culture, relatives said. Her favorite shows included ``The Phantom
of the Opera'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.'' She also enjoyed
dining out and shopping at the city's many department stores,
though she did not have much money, her relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   She looked as if she were about to take the stage herself, they
said, always carefully made-up and dressed. And like most women of
her generation, she was reticent about her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows her age, but we'd place her at 82,''
Robert Feliconio said. ``She was too elegant to tell anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Marino, a cousin who lives in Hamden, Conn., and
visited her frequently, said Thereza Feliconio was the consummate
New Yorker. ``She walked everywhere,'' Ms. Marino recalled. ``I
don't remember her taking a cab or the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Ferry, who led mourners through the 23rd Psalm and
read the Gospel account of the resurrection of Lazarus as part of
the hourlong service, recalled a woman who was devoted to the
church. He said that St. Patrick's Cathedral was the center of her
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``To outsiders, New York City seems very impersonal, very cold
and not concerned with individuals,'' he said. ``Yet if you are a
New Yorker, born here as I was, or came here as Thereza did, you
know that nothing can be further from the truth. It is at times
like these that New Yorkers rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers retained by Robert Feliconio's father and Thereza
Feliconio's brother, Carlos, of Hollywood, Fla., said they were
impressed by the city's outpouring of sympathy, but said it did not
change their belief that someone was negligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tragedy like this doesn't occur but for someone's
negligence,'' said Steven Schwartzapfel, who stood next to his
partner, Robert Marcus. ``We promised the family that we would seek
and hold the wrongdoers responsible for causing the tragic and
senseless death of Thereza Feliconio.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Auster, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which
has been helping scores of residents left homeless by the accident,
accompanied about 30 Woodstock residents, some walking with canes,
to the church Tuesday. They came by two chartered buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an air of melancholy,'' she said. ``In the church, I
was sitting behind another Red Cross worker, who was patting the
arm of an elderly man who was upset. A lot of people cared about
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall, everyone's OK,'' she said. ``The service was
hard, but so is the fact that they haven't been allowed back into
their apartments.''

THE PASS CAN SET UP OR START UP AN OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The essence of winning football is the running game. This
question follows: Does the run set up the pass, or does the pass
set up the run?
</P>
<P>
   It is a puzzle as old as the game. As National Football League
training camps unfold in earnest this week, each team attempts to
solidify exactly what role the passing game will play in its
season.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in thinking on the question can be dramatic among
the NFL's 30 teams. Oakland, for example, says that the deep,
vertical passing game is the way to go. That approach sets up the
run and breaks down defenses and keeps the opponent always on its
heels. It strikes fear. Pittsburgh, however, insists that pounding
the football up the middle via the run softens any defense. It
makes the enemy bring its safeties up to support the run defense.
Then pow. Hit 'em with the home run, the deep pass.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in fact, lies somewhere in between. It is all about
efficiency. Choose your strategy: run first or pass first. Simply
carry it out efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   And when you do pass, work on improving in a few specific areas
that are crucial to success.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you run or pass, the first essential ingredients of a
productive offense are, of course, a stout and mobile offensive
line and skilled players at the skill positions to make the offense
click. Avoiding turnovers is critical. Avoiding dropped balls in
the passing game is critical, too.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, success in today's NFL passing game frequently
hinges on increasing average yards gained per pass attempt,
allowing fewer sacks and using the short pass as a substitute for
the run.
</P>
<P>
   If a team can master these interrelated areas, it is on its way
to a successful passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers from the 1997 NFL season say so.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that ranked No. 1 through No. 7 in average yards per
pass attempt, with sacks included as attempts, all reached the
playoffs last season. Five of those teams won 11 or more games.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (No. 3), Cincinnati (No. 7), Atlanta (No. 8),
Philadelphia (No. 12) and Indianapolis (No. 13) sat pretty in
average yards per pass attempt without considering sacks allowed.
Factor in the sacks, and their rankings dropped to 10, 9, 15, 17
and 21, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the puzzle of running first or passing first is
to use the pass as the run.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, San Francisco has been the champion of
this tactic. How many times did Joe Montana and Steve Young play
catch with tight end Brent Jones? Jones would run 4 yards, turn
around, catch the ball and fall down for 3 more yards, and the
result was the equivalent of a 7-yard run. The game clock kept
running, too, keeping the ball away from the opponent's offense.
Easy stuff. Or those swing passes the 49ers used to a variety of
backs _ Roger Craig or Ricky Watters, now Garrison Hearst _ for 5
and 6 yards or a little more. Stay inbounds and the clock runs.
Again, the equivalent of a running play.
</P>
<P>
   That is en vogue in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we stand in the passing game, teams ask? Here are some
answers. Following each team is its number of sacks allowed and
yardage lost on those sacks.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (62 sacks for 430 yards): The Colts must throw more
quickly and throw more often to tight end Ken Dilger. He caught 27
balls last season and averaged 14.1 yards a catch. That's a hot
average for a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (22 for 153): Dan Marino is protected well and throws it
fast. The Dolphins need more speed and fewer dropped passes to take
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (50 for 317): Not only 50 sacks allowed, but also 33
interceptions thrown. No wonder the Saints suffered. They must
improve in both pass protection and possession time.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (35 for 210): The Broncos took chances and made the
gambles pay off. Last season they swung back and forth on the
run-first/pass-first question: quarterback John Elway set up back
Terrell Davis and then Davis set up Elway. Versatile. Makes them
tough to defend. Helped make them champions.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE (40 for 218): For the last two seasons this team
has led the league in average yards per pass attempt with sacks
included. Several teams allowed fewer sacks but lost more yardage.
(Dallas, for example, allowed 39 sacks for 313 yards lost.) That
says that Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell is agile and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (32 for 238): Their average yards per pass attempt in
both categories, with and without sacks, was at the bottom of the
league, yet they won their division. Two things are clear: the
running game was good and the defense was spectacular. For success
in '98, the Giants need big improvement here.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND (58 for 530): Jeff George led the league in passing
yards (3,917). He led the American Football Conference in touchdown
passes (29). Yet he still spent too much time on his back, and the
Raiders paid for their all-or-nothing scheme. Too often, it was
nothing. The Raiders will tinker more with the short passing game.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY (32 for 236): The Chiefs ranked in the lower half of
the league in average yards gained per pass, but with free agent
Derrick Alexander joining Andre Rison, they have a receiving
package that can burn.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA (78 for 495): Where do you start to fix this?
</P>
<P>
   JETS (48 for 313): The more Glenn Foley plays, the more the
Jets' passing numbers should improve. If Vinny Testaverde starts,
he will have to reduce his interceptions (15 last season in
Baltimore).
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (36 for 228): Receiver James McKnight led the league
with 18.7 yards a catch last season. A steady mixture of deep
passes to McKnight and short ones to the new Seahawk back, Ricky
Watters, spells success.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY (32 for 196): Only six NFL teams lost fewer than 200
yards when sacked. This was one. The others were Pittsburgh (152),
Tennessee (199), Miami (153), Green Bay (191) and Washington (198).
</P>
<P>
   Does the run set up the pass or does the pass set up the run?
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of choice for NFL teams in the '98 season. Drops
and interceptions, however, are not; they kill a passing offense.
Completing big plays, avoiding sacks and using the short pass as a
run bring the passing offense to life.

AT 18, KWAN IDLING AT THE CROSSROADS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Michelle Kwan will not graduate from high
school for a couple of weeks, so it's understandable that she
doesn't have the rest of her life mapped out just yet. For now, she
is committed to participating in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City. But that is down a long, unknowable road. Right now, all
she is looking for is a place to pull over.
</P>
<P>
   Figure skating begins Wednesday at the Goodwill Games, and Kwan
is a spokeswoman for the Games as well as the top female
competitor. There is a $75,000 reward for first place, along with
her promotional fee, which is believed to be in six figures. She
has been going nonstop for a year, with the Olympics and a 59-stop
tour. Like any 18-year-old, she is waiting to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   She has cleared the decks for a monthlong vacation in August.
Skating begins again in September, and not until then will Kwan
begin making firm plans for the coming season. She wants to compete
at the 1998 national and world championships, her coach and agent
said. But, as of now, Kwan has committed only to a pro-am in
October in Daytona Beach, Fla. ``What she needs is a real rest,''
said Frank Carroll, who coaches Kwan in Lake Arrowhead, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She feels no pain from the stress fracture in her left foot, she
said. How much she competes this season will be determined by how
well she is able to raise the bar on her own high standards. ``I
don't want to come out and be the same old Michelle,'' she said at
a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
   That means she wants to add more technical difficulty to her
routines. Last year, it was impossible with a stress fracture in
the second toe of her left foot. This year, she wants to perfect
triple-lutz-triple-loop and triple-toe-triple-toe combination
jumps. And after talking about a triple axel for four years, she
joked, she wants to be able to land one regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've stayed at a certain level in technical ability,''
Kwan said. ``It's time to really expand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she watched the taped replay of her
silver-medal-winning performance at the 1998 Winter Games in
Nagano, Japan. She understands what was lacking. A little speed,
``a little more oomph'' in her cautious routine. In retrospect, she
said, she was a little too nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was a little too overwhelmed by everything,'' Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, however, she doesn't feel the searing regret
she thought she might feel at winning silver instead of the
expected gold.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, she said, she was thinking: ``If I don't win, what
am I going to do with myself? I thought if I didn't win, my life
would be over.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the silver came a revelation. Life didn't end. Neither
did skating. Her graciousness in defeat may even have made her more
popular than she would have been in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know that that's not all there is to skating,'' Kwan
said. ``A gold medal is great, but I feel there is more that I can
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she misses competing against Tara Lipinski, who won the
gold medal and, having fulfilled her lifelong dream at 15, decided
to turn professional. ``I do miss her, because it's nice having a
challenge,'' Kwan said. ``But I feel there is a challenge against
myself also.''
</P>
<P>
   The world silver and bronze medalists, Mariya Butyrskaya and
Irina Slutskaya, both of Russia, are competing here, but they
should pose no threat to Kwan, who will perform her Olympic
routines at the Goodwill Games. In fact, there is no female skater
in the world with Olympic ambitions who can match Kwan's grace and
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks will be willing to throw money at her like
flower petals to keep her in the competitive side of the sport.
After her, there is no one. The real challenge for Kwan is to
decide whether she truly feels joy at the prospect of another
Olympics or whether she only feels unfulfilled at having won silver
instead of gold. She has put college off for at least a year to
concentrate on skating. She will be only 21 during the 2002 Salt
Lake City Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wants to compete, she should compete,'' Carroll said.
``Her parents aren't telling her she has to stay in. I'm not
saying, `Michelle, you didn't win the gold, you've got to stay in.'
She's 18. Make some decisions. She's the one taking charge of her
life. I think it's nice.''

<P>
   Matteo Manuguerra, a French baritone who was admired for his
versatility and dramatic acuity, died in Montpellier, France, on
Thursday. He was 73 and lived in Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   He died of congestive heart failure three days after a stroke,
his manager, Robert Lombardo, said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1971, when he made his Metropolitan Opera debut as
Enrico in Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' Manuguerra appeared
regularly at the Met, where he sang 127 performances. Among the 15
roles he sang at the house were Marcello in Puccini's ``Boheme,''
Alfio in Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' and several Verdi
roles, including Carlo in Verdi's ``Forza del Destino,'' Renato in
``Un Ballo in Maschera,'' Amonasro in ``Aida'' and Germont in ``La
Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   His performances in the title role of ``Rigoletto'' were
particularly noteworthy and had grown increasingly rich over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Manuguerra was also a frequent guest of the Opera Orchestra of
New York, which presents operatic rarities at Carnegie Hall. He was
in the Opera Orchestra's casts for Donizetti's ``Lucrezia Borgia,''
Zandonai's ``Francesca di Rimini,'' Meyerbeer's ``Africaine,''
Verdi's ``Battaglia di Legnano'' and Catalani's ``Wally.'' His last
appearance in New York was in the Opera Orchestra's performance of
Bellini's ``Straniera'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Manuguerra was born in Tunisia to Italian parents in October
1924, and later acquired French citizenship. He began his vocal
studies after World War II and settled in Argentina, where at the
age of 35 he enrolled at the Buenos Aires Conservatory and the
Instituto Lirico. He returned to France in 1963 to make his debut
at the Lyons Opera as Valentin in Gounod's ``Faust.'' After three
years in Lyons he joined the roster of the Paris Opera, where he
added ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' ``Rigoletto'' and ``La Traviata'' to
his repertory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Manuguerra made his American debut as Gerard in
Giordano's ``Andrea Chenier'' at the San Francisco Opera. In the
United States, Manuguerra also performed with the Lyric Opera of
Chicago, the Dallas Opera, the Houston Grand Opera and the New
Orleans Opera. In Europe he made notable appearances at the Vienna
Staatsoper, the Arena di Verona and Covent Garden, as well as in
Bilbao, Spain; Frankfurt, Germany; Essen, Germany, and Bordeaux,
France, and at the Perelada Festival in Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   Manuguerra is survived by his wife, Michelle, two sons, Mathieu
and Marc, and a daughter, Marianne.

 Lawsuit begins over death at veterans hospital  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Lawyers for a 71-year-old Missouri widow
set out to show Monday what the FBI could not: that a murderer
stalked the hallways of the veterans hospital in Columbia six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum opened a wrongful-death lawsuit in federal court
Monday. She alleges negligence and malpractice led to the death of
her husband, Elzie Havrum, at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum says her husband, a World War II veteran who earned
a Purple Heart, died of a codeine overdose a nurse administered.
Havrum's death is one of 33 at the hospital the FBI called
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trusted his medical care to the same government he
served,'' Havrum's lawyer, John Kurtz of Kansas City, said Monday
in his opening statement. Havrum, he said, ``left the service much
as he left his life'' _ in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But a government lawyer said Havrum died of lung and heart
disease and that no one saw the nurse in question, Richard A.
Williams, do anything improper. Havrum had received three Tylenol 3
tablets, which contain codeine, for pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show Mr. Havrum did not die of codeine
toxicity,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Curt Bohling.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 32, has refused to comment on the case recently but
told a reporter last year he didn't give Havrum any unauthorized
medication. Williams could not be reached at his St. Louis area
home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen of Havrum's relatives were in the courtroom Monday but
declined to comment. Helen Havrum is seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is not on the witness list for the two-week trial
before U.S. District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey, but his wife,
Melissa Williams, gave a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Elzie Havrum died at age 66 on June 15, 1992, after being
admitted for shortness of breath. He had chronic asthma and
emphysema, but he ran a Friday night auction business at his
Fulton, Mo., home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never slowed down much,'' his son, David Havrum, testified
Monday. ``He kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum said she assumed her husband died of natural
causes, but then by the fall of 1992 reports surfaced about a high
rate of deaths at the hospital's Ward Four East, where Elzie Havrum
died.
</P>
<P>
   One study showed patients were 10 times more likely to die while
Williams was on duty than while other nurses worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not the most sick, they were not the ones most
expected to die,'' Kurtz said Monday. Some nurses had referred to
Williams as the ``angel of death,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum said the hospital erred in keeping Williams on duty
two to three months after a sharp increase in deaths began showing
up during his nursing shift.
</P>
<P>
   But a witness testified Monday that the hospital didn't dawdle
in investigating the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't waiting. We were reviewing those deaths every time
they occurred,'' said Linda McGary, who oversees the hospital's
quality care program. A board of doctors reviews care given, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   McGary said, however, that deaths were not tracked by wards in
which they occurred. A short-term increase in deaths by ward would
be considered more of a ``variation than a trend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No hospital in the country tracks death data in any other
way,'' Bohling said in his opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses noticed an unusual increase in deaths on Ward Four East
beginning in April 1992. McGary testified that a full investigation
began in late July after her staff and a police officer started
asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was then transferred out of patient care, after which
the death rate on his ward returned to normal levels. He left the
hospital staff in December 1993 and has since moved from job to
job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Havrum case, like most others, Williams was the nurse who
found the patients in question either dead or near death.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stated on hospital forms that he found Havrum in
``severe respiratory distress'' about 1:10 a.m. June 15. By the
time a doctor arrived five minutes later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies on Havrum's exhumed body found conflicting evidence of
codeine. Government experts first indicated his liver had six times
the fatal range of codeine, but later tests ordered as part of the
Havrum case determined he only had as much codeine as contained in
three pills he took that night.
</P>
<P>
   Expert witnesses for Havrum, however, maintain that codeine
level was within a fatal range and that it could have been
injected. The autopsy found an unexplained needle mark on his left
buttock and elbow, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses quizzed by Bohling Monday said the amount of codeine
needed to kill someone would not be available on the nursing floor
and that checks are made after every shift to account for what
drugs are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz indicated that Williams could have obtained codeine from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Bohling said there is no proof of a fatal codeine level, which
he called essential to Havrum's wrongful-death case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that finding can't be made,'' Bohling said, ``nothing else
follows.''
</P>
<P>
   The Havrum case puts the federal government in the position of
trying to defend the conduct of Williams after spending five years
investigating him and the deaths of his hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI exhumed 13 bodies in early 1993 and conducted hundreds
of tests and interviews. In January of this year, the FBI termed 11
of the hospital deaths ``highly suspicious'' and 22 ``moderately
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   But in January, the FBI announced it could not prove a crime.

 &HT;    U.S. team defeats Chinese in Goodwill swim meet
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The U.S. recognized few of the names on the
Chinese swimming roster for the Goodwill Games. And even the one
name officials did know, they weren't sure if it was Yan Chen the
world champion in the 400 freestyle and 400 IM or Yan Chen the
backstroker.
</P>
<P>
   It was the world champion, but she and her 16 teammates looked
small and vulnerable against a U.S. team that defeated them 88-34
Tuesday night in a dual meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese won only three of the 14 events and no world records
were set by either team at the Nassau County pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the Chinese) are the biggest question mark in
swimming,'' said U.S. swimmer Lea Maurer, a world champion
backstroker. ``They're the most unpredictable team I've ever swam
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do opponents know who will turn up, they don't know
what they'll look like.
</P>
<P>
   You want physically imposing? The U.S. women had broader backs
and bigger muscles than most of the Chinese, a team that once
inspired awe and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer said her teammates discussed the Chinese physiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the verdict's still out,'' she said. ``I think that
they look fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after huddling for a ``USA on the warpath'' cheer, a U.S.
400-meter medley relay team of Maurer, Megan Quann, Misty Hyman and
Richelle Fox defeated China by a whopping 11.84 seconds, 4:08.43 to
4:20.27. At the Atlanta Olympics, the U.S. took the gold and China
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, when some people found out the Chinese were
going to swim, some people didn't want to swim here,'' said U.S.
coach John Collins, who coaches Maurer and Cristina Teuscher (who
handed Yan Chen a defeat in the 200 free). ``They thought they're
dirty and shouldn't be here in this country. Because of the recent
history, what happened in Perth where they got caught with drugs
... everything we thought about them was true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese swimmer caught carrying human growth hormone was
banned for 15 years and four teammates _ three women and a man _
were suspended for two years for doping violations.
</P>
<P>
   Although FINA, the international swimming governing body, does
not believe the Chinese Swimming Association is promulgating ``a
systematic process of doping,'' the Chinese aroused suspicion at
the 1994 Worlds when they won 12 of 16 gold medals. A year later,
two world champions were banned for drug violations before the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, China won only one gold medal, three silvers and two
bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Chinese are thinking about the 2000 Olympics,''
Collins said. ``Coming over here is a big experience for them. I'm
not sure their expectations coming here were to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team has two more dual meets against Germany and a team of
World All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The women's swimming doubleheader began with the All-Stars
defeating Germany 64-58.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has also had troubles with performance-enhancing drugs,
and the East German doping trials are still going on. Several
Olympic medalists have been identified as steroid users.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he didn't think this was China's best team, ``but I
don't think this is our top-grade team, either.''
</P>
<P>
   This U.S. team was missing some superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals in Atlanta, underwent
shoulder surgery and is out until December. Kristine Quance, a top
IM and breaststroker, got married last spring and is pregnant.
Brooke Bennett decided to skip the meet to concentrate on
nationals, as did the University of Georgia's Kristy Kowal, a world
champion breaststroker.
