Notre Dame upsets Michigan to open season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTH BEND, Indiana (AP) _ Notre Dame took a little more than a
half before showing Michigan and its critics that 1997 and its long
offseason are history.
	   Notre Dame scored on its first five second-half possessions,
overcoming a sluggish first half to beat defending national
champion Michigan 36-20 Saturday.
	   The season-opening win was a shocking turnaround from a 1997
season that saw Michigan win its first national title in 49 years
and Notre Dame lose six games for the first time since 1986.
	   It also eased much of the pain endured by the Irish during a
long summer that saw a former assistant win an age discrimination
suit and an NCAA investigation begin into current and former
players taking gifts from a booster.
	   Jarious Jackson threw two touchdown passes in his first start
and Autry Denson carried 24 times for a career-best 162 yards and
two TDs as the 22nd-ranked Irish snapped No. 5 Michigan's 12-game
winning streak.
	   ``We can compete against anyone in the country,'' said Jackson,
who passed for 96 yards and ran for another 62 in Notre Dame's new
option attack. ``You never know who's going to be the national
champion this year.''
	   No. 1 Ohio State started its run for the title with a 34-17 win
at No. 11 West Virginia. Joe Germaine passed for 301 yards and two
touchdowns and Michael Wiley ran for 140 yards and another score
for the Buckeyes. No. 3 Florida, No. 4 Nebraska and No. 6 Kansas
State pounded overmatched opponents.
	   Notre Dame's win was the first for the Irish against Michigan
since 1993, when another unheralded quarterback, Kevin McDougal,
led Notre Dame to a 27-23 upset at Michigan.
	   The Irish finished that season 11-1 and ranked second in the
country, the last time they contended for the national title.
Michigan went 8-4, the first of four consecutive four-loss seasons
that didn't end until last season.
	   Tom Brady, in his first start for Michigan, was 23 of 36 for 267
yards. The rest of the Wolverines looked anything like champions,
missing four of six field goals and losing two fumbles.
	   ``Our defense tired, we missed four field goals and we didn't
run the ball well,'' coach Lloyd Carr said. ``We've got a long way
to go. We've got a lot of corrections to make, and not a long time
to do it.''
	   In other games Saturday, it was No. 10 Tennessee 34, No. 17
Syracuse 33; Miami of Ohio 13, No. 12 North Carolina 10; No. 13
Penn State 34, No. 21 Southern Mississippi 6; No. 19 Georgia 56,
Kent 3; and Oregon 48, No. 23 Michigan St. 14.
	   Tim Couch and Ricky Williams each opened their Heisman Trophy
campaign with big games. Couch threw for 498 yards and seven
touchdowns as Kentucky routed Louisville 68-34. Williams ran for
215 yards and six touchdowns as Texas beat New Mexico State 66-36.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 34, No. 11 W. Virginia 17 &QC; 
	   Germaine completed 18 of 32 passes without an interception and
Wiley upstaged Amos Zereoue with 140 yards on 17 carries. Zereoue,
10th in the Heisman Trophy balloting last season, gained 77 yards
on 20 attempts.
 &UR; No. 3 Florida 49, Citadel 10 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, Jesse Palmer threw for 301 yards and
four touchdowns and Terry Jackson ran for 127 yards and two scores
to lead Florida.
 &UR; No. 4 Nebraska 38, Alabama-Birmingham 7 &QC; 
	   At Lincoln, Nebraska, Eric Crouch, making his first college
start, ran for two touchdowns and passed for another to lead
Nebraska. Playing for the injured Bobby Newcombe, Crouch completed
11 of 17 for 127 yards and the TD. He also ran seven times for 69
yards for Nebraska (2-0).
 &UR; No. 6 Kansas St. 66, Indiana St. 0 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop ran for two touchdowns and
threw for a third and the kicking teams scored twice as Kansas
State came within one point of the school record.
	   The Wildcats did not let Division I-AA Indiana State have a
first down other than by penalty until 2:22 remained. The final
score was one point shy of the record 67-0 shutout of Akron in
1995.
 &UR; No. 10 Tennessee 34, No. 17 Syracuse 33 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, New York, Jeff Hall kicked a 27-yard field goal as
time expired to give Tennessee a stunning victory in the first game
of the post-Peyton Manning era.
	   Tee Martin, Manning's understudy the past two years, threw for
two touchdowns, ran for one and led the game-winning drive with the
help of a fourth-down pass-interference penalty.
	   Donovan McNabb was 21-for-27 for 298 yards and two TDs for
Syracuse.
 &UR; Miami of Ohio 13, No. 12 North Carolina 10 &QC; 
	   At Chapel Hill, North Carolina, John Scott kicked a 37-yard
field goal with one second left and Travis Prentice ran for 162
yards as Miami of Ohio ruined Carl Torbush's regular-season
coaching debut.
	   The Tar Heels went all but four plays with freshman quarterback
Ronald Curry after losing starter Oscar Davenport to a knee
injury.
 &UR; No. 13 Penn St. 34, No. 21 Southern Miss. 6 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, Cordell Mitchell ran for a
career-high 99 yards in his first start and Penn State's defense
held Southern Mississippi to 9 yards rushing.
	   With Penn State's backfield depleted by injuries and Curtis
Enis' defection to the NFL, Mitchell led a corps of back-ups who
ran for 255 yards. Quarterback Kevin Thompson went 10-for-15 for
140 yards and one touchdown.
 &UR; No. 19 Georgia 56, Kent 3 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Quincy Carter, the first freshman
quarterback to start a season-opener for Georgia, threw for 235
yards and three touchdowns. Olandis Gary and Robert Arnaud each
added two rushing TDs for the Bulldogs, who piled up 566 yards.
 &UR; Oregon 48, No. 23 Michigan St. 14 &QC; 
	   At Eugene, Oregon, Akili Smith threw four touchdown passes and
Reuben Droughns rushed for 202 yards and scored three TDs as Oregon
won its opener. Smith completed 15 of 25 passes for 266 yards
against Michigan State (0-2).

Quick matches for Sampras, other favorites at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras quotes in grafs 7-8; SHOULD STAND &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras and the rest of the world's top
tennis players are doing little work on this Labor Day weekend.
	   The top-seeded Sampras needed just 78 minutes to defeat Mikael
Tillstrom 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 Saturday night to advance to the fourth
round of the U.S. Open, and several of his peers spent even less
time on court.
	   Defending champion Patrick Rafter won in 66 minutes, dropping
only three games in a third-round victory. Andre Agassi advanced
while losing just five games. Venus Williams needed to play only
half a match.
	   ``You never feel badly about winning. You want to get on and off
as quick as you possibly can,'' Rafter said after his 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory over David Nainkin. ``This is a Grand Slam. You want to
conserve your energy.''
	   Only two seeded women and four seeded men have been eliminated.
	   Sampras, serving 14 aces at up to 125 mph (200 kph), was
expressionless for most of the match as he pounded winners past the
Swede. But the four-time U.S. Open champion raised his arms to the
crowd to solicit applause on one point after slamming a forehand
down the line.
	   Even though he won 91 percent of his first-serve points, Sampras
was not entirely pleased with his performance _ which included
seven double faults.
	   ``It was a little up and down from both of us. I really had no
rhythm on my serves, got a little careless at times,'' Sampras
said. ``But I played the way I wanted to play. I came in, I chipped
and charged. It was a pretty good day.''
	   Sampras' next opponent will be unseeded Marat Safin, the Russian
teen-ager who became a crowd favorite in Paris with his improbable
run through this year's French Open. He defeated Thomas Muster in
the third round.
	   The third-seeded Rafter, who lost just six points on his first
serve and never faced a break point, will face No. 14 Goran
Ivanisevic in the fourth round.
	   Ivanisevic had 21 aces in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 win over Paul
Haarhuis, a player who had tormented him in the past. The
temperamental Ivanisevic said he has been playing better since
banging his head on the court during a second-round win over Todd
Martin earlier this week.
	   ``Sometimes I am a little bit messed up,'' he explained. ``I
have to bang, then everything comes together.''
	   Agassi won 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 in 96 minutes over Davide Sanguinetti,
who twisted his right ankle late in the first set and played the
rest of the match with the ankle heavily taped. Agassi's next
opponent will be No. 9 Karol Kucera.
	   The only men's seed to lose Saturday was No. 6 Greg Rusedski,
who was upset 4-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 by Jan Siemerink in a match
that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes. Rusedski was a U.S. Open finalist
last year.
	   Williams' match lasted just 13 minutes. She was leading 5-0 in
the first set when Larisa Neiland retired because of a painful
lower back injury that prevented her from sitting on the final
changeover.
	   Neiland was unable to move more than a few feet from the middle
of the court, watching helplessly when Williams hit shots into the
corners. Neiland's face was contorted with pain as she held onto
the umpire's chair for support after five games and told Williams
she could not continue.
	   ``I really would have enjoyed to have a match where she could
have played to her full ability,'' Williams said. ``I can get the
preparation on the practice court.''
	   Agassi, who played third on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court after
Rafter and Williams, was shocked to start playing so early in the
afternoon.
	   ``Both matches combined were like an hour and 15 minutes,
phenomenal,'' Agassi said. ``I felt rather rushed, I didn't enjoy
that at all.''
	   Women's winners included No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, No. 7 Conchita Martinez, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat,
No. 12 Mary Pierce, No. 13 Amanda Coetzer and No. 15 Anna
Kournikova.
	   Fourteen of the 16 women's seeds reached the fourth round, the
first time that has happened since 1987. And the ease with which
favorites are advancing is in stark contrast to this year's French
Open and Wimbledon, in which there were many surprises.
	   ``It's been weird because the other Grand Slams, there's been a
lot of upsets, a lot of seeds that haven't made it,'' Davenport
said. ``I don't know what the reason is, but it just seems like the
players who are expected to win so far are winning.''

Los Angeles 5, Miami 3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Carlos Hermosillo scored the
game-winning goal in the 80th minute and Welton added two
second-half goals Saturday night to give the Los Angeles Galaxy a
5-3 victory over the Miami Fusion.
	   Los Angeles clinched the Western Conference title with the
victory, improving to 22-7 with a league-best 64 points.
	   The Galaxy will have home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs, including the MLS Cup, should they reach the final in
Pasadena.
	   Miami (13-15) rallied twice from one-goal deficits, but had its
six-game home winning streak snapped in front of 14,731 at Lockhart
Stadium.
	   The Fusion missed a chance to extend their lead on Tampa Bay and
New England for the fourth playoff spot in the East.
	   Welton, who came on in the 65th minute, scored his first goal
with 14 minutes remaining to tie the score at three. His second
goal came with two minutes to play and squelched any hope for
another Miami rally.
	   The two goals boosted Welton's season total to 17.
	   Cobi Jones had a goal and an assist to increase his
league-leading point total to 49.
 &UR; Kansas City 5, San jose 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Preki Radosavljevic had three goals
and two assists Saturday night as the Kansas City Wizards beat the
San Jose Clash 5-1 in Major League Soccer and stopped a three-game
losing streak.
	   Ronald Cerritos put San Jose ahead in the seventh minute, but
Radosavljevic fed Mo Johnston for Kansas City's first goal in the
12th and scored the go-ahead goal in the 18th on an assist from
Paul Wright.
	   Radosavljevic scored twice in the 48th and 80th minutes on
assists from Mark Chung and Ryan Tinsley. He fed Wright for the
other goal in the 59th.
	   Kansas City (12-17) moved one point ahead of Dallas in the race
for the fourth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
The Clash (10-18) have lost three straight overall and eight
straight on the road.

Japanese and snafus dominate Sydney marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japanese runners dominated the men's
and women's divisions of Sunday's Sydney marathon, but there was
major embarrassment for the host city of the 2000 Olympics.
	   Kenichi Takahashi won the men's title in two hours, 15 minutes
and 51 seconds, followed by compatriots Kutsuhiko Hanada and Honda
Takehura, as Japanese runners filled the first 19 places and all
but two of the first 30.
	   Yukari Komatsu, 24, was the first woman across the finish in
2:29:09 followed by Hisako Inami and Shiki Terasaki. Japan claimed
the top six places in the women's field.
	   The race started an hour late because the Sydney Roads and
Traffic Authority had failed to close two essential roads to
traffic.
	   While the event was not run by the Sydney Olympic organizers
(SOCOG), a leading athletics official said the problems could only
reflect poorly on Sydney's Olympic buildup.
	   The 900 entrants were warmed up and ready for the 0700 start at
North Sydney when police informed organizers of the inadequate road
closures. The race started at 0803 local time.
	   Athletics New South Wales president Ralph Doubell described it
as a major international embarrassment for Sydney.
	   ``Especially when you have about 400 overseas runners, including
the Japanese Olympic Games squad competing,'' said Doubell, who won
the 1968 Olympic 800-meter gold medal.
	   ``When they return home they will be reporting that the marathon
started one hour late. ``The Roads and Traffic Authority charged us
Aust dlrs 50,000 (U.S. dlrs 29,000) to construct road barriers, and
they didn't. I think there will now be negotiation on the price.''
	   Organizers encountered another problem 24 hours earlier when
they had to arrange the provision of about 10,000 bottles of water
because Sydney's tap water was found to contain dangerous bacteria.

Moammar Gadhafi announced his rejection of an American and British
offer to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am bombing case in the
Netherlands.
	   In a speech late Saturday, Gadhafi accused the United States and
Britain of trying to use the Netherlands as ``a transit point'' in
the case.
	   The offer calls for the trial of the two Libyans _ Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ in the Netherlands. If
found guilty, they would be transferred to Britain to serve their
time.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
	   Gadhafi told a gathering here that this was not the trial in a
third country that Libya had demanded but a deal ``to make the
third country a transit point to transfer the accused to Britain.''
	   He added: ``We (are prepared) to go tomorrow to the Netherlands,
provided that the Netherlands is the last stop in case of acquittal
or conviction. ... Guarantees to that effect are necessary.''
	   He said Libya did not recognize the agreement between Britain
and the Netherlands on the trial nor the U.N. Security Council
resolution endorsing it.
	   ``We reject the agreement signed by Britain and the Netherlands
because it concern's Libya's sons, and Libya has not signed it and
is not a party to it,'' Gadhafi said. He termed the U.N. Security
council resolution ``null and void'' and added that ``Libya does
not accept it.''
	   His remarks were monitored by the BBC in London.
	   The resolution calls for lifting trade sanctions once the
suspects are transferred to the Netherlands.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand
over the suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar
weapons sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit the sale of oil
equipment.
	   Gadhafi praised five visiting African leaders for flying to
Tripoli in violation of the sanctions. The Organization of African
Unity earlier this year said it would no longer abide by the
sanctions when travel was required for humanitarian activities or
official business.
	   ``They stepped on the American sanctions ... with their dark
feet,'' Gadhafi said of the African leaders.
	   Gadhafi, dressed in tan fatigues and seated behind a podium,
spoke to thousands assembled in Tripoli's downtown Martyr's Square.
	   He was flanked by African presidents including Sudan's Omar
el-Bashir, Chad's Idriss Deby, Niger's Ibrahim Bare Mainassara,
Mali's Alpha Oumar Konare and the Central African Republic's
Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   The ceremony marked the 29th anniversary of the coup that
brought Gadhafi to power in 1969. Saturday also marked the 20th
anniversary of the Libyan Armed Laborers Day.
	   Libya has been calling for trial in a third, ``neutral'' country
for the Lockerbie suspects on grounds they could not receive a fair
trial in the United States and Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London _ which had long insisted that
any trial be on their territories _ relented and said it would
accept a trial in the Netherlands with Scottish judges and under
Scottish law.
	   Gadhafi earlier had said he wanted further negotiations to
provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe custody and fair
trial. Washington and London say the offer is non-negotiable.

King pessimistic about Cambodia's future, protests continue

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ As demonstrations decrying the
results of the recent national election continued in the capital
Sunday, King Norodom Sihanouk expressed pessimism that talks he is
mediating will lead the country out of its political crisis.
	   The 75-year-old monarch is presiding over three days of meetings
in the northwestern province of Siem Reap which he had hoped would
help bring an end to the political deadlock that has followed the
July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   The talks bring together representatives from the three rival
political parties, the national election committee and the
country's highest appeals body.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
the polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on
his own.
	   The leading opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party have accused Hun Sen of cheating at the polls. They
have threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if their
allegations of fraud _ dismissed as baseless by election
authorities loyal to Hun Sen _ are not properly investigated.
	   So far disagreements between the opposing sides at the talks are
``total and irreversible,'' the king said in a letter to U.S.
Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, released by the palace as the second
day of talks opened Sunday.
	   ``I am very pessimistic and I am not anticipating that the
responsible Cambodian parties will, through an honorable
compromise, lead our unfortunate country and our unhappy people out
of this more and more tragic crisis,'' he wrote.
	   Tensions have been mounting in Phnom Penh since the July 26
parliamentary elections, and demonstrators in the capital have been
holding an around-the-clock vigil against Hun Sen for two weeks.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy led 10,000 people through the
streets of Phnom Penh Sunday.
	   Traffic was clogged for several hours when they marched and rode
motorcycles to the National Assembly _ the site of the
anti-government vigil _ after holding a two-hour rally at the main
sports stadium.
	   ``As long as the march is peaceful I think it is productive,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``While they are talking in Siem Reap everyone in
the whole world can see that people in Cambodia want democracy.''
	   The protests have been largely violence-free, but angry mobs
were reported Friday to have killed as many as five ethnic
Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them of being
responsible for a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   FUNCINPEC head Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who condemned the
killings, have in their public speeches played on the
anti-Vietnamese prejudices held by many Cambodians.
	   Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge
regime in 1979, a harsh, decade-long occupation followed,
exacerbating traditional suspicion and hatred of Vietnam.
	   Many Cambodians see Hun Sen, who ruled the country during
Vietnam's occupation, as too pro-Hanoi, a perception encouraged by
his opponents.
	   Sam Rainsy said Sunday that he has appealed to protesters to
refrain from violence, which has hurt his democratic image.
	   Sihanouk, whose powers are limited by the constitution, is a
symbol of moral authority for many Cambodians and seen as the only
one who can help find a way to end the political stalemate.
	   But representatives from the National Election Committee and the
Constitutional Council said in the first day of talks with the king
Saturday that their decision rejecting all election complaints was
``unappealable.''
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party representatives also showed
no willingness to back down from their demands, which include
recounts of ballots or new votes in some areas and the elimination
of a controversial formula used to allocate seats in the National
Assembly.
	   They have also called for Hun Sen's ouster.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh, the
king's son, as co-premier in a bloody coup. Hun Sen hoped the new
polls would help him win back legitimacy in the eyes of the
international community and foreign aid.

Dissidents appeal for help as UN rights chief lands in China
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Greeted by appeals from dissidents to free a
jailed colleague and end detentions without trial, U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson arrived in China Sunday on a
ground-breaking mission.
	   In an indication of the hopes China's persecuted dissidents
place on the first ever visit by a U.N. high commissioner for human
rights, activists sent open letters seeking Robinson's help in
curbing police powers and demanding their rights to form political
parties.
	   Government critic Chu Hailan wrote Robinson requesting a meeting
and her help in getting her husband, labor rights campaigner Liu
Nianchun, released from a labor camp. But Robinson's spokesman Jose
Diaz said she received no such requests from Chu or other
dissidents.
	   Robinson ``wants the Chinese people to know she's here, she's
aware of their expectations and concerns and she will be discussing
these things with the Chinese authorities,'' Diaz said.
	   Whether Robinson can urge human rights improvements without
alienating leaders from the ruling Communist Party will be a major
test of her 10-day trip. She and Chinese leaders plan to sign an
agreement on future cooperation, hoping to dispel the confrontation
that has marked relations between Beijing and her office.
	   Robinson was expected to meet President Jiang Zemin and legal
officials as well as travel to Tibet, which has endured often harsh
treatment under Chinese rule. She was also scheduled to take part
in a workshop on key U.N. human rights treaties.
	   Speaking to reporters shortly after her arrival, Robinson said
she specifically wants to know the government's intentions on two
treaties.
	   China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights last year, but the communist-controlled national
legislature has yet to ratify it. The government also pledged six
months ago to accede to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights but has not done so. A Foreign Ministry spokesman
said last week the document would be signed soon.
	   The two covenants are seen as baseline guarantees of such
fundamental rights as free speech and assembly, including the right
to form trade unions. Although China's constitution gives citizens
those rights, they are seldom observed in practice.
	   In one open letter, 116 dissidents from 20 provinces called for
an end to one of the most abusive forms of police control: the
ability to send suspects to prison camps for up to four years
without trial. Known as ``labor re-education,'' the punishment has
often been used on government critics.
	   ``Labor re-education is a barbaric system that institutionalizes
on a grand scale the vicious invasion of human rights,'' said the
letter, a copy of which was released by the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.
	   Chu Hailan's husband, Liu Nianchun, is one of the most prominent
political prisoners now in a labor camp. Arrested three years ago
in a sweep of dissidents, Liu has been denied medical parole for
ailments Chu has said range from high blood pressure to mouth
ulcers that make it difficult for him to eat and drink.
	   In a letter to Robinson given to foreign news agencies, Chu
asked the human rights commissioner to visit Liu in prison and see
for herself the violations of their rights.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to reach a
compromise on forming a new government to handle Russia's
burgeoning economic crisis, his press service confirmed.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communist-dominated parliament has already
rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said Sunday that he would hold talks
Monday with eight members of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, eight members of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. Chernomyrdin held the job for five years before
being fired in March and rehired Aug. 23 as Russia's economy went
into a tailspin.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   The Communists and their hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin for creating Russia's current predicament. On Saturday
they said they had as many as nine alternatives for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats.
	   The State Duma is scheduled to consider the matter again Monday,
after meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that add to the current turmoil.

	   BUDERIM, Australia (AP) _ Australian opener Mark Waugh belted an
unbeaten 98 as the Commonwealth Games-bound side warmed up with a
nine-wicket win over New Zealand on Sunday.
	   Waugh led the Australians, with brother Steve sitting out, and
hit five sixes and five fours in a 63-ball innings.
	   Both teams will play in the 16-team Commonwealth Games
competition which starts Wednesday, two days ahead of the opening
ceremony in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   Australia bowled out the mid-strength New Zealand for 151 in 44
overs and made 156 for one off just 23.3 overs, with Waugh hitting
a six for the winning runs.
	   ``I was hitting the ball pretty well out there and hopefully I
can keep it going at the Commonwealth Games,'' said Waugh. ``The
whole team played good cricket today and we want to be able to do
that in Kuala Lumpur.''
	   Waugh's opening partner Adam Gilchrist dominated Australia's
first wicket stand of 86 with 51 off 50 balls.
	   New Zealand's openers Nathan Astle (33) and Matthew Horne (59)
made a bright start and reached 90 for no loss in the 18th over
before the team collapsed, losing its last 10 wickets for 61.
	   Offspinner Gavin Robertson was Australia's best bowler with
3-19.

	   The epic, which Kurosawa called his ``life's work,'' was named
best picture of the year by America's National Society of Film
Critics. With a price tag topping 10 million U.S. dollars, Ran was
the most expensive movie in Japanese film history.
	   ``Take `myself,' subtract `movies,' and the remainder is
`zero,''' the director once wrote. His themes often assert the
value of the warrior spirit, humanist ideals, and the urgency of
self-sacrifice even if futile.
	   Critics have found his innovative style -- celebrated for its
elaborate detail and sweeping camera movements -- influencing
foreign films from George Lucas' Star Wars to Brian DePalma's
Scarface.

Carey stars for North
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ North Melbourne captain Wayne Carey
showed why he is considered the best player in the Australian
Football League with another brilliant hand in the Kangaroos'
play-off victory on the weekend.
	   Carey kicked five goals against a tenacious Essendon in North's
11.16 (82) to 8.12 (60) victory which put it one win away from the
championship game.
	   North coach Denis Pagan was thrilled with his side's
performance, particularly after the poor start in which the Roos
failed to go inside their forward 50-meter area for the first 15
minutes and Essendon took a nine-point lead at quarter-time.
	   ``I can't remember us having a statistic like that ever,'' Pagan
said. ``At quarter-time we should have been further behind than we
were but I thought after that our blokes were terrific even though
we didn't play anywhere near our capabilities.''
	   Sydney overcame St. Kilda in a thrilling match at the Sydney
Cricket Ground.
	   Greg Stafford kicked the winning goal seven minutes from
full-time in a 12.17 (89) to 13.9 (87) victory and Saints' Nicky
Winmar had a chance to give his team the win but stabbed a late
shot wide of the goal.
	   It was St. Kilda's first loss at Sydney's home ground since
1989, having won its last seven matches there including a 101-point
thumping three months ago.
	   St. Kilda stayed in contention when Western Bulldogs thrashed
West Coast Eagles 18.13 (121) to 7.9 (51).
	   West Coast was eliminated while the Bulldogs and North Melbourne
earned a week off.
	   Melbourne continued its great season with a crushing 17.13 (115)
to 9.13 (67) win over defending champion Adelaide, setting up the
win with a six-goal first quarter.
	   Melbourne, which finished four wins adrift at the bottom of the
table last season, was well served by Jeff Farmer, who kicked six
goals, and outstanding ruckman Jeff White.
	   ``It was our worst four quarter performance of the season,''
said Adelaide coach Malcolm Blight. ``It's the first time all
season our midfield has been completely overwhelmed.''
	   Melbourne plays St Kilda and Sydney plays Adelaide in next
week's play-offs.

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dies at 88
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's most famous film director, Akira Kurosawa,
died at his home Sunday at the age of 88, Kyodo news agency
reported.
	   Kurosawa's films included epics such as ``The Seven Samurai''
and ``Rashomon.'' His work inspired a generation of directors both
in Japan and in the United States.
	   The cause of death was not immediately known.
	   Kurosawa, known as ``The Emperor'' for his perfectionism and
extravagance, was one of the few Japanese directors to find fame on
international screens.
	   The Cannes Film Festival honored Kurosawa with a special trophy
for achievement upon the debut of his 28th film, ``Ran,'' or
``Chaos,'' in 1985.
	   The epic, which Kurosawa called his ``life's work,'' was named
best picture of the year by America's National Society of Film
Critics. With a price tag topping dlrs 10 million, Ran was the most
expensive movie in Japanese film history.
	   ``Take `myself,' subtract `movies,' and the remainder is
`zero,''' the director once wrote. His themes often asserted the
value of the warrior spirit, humanist ideals, and the urgency of
self-sacrifice even if futile.
	   Critics have found his innovative style _ celebrated for its
elaborate detail and sweeping camera movements _ influencing
foreign films from George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' to Brian DePalma's
``Scarface.''
	   Kurosawa's movies include ``Rashomon'' (1950), ``The Seven
Samurai'' (1954), ``Throne of Blood'' (1957), ``Yojimbo'' (1961),
and ``Kagemusha,'' or ``Shadow Warrior'' (1980).
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910 to a family that had held samurai rank,
Kurosawa was the youngest of eight children of a military school
administrator.
	   He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art school and
tiring of poverty as a painter. In 1936 he stumbled on a film
studio's advertisement asking people to audition for an assistant
directorship, tried out, and got it.
	   At age 33 he directed his first film, ``Sanshiro Sugata'' (The
Judo Saga). It was a hit in wartime Japan, but Kurosawa's vision
conflicted with some nationalist sentiments, and drew heated
attacks from the military.
	   His work did not win much applause abroad until ``Rashomon'' got
the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1951.

Thorpe tips record chance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ World swimming champion Ian Thorpe
believes the oldest men's record may fall at the Commonwealth Games
in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Thorpe, speaking to Australian reporters at the team's base in
Singapore, tipped Italian Georgio Lamberti's 1989 200-meter
freestyle mark to come under threat.
	   Thorpe, the world No.1 ranked swimmer in the event, will face
world champion Michael Klim, Olympic champion Danyon Loader and
Olympic bronze medalist Daniel Kowalski in the event.
	   ``Looking at how Michael and Daniel are training and I'm
training well also ... I think it will be very close to a world
record swim,'' said Thorpe. ``I'm more than happy with how my
preparation's going. I'm training just as well if not better than I
was before the world titles and Commonwealth Games trials. I'm
happy with that.''
	   Thorpe swam within 0.55 seconds of Lamberti record one minute,
46.69 seconds at the Commonwealth Games trials in Melbourne in
April.
	   He failed to win a place in the individual 200-meter freestyle
at the Perth world titles just eight months ago, but is now ranked
No.1 in the world based on his Commonwealth record 1:47.24 at the
trials.

North Korea's claim of satellite launch still not verified
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three days after North Korea announced
that it had successfully launched a ``scientific satellite'' into
Earth orbit, South Korea said Sunday it still could not verify or
deny the North's claim.
	   ``It has not been determined yet what North Korea did exactly _
a missile firing or a satellite launch,'' chief presidential
spokesman Park Jie-won told reporters.
	   ``We're closely cooperating and exchanging information with the
United States and Japan to determine the truth of the North Korean
claim,'' he said.
	   Rejecting Western denunciations accusing it of test-firing a
medium-range ballistic missile across Japan on Monday, North Korea
said Friday that it had successfully launched a ``scientific
satellite'' into orbit.
	   The United States, Japan and South Korea said the North had
fired a Taepo Dong 1, a new missile with an estimated range of
2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), over Japan.
	   But North Korea said that assessment was wrong.
	   ``Some people ... suspected it to be a ballistic missile
launching test, expressed some apprehensions and described it as a
serious event,'' the North's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   North Korea said the satellite, put in orbit by a locally
developed, three-stage rocket, was circling the Earth transmitting
revolutionary hymns praising the late President Kim Il Sung and his
heir and son, Kim Jong Il.
	   But South Korean officials said Sunday they could not detect any
signals or hymns from such a satellite.
	   ``All 11 monitoring stations throughout the country could not
detect any signals,'' one Telecommunications Ministry official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   No country has been able to officially deny or verify the North
Korean claim, although Russia's ITAR-TASS news agency reported that
Moscow's space observation center had spotted the satellite.
	   South Korea reserved judgment, saying that regional stability
was being threatened either way.
	   ``The problem is that whether it's a missile or a satellite is
worrying the world and negatively affecting peace in East Asia,
particularly the Korean Peninsula,'' the presidential spokesman
said.
	   The spokesman said that despite security concerns on the
peninsula, South Korea has no plans to alter its engagement policy
with its northern communist neighbor.
	   ``There is no reason to change our North Korea policy. If we
react too sensitively, we may play into their tactics,'' he said.
	   South Korea, he said, hopes that Kim Jong Il, who officially
took over as North Korea's full-fledged leader Saturday, will act
for the sake of regional and world peace.
	   ``We strongly hope that North Korea would do things conducive to
world peace and make efforts to reduce unnecessary defense spending
to help its hungry people,'' he said.
	   North Korea's newly elected parliament adopted a new
constitution Saturday elevating Kim to the ``highest post of
state,'' giving him greatly expanded powers as head of the North's
1.1 million-strong military.
	   Kim had been expected to be named president of the Marxist
state, but instead was given enhanced power as head of the National
Military Commission, the country's highest military leadership
organization.
	   Apparently out of respect for his late father, the junior Kim
decided to leave the presidency vacant permanently.
	   ``The preface of the constitution says the DPRK (North Korea)
and the Korean people will uphold the great leader Kim Il Sung as
the eternal president,'' the North's Korean Central News Agency
said Saturday.

Indonesian opposition figure prepares for elections next year

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify elected legislators will choose a
president, Megawati considered a strong candidate. ADDS byline,

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Defying a rival party faction, one of
Indonesia's most prominent opposition leaders said Sunday she would
run in general elections next year.
	   Hundreds of cheering supporters turned out to watch Megawati
Sukarnoputri, a longtime critic of former President Suharto, open
an office of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party. She is
considered a strong candidate for the presidency.
	   ``The next general election is a very important and strategic
election,'' said Megawati, the eldest daughter of Sukarno,
Indonesia's founding president. Dressed in red and black, the party
colors, crowds clapped and chanted her name.
	   Megawati was ousted as head of the party, known by its
Indonesian acronym PDI, in a 1996 party congress sponsored by the
government of the autocratic Suharto.
	   However, she has refused to recognize the government-backed PDI
faction and her supporters disrupted a congress it held last month,
fighting police in the northern city of Palu.
	   Suharto quit in May, dislodged by riots, student protests and
the desertion of his political allies. The government of President
B.J. Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, but has stayed out
of the PDI dispute, arguing it is an internal matter.
	   Megawati, who was ousted as PDI leader because she called for
greater democracy, accused the new government of engineering the
recent congress of the rival faction.
	   She said the government had ``contributed to the bad image of
Indonesia in the eyes of the international community.''
	   Megawati did not say she would run for the presidency, but left
open the possibility. Legislators elected next year will then meet
in a special assembly to choose a president.
	   ``If the people want Megawati to be president, she will be ready
for that,'' said Kwik Kian Gie, an economist and aide to Megawati.
	   Megawati's ouster from the PDI leadership in 1996 triggered
deadly riots in Jakarta, following the storming of the party's
headquarters by security forces and supporters of the rival
faction.
	   Some foreign diplomats and economic and political experts
attended the ceremony led by Megawati, who said she hoped her new
office would not be raided.
	   ``But I don't think it will be raided again,'' she said. ``It's
not an era of party raiding anymore.''
	   Dozens of political parties have sprouted during Indonesia's
experiment with democracy over the last few months. Many that lack
enough support will likely founder or form coalitions ahead of the
general elections, scheduled for May.
	   Megawati told her supporters to be prepared to collect 1 million
signatures to qualify for the election.

Once again, EU neigbors stump West Europeans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Once again, its eastern neighbors are
stumping the European Union with political crises in Russia and
Kosovo.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, concerned that after
Bosnia, the United States is again grabbing the wheel in Balkan
peacemaking, proposed the EU appoint a special envoy to Kosovo
where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel told
reporters Saturday, the opening day of a two-day EU foreign
ministers meeting. He said the EU must make ``a special
contribution'' to peace in Kosovo.
	   The EU ministers were to discuss Kosovo in detail on Sunday.
	   On Saturday, the financial and political crisis in Russia loomed
large over the meeting but the ministers approached it very
cautiously. They made the point there was no purpose in handing out
large amounts of financial aid to stabilize an out of control
economy and currency and with no government in place in Moscow.
	   The EU ministers said they will send a delegation of British,
Austrian and German officials to Moscow next week to pledge
political support and issue a strong plea for Russia to stay true
to economic reform and leave not return to communism.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action's
sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not clear,''
Kinkel said.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here that a
rescheduling or moratorium on Russia's external debt was
``inevitable.'' Speaking to reporters, he added, ``It is hardly
possible for Russia to meet its (debt) obligations in the short
term.''
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy.
	   However, EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in
development aid programs to Russia since 1991 with mixed results.
The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.
	   EU grappling with the foreign policy issues such as Russia and
Kosovo underline its inability to take a common stand quickly and
effectively. This was most noticeable during the Bosnian war when
EU waffling led the United States to take the lead and impose a
peace settlement.
	   Taking a cue from that experience, EU government have begun
considering ways to amend their slow-as-molasses decision-making
rules. That in itself will last months since previous attempts have
failed each time.

Japanese and snafus dominate Sydney marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with amended results; ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japanese runners dominated the men's
and women's divisions of Sunday's Sydney marathon, but there was
major embarrassment for the host city of the 2000 Olympics.
	   Kenichi Takahashi won the men's title in two hours, 15 minutes
and 51 seconds, followed by compatriots Kutsuhiko Hanada and Honda
Takehura, as Japanese runners filled the first 10 placings.
	   Yukari Komatsu, 24, was the first woman across the finish in
2:29:09 followed by Shiki Terasaki and Eri Matsubara. Japan claimed
the top five places in the women's field.
	   Masako Chiba, who won a bronze medal over 10,000-meters at last
year's world championships, was fourth in her debut at the full
marathon distance, clocking 2:37:44.
	   The race started an hour late because the Sydney Roads and
Traffic Authority had failed to close two essential roads to
traffic.
	   While the event was not run by the Sydney Olympic organizers
(SOCOG), a leading athletics official said the problems could only
reflect poorly on Sydney's Olympic buildup.
	   The 900 entrants were warmed up and ready for the 0700 start at
North Sydney when police informed organizers of the inadequate road
closures. The race started at 0803 local time.
	   Athletics New South Wales president Ralph Doubell described it
as a major international embarrassment for Sydney.
	   ``Especially when you have about 400 overseas runners, including
the Japanese Olympic Games squad competing,'' said Doubell, who won
the 1968 Olympic 800-meter gold medal.

Turkish Premier on Mideast tour, departs for Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Sunday flew
to Jordan _ the first leg of a two-day tour that will also take him
to Israel and the West Bank _ for talks on the stalled Middle East
peace talks.
	   ``The peace process, on which we pinned such hopes, have been
deadlocked for a long time and are being driven towards a dangerous
adventure,'' Yilmaz told reporters before his departure.
	   Yilmaz, who is accompanied by a large delegation of businessmen,
is scheduled to meet Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.
	   Yilmaz said talks would also focus on improving economic ties
with the region.
	   Middle East peace talks stalled when Arafat called them off
until Israel accepts an American peace proposal for Israel to
gradually withdraw troops from parts of the West Bank.
	   While supporting the Palestinian cause, Turkey has forged close
ties with Israel since 1996, exchanging warplanes for training,
conducting naval maneuvers and sealing several defense and trade
ties.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 new grafs at end to UPDATE with regional governor
criticizing Chernomyrdin. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to reach a
compromise on forming a new government to handle Russia's
burgeoning economic crisis, his press service confirmed.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communist-dominated parliament has already
rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said Sunday that he would hold talks
Monday with eight members of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, eight members of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. Chernomyrdin held the job for five years before
being fired in March and rehired Aug. 23 as Russia's economy went
into a tailspin.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   The Communists and their hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin for creating Russia's current predicament. On Saturday
they said they had as many as nine alternatives for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats.
	   The State Duma is scheduled to consider the matter again Monday,
after meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Federation Council passed a non-binding motion on Friday
endorsing Chernomyrdin, putting pressure on the Duma to confirm his
appointment.
	   But the governor of the Samara region, chairman of the Council's
budget committee, said Sunday that Chernomyrdin ``cannot lead the
country out of the crisis, whoever joins his Cabinet.''
	   Konstantin Titov told the Interfax news agency that Luzhkov, the
Moscow mayor and one of the opposition's proposed candidates for
prime minister, was someone who ``can consolidate the nation.''

Ousted leader grapples with reform strategy

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister intends to launch an unprecedented public campaign against
the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But first he
must assess his support.
	   Four days after he was stripped of his official positions of
deputy and finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, remained hunkered
down at home Sunday.
	   With the exception of a brief statement after Friday prayers at
a neighborhood mosque, Anwar has not gone out, preferring to meet
supporters in small groups in his living room and occasionally talk
to reporters.
	   Anwar has said he intends to make a nationwide tour to launch
his political reform campaign. But for now he's staying put.
	   ``Security is at least guaranteed here,'' he said.
	   A clutch of supporters and about two dozen reporters have kept a
vigil at Anwar's two-story house in the posh Damansara Heights
neighborhood since Thursday.
	   Anwar says he is awaiting arrest. But Malaysian police said
Saturday they want to complete their investigations into
allegations of sexual misconduct, abuse of power and leaking state
secrets before an arrest is considered.
	   Observers say Anwar cannot focus on his political agenda until
his immediate future is known _ whether he will remain free or
imprisoned under the Internal Security Act.
	   The dreaded act allows suspects to be detained without trial if
they are deemed a threat to national security.
	   Although Anwar has spoken of an Indonesian-style campaign for
political reform and free press, it will have to wait until he can
defend himself against mounting charges.
	   New allegations were flung at him Saturday, when the country's
top police official accused Anwar of trying to interfere with the
investigation, abuse his position and tamper with evidence.
	   Few observers have been able to judge the support Anwar may
enjoy. Barring two public displays by hundreds of supporters
shouting ``Long live Anwar'' and ``We want justice,'' there have
been no massive protests against his ouster.
	   ``There is no need to seek a recourse that may risk arrest under
Internal Security Act unless, of course, the strategy is to force
the authorities to use the act so that one can achieve political
martyrdom,'' said an editorial in Sunday's New Straits Times.
	   The government-backed newspaper said most of Anwar's supporters
appeared to be from a Malay Islamic group that he founded during
his radical student days.
	   Since he was expelled by Mahathir from the ruling United Malays
National Organization on Thursday, Anwar has received little
sympathy from his former colleagues. Only a handful have visited
him and there have been more people from the opposition parties and
human rights groups at his home.
	   Whether Anwar can carve out support from outside the powerful
UMNO, which has governed Malaysia since independence from Britain
in 1957, is the big question.
	   The rift between Anwar and Mahathir dates back more than one
year, but did not surface until the July party convention. Anwar's
allies launched a broadside on corruption in high places and
nepotism among top UMNO leaders, which many saw as the first open
challenge to Mahathir's leadership.

Rocket strikes house during peacekeeping drill, kills man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A rocket fired during peacekeeping
exercises in the South Ossetia region of Georgia struck a home,
killed a man inside and wounded his wife and mother, officials said
Sunday.
	   The incident took place on Saturday in the village of Didmuka,
said Alan Gaglayev, duty officer at the Zkhinvali regional
administration.
	   South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in 1990, when it was still
part of the Soviet Union. The region's mostly ethnic Ossetian
populace has been calling for unity with ethnic brethren in
Russia's North Ossetia.
	   Russian peacekeepers were deployed in the region in 1992, but a
political settlement has not yet been reached.

Estrada says Philippine health chief resigned due to threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' health chief
resigned because of threats from a syndicate that has illegally
cornered government purchases of medicine, President Joseph Estrada
said Sunday.
	   Estrada said he has ordered an investigation of the syndicate's
activities at the Department of Health.
	   Last week, Estrada accepted the resignation of Health Secretary
Felipe Estrella, the first Cabinet member in the new administration
to quit. Estrada, who took office June 30, said he would name a
replacement this week.
	   Estrella had tried but failed to stop the operations of the
syndicate, which has existed since the time of Estrada's
predecessor, Fidel Ramos, the president told reporters.
	   ``It's been going on, millions have been lost,'' Estrada said,
but declined to give other details, including whether health
department officials were involved.
	   The Philippine leader also blamed the syndicate for a shortage
of medicine in many rural hospitals.
	   Estrada won by a wide margin in the May 11 elections on a
pro-poor platform. He has pledged to make an anti-graft campaign a
cornerstone of his six-year term.

Taxi drivers stop work in Chinese city over fees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Several thousand taxi drivers angered by new
government fees protested outside city offices, paralyzing part of
a Chinese provincial capital for three days last week.
	   All but a few hundred of Shijiazhuang's 4,000 taxi drivers
walked off the job Wednesday night, and by 9 a.m. Thursday 1,000
striking cabbies had mobbed entrances and streets around the city
government office, a human rights group said Sunday.
	   Hundreds of police tried to get the protesters to stop blocking
the streets, and the angry strikers attacked cabbies who did not
join in the strike, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   A plan announced last month to stop issuing new taxi operating
licenses and to raise registration fees in Shijiazhuang _ capital
of Hebei province, 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Beijing _
provoked the strike, said the Information Center.
	   Protests and sporadic attacks on strike-breakers continued until
city officials agreed Saturday afternoon to put off the new policy,
said the Information Center and an official in the Hebei propaganda
office, who gave only his surname, Wang.
	   While the Information Center reported that 3,000 taxi drivers
went on strike, the official would say only that several thousand
took part. He added that there were no arrests.

Chechnya vows to pursue independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya will never give up plans to build
an independent Islamic state, President Aslan Maskhadov said
Sunday, the region's Independence Day.
	   Maskhadov spoke at a ceremony held in pouring rain in a stadium
in Grozny, the Chechen capital. The stadium was decorated with
17,000 balloons showing the Chechen flag. Portraits of Chechnya's
first president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, and other prominent figures were
displayed on nearby buildings.
	   A military parade was held later, and people celebrated in the
street, many firing guns into the air.
	   Dudayev, a retired air force general, seized control of Grozny
on Sept. 6, 1991. He was elected president in October 1991 and
declared the southern region independent of Russia, which was then
part of the Soviet Union.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent in troops to crush the
Chechen independence drive in 1994; fighting lasted for two years.
As many as 80,000 people, including Dudayev, were killed.

King pessimistic about Cambodia's future, protests continue

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk expressed
pessimism Sunday that talks he is mediating will lead the country
out of its political crisis and reportedly told participants he
will abdicate if the effort fails.
	   He made the threat as demonstrations decrying the results of the
recent national election continued in the capital.
	   The seriousness of Sihanouk's remarks was hard to judge because
he regularly employs such threats as a political bargaining chip.
	   The 75-year-old monarch's powers are limited by the
constitution, but many Cambodians revere him as a symbol of moral
authority.
	   Sihanouk presided Sunday over the second of three days of
meetings in the northwestern province of Siem Reap that he had
hoped would help resolve the deadlock that has followed July's
parliamentary elections.
	   The talks bring together representatives from the three rival
political parties, the national election committee and the
country's highest appeals body.
	   Eng Chhay Ieng, a representative of the opposition Sam Rainsy
Party, said Sunday's meeting produced no results because technical
issues raised by opposition parties _ how to deal with their
election complaints _ received no response.
	   He quoted the king as telling representatives of all sides that
he would ``step down from the throne if the crisis cannot be
settled.''
	   Palace officials were not available to confirm the king's
remark.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
the July 26 polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government on its own.
	   The leading opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party have accused Hun Sen of cheating at the polls. They
have threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if their
allegations of fraud _ dismissed as baseless by election
authorities loyal to Hun Sen _ are not properly investigated.
	   So far, disagreements between the opposing sides at the talks
have been ``total and irreversible,'' the king said in a letter to
U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher, released by the palace as
Sunday's talks opened. Rohrabacher has taken an active interest in
Cambodian affairs.
	   ``I am very pessimistic and I am not anticipating that the
responsible Cambodian parties will, through an honorable
compromise, lead our unfortunate country and our unhappy people out
of this more and more tragic crisis,'' Sihanouk wrote.
	   Tol Lah, the chief FUNCINPEC representative at the talks,
described Sunday's session as fruitless. He said a suggestion by
Hun Sen's party to deal with election-related complaints after
convening parliament was ``impossible.''
	   Since the elections, tensions have been mounting in Phnom Penh,
where demonstrators have been staging an around-the-clock vigil
against Hun Sen for two weeks.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy led 10,000 people through the
streets of Phnom Penh Sunday. They clogged traffic when they
marched and rode motorcycles to the National Assembly _ the site of
the anti-government vigil _ after holding a two-hour rally at the
main sports stadium.
	   ``As long as the march is peaceful, I think it is productive,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``While they are talking in Siem Reap, everyone in
the whole world can see that people in Cambodia want democracy.''
	   The protests have been largely violence-free, but angry mobs
were reported Friday to have killed as many as five ethnic
Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them of being
responsible for a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   In their public speeches, FUNCINPEC head Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, who condemned the killings, have played on the
anti-Vietnamese prejudices held by many Cambodians.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh, the
king's son, as co-premier in a bloody coup. Hun Sen hoped the new
polls would help him win back legitimacy in the eyes of the
international community and foreign aid.

Taiwan police round up more than two dozen suspected gangsters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police rounded up more than two dozen
suspected gangsters in a dawn sweep Sunday as part of a 2-year-old
campaign to break the back of Taiwan's underworld.
	   Vowing ``no compromise, no truce'' in the government's war on
organized crime, Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo announced that six
gang bosses and 25 lower-ranking gangsters had been arrested around
the island and sent to a top-security island jail off the east
coast.
	   ``I would hope that the underworld would not underestimate the
government's determination to crack down on the gangs,'' Cheng told
a news conference.
	   Among those arrested were Chen Wen-yung, a suspected gang boss
in northern Taoyuan County accused of strong-arming his way into
the gravel and garbage businesses and running prostitution rings.
	   Two leaders of the Bamboo League, one of Taiwan's largest gangs,
were also brought in, along with Lin Chung-jung, a Taipei gangster
who had renounced his gang ties during a police amnesty last year.
	   Taiwan has an estimated 126 organized crime groups with more
than 5,000 members engaged in businesses ranging from construction
to drug running.
	   Coming at a time when politicians are jostling for support in
December's general elections, the sweep seemed intended to back up
Cheng's earlier warnings to gangsters to stay out of the electoral
process. Government at all levels in Taiwan is believed to be
heavily infiltrated by the gangs, which use political influence to
avoid prosecution and steer government contracts their way.
	   Cheng's ministry has announced new measures to trace campaign
funding and force politicians to sever their gang links.
	   Cheng credited improved cooperation between his ministry and the
Interior Ministry's police force for the success of the sweep.
Future targets will include more rank and file gang members, Cheng
said.

Germany rules out freeze on debt repayments for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Germany ruling out debt moratorium &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Hans Kinkel on
Sunday ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped Russia insisting
Moscow pay back its debts to foreign creditors.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' Kinkel said.
	   On Saturday, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini called a
rescheduling or moratorium on Russia's external debt
``inevitable.''
	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government.
	   Kinkel said ``those debts must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to
continue to count on German government support for such lending.
``I don't think a debt moratorium is the right way to go.''
	   Kinkel spoke on the second and last day of an EU foreign
ministers meeting in this picturesque city, birthplace of Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart. At the session, in an ornate palace in the center
of the city, the ministers found themselves once again stumped by
political crises in Eastern Europe.
	   Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United States is again
grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed the EU appoint
a special envoy to Kosovo where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel told
reporters Saturday. He said the EU must make ``a special
contribution'' to peace in Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, the financial and political crisis in Russia loomed
large over the meeting but the ministers approached it very
cautiously. Several said there was no point in handing out large
amounts of financial aid to stabilize an out-of-control economy and
currency and with no government in place in Moscow.
	   The EU ministers said they will send a delegation of British,
Austrian and German officials to Moscow next week to pledge
political support and issue a strong plea for Russia to stay true
to economic reform and leave not return to communism.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action's
sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not clear,''
Kinkel said.
	   Dini said a rescheduling or moratorium on Russia's external debt
was inevitable, adding, ``It is hardly possible for Russia to meet
its (debt) obligations in the short term.''
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy.
	   However, EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in
development aid programs to Russia since 1991 with mixed results.
The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.
	   EU grappling with the foreign policy issues such as Russia and
Kosovo underline its inability to take a common stand quickly and
effectively. This was most noticeable during the Bosnian war when
EU waffling led the United States to take the lead and impose a
peace settlement.
	   Taking a cue from that experience, EU government have begun
considering ways to amend their slow-as-molasses decision-making
rules. That in itself will last months since previous attempts have
failed each time.

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dies at 88
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of death, surviving relatives; ADDS
byline
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's most famous filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, died
at his home Sunday, a spokesman for his film company said. He was
88.
	   Kurosawa's films included epics such as ``The Seven Samurai''
and ``Rashomon.'' His work inspired a generation of directors both
in Japan and in the United States.
	   The cause of death was not immediately known, said Toru Tanaka
an official of Kurosawa Film Production.
	   He was survived by a son, Hisao, and daughter, Kazuko.
	   Kurosawa, known as ``The Emperor'' for his perfectionism and
extravagance, was one of the few Japanese directors to find fame on
international screens.
	   The Cannes Film Festival honored Kurosawa with a special trophy
for achievement upon the debut of his 28th film, ``Ran,'' or
``Chaos,'' in 1985.
	   The epic, which Kurosawa called his ``life's work,'' was named
best picture of the year by America's National Society of Film
Critics. With a price tag topping dlrs 10 million, Ran was the most
expensive movie in Japanese film history.
	   ``Take `myself,' subtract `movies,' and the remainder is
`zero,''' the director once wrote. His themes often asserted the
value of the warrior spirit, humanist ideals, and the urgency of
self-sacrifice even if futile.
	   Critics have found his innovative style _ celebrated for its
elaborate detail and sweeping camera movements _ influencing
foreign films from George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' to Brian DePalma's
``Scarface.''
	   Kurosawa's movies include ``Rashomon'' (1950), ``The Seven
Samurai'' (1954), ``Throne of Blood'' (1957), ``Yojimbo'' (1961),
and ``Kagemusha,'' or ``Shadow Warrior'' (1980).
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910 to a family that had held samurai rank,
Kurosawa was the youngest of eight children of a military school
administrator.
	   He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art school and
tiring of poverty as a painter. In 1936 he stumbled on a film
studio's advertisement asking people to audition for an assistant
directorship, tried out, and got it.
	   At age 33 he directed his first film, ``Sanshiro Sugata'' (The
Judo Saga). It was a hit in wartime Japan, but Kurosawa's vision
conflicted with some nationalist sentiments, and drew heated
attacks from the military.
	   His work did not win much applause abroad until ``Rashomon'' got
the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1951.

Yilmaz in Jordan for talks on Mideast peace, boosting ties

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz arrived
Sunday for talks on the Middle East peace process and on building
closer economic and military ties.
	   Yilmaz is on his first visit to the region since his Motherland
Party came to power earlier this year. He will stay in Jordan for
two days, then visit neighboring Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
	   He did not speak with reporters on arrival at Marka Air Base
near Amman. He quickly went into a meeting with Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh and also was scheduled to meet Crown Prince Hassan.
	   Suha Umar, Turkey's ambassador to Jordan, said talks would focus
on ways to push forward Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
	   He said Yilmaz, who is accompanied by 100 business executives,
would seek joint ventures with Jordan in irrigation, dams and road
construction. Umar said Turkey would like to see two-way trade
increase from its current total of dlrs 190 million a year.
	   Umar said military cooperation and combating terrorism also
would be on Yilmaz's agenda. He did not elaborate.
	   Jordan came under fire from Arab countries, especially
neighboring Syria, when it sent an observer to joint
Israeli-Turkish maneuvers off Israel's coast last November.
	   Arab states and Iran considered the drills a threat to regional
security.
	   Syria _ which fell out with Jordan after King Hussein signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994 _ fears that an emerging alliance
between Turkey, Israel and Jordan could weaken its military and
political clout in the region.
	   Turkey has signed several military cooperation agreements with
Israel since 1996. It allows Israeli jets to use its airspace for
training, and Israel upgrades Turkey's F-4 fighter fleet under a
contract worth dlrs 630 million signed two years ago.
	   Last month, the liberal Istanbul daily Yeni Yuzyil reported that
Israel, Turkey and the United States may hold another round of
exercises in the eastern Mediterranean in December or January. It
said Egypt and Jordan may be invited.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters after a Cabinet
session late Saturday that Jordan has no plans to join a regional
military alliance.
	   ``Jordan's policy is to maintain good and positive relations
with brothers and friends in all places to the interest of the Arab
nation,'' he said.

	   Sheinbein listened to the judge's ruling stony faced, as his
brother draped his arm around him.
	   Sheibein's lawyer David Libai said that he would appeal the
ruling to the Supreme Court within 30 days. During the appeal
process, which lawyers and justice officials said could take
months, Sheinbein would remain in Israel.
	   In the 56 page ruling, the judge said that although Sheinbein
was a citizen he could be extradited because his family had not
maintained close ties with the country.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in his
decision.
	   The courtroom was mobbed with press and before the ruling was
read, Sheinbein's mother Victoria burst into tears as photographers
clamored over her in an attempt to take a picture of her son.

	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of 19 year-old Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in
the garage of an empty house near the Sheinbein home in Silver
Spring Maryland. Shortly after he arrived, he was picked up by
police and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's attorney, former Israeli
Justice Minister David Libai, fought the U.S. extradition request
based on the citizenship law.
	   The claims caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and
threatened relations between the two allies. Two senior members of
the Senate House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Robert Livingstone,
Louisiana, and Rep. Sonny Callahan, Alabama, both considered
delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was not returned.
	   They softened their positions, however, when Israel's Justice
Ministry rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims. State prosecutors
have asked the court to rule against Sheinbein's citizenship claim
because his father left the country before the citizenship law was
enacted and never applied for citizenship in the United States
where he has lived since he was a child.
	   The Montgomery County prosecutor's office has worked closely
with Israeli prosecutors in the extradition case. For Maryland
State Attorney Robert Dean, Israel's intricate laws have been a
frustrating delay of justice.
	   ``I really feel bad for the victim's family. They have a right
to see that justice gets done, and I think that a lot of people in
Maryland and Montgomery County are feeling a bit frustrated that
Samuel Sheinbein, who was born and raised here, is not back yet,''
he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
	   A ruling granting citizenship would not mean the murder trial
would be moved to Israel, where there is no jury system. Courts,
sentences and even prison life can be easier.
	   Reuven Shapira, a crime reporter for Israeli newspapers for 10
years, said while murder convictions carry a 24-year sentence, most
prisoners are released after serving two-thirds of the sentence or
even less for good behavior.
	   For youths, the sentence is usually 16 years and can be reduced
for good behavior. Sheinbein was 17-years-old at the time of
Tello's murder and would likely be tried as a youth. Almost all
prisoners, including murder convicts are eligible for one week-end
furlough each month after the completion of the first quarter of
the sentence. Prison life is considered safer than in the United
States, murder or rape in Israeli jails is rare.
	   Only a small handful of prisoners including assassin Yigal Amir,
who killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, have been denied week-ends
off and eligibility for sentence reduction.
	   Holding the trial in Israel could be expensive and complicated,
and it is unclear who would pick-up the costs. Witnesses, evidence,
aides, and even the victim's family would need to be flown in for
the trial.
	   ``The logistical concerns alone are a compelling argument to
keep the trial in Maryland,'' said Dean.
	   In Israel, there have also been calls to send Sheinbein back.
Lawmakers and newspaper editorials harshly criticized the motives
of the accused, saying that Israel was not built as a haven for
Jewish criminals.
	   Sheinbein, who is in a youth detention center, has appeared
handcuffed and shackled at most court sessions but has not spoken
to reporters.
	   For some appearances, he was accompanied by his mother Victoria,
who flew in towards the end of the extradition trial or his father
Sol, who has been charged the United States with aiding his son's
flight to Israel.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A judge ruled Sunday to extradite Samuel
Sheinbein, an American teen-ager wanted for murder in Maryland for
the brutal killing of an acquaintance nearly one year ago.
	   Jerusalem District Court Judge Moshe Ravid said that although
Sheinbein was ``extraditable'' the defense had 50 days within which
to appeal the decision.
	   The judge ruled that even though he accepted Sheinbein's
contention that he was an Israeli citizen, he had no right to stay
in the country because he had not maintained close ties to Israel.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Though her husband's career is
awash in allegations of sexual misconduct, the wife of Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister laughs off comparisons with Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, dumped from his posts of deputy prime minister
and finance minister on Wednesday, stands accused of everything
from sodomy to wearing wigs during his sexual trysts.
	   The allegations have put Anwar and his family under intense
pressure. But his wife, Azizah Ismail, has not lost her sense of
humor.
	   ``I'm a medical doctor and she's a lawyer,'' Azizah, an
ophthamologist, said, referring to U.S. President Bill Clinton's
wife.
	   Azizah also noted that she met her husband when she was a
medical intern in a hospital Anwar visited years ago. ``But please
don't call me the intern,'' she said with a smile.
	   Azizah, speaking Sunday at her family's private residence, backs
her husband's claim the allegations were floated to undermine his
challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   ``I married a man who fought for the people, for the rights of
the poor, for truth and for idealism,'' she said.
	   Her family has been holed up at the residence since Thursday.
Anwar expects to be arrested on the sexual misconduct allegations,
or possibly on other charges of treason by way of leaking state
secrets.
	   He tells the hundreds of people holding vigil at his house that
there is safety in numbers.
	   Azizah, who quit working full time when Anwar became deputy in
1995, said she felt betrayed by Mahathir.
	   The 72-year-old leader was a mentor to Anwar, 51, persuading him
to leave his more conservative Islamic party and join the ruling
United Malays National Organization.
	   Anwar had been considered Mahathir's successor. Now, Azizah
said, he may become the champion of a reform movement that has been
quietly brewing for years.

Legislator says market intervention damages Hong Kong reputation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Government intervention to prop up share prices
has damaged the territory's reputation as a free-market financial
center, a legislator said Sunday.
	   Independent lawmaker Emily Lau said on Radio Hong Kong that the
stakes in the government intervention stretch far beyond the stock
market.
	   ``With financial turmoil sweeping around the world, the Hong
Kong dollar is seen as one of the vulnerable candidates for the
next collapse,'' she said.
	   Last month, the government spent 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion foreign reserves on a two-week stock buying spree to lift
share prices to levels where speculators suffered heavy losses.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also announced steps on
Saturday to strengthen the territory's 15-year old currency peg to
the U.S. dollar.
	   Lau said the battle for the Hong Kong dollar is a ``political
test as well as a financial crisis.''
	   She warned that as market volatility continues and the people
find that little has been achieved by the intervention, they may
become ``restive and even angry.''
	   ``Loss of public confidence would endanger the currency peg to
the U.S. dollar, which is the linchpin of our financial system,''
she added.
	   Speculators have played on the currency peg's connection to
local interest rates to drive rates higher and share prices lower,
in an attempt to weaken the peg, which is set at 7.80 to the U.S.
dollar.

EU has sympathy for Russia but no new money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with draft declaration on Russian crisis, EDITS to
conform, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The 15 European Union governments, in a
declaration they planned to issue Sunday, said they are ready to
help Russia climb out of its financial crisis but offered no fresh
money or even a reprieve on its debt repayments.
	   In a draft declaration, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow to
stay the course on economic reforms.
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' said the draft statement, obtained by The
Associated Press. ``The responsibilities for these reforms lies
with Russia.''
	   The statement made clear the wish of West Europeans to help
Moscow financially through aid programs of the EU itself and the
International Monetary Fund. ``We stand ready to cooperate further
with the Russian authorities in support of sustained efforts
towards stabilization and reform.''
	   In something of a plea to international money lenders to show
some heart, the statement called on the IMF to consider the impact
the Russian crisis has on social conditions in the country,
especially on the eve of another winter.
	   The draft statement made no mention of a moratorium on Russia's
current debts or even a rescheduling of repayments.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Saturday such a
possibility ``was inevitable.'' However, German Foreign Minister
Hans Kinkel on Sunday ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped
Russia.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' he said
	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government. Kinkel said ``those debts
must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to continue to count on German
government support for such lending. ``I don't think a debt
moratorium is the right way to go.''
	   The foreign ministers debated Russia in this picturesque city,
the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, on the second and last
day of informal talks. Once again, they ministers found themselves
stumped by political crises in Eastern Europe.
	   Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United States is again
grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed the EU appoint
a special envoy to Kosovo where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel told
reporters Saturday.
	   The ministers planned to send a the foreign ministers of
Britain, Austria and Germany to Moscow this week to pledge
political support, but only if a government is in place.
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy.
	   However, EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in
development aid programs to Russia since 1991 with mixed results.
The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dies at 88
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to add Kurosawa received special Oscar; UPDATES with
comment from film critic in graf 11 &QL; 
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, the internationally acclaimed
director awarded a special Oscar for his half-century career in
filmmaking, died at his home Sunday, a spokesman for his production
company said. He was 88.
	   Kurosawa's films included epics such as ``The Seven Samurai''
and the Oscar-winning ``Rashomon,'' the first Japanese film to win
an international award.
	   His work inspired a generation of directors both in Japan and in
the United States.
	   The director died early Sunday afternoon in his Tokyo home, said
Toru Tanaka an official of Kurosawa Film Production. The cause of
death was not immediately known.
	   He was survived by a son, Hisao, and daughter, Kazuko.
	   Kurosawa, known as ``The Emperor'' for his perfectionism and
extravagance, was one of the few Japanese directors to find fame on
international screens.
	   The Cannes Film Festival honored Kurosawa with a special trophy
for achievement upon the debut of his 28th film, ``Ran,'' or
``Chaos,'' in 1985.
	   The epic, which Kurosawa called his ``life's work,'' was named
best picture of the year by America's National Society of Film
Critics. With a price tag topping dlrs 10 million, Ran was the most
expensive movie in Japanese film history.
	   Kurosawa was the first Japanese to receive the Honorary Oscar
for lifetime achievements in 1990.
	   ``Take `myself,' subtract `movies,' and the remainder is
`zero,''' the director once wrote. His themes often asserted the
value of the warrior spirit, humanist ideals, and the urgency of
self-sacrifice even if futile.
	   Critics have found his innovative style _ celebrated for its
elaborate detail and sweeping camera movements _ influencing
foreign films from George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' to Brian DePalma's
``Scarface.''
	   ``He had a god-like vision that translated well to American
movies,'' said Naoko Kimura, an independent film critic in Tokyo.
	   ``His philosophy on directing is part of modern filmmaking,''
she said.
	   Kurosawa's movies include ``Rashomon'' (1950), ``The Seven
Samurai'' (1954), ``Throne of Blood'' (1957), ``Yojimbo'' (1961),
and ``Kagemusha,'' or ``Shadow Warrior'' (1980).
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910 to a family that had held samurai rank,
Kurosawa was the youngest of eight children of a military school
administrator.
	   He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art school and
tiring of poverty as a painter. In 1936 he stumbled on a film
studio's advertisement asking people to audition for an assistant
directorship, tried out, and got it.
	   At age 33 he directed his first film, ``Sanshiro Sugata'' (The
Judo Saga). It was a hit in wartime Japan, but Kurosawa's vision
conflicted with some nationalist sentiments, and drew heated
attacks from the military.
	   His work did not win much applause abroad until ``Rashomon'' got
the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1951.

Ishihara wins first career victory in Fujisankei Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAWAGUCHIKO, Japan (AP) _ Masako Ishihara beat South Korean Shin
Sora and Akiko Fukushima in a playoff Sunday in the Fujisankei
Ladies Classic, her first victory in a four-year career.
	   After starting four strokes off the pace, Ishihara forced the
playoff with a final round of even-par 71, tying Shin and Fukushima
at a level-par 213 total for the regulation 54 holes.
	   Fukushima shot a 68 and Shin a 72.
	   In the playoff on the par-4 18th, both Ishihara and Shin birdied
the first hole, while Fukushima, the Japan LPGA's money earnings
leader in the last two years, picked the ball up after missing a
putt for par.
	   On the second extra hole, Ishihara sank a 3-foot (1-meter)
birdie putt, while Shin two-putted from 13 feet (4 meters).
	   The victory was worth 10.8 million yen (dlrs 80,600) from a
purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 448,000). It compares to a total of
4.8 million yen (dlrs 35,800) she had earned in the first three
years on the tour.
	   ``I'm not a talented, thoroughbred golfer,'' said the
32-year-old Ishihara, who started playing golf after graduating
from a college. ``Now that I've won a tournament, I'll just keep
trying to build up momentum slowly and steadily in each
tournament.''
	   The 25-year-old Fukushima, who has just passed the first round
of qualification to join the U.S. LPGA Tour, was seeking her second
title of the season and 13th overall.
	   Shin's only victory in Japan came in the 1996 Toto Motors
Ladies.
	   Overnight leader Tseng Hsiu-feng of Taiwan shot a fat 76 that
left her tied for fourth at 1-over-par 214 with Kumiko Hiyoshi and
Yumiko Akagi.
	   Kaori Harada, who is leading the earnings list this season, shot
a 71 and shared seventh at 215 with Mayumi Murai and Kaori Higo.

EU has sympathy for Russia but no new money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with draft declaration on Russian crisis, EDITS to
conform, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The 15 European Union governments, in a
declaration they planned to issue Sunday, said they are ready to
help Russia climb out of its financial crisis but offered no fresh
money or even a reprieve on its debt repayments.
	   In a draft declaration, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow to
stay the course on economic reforms.
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' said the draft statement, obtained by The
Associated Press. ``The responsibilities for these reforms lies
with Russia.''
	   The statement made clear the wish of West Europeans to help
Moscow financially through aid programs of the EU itself and the
International Monetary Fund. ``We stand ready to cooperate further
with the Russian authorities in support of sustained efforts
towards stabilization and reform.''
	   In something of a plea to international money lenders to show
some heart, the statement called on the IMF to consider the impact
the Russian crisis has on social conditions in the country,
especially on the eve of another winter.
	   The draft statement made no mention of a moratorium on Russia's
current debts or even a rescheduling of repayments.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Saturday such a
possibility ``was inevitable.'' However, German Foreign Minister
Hans Kinkel on Sunday ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped
Russia.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' he said
	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government. Kinkel said ``those debts
must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to continue to count on German
government support for such lending. ``I don't think a debt
moratorium is the right way to go.''
	   The foreign ministers debated Russia in this picturesque city,
the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, on the second and last
day of informal talks. Once again, they ministers found themselves
stumped by political crises in Eastern Europe.
	   Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United States is again
grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed the EU appoint
a special envoy to Kosovo where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   The ministers planned to send a the foreign ministers of
Britain, Austria and Germany to Moscow this week to pledge
political support, but only if a government is in place.
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy.
	   However, EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in
development aid programs to Russia since 1991 with mixed results.
The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A judge ruled Sunday to extradite Samuel
Sheinbein, an American teen-ager wanted for murder in Maryland for
the brutal killing of an acquaintance nearly one year ago.
	   Jerusalem District Court Judge Moshe Ravid said that although
Sheinbein was ``extraditable'' the defense had 50 days within which
to appeal the decision.
	   The judge ruled that even though he accepted Sheinbein's
contention that he was an Israeli citizen, he had no right to stay
in the country because he had not maintained close ties to Israel.
	   Sheinbein listened to the judge's ruling stony faced, as his
brother draped his arm around him.
	   Sheinbein's attorney, former Justice Minister David Libai, said
that he would act speedily in order to appeal the ruling to the
Supreme Court within a month. During the appeal process, which
lawyers and justice officials said could last for months, Sheinbein
would remain in Israel.
	   In the 56 page ruling, the judge said that although Sheinbein
was a citizen he could be extradited because his family had not
maintained close ties with the country.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in his
decision.
	   United States Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said the U.S.
welcomed the decision and looked forward to further cooperation on
the case with Israeli officials in the event of an appeal.
	   ``It is uncertain when Sheinbein will return to the U.S. if he
appeals the decision. At the beginning of the process Israeli
officials estimated it might take a year or more. We plan to
discuss the decision and arrangements for Sheinbein's return to the
U.S. with Israeli authorities soon,'' Schwartz said.
	   The courtroom was mobbed with press and before the ruling was
read, Sheinbein's mother Victoria burst into tears as photographers
clamored over her in an attempt to take a picture of her son.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of 19 year-old Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in
the garage of an empty house near the Sheinbein home in Silver
Spring Maryland. Shortly after he arrived, he was picked up by
police and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's lawyer fought the U.S.
extradition request based on the citizenship law.
	   The claims caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and
threatened relations between the two allies. Two senior members of
the Senate House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Robert Livingstone,
Louisiana, and Rep. Sonny Callahan, Alabama, both considered
delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was not returned.
	   They softened their positions, however, when Israel's Justice
Ministry rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims. State prosecutors
have asked the court to rule against Sheinbein's citizenship claim
because his father left the country before the citizenship law was
enacted and never applied for citizenship in the United States
where he has lived since he was a child.
	   The Montgomery County prosecutor's office has worked closely
with Israeli prosecutors in the extradition case. For Maryland
State Attorney Robert Dean, Israel's intricate laws have been a
frustrating delay of justice.
	   ``I really feel bad for the victim's family. They have a right
to see that justice gets done, and I think that a lot of people in
Maryland and Montgomery County are feeling a bit frustrated that
Samuel Sheinbein, who was born and raised here, is not back yet,''
he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
	   A ruling granting citizenship would not mean the murder trial
would be moved to Israel, where there is no jury system. Courts,
sentences and even prison life can be easier.
	   Reuven Shapira, a crime reporter for Israeli newspapers for 10
years, said while murder convictions carry a 24-year sentence, most
prisoners are released after serving two-thirds of the sentence or
even less for good behavior.
	   For youths, the sentence is usually 16 years and can be reduced
for good behavior. Sheinbein was 17-years-old at the time of
Tello's murder and would likely be tried as a youth. Almost all
prisoners, including murder convicts are eligible for one week-end
furlough each month after the completion of the first quarter of
the sentence. Prison life is considered safer than in the United
States, murder or rape in Israeli jails is rare.
	   Only a small handful of prisoners including assassin Yigal Amir,
who killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, have been denied week-ends
off and eligibility for sentence reduction.
	   Holding the trial in Israel could be expensive and complicated,
and it is unclear who would pick-up the costs. Witnesses, evidence,
aides, and even the victim's family would need to be flown in for
the trial.
	   ``The logistical concerns alone are a compelling argument to
keep the trial in Maryland,'' said Dean.
	   In Israel, there have also been calls to send Sheinbein back.
Lawmakers and newspaper editorials harshly criticized the motives
of the accused, saying that Israel was not built as a haven for
Jewish criminals.
	   Sheinbein, who is in a youth detention center, has appeared
handcuffed and shackled at most court sessions but has not spoken
to reporters.
	   In some appearances such as Sunday's ruling he was accompanied
by his mother Victoria, who flew in towards the end of the
extradition trial or his father Sol, who has been charged the
United States with aiding his son's flight to Israel.

In Iraq, business as usual for remaining U.N. monitors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspections have been sharply
limited by Saddam Hussein's government, although one group of
inspectors is still busy. But they go only where Iraqi officials
expect them to.
	   These monitors check remote-controlled cameras and sensors at
potential weapons-making sites, making sure nothing has been
tampered with in the surveillance program to ensure Iraq is not
renewing weapons production.
	   The monitoring crews are responsible for inspecting about 300
sites in Baghdad and around the country.
	   ``They are busy,'' said Nils Carlstrom, the inspectors' chief in
Baghdad. ``There are day inspections, night inspections, all the
time.''
	   The routine monitoring goes largely unnoticed because it
involves sites visited dozens of times before, causing some to
question how much the monitoring can really do to prevent Iraq from
secretly resuming arms production.
	   The monitors' work contrasts with the surprise visits to new
sites that are now blocked by Iraq. The last six or seven
disarmament inspectors who do that work left Baghdad on Aug. 8,
three days after Iraq announced it was halting cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections since Iraq's
defeat in the Gulf War.
	   Until the commission declares Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, trade and other sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted. The sanctions have hit
Iraq hard, banning regular sales of its economic mainstay, oil.
	   Saddam's government has long maintained it has destroyed its
weapons systems and its refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors
is meant to force the issue. It halted the inspections by simply
refusing to supply needed Iraqi escorts to U.N. teams.
	   It still gives escorts to the monitors who continue their daily
routine, visiting factories and laboratories and making long trips
by helicopter to remote sites.
	   But even with this work, Iraq's ban affects monitoring, too,
since the monitors cannot pursue leads they might get about
possible weapons activity at new sites, Richard Butler, the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, has complained.
	   Butler said Thursday that Iraq also has challenged the U.N.
monitors on which sites will be considered as having been inspected
before.
	   Scott Ritter, the arms inspector who resigned Aug. 26 with
scathing criticism of the United Nations' handling of the
inspections, said Iraq has succeeded in cutting the guts out of the
inspection program.
	   ``There is an illusion of arms control taking place,'' he said.
``Right now we are not doing meaningful inspections in Iraq.''
	   Ritter accused the United Nations _ and the U.S. government _ of
knuckling under and refusing to challenge Iraq for fear of creating
a fizzled confrontation like the one in February when Iraq last
challenged the inspection system.
	   The divided U.N. Security Council _ China opposes U.S. and
British demands for stronger action against Iraq _ has taken no
practical steps to renew the broader inspections.
	   In Baghdad, the U.N. monitors are under orders not to talk to
reporters so details of their work are not public. Carlstrom, a
Swedish major general, defends the monitoring as a valuable part of
the inspection process.
	   He says the monitors keep cameras running that could detect
suspicious items showing up in labs or on assembly lines. The
monitors also can go through filing cabinets and storage boxes to
keep track of what is going on at the various sites.
	   The monitors are dogged in their work. They show up at the
commission's headquarters, a small hotel on Baghdad's outskirts, at
6 a.m. and it is often 10 p.m. by the time they finish.
	   There are no apparent tensions between the monitors and their
escorts or other Iraqis. Carlstrom said the monitors are free to
move around Baghdad and at night their cars can be seen parked
outside restaurants in affluent areas.

Homicide trial of ex-president's brother winding down

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Raul Salinas once moved among power and
riches, showing off a Spanish mistress and funneling more than
dlrs132 million out of the country during his brother's
presidential administration.
	   Then his brother left office, and he went into prison more than
3 1/2 years ago and had his bank accounts seized.
	   Now the gregarious big brother of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari is whacking away at charges ranging from
corruption to money laundering to murder.
	   Some people think he may just shake them.
	   Testimony wrapped up last week in his long-running trial on
charges of masterminding the 1994 assassination of a political
rival, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and a verdict is expected this
fall.
	   During a session last month, Salinas said he hoped to be
acquitted ``thanks to God and the evidence.''
	   The prosecution's case was so marred by the witness tampering
and perjury that are rampant in Mexico's troubled legal system that
both supporters and detractors alike say the charges may not stick.
	   At his final court appearance, Salinas threw up his hands and
begged a witness to ``tell the judge how they intimidated you ...
tell the judge, for God's sake!''
	   The witness stuck by his story that the alleged go-between in
Ruiz Massieu's assassination _ Sen. Manuel Munoz Rocha _ had called
Salinas the night of the murder.
	   But other witnesses repeatedly changed their stories during the
trial, which has held periodic sessions since early 1995. Even
Salinas contradicted himself on his relationship with Munoz Rocha,
who disappeared soon after the killing and is now presumed dead.
	   A previous team of prosecutors in the murder case has been
charged itself with torturing witnesses to extract testimony.
	   Meanwhile, prosecutors produced almost no physical evidence in
arguing Salinas ordered the murder of Ruiz Massieu, who was a
former brother-in-law and the No. 2 man in the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   ``We won't present witnesses who would have seen how the killing
was carried out ... or who saw who ordered it,'' prosecutor Jose
Ramos conceded early on.
	   Salinas' brother, who lives in self-imposed exile in Ireland,
has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied any
knowledge of his brother's actions.
	   An acquittal in the murder case won't mean freedom for Salinas,
his lawyers say.
	   ``If Mr. Salinas manages to win an acquittal in the homicide
case, then the government and prosecutors will turn all their guns
on trying for a conviction on money matters,'' lawyer Raul Cardenas
predicted.
	   Salinas sits in the high-security Almoloya prison, guarded by
heavily armed soldiers in the middle of a corn field outside the
capital. He also faces trial for ``illegal enrichment'' _ a
catchall charge that covers such things as taking bribes, aiding
drug traffickers and misusing public funds.
	   Swiss prosecutors who investigated Salinas' foreign bank
accounts said his fortune came from money laundering and drug
bribes, but a Mexican judge dismissed money-laundering charges
earlier this year. Mexican prosecutors never filed any specific
drug-related charges.
	   Salinas denies the illegal enrichment charges, saying he sent
the dlrs 132 million _ part of which he claims belonged to business
associates _ out of Mexico to Swiss bank accounts ``because he
didn't think it was proper to have business dealings in Mexico
while his brother was president,'' said Cardenas, his lawyer.
	   The Mexico attorney general's office says Salinas used at least
four aliases and forged documents to hide extensive real estate and
bank holdings acquired while holding a second-tier post in his
brother's government that paid about dlrs 40,000 a year. He also
used false names to transfer the dlrs 132 million out of the
country, officials say.
	   Although he denies the specific money charges, Salinas himself
has publicly admitted to capitalizing on ``the huge opportunities''
available to him as a sibling of Mexico's president.
	   Salinas has undergone a striking turnabout since his fall.
	   He was peremptory and arrogant when he entered prison in
February 1995, just three months after his brother left the
presidency in disgrace.
	   His hair is completely gray now and during court hearings he
greets reporters from behind the bars with friendly phrases like:
``God bless you, kids.''
	   Authorities have barred journalists from interviewing Salinas,
but he has sent several statements to the news media through his
legal team.
	   ``To date, neither my lawyers nor my family have been able to
see me except from behind glass, behind bars or once a week under
strict observation,'' Salinas said in a message released in August.
	   ``I am allowed a pen and a notebook, which is illegally opened,
photocopied and handed over to third parties, which has allowed the
government to see all my correspondence and defense strategies,''
he added.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ When Yasser Arafat, the former
Palestinian guerrilla chief, shook hands with Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli ex-general, on the White House lawn five years ago, their
act of courage held the promise of ending decades of Arab-Israeli
bloodshed and hatred.
	   Today, that icon of peacemaking on Sept. 13, 1993, is tarnished
and abraded by broken promises, violence and deepening suspicions
that overshadow real changes in the daily lives of Palestinians and
Israelis.
	   For Palestinians, the peace process brought self-rule in all
major cities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gone are Israeli army
jeeps, curfews and nighttime raids. In their place are mundane
symbols of normalcy: park benches, traffic lights, cafes, public
telephones, reliable trash collection.
	   For Israelis, it has meant fewer days in uniform for
citizen-soldiers in the narrow, twisting alleys of fetid refugee
camps. It also brought acceptance in the Arab world at large, one
that held the promise of a broader peace and new economic
opportunity.
	   The peace accord negotiated in Oslo, Norway, was never
envisioned as an overall settlement, only as a way to get started.
The central concept was a step-by-step approach that would steadily
build confidence and encourage compromise.
	   But the peace process has been stuck for 18 months. Israel has
failed to meet deadlines for handing over more West Bank land, and
fears are increasing that the two sides are heading for a major
confrontation if Arafat makes good on a promise to declare an
independent Palestinian state next May when the interim peace
accord expires.
	   Nowhere are tensions more deeply felt than in Hebron, a West
Bank city of 130,000 people where Israel still controls the city
center and large numbers of its soldiers protect a few hundred
Jewish settlers.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government turned over 80
percent of the city to Palestinian control in January 1997, but
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian stonethrowers clash regularly.
Jewish settlers have gone on several rampages, attacking cars,
overturning vegetable carts and kicking and pushing Palestinians
who cross in front of their houses.
	   ``We live between the rocks and the shots,'' said Asad al-Asali,
who sells blue jeans and long Arabic dresses with intricately sewn
designs from his shop on the line dividing the Palestinian- and
Israeli-run sectors.
	   Al-Asali said he is somewhat pleased with the peace process. He
said Palestinians got some of the land they want, referring to the
27 percent of the West Bank and nearly all of the Gaza Strip now
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and noted some refugees
have been able to return as a result of the Oslo accord.
	   But the Jewish settlers who remain among the Palestinians are a
problem, al-Asali said. ``If we are strong, they will go,'' he
said. ``If they stay, we will not be able to have peace.''
	   The latest violence in Hebron erupted last month after a
prominent rabbi, Shlomo Raanan, was murdered as he slept in his
mobile home. Israeli authorities said they believed his assailant
escaped into the Palestinian autonomy zone.
	   Such attacks are at the heart of Netanyahu's problem with the
peace process he was bequeathed. He demands that Palestinian
officials hand over murder suspects, disarm military groups like
Hamas and end the ``revolving door'' of arrest and release for
extremists.
	   Netanyahu, who pointedly avoided fifth anniversary ceremonies in
Oslo, also complains bitterly that Arafat has not reined in threats
of violence and hate speech by Palestinian officials and media.
	   And to show its sincerity about peace, the Palestinian National
Council must remove the 26 articles of the PLO charter that call
for Israel's destruction, Netanyahu says.
	   ``Can you imagine the impact on Israeli public opinion?'' asked
David Bar-Illan, a top Netanyahu adviser. ``Nothing would signal
more clearly that they will seek peace in peaceful ways.''
	   Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Alaa, the chief Palestinian
negotiator at Oslo, puts the blame on the other side.
	   He said the most serious failing of the peace process is that
Israel did not deliver on its promises _ not only on troop
withdrawals but on lesser issues such as a port and airport for
Palestinians.
	   ``And so we have lost two years of the five years in putting on
a show of negotiations for the television cameras, a creation of
this Israeli government of wasting time,'' said Qureia, now head of
the elected Palestinian legislative council.
	   Hassan Asfour, also a member of the Palestinian negotiating
team, said the problem was not the peace process but Netanyahu, who
had ruled out compromise on vital issues such as the future of
Jerusalem, the return of refugees and Palestinian statehood.
	   ``We tried our best to solve the issues, but the Israeli side
just played with time. We will put an end to this game,'' Asfour
said.
	   He said the Israelis could negotiate with the new Palestinian
state when it is declared in May.
	   Joseph Alpher of the American Jewish Committee said the peace
agreement had been oversold by its supporters, creating a backlash
among the Israeli public when Palestinian militants carried out a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
	   The accord also failed to bring reconciliation at the grassroots
level, he said.
	   ``By and large, there's been no change in everyday
interactions,'' he said. ``Oslo failed to instill confidence and
trust between the two peoples.''

	   Sprigs of reconciliation and hope have been crushed in the ever
deepening distrust on both sides.
	   One recent example was the cancellation of a performance by
Zehava Ben, an Israeli who has sought to build a cultural bridge
with Palestinians by singing the classic Arabic songs of the
Egyptian great Umm Kalthoum. She said she received warnings that
Hamas militants were threatening an attack.
	   ``They gave me a very warm reception,'' Ben said of her past
performances in the West Bank. ``They like my songs, not only in
Arabic. They ask me to sing in Hebrew, also.''
	   Ata Abdel Karim Kaid, a Palestinian whose greenhouse near the
West Bank town of Qalqiliya became a meeting point for Jewish
settlers and Palestinians buying flowers and house plants, is
bitter. Israel's army plans to demolish his Paradise Nursery,
fearing it could be used as a hideout to ambush settlers on a
nearby road.
	   Kaid said appeals by senior Palestinian officials had been to no
avail. ``This shows that the Israelis and Palestinians are not
partners in peace,'' he said.

Two views of peace process by those who negotiated the accords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Middle East-Peace Anniversary &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
architect of the Oslo peace accord, and Palestinian chief
negotiator Ahmed Qureia (Abu Alaa) met separately with The
Associated Press to outline their views on the progress and meaning
of the peace process:
 &UR; SHIMON PERES &QC; 
	   Q: Looking back, what did Olso accomplish?
	   A: To us it looks like a very long period; historically it was
fast, you know. But I think the Oslo agreement has changed the
whole history and processes in the Middle East.
	   Let's face it, at the heart of the Mediterranean conflict it was
always the Palestinian problem. But, when it came to the
Palestinians, there was a Palestinian problem but not a Palestinian
partner. In Oslo, it was legitimized, a Palestinian partner was
established and whether the baby is a product of love or accident,
it doesn't matter, he has a life of his own, he grows, he develops.
...
	   We have today Palestinian autonomy. Most of the Palestinians are
in the womb of their own leadership. We stopped being the
dominators of the Palestinian life, the Palestinian people. They're
developing their own land, their own independence, their own
infrastructure. ...
	   With the present processes and crises, we do not hear voices
that call for war neither on the Arab side nor on the Israeli side.
And while right now there is a setback or a stoppage or whatever
you call it, it's temporary. If the government will not proceed
with the peace process, I think the government will fall and not
the peace process.
	   Q: Do you believe in the creation of an independent Palestinian
state?
	   A: Well, I'm clearly and loudly for the creation of a
Palestinian independent state. Hopefully it will be democratic,
modern and prosperous.
	   We need it, because the alternative to it is the end of Israel
as a Jewish state. We are today 4.7 million Jewish people west of
the Jordan river, and there are 4 million Palestinian people. If we
should come under the same statehood, it will be not a Jewish
state, not a Palestinian state; it will be an ongoing clash between
two people that refuse to coexist.
	   So I mean, honestly and courageously one must say the truth,
that this is the best solution. Instead of having a divided state,
let's have a partition of the land. Furthermore, I say that even if
we shall give to the Palestinians most of the land they demand and
much of the water they ask for, they, as us, will always be short
of land and short of water because the land is a tiny little land
and the Jordan River is richer in history than in water.
	   ___
 &UR; AHMED QUREIA (ABU ALAA) &QC; 
	   Q: Five years after Oslo, what are the accomplishments and
disappointments?
	   A: A lot has been accomplished. There is a Palestinian Authority
that was established on Palestinian land. There are institutions
for this authority that are real and a foundation for the process
of building towards the independent Palestinian state. ...
	   Also, a kind of relationship with the Israelis has been
established, as well. And there is now a kind of understanding on
the part of the Israelis of the rights of the Palestinian people,
and a lot of the misinformation and indoctrination that the
Israelis relied on in dealing with the Palestinian has begun to be
rejected and in its place there is the beginning _ and I stress the
beginning _ of the possibility for two neighbors to exist on one
land and to think of a future of cooperation and coordination on
various levels.
	   Among the negative is that for the past two years this Israeli
government has been conducting the process by itself far from
implementation of the agreement in accordance with a set timetable,
a timetable limited to five years.
	   And so we have lost two years of the five years in putting on a
show of negotiations for the television cameras, a creation of this
Israeli government of wasting time. The timetable is the most
significant component of Oslo; it is the strongest component. The
major disappointment is the nonimplementation of the agreements.
	   Q: What is the Palestinian definition of peace?
	   A: Real peace is the real attainment of the national rights of
the Palestinian people, which include the right of return,
self-determination and the establishment of the independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. This is the real
peace. And if this is achieved then every Palestinian has to go and
give every Israeli citizen they see a kiss because this will mean
real coexistence. Without this there will be no real peace.
	   Q: Is May 1999 the right time to declare the state?
	   A: I believe yes for one reason: That the agreement set May 4,
1999, as the end of the interim agreement and so with the end of
the interim agreement the world must stand by us so that we can
declare our state and establish its borders and tell the world
there are certain areas of our land still under occupation, and it
is you who are responsible, ethically, historically and legally to
implement your decision regarding the refugees' right of return.

Spanish tail sections are joining here with French cockpits to make
the Airbus jetliners giving Boeing a run for its money.
	   After recent strategic sales coups, most recently breaking
Boeing's grip on British Airways, the European consortium is
talking confidently of deposing the U.S. giant as the world's No. 1
commercial jetmaker.
	   For Airbus, beating Boeing depends on a superjumbo gamble _ the
A3XX, which seats up to 650 people and cost at least dlrs 9 billion
to develop.
	   At the Farnborough International 98 air show in England this
week, Airbus will seek more companies to participate in the project
and spread the risk.
	   There's no scale mockup yet; the air show instead will feature
wind tunnel and other testing. But diagrams show the interior of a
cruise ship, with wide staircases, two decks with rows up to 10
seats across, and lower levels for shopping, a gym and sleeping
quarters.
	   ``We are investing heavily in this program,'' says Philippe
Jarry, Airbus vice president for marketing. He said the company
plans to firm up the plane's design by the end of the year and get
it flying by 2003.
	   Is Airbus sticking its neck out too far? Up to now, it's chipped
away at Boeing's dominance with sales of its A310s, 320s, 330s and
340s. But it has no jumbo jet, and the A3XX is aimed at far
surpassing the 350-seat 747.
	   ``If we're successful in four years with the A3XX, we won't be
limited to 50 percent of the market,'' says Airbus spokesman Alain
Dupiech.
	   There are other ``ifs.''
	   Will Airbus, a four-nation consortium including the state-owned
Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain, be able to restructure
soon into a private stock-issuing company that can raise money for
expansion?
	   Talks are under way between those companies and partners British
Aerospace and Germany's Dasa. For that to happen, said BA President
John Weston in Friday's Le Monde daily, Airbus must ``satisfy
criteria of profitability. ... It's not the case today.''
	   Can Airbus build the A3XX at an attractive price?
	   ``It certainly is a big gamble,'' said Paul Jackson, editor of
the London-based Jane's All The World's Aircraft.
	   While Airbus predicts demand for about 1,400 A3XXs, Boeing
officials ``don't see a market for a bigger plane right now,'' said
Boeing spokesman Craig Martin. But they're keeping a stretch 747 on
the drawing boards, just in case.
	   Past concerns about Airbus' fly-by-wire planes, with a computer
between the pilot and the control of the aircraft, appear to have
evaporated. Boeing stuck with directly linked controls for thrust
and steering until it came out with the 777.
	   But strong Airbus sales confirmed the airline industry's faith
in fly-by-wire _ used in modern military jets _ as lighter and more
fuel-efficient. Airbus claims the A3XX's direct operating cost per
seat will be 15 percent cheaper than that of the 747.
	   Airbus is hoping for 40-percent risk-sharing, and so far, Jarry
said eight European companies and one American firm have signed on
for 30 percent of the program.
	   In addition, 20 airlines from Europe, Asia and the United States
have joined as consultants in the development stage.
	   ``When we said the price would be around dlrs 200 million to
these airlines, they were not surprised,'' Jarry said.
	   The Asian financial crisis ``will go away in say, two years, and
it won't change the fact they need a bigger plane.''

Scottish defense lawyer says Gadhafi bargaining, not rejecting
</HEADLINE>
Lockerbie deal &QL; 
 &UR; With Libya

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A defense lawyer for two Libyan
suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jet said Sunday that Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi has not rejected a trial in The Netherlands,
but appears to be seeking firm guarantees against extradition.
	   ``It sounds to me as if what he is saying is that in principal
the idea of a trial in The Hague is not unacceptable,'' Alistair
Duff, the suspects' Scottish lawyer, told reporters in Edinburgh.
	   ``But (he means) that there need to be clear guarantees and
assurances about the risk of extradition _ passing the two accused
on to some other country once they are in The Hague ... that is no
different to what different people have been saying all week,''
added Duff.
	   In Tripoli, the Libyan capital, Gadhafi said Saturday that he
rejected a U.S.-British agreement for a trial in the Dutch capital
under Scottish law because ``Libya has not signed it and is not a
party to it.''
	   He said Britain and the United States were trying to use The
Netherlands as a ``transit point'' to transfer the men to Britain,
and demanded guarantees that The Netherlands would be the last
stop.
	   The agreement provides that suspects Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah serve sentences in Britain if convicted.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, a spokesman for relatives of British victims, also
interpreted Gadhafi's reponse as bargaining rather than rejection.
	   ``It sounds to me as if the Libyans are looking at some depth at
what is on offer,'' said Swire. ``In some ways this is an
encouraging thing ... I think what Col. Gadhafi is hinting at here
is that he doesn't like the idea of his citizens being imprisoned
in Scotland.''
	   Swire is insistent the suspects be jailed in Scotland if
convicted.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with appeal from deputy speaker for political deal. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to agree on
forming a new government to handle Russia's burgeoning economic
crisis, his press service confirmed.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communist-dominated parliament has already
rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said Sunday that he would hold talks
Monday with eight members of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, eight members of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Communist deputy speaker of the Duma appealed to all sides
to reach an agreement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Svetlana Goryacheva urged opposition lawmakers to ``brush aside
ambitions, think of Russia's future and conclude an agreement with
the authorities.''
	   She said that many lawmakers ``have utterly forgotten about
Russia and become entangled in political games and lengthy
discussions.''
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. Chernomyrdin held the job for five years before
being fired in March and rehired Aug. 23 as Russia's economy went
into a tailspin.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   The Communists and their hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin for creating Russia's current predicament. On Saturday
they said they had as many as nine alternatives for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats.
	   The State Duma is scheduled to consider the matter again Monday,
after meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Federation Council passed a non-binding motion on Friday
endorsing Chernomyrdin, putting pressure on the Duma to confirm his
appointment.
	   But the governor of the Samara region, chairman of the Council's
budget committee, said Sunday that Chernomyrdin ``cannot lead the
country out of the crisis, whoever joins his Cabinet.''
	   Konstantin Titov told Interfax that Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor
and one of the opposition's proposed candidates for prime minister,
was someone who ``can consolidate the nation.''

EU has sympathy for Russia but no new money

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The 15 European Union governments said
Sunday they are ready to help Russia climb out of its financial and
economic crisis but offered no fresh money or even a reprieve on
its debt repayments.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow
to stay the course on economic reforms and not ``revert to a
command economy.''
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' the statement said.
	   ``The responsibilities for these reforms lies with Russia.''
	   The statement underscored the EU's wish to help Moscow
financially through aid programs of the EU itself and the
International Monetary Fund. ``We stand ready to cooperate further
with the Russian authorities in support of sustained efforts
towards stabilization and reform.''
	   In a nudge to international money lenders to show some heart,
the EU statement called on the IMF to consider the impact the
Russian crisis has on social conditions in the country, especially
on the eve of winter.
	   The statement made no mention of a moratorium on Russia's debts
or even a rescheduling of repayments.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Saturday such a
possibility ``was inevitable,'' but German Foreign Minister Hans
Kinkel ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped Russia.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' Kinkel said.
	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government. Kinkel said ``those debts
must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to continue to count on German
government support for such lending.
	   Senior officials of the G-7 nations _ the United States, Canada,
Japan, Germany, Italy, Britain and Germany _ are to meet in London
this week to discuss how the international community can help
Russia. Officials declined to speculate on what action would be
taken but acknowledged that a rescheduling or freeze of Russian
debts would be a possibility.
	   On Kosovo, Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United
States is again grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed
the EU appoint a special envoy to the Serb province where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel
said.
	   The foreign ministers of Britain, Austria and Germany plan to go
to Moscow this week to show the EU's political support for Moscow
in its times of crisis.
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy. However, EU governments have
granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid programs to Russia
since 1991 with mixed results.
	   The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.

In Iraq, business as usual for remaining U.N. monitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 9th graf that Iraq ``usually'' gives escorts to
monitors. INSERTS 12 graf with comment from official in Baghdad,
CHANGES last graf to make it read inspectors have no problems with
Iraqi public. No pick up &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspections have been sharply
limited by Saddam Hussein's government, although one group of
inspectors is still busy. But they go only where Iraqi officials
expect them to.
	   These monitors check remote-controlled cameras and sensors at
potential weapons-making sites, making sure nothing has been
tampered with in the surveillance program to ensure Iraq is not
renewing weapons production.
	   The monitoring crews are responsible for inspecting about 300
sites in Baghdad and around the country.
	   ``They are busy,'' said Nils Carlstrom, the inspectors' chief in
Baghdad. ``There are day inspections, night inspections, all the
time.''
	   The routine monitoring goes largely unnoticed because it
involves sites visited dozens of times before, causing some to
question how much the monitoring can really do to prevent Iraq from
secretly resuming arms production.
	   The monitors' work contrasts with the surprise visits to new
sites that are now blocked by Iraq. The last six or seven
disarmament inspectors who do that work left Baghdad on Aug. 8,
three days after Iraq announced it was halting cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections since Iraq's
defeat in the Gulf War.
	   Until the commission declares Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, trade and other sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted. The sanctions have hit
Iraq hard, banning regular sales of its economic mainstay, oil.
	   Saddam's government has long maintained it has destroyed its
weapons systems and its refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors
is meant to force the issue. It halted the inspections by simply
refusing to supply needed Iraqi escorts to U.N. teams.
	   It still usually gives escorts to the monitors who continue
their routine, visiting factories and laboratories and making long
trips by helicopter to remote sites.
	   But even with this work, Iraq's ban affects monitoring, too,
since the monitors cannot pursue leads they might get about
possible weapons activity at new sites, Richard Butler, the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, has complained.
	   Butler said Thursday that Iraq also has challenged the U.N.
monitors on which sites will be considered as having been inspected
before.
	   Caroline Cross, an aide to Carlstrom, said Saturday the monitors
had been refused access to one previously inspected missile site
and not given escorts to visit two other such sites. But she added
that the monitoring mission still was ``pretty much unharmed.''
	   Scott Ritter, the arms inspector who resigned Aug. 26 with
scathing criticism of the United Nations' handling of the
inspections, said Iraq has succeeded in cutting the guts out of the
inspection program.
	   ``There is an illusion of arms control taking place,'' he said.
``Right now we are not doing meaningful inspections in Iraq.''
	   Ritter accused the United Nations _ and the U.S. government _ of
knuckling under and refusing to challenge Iraq for fear of creating
a fizzled confrontation like the one in February when Iraq last
challenged the inspection system.
	   The divided U.N. Security Council _ China opposes U.S. and
British demands for stronger action against Iraq _ has taken no
practical steps to renew the broader inspections.
	   In Baghdad, the U.N. monitors are under orders not to talk to
reporters so details of their work are not public. Carlstrom, a
Swedish major general, defends the monitoring as a valuable part of
the inspection process.
	   He says the monitors keep cameras running that could detect
suspicious items showing up in labs or on assembly lines. The
monitors also can go through filing cabinets and storage boxes to
keep track of what is going on at the various sites.
	   The monitors are dogged in their work. They show up at the
commission's headquarters, a small hotel on Baghdad's outskirts, at
6 a.m. and it is often 10 p.m. by the time they finish.
	   There are no apparent tensions between the monitors and the
Iraqi people. Carlstrom said the monitors are free to move around
Baghdad and at night their cars can be seen parked outside
restaurants in affluent areas.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) - Here is the text of the declaration on
Russia issued Sunday by European Union foreign ministers:
	   The European Union attaches great importance to a politically
stable and economically sound Russia. Russia remains a vital
partner in addressing global issues and in ensuring regional
stability. The European Union and Russia enjoy a privileged
relationship reflected in the Partnership and Cooperation
Agreement. Intensive political dialogue at all levels between the
Union and Russia, including the foreign ministers' meeting in
September and the summit in October, is of great importance. The EU
stands ready to send a troika at ministerial level as soon as
practicable to Moscow.
	   We hope that the constitutional procedures to form a new
government will soon be completed. This will help to re-establish
confidence among the Russian people and the international financial
community. It is our firm conviction that political and economic
stability go hand in hand, and are a prerequisite for economic
growth in Russia. In this context, social cohesion and credible
efficient and transparent institutions will undoubtedly be of prime
importance. Against this background the existing programs of the
international financial institutions should be reviewed.
	   We realize that Russia has had to face and will continue to face
unique challenges. We see a continued reform process as an
expression of Russia's commitment to democracy, a market economy
and its integration into the world economy. The responsibility for
these reforms lie with Russia. We trust that Russia will not revert
to a command economy but proceed along the path of structural
reform in order to establish a social market economy. Only through
resolute structural reform and sound macroeconomic policies will it
be possible to pave the way for sustainable growth and social
stability.
	   The Union and its member states have already contributed to the
economic and political transition process in Russia through the
IMF, the EBRD, other international financial institutions, the
Council of Europe and its own instruments such as TACIS as well as
member states' bilateral technical assistance programs. We stand
ready to cooperate further with the Russian authorities in support
of sustainable efforts toward stabilization and reform.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Counting of handwritten ballots proceeded
slowly Sunday, a day after Maltese voted in a national election
seen as a test of sentiment about whether the island nation feels
ready to join the European Union fold.
	   About 95 percent of the 278,000 eligible voters turned out
Saturday in an election called three years early by Prime Minister
Alfred Sant in hopes of strengthening his Labor party's sometime
tenuous one-vote majority in the 65-seat parliament.
	   Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami was trying to gain back
the premiership.
	   Shortly after coming to office in 1996, Sant froze Malta's EU
bid, which had been pushed heavily by Fenech Adami, and the
election was largely being read as a sounding of whether Maltese
were willing to have the nation make the fiscal sacrifices needed
for EU eligibility.
	   Maltese industry receives heavy government protection, and
paring a budget deficit would likely mean cutting jobs in the heavy
state sector.
	   The Nationalists contended any sacrifices would be worth it to
attract foreign investment and EU funds for such infrastructure as
new roads, important for Malta's biggest money-maker, tourism.
	   Labor campaigned by advocating a free trade area agreement with
Brussels which would stop short for now of pushing for EU
membership.
	   With all but perhaps 10 percent of the voters diehard
Nationalists or Labor supporters, the practice of exit polling
never developed on the island.
	   Winners' victory announcements traditionally set off an
explosion of joy from supporters whooping and sending up fireworks
as they surge through the streets. Backers of the losing parties
have sometimes taken to trashing local offices of the winning
party.
	   In the runup to the election, political leaders called upon
their supporters to stay calm.
	   Worried about the prospect of smashed storefronts and tipsy
revelers or angry losers, most shops and businesses, ranging from
airline offices to dry cleaners, announced they would stay
shuttered on Monday. Sunday is a traditional closing day.

	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government. Kinkel said ``those debts
must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to continue to count on German
government support for such lending.
	   Senior officials of the G-7 nations _ the United States, Canada,
Japan, Germany, Italy, Britain and Germany _ are to meet in London
this week to discuss how the international community can help
Russia. Officials declined to speculate on what action would be
taken but acknowledged that a rescheduling or freeze of Russian
debts would be a possibility.
	   On Kosovo, Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United
States is again grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed
the EU appoint a special envoy to the Serb province where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel
said.
	   The foreign ministers of Britain, Austria and Germany plan to go
to Moscow this week to show the EU's political support for Moscow
in its times of crisis.
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy. However, EU governments have
granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid programs to Russia
since 1991 with mixed results.
	   The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy
such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound
banking laws.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Here is the text of the declaration on
Russia issued Sunday by European Union foreign ministers:
	   The European Union attaches great importance to a politically
stable and economically sound Russia. Russia remains a vital
partner in addressing global issues and in ensuring regional
stability. The European Union and Russia enjoy a privileged
relationship reflected in the Partnership and Cooperation
Agreement. Intensive political dialogue at all levels between the
Union and Russia, including the foreign ministers' meeting in
September and the summit in October, is of great importance. The EU
stands ready to send a troika at ministerial level as soon as
practicable to Moscow.
	   We hope that the constitutional procedures to form a new
government will soon be completed. This will help to re-establish
confidence among the Russian people and the international financial
community. It is our firm conviction that political and economic
stability go hand in hand, and are a prerequisite for economic
growth in Russia. In this context, social cohesion and credible
efficient and transparent institutions will undoubtedly be of prime
importance. Against this background the existing programs of the
international financial institutions should be reviewed.
	   We realize that Russia has had to face and will continue to face
unique challenges. We see a continued reform process as an
expression of Russia's commitment to democracy, a market economy
and its integration into the world economy. The responsibility for
these reforms lie with Russia. We trust that Russia will not revert
to a command economy but proceed along the path of structural
reform in order to establish a social market economy. Only through
resolute structural reform and sound macroeconomic policies will it
be possible to pave the way for sustainable growth and social
stability.
	   The Union and its member states have already contributed to the
economic and political transition process in Russia through the
IMF, the EBRD, other international financial institutions, the
Council of Europe and its own instruments such as TACIS as well as
member states' bilateral technical assistance programs. We stand
ready to cooperate further with the Russian authorities in support
of sustainable efforts toward stabilization and reform.

Defense lawyer says Gadhafi bargaining, not rejecting Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>
deal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: 2nd-4th grafs, UPDATES with British Foreign Office reaction;
edits pvs to conform &QL; 
 &UR; With Libya

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A defense lawyer for two Libyan
suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jet said Sunday that Libya's
leader has not rejected a trial in The Netherlands, but appears to
be seeking guarantees against extradition.
	   In London, the Foreign Office said Britain would not bargain
over the substance over a British-U.S. agreement providing for the
suspects to the tried in The Hague, the Dutch capital, and jailed
in Britain if convicted.
	   However, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain ``was happy to
clarify any technical or legal details'' through the United
Nations.
	   ``There is no other channel and we're not prepared comment on
media reports,'' added the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Edinburgh, defense lawyer Alistair Duff said Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi appeared to be saying that ``in principal the idea
of a trial in The Hague is not unacceptable.''
	   ``But (he means) that there need to be clear guarantees and
assurances about the risk of extradition _ passing the two accused
on to some other country once they are in The Hague ... that is no
different to what different people have been saying all week,''
added Duff.
	   On Saturday, Gadhafi announced in Tripoli, the Libyan capital,
that he rejected a U.S.-British agreement because ``Libya has not
signed it and is not a party to it.''
	   He said Britain and the United States were trying to use The
Netherlands as a ``transit point'' to transfer the men to Britain,
and demanded guarantees that The Netherlands would be the last
stop.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, a spokesman for relatives of British victims, also
interpreted Gadhafi's response as bargaining rather than rejection.
	   ``It sounds to me as if the Libyans are looking at some depth at
what is on offer,'' said Swire. ``In some ways this is an
encouraging thing ... I think what Col. Gadhafi is hinting at here
is that he doesn't like the idea of his citizens being imprisoned
in Scotland.''
	   Swire is insistent the suspects that suspects Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah serve sentences in Britain if
convicted.

Iraq threatens `necessary action' if sanctions aren't lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-Inspectors &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi newspaper that reflects the views
of the ruling Baath party warned Sunday that Iraq will take
``necessary action'' if the U.N. Security Council does not lift
punishing trade sanctions.
	   The front-page editorial in Al-Thawra did not say what action
was contemplated.
	   The paper also reacted angrily to an American and British draft
resolution introduced to the Security Council last week. It calls
for suspension of regular sanctions reviews until Iraq reverses its
Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel and limit the sale of oil,
Iraq's economic mainstay _ were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The Security Council has said they will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists that it has done so and says the inspectors have
been working to prolong the sanctions on behalf of the United
States.
	   Al-Thawra accused the Security Council of ignoring its
statements, saying the council ``does not find an issue to discuss
but an American-British draft resolution aimed at the suspension of
the bimonthly reviews of sanctions.''
	   The paper added: ``If the Security Council succumbs again to the
American blackmail ... the leadership and the people have no choice
but to take the necessary action conferred by its legal rights,
national interests, independence and national pride.''
	   The paper said the threat of suspending reviews ``will not make
Iraq back down of its demands ... as long as the sanctions continue
without a hint from the Security Council which shows an end to the
sanctions is within sight.''
	   The paper asserted that the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees weapons inspections, ``receives its instructions from
Iraq's enemies.'' Iraq has long contended that the commission
operates at the behest of the United States and Britain to prolong
the sanctions.
	   The draft resolution put forward by the United States and
Britain last week would punish Iraq for freezing cooperation with
inspectors by suspending regular sanctions reviews.
	   But it also appeared to offer Iraq an incentive to resume
cooperation. The resolution says that if inspectors are allowed to
get back to work, the council would be willing to consider a
comprehensive review of Iraq's previous compliance.
	   That could allow the council members to highlight Iraq's
previous record of destroying its weapons of mass destruction.

Myanmar state press continues attacks on pro-democracy movement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A high-ranking leader accused the
pro-democratic opposition Sunday of trying to lead Myanmar women
into wicked Western ways, while the state-run press blamed it for
inflation and the frequent closings of the country's colleges.
	   It was part of an intensifying campaign of vilification against
the pro-democracy movement and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in
recent weeks as the military government has faced increasing
challenges.
	   The attacks bring into question the sincerity of the
government's call for a dialogue with Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy _ talks the regime says Suu Kyi could not attend.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues have vowed to try to convene
parliament on their own sometime this month, even though the
military regime that seized power in 1988 has threatened to arrest
them and ban her party if they try.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the result.
	   In the last two weeks, hundreds of students have demonstrated at
least three times, the first public protests in Yangon in almost
two years.
	   Access to the Hlaing campus of the Yangon Institute of
Technology, where the students are housed, remained closed Sunday,
but residents in the area reported no heavy security presence.
Protests over educational issues were held there Thursday night.
	   In a speech reported in state-run newspapers Sunday, a senior
military officer accused ``destructionist elements'' of trying to
tarnish the image and dignity of Myanmar women and imposing Western
values under the pretext of human rights and women's rights.
	   Speaking to winners of the ``Myanmar Women's Day Essay
Competition,'' Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, leading secretary of the ruling
junta, said that though Myanmar women enjoy equal status with men
as their birthright, some ``imperialist lackeys'' have charged that
they are deprived of rights.
	   ``It is time for all Myanmar women to annihilate the ax-handles
who are trying to mislead Myanmar girls to think highly of Western
culture and commit unlawful acts,'' Khin Nyunt was quoted saying.
``Ax handles'' is the junta's term for traitors, frequently applied
to pro-democracy dissidents, as is the phrase ``imperialist
lackey.''
	   A separate commentary in the newspapers blamed the ``internal
ax-handles'' for inflation and the frequent closings of state-run
colleges and universities.
	   ``A group of ax-handles led by an Oxford graduate has been using
devious methods to incite unrest, create economic hardship,
instigate youths and cause the disintegration of the country,''
said the commentary.
	   Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is the country's
best-known Oxford graduate, and the junta likes to emphasize her
ties to Britain, one-time colonial master of Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   All universities and colleges in Yangon and the country's
second-biggest city, Mandalay, were closed indefinitely in December
1996 after student unrest.
	   Educational institutions in other parts of the country,
unaffected by the unrest, continued their classes and held their
1997 final examinations. They did not, however, reopen for the
following school year.
	   In May this year, the universities resumed activities with a
very limited schedule of exams for final year students.
	   The government is extremely cautious about giving students any
opportunity for freedom of expression, fearful they may align
themselves with the pro-democracy movement.
	   Although it highly values stability and order, the closing of
educational institutions has become an embarrassment for the
government, already widely condemned for human rights abuses and
the stifling of the country's pro-democracy movement.

Seven Croatian policemen arrested for beating foreigner to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Seven policemen have been arrested and
charged in connection with the beating death of an Italian man, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The officers, whose names were not released, are charged with
assault in the line of duty and inflicting grievous bodily harm to
44-year-old Ricardo Cetina, the daily Jutarnji List reported.
	   According to a police statement, Cetina, 44, of Udine, was
apparently beaten by the officers at a restaurant Wednesday night
in the coastal town of Sibenik after resisting arrest on charges of
disturbing the peace and endangering traffic.
	   He was taken to nearby Split county hospital, suffering from
contusions all over his body and a brain hemorrhage. He died
Thursday morning after several hours in a coma.
	   An autopsy and police investigation monitored by the Italian
Embassy are still in progress.
	   Southern Croatia is a popular tourist region visited by many
foreigners, especially Italians and Germans.

EU has sympathy for Russia, but no money; Tells IMF to review its
</HEADLINE>
criteria &QL; 
 &UR; UPDATES with criticism of IMF, other money lenders &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The European Union governments said
Sunday they are ready to help Russia out of its financial and
economic crisis but offered no fresh money or even a reprieve on
its debt repayments. They urged money lenders to be kind to Moscow
and amend their loan criteria.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow
to stay the course on economic reforms and not ``revert to a
command economy.''
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' the statement said. ``The responsibilities for
these reforms lies with Russia.''
	   The statement underscored the EU's wish to help Moscow
financially through aid programs of the EU itself and the
International Monetary Fund and other international institutions.
``We stand ready to cooperate further with the Russian authorities
in support of sustained efforts towards stabilization and reform,''
it said.
	   The ministers urged money lenders like the IMF to show some
heart and be generous, especially in the case of Russia whose
economic and financial collapse severely impacts on the average
Russian.
	   ``Against this background the existing programs of the
international financial institutions should be reviewed,'' said the
statement, criticizing the conditions the IMF and others want to
see fullfilled before they open their wallets to those in need.
	   The EU statement made no mention of a moratorium on Russia's
debts or even a rescheduling of repayments.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Saturday such a
possibility ``was inevitable,'' but German Foreign Minister Hans
Kinkel ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped Russia.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' Kinkel said.
	   German banks have about dlrs 30 billion in Russian loans, most
of them guaranteed by the government. Kinkel said ``those debts
must be repaid'' if Moscow wants to continue to count on German
government support for such lending.
	   Senior officials of the G-7 nations _ the United States, Canada,
Japan, Germany, Italy, Britain and Germany _ are to meet in London
this week to discuss how the international community can help
Russia. Officials declined to speculate on what action would be
taken but acknowledged that a rescheduling or freeze of Russian
debts would be a possibility.
	   On Kosovo, Kinkel _ concerned that after Bosnia, the United
States is again grabbing the wheel in Balkan peacemaking _ proposed
the EU appoint a special envoy to the Serb province where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   The idea is meant to balance the shuttle diplomacy of
Christopher Hill, the American envoy who has cobbled together a
tentative peace deal.
	   ``The role of Europe in Kosovo must be reinforced,'' Kinkel
said.
	   The foreign ministers of Britain, Austria and Germany plan to go
to Moscow this week to show the EU's political support for Moscow
in its times of crisis.
	   The EU is not worried that the Russian crisis will curb economic
growth in Western Europe. Russia makes up only 4 percent of the
15-nation EU's overall economy. However, EU governments have
granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid programs to Russia
since 1991 with mixed results.
	   The EU head office in Brussels has suggested that these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the economy

Kuwabara wins Japan PGA Matchplay

<TEXT>
	   TOMAKOMAI, Japan (AP) _ Katsunori Kuwabara overcame Shinichi
Yokota's late charge Sunday and beat him on the 38th hole for a
1-up victory in the Japan PGA Matchplay Championship Promise Cup.
	   In an 18-hole round for third place, Myanmar's Zaw Moe defeated
defending champion Shigeki Maruyama 3 and 2.
	   Kuwabara, whose only previous title came in the 1995 Acom
International, seemed headed for an easy victory as he built a 4-up
lead halfway through the regulation 36 holes.
	   But Yokota, also seeking his second career victory, caught up on
the second 18.
	   The 29-year-old Kuwabara finally captured the title by parring
the second extra hole. Yokota reached the green in three shots and
missed a 12-foot (3.5-meter) putt for par.
	   ``I didn't play any differently in the latter half compared to
when I was taking a 5-up lead,'' Kuwabara said. ``He just didn't
give up and he played so well.''
	   Kuwabara collected 30 million yen (dlrs 223,600) from a purse of
100 million yen (dlrs 746,000), and received a five-year exempt
status on the tour. The match play tournament is one of the Japan
PGA Tour's four major events.

Gadhafi rejects U.S., British offer on Lockerbie trial

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi rejected the
terms of an American and British offer to try two Libyan suspects
in the Pan Am bombing case in the Netherlands, but a Scottish
defense lawyer suggested he was simply bargaining.
	   In a speech late Saturday, Gadhafi accused the United States and
Britain of trying to use the Netherlands as ``a transit point'' in
the case.
	   The offer calls for the trial of the two Libyans _ Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ in the Netherlands. If
found guilty, they would be transferred to Britain to serve their
time.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
	   Gadhafi told a gathering here that this was not the trial in a
third country that Libya had demanded but a deal ``to make the
third country a transit point to transfer the accused to Britain.''
	   He added: ``We (are prepared) to go tomorrow to the Netherlands,
provided that the Netherlands is the last stop in case of acquittal
or conviction. ... Guarantees to that effect are necessary.''
	   He said Libya did not recognize the agreement between Britain
and the Netherlands on the trial nor the U.N. Security Council
resolution endorsing it.
	   ``We reject the agreement signed by Britain and the Netherlands
because it concern's Libya's sons, and Libya has not signed it and
is not a party to it,'' Gadhafi said. He termed the U.N. Security
council resolution ``null and void'' and added that ``Libya does
not accept it.''
	   His remarks were monitored by the BBC in London.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, defense lawyer Alistair Duff said
Gadhafi appeared to be saying that ``in principal, the idea of a
trial ... is not unacceptable.''
	   He added: ``But (he means) that there need to be clear
guarantees and assurances about the risk of extradition _ passing
the two accused on to some other country.''
	   Duff noted that defense attorneys made similar statements last
week.
	   In London, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said Britain ``was
happy to clarify any technical or legal details,'' but said this
should be done through the United Nations and not the media. He
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The U.N. resolution calls for lifting trade sanctions once the
suspects are transferred to the Netherlands.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand
over the suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar
weapons sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit the sale of oil
equipment.
	   Gadhafi on Saturday praised five visiting African leaders for
flying to Tripoli in violation of the sanctions. The Organization
of African Unity earlier this year said it would no longer abide by
the sanctions when travel was required for humanitarian activities
or official business.
	   ``They stepped on the American sanctions ... with their dark
feet,'' Gadhafi said of the African leaders.
	   Gadhafi, dressed in tan fatigues and seated behind a podium,
spoke to thousands assembled in Tripoli's downtown Martyr's Square.
	   He was flanked by African presidents including Sudan's Omar
el-Bashir, Chad's Idriss Deby, Niger's Ibrahim Bare Mainassara,
Mali's Alpha Oumar Konare and the Central African Republic's
Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   On Sunday, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki flew to Tripoli in
violation of the sanctions.
	   The ceremony marked the 29th anniversary of the coup that
brought Gadhafi to power in 1969. Saturday also marked the 20th
anniversary of the Libyan Armed Laborers Day.
	   Libya has been calling for trial in a third, ``neutral'' country
for the Lockerbie suspects on grounds they could not receive a fair
trial in the United States and Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London _ which had long insisted that
any trial be on their territories _ relented and said it would
accept a trial in the Netherlands with Scottish judges and under
Scottish law.
	   Gadhafi earlier had said he wanted further negotiations to
provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe custody and fair
trial. Washington and London say the offer is non-negotiable.

APEC group urges bailout, but says integration must continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A committee of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum suggested measures Sunday to foil speculators'
attacks on regional markets and shore up battered economies, but
rejected moves to reverse the trend toward increased integration.
	   Delegates to the 18-member APEC Business Advisory Council
meeting agreed that aggressive steps were needed to curb
speculation in the stock and currency markets, the council said in
a news release. Specific measures were not announced.
	   ``While the benefits of trade and investment liberalization are
clear, the ramifications of speculative currency trading in the
absence of adequate governance structures are not clear and need to
be urgently addressed,'' the council said.
	   But delegates also agreed on the need to keep their economies
open to free movement of capital, a rejection of measures such as
the virtual shutdown of currency trading Malaysia clamped on its
economy last week in hopes of ending a slide into recession.
	   ``Desperate times call for urgent and tangible action by
governments to restore growth in the affected economies. But APEC
must also stick to its program of liberalization because this will
also help get us over the crisis,'' said ABAC Chairman Tan Sri
Tajudin Ramli.
	   The conference also endorsed Taiwanese delegate Jeffrey Koo's
proposal that countries less affected by the financial crisis
should guarantee bonds issued by the more battered economies.
	   The committee's recommendations will be submitted to the annual
APEC summit to be held in Malaysia in November.

Hundreds trying to buy games tickets find ticket booth closed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of people wanting to buy
tickets for the Commonwealth Games have found the ticket booth
closed, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   The official ticket agent, Ticket Express Sdn Bhd, was to begin
selling tickets last Tuesday, the Sunday Star reported.
	   But a Ticket Express spokesman told the paper that the company
was facing a shortage of telephones lines and power supply at the
booth, the paper said.
	   The games' opening ceremony is scheduled Friday, though some
events such as field hockey start Wednesday.
	   ``We need adequate telephone lines before we can install the
computers to keep track of ticket sales, and they are not ready
yet,'' the paper quoted the spokesman as saying.
	   A Ticket Express official, Tengku Jamalludin Tengku Bakar, said
ticket booths at the various stadiums were likely to open Monday.
	   Meanwhile the national news agency Bernama said it had received
complaints from the public that food sold at the games' main sports
complex was exorbitantly priced.

EU has sympathy for Russia but no new money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with six grafs with criticism of IMF, other money
lenders &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The 15 European Union governments said
Sunday they are ready to help Russia climb out of its financial and
economic crisis but offered no fresh money or even a reprieve on
its debt repayments.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow
to stay the course on economic reforms and not ``revert to a
command economy.''
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' the statement said. ``The responsibilities for
these reforms lies with Russia.''
	   The statement underscored the EU's wish to help Moscow
financially through aid programs of the EU and the International
Monetary Fund. ``We stand ready to cooperate further with the
Russian authorities in support of sustained efforts towards
stabilization and reform.''
	   In a nudge to international money lenders to show some heart,
the EU statement called on the IMF to consider the impact the
Russian crisis has on social conditions in the country, especially
on the eve of winter.
	   ``Against this background the existing programs of the
international financial institutions should be reviewed,'' said the
statement, criticizing the conditions the IMF and others want to
see fulfilled before they open their wallets to those in need.

Kuwait frees Indians detained in embassy threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has freed three Indian nationals who were
detained on suspicion they wrote a note threatening a bomb attack
on the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, the Interior Ministry said
Sunday.
	   The note was found Tuesday aboard an Emirates flight that landed
in Kuwait from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The three men
were passengers on the flight.
	   Kuwaiti investigators collected handwriting samples from the
passengers, and those of the three Indians initially appeared to be
similar to that on the note, said Col. Bader Saleh, spokesman for
the Interior Ministry.
	   Saleh said the men were released on Friday after it was found
their handwriting did not match.
	   He declined to identify the men or say if they were Gulf
workers.
	   No other arrests have been made, Saleh said.
	   The unsigned note, which was written in English and found in a
toilet of the aircraft, said the U.S. Embassy in Manila would be
bombed on Sept. 4. The threat led to heightened security measures
at the embassy.
	   Washington had closed some of its diplomatic missions and
increased security at others since last month's twin bombings of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. More than 250 people were
killed and some 5,000 injured.
	   Anti-American sentiments rose in the Middle East and Islamic
countries after the United States retaliated with missile strikes
on a Sudanese factory and suspected militants' training camps in
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ When Yasser Arafat, the former
Palestinian guerrilla chief, shook hands with Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli ex-general, on the White House lawn five years ago, their
act of courage held the promise of ending decades of Arab-Israeli
bloodshed and hatred.
	   Today, that icon of peacemaking on Sept. 13, 1993, is tarnished
and abraded by broken promises, violence and deepening suspicions
that overshadow real changes in the daily lives of Palestinians and
Israelis.
	   For Palestinians, the peace process brought self-rule in all
major cities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gone are Israeli army
jeeps, curfews and nighttime raids. In their place are mundane
symbols of normalcy: park benches, traffic lights, cafes, public
telephones, reliable trash collection.
	   For Israelis, it has meant fewer days in uniform for
citizen-soldiers in the narrow, twisting alleys of fetid refugee
camps. It also brought acceptance in the Arab world at large, one
that held the promise of a broader peace and new economic
opportunity.
	   The peace accord negotiated in Oslo, Norway, was never
envisioned as an overall settlement, only as a way to get started.
The central concept was a step-by-step approach that would steadily
build confidence and encourage compromise.
	   But the peace process has been stuck for 18 months. Israel has
failed to meet deadlines for handing over more West Bank land, and
fears are increasing that the two sides are heading for a major
confrontation if Arafat makes good on a promise to declare an
independent Palestinian state next May when the interim peace
accord expires.
	   Nowhere are tensions more deeply felt than in Hebron, a West
Bank city of 130,000 people where Israel still controls the city
center and large numbers of its soldiers protect a few hundred
Jewish settlers.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government turned over 80
percent of the city to Palestinian control in January 1997, but
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian stonethrowers clash regularly.
Jewish settlers have gone on several rampages, attacking cars,
overturning vegetable carts and kicking and pushing Palestinians
who cross in front of their houses.
	   ``We live between the rocks and the shots,'' said Asad al-Asali,
who sells blue jeans and long Arabic dresses with intricately sewn
designs from his shop on the line dividing the Palestinian- and
Israeli-run sectors.
	   Al-Asali said he is somewhat pleased with the peace process. He
said Palestinians got some of the land they want, referring to the
27 percent of the West Bank and nearly all of the Gaza Strip now
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and noted some refugees
have been able to return as a result of the Oslo accord.
	   But the Jewish settlers who remain among the Palestinians are a
problem, al-Asali said. ``If we are strong, they will go,'' he
said. ``If they stay, we will not be able to have peace.''
	   The latest violence in Hebron erupted last month after a
prominent rabbi, Shlomo Raanan, was murdered as he slept in his
mobile home. Israeli authorities said they believed his assailant
escaped into the Palestinian autonomy zone.
	   Such attacks are at the heart of Netanyahu's problem with the
peace process he was bequeathed. He demands that Palestinian
officials hand over murder suspects, disarm military groups like
Hamas and end the ``revolving door'' of arrest and release for
extremists.
	   Netanyahu, who pointedly avoided fifth anniversary ceremonies in
Oslo, also complains bitterly that Arafat has not reined in threats
of violence and hate speech by Palestinian officials and media.
	   And to show its sincerity about peace, the Palestinian National
Council must remove the 26 articles of the PLO charter that call
for Israel's destruction, Netanyahu says.
	   ``Can you imagine the impact on Israeli public opinion?'' asked
David Bar-Illan, a top Netanyahu adviser. ``Nothing would signal
more clearly that they will seek peace in peaceful ways.''
	   Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Alaa, the chief Palestinian
negotiator at Oslo, puts the blame on the other side.
	   He said the most serious failing of the peace process is that
Israel did not deliver on its promises _ not only on troop
withdrawals but on lesser issues such as a port and airport for
Palestinians.
	   ``And so we have lost two years of the five years in putting on
a show of negotiations for the television cameras, a creation of
this Israeli government of wasting time,'' said Qureia, now head of
the elected Palestinian legislative council.
	   Hassan Asfour, also a member of the Palestinian negotiating
team, said the problem was not the peace process but Netanyahu, who
had ruled out compromise on vital issues such as the future of
Jerusalem, the return of refugees and Palestinian statehood.
	   ``We tried our best to solve the issues, but the Israeli side
just played with time. We will put an end to this game,'' Asfour
said.
	   He said the Israelis could negotiate with the new Palestinian
state when it is declared in May.
	   Joseph Alpher of the American Jewish Committee said the peace
agreement had been oversold by its supporters, creating a backlash
among the Israeli public when Palestinian militants carried out a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
	   The accord also failed to bring reconciliation at the grassroots
level, he said.
	   ``By and large, there's been no change in everyday
interactions,'' he said. ``Oslo failed to instill confidence and
trust between the two peoples.''

	   Sprigs of reconciliation and hope have been crushed in the ever
deepening distrust on both sides.
	   One recent example was the cancellation of a performance by
Zehava Ben, an Israeli who has sought to build a cultural bridge
with Palestinians by singing the classic Arabic songs of the
Egyptian great Umm Kalthoum. She said she received warnings that
Hamas militants were threatening an attack.
	   ``They gave me a very warm reception,'' Ben said of her past
performances in the West Bank. ``They like my songs, not only in
Arabic. They ask me to sing in Hebrew, also.''
	   Ata Abdel Karim Kaid, a Palestinian whose greenhouse near the
West Bank town of Qalqiliya became a meeting point for Jewish
settlers and Palestinians buying flowers and house plants, is
bitter. Israel's army plans to demolish his Paradise Nursery,
fearing it could be used as a hideout to ambush settlers on a
nearby road.
	   Kaid said appeals by senior Palestinian officials had been to no
avail. ``This shows that the Israelis and Palestinians are not
partners in peace,'' he said.

Anderlecht suffers heaviest league defeat in 61 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's long-time soccer powerhouse
Anderlecht struggled Sunday to come to terms with its heaviest
league defeat since 1937, a 6-0 thrashing by first division
newcomers Westerlo.
	   ``We are all ashamed of this result. The supporters are ashamed.
I hope the players are ashamed,'' said club Chairman Roger Vanden
Stock.
	   The defeat Saturday night leaves the Brussels team
second-from-bottom of the first division with two points from four
games. Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times. Westerlo is
enjoying only its second season in the first division.
	   Anderlecht officials blamed the defeat on the injuries to
Belgian internationals Enzo Scifo and Lorenzo Staelens and the
absence of Swedish striker Par Zetterberg on duty with his national
team.

 &UR; Two views of peace process by those who negotiated the accords &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Middle East-Peace Anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
architect of the Oslo peace accord, and Palestinian chief
negotiator Ahmed Qureia (Abu Alaa) met separately with The
Associated Press to outline their views on the progress and meaning
of the peace process:
 &UR; SHIMON PERES &QC; 
	   Q: Looking back, what did Olso accomplish?
	   A: To us it looks like a very long period; historically it was
fast, you know. But I think the Oslo agreement has changed the
whole history and processes in the Middle East.
	   Let's face it, at the heart of the Mediterranean conflict it was
always the Palestinian problem. But, when it came to the
Palestinians, there was a Palestinian problem but not a Palestinian
partner. In Oslo, it was legitimized, a Palestinian partner was
established and whether the baby is a product of love or accident,
it doesn't matter, he has a life of his own, he grows, he develops.
...
	   We have today Palestinian autonomy. Most of the Palestinians are
in the womb of their own leadership. We stopped being the
dominators of the Palestinian life, the Palestinian people. They're
developing their own land, their own independence, their own
infrastructure. ...
	   With the present processes and crises, we do not hear voices
that call for war neither on the Arab side nor on the Israeli side.
And while right now there is a setback or a stoppage or whatever
you call it, it's temporary. If the government will not proceed
with the peace process, I think the government will fall and not
the peace process.
	   Q: Do you believe in the creation of an independent Palestinian
state?
	   A: Well, I'm clearly and loudly for the creation of a
Palestinian independent state. Hopefully it will be democratic,
modern and prosperous.
	   We need it, because the alternative to it is the end of Israel
as a Jewish state. We are today 4.7 million Jewish people west of
the Jordan river, and there are 4 million Palestinian people. If we
should come under the same statehood, it will be not a Jewish
state, not a Palestinian state; it will be an ongoing clash between
two people that refuse to coexist.
	   So I mean, honestly and courageously one must say the truth,
that this is the best solution. Instead of having a divided state,
let's have a partition of the land. Furthermore, I say that even if
we shall give to the Palestinians most of the land they demand and
much of the water they ask for, they, as us, will always be short
of land and short of water because the land is a tiny little land
and the Jordan River is richer in history than in water.
	   ___
 &UR; AHMED QUREIA (ABU ALAA) &QC; 
	   Q: Five years after Oslo, what are the accomplishments and
disappointments?
	   A: A lot has been accomplished. There is a Palestinian Authority
that was established on Palestinian land. There are institutions
for this authority that are real and a foundation for the process
of building towards the independent Palestinian state. ...
	   Also, a kind of relationship with the Israelis has been
established, as well. And there is now a kind of understanding on
the part of the Israelis of the rights of the Palestinian people,
and a lot of the misinformation and indoctrination that the
Israelis relied on in dealing with the Palestinian has begun to be
rejected and in its place there is the beginning _ and I stress the
beginning _ of the possibility for two neighbors to exist on one
land and to think of a future of cooperation and coordination on
various levels.
	   Among the negative is that for the past two years this Israeli
government has been conducting the process by itself far from
implementation of the agreement in accordance with a set timetable,
a timetable limited to five years.
	   And so we have lost two years of the five years in putting on a
show of negotiations for the television cameras, a creation of this
Israeli government of wasting time. The timetable is the most
significant component of Oslo; it is the strongest component. The
major disappointment is the nonimplementation of the agreements.
	   Q: What is the Palestinian definition of peace?
	   A: Real peace is the real attainment of the national rights of
the Palestinian people, which include the right of return,
self-determination and the establishment of the independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. This is the real
peace. And if this is achieved then every Palestinian has to go and
give every Israeli citizen they see a kiss because this will mean
real coexistence. Without this there will be no real peace.
	   Q: Is May 1999 the right time to declare the state?
	   A: I believe yes for one reason: That the agreement set May 4,
1999, as the end of the interim agreement and so with the end of
the interim agreement the world must stand by us so that we can
declare our state and establish its borders and tell the world
there are certain areas of our land still under occupation, and it
is you who are responsible, ethically, historically and legally to
implement your decision regarding the refugees' right of return.

Confident Airbus gambles with new jet to challenge Boeing

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ British wings, German fuselages and
Spanish tail sections are joining here with French cockpits to make
the Airbus jetliners giving Boeing a run for its money.
	   After recent strategic sales coups, most recently breaking
Boeing's grip on British Airways, the European consortium is
talking confidently of deposing the U.S. giant as the world's No. 1
commercial jetmaker.
	   For Airbus, beating Boeing depends on a superjumbo gamble _ the
A3XX, which seats up to 650 people and cost at least dlrs 9 billion
to develop.
	   At the Farnborough International 98 air show in England this
week, Airbus will seek more companies to participate in the project
and spread the risk.
	   There's no scale mockup yet; the air show instead will feature
wind tunnel and other testing. But diagrams show the interior of a
cruise ship, with wide staircases, two decks with rows up to 10
seats across, and lower levels for shopping, a gym and sleeping
quarters.
	   ``We are investing heavily in this program,'' says Philippe
Jarry, Airbus vice president for marketing. He said the company
plans to firm up the plane's design by the end of the year and get
it flying by 2003.
	   Is Airbus sticking its neck out too far? Up to now, it's chipped
away at Boeing's dominance with sales of its A310s, 320s, 330s and
340s. But it has no jumbo jet, and the A3XX is aimed at far
surpassing the 350-seat 747.
	   ``If we're successful in four years with the A3XX, we won't be
limited to 50 percent of the market,'' says Airbus spokesman Alain
Dupiech.
	   There are other ``ifs.''
	   Will Airbus, a four-nation consortium including the state-owned
Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain, be able to restructure
soon into a private stock-issuing company that can raise money for
expansion?
	   Talks are under way between those companies and partners British
Aerospace and Germany's Dasa. For that to happen, said BA President
John Weston in Friday's Le Monde daily, Airbus must ``satisfy
criteria of profitability. ... It's not the case today.''
	   Can Airbus build the A3XX at an attractive price?
	   ``It certainly is a big gamble,'' said Paul Jackson, editor of
the London-based Jane's All The World's Aircraft.
	   While Airbus predicts demand for about 1,400 A3XXs, Boeing
officials ``don't see a market for a bigger plane right now,'' said
Boeing spokesman Craig Martin. But they're keeping a stretch 747 on
the drawing boards, just in case.
	   Past concerns about Airbus' fly-by-wire planes, with a computer
between the pilot and the control of the aircraft, appear to have
evaporated. Boeing stuck with directly linked controls for thrust
and steering until it came out with the 777.
	   But strong Airbus sales confirmed the airline industry's faith
in fly-by-wire _ used in modern military jets _ as lighter and more
fuel-efficient. Airbus claims the A3XX's direct operating cost per
seat will be 15 percent cheaper than that of the 747.
	   Airbus is hoping for 40-percent risk-sharing, and so far, Jarry
said eight European companies and one American firm have signed on
for 30 percent of the program.
	   In addition, 20 airlines from Europe, Asia and the United States
have joined as consultants in the development stage.
	   ``When we said the price would be around dlrs 200 million to
these airlines, they were not surprised,'' Jarry said.
	   The Asian financial crisis ``will go away in say, two years, and
it won't change the fact they need a bigger plane.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Raul Salinas once moved among power and
riches, showing off a Spanish mistress and funneling more than
dlrs132 million out of the country during his brother's
presidential administration.
	   Then his brother left office, and he went into prison more than
3 1/2 years ago and had his bank accounts seized.
	   Now the gregarious big brother of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari is whacking away at charges ranging from
corruption to money laundering to murder.
	   Some people think he may just shake them.
	   Testimony wrapped up last week in his long-running trial on
charges of masterminding the 1994 assassination of a political
rival, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and a verdict is expected this
fall.
	   During a session last month, Salinas said he hoped to be
acquitted ``thanks to God and the evidence.''
	   The prosecution's case was so marred by the witness tampering
and perjury that are rampant in Mexico's troubled legal system that
both supporters and detractors alike say the charges may not stick.
	   At his final court appearance, Salinas threw up his hands and
begged a witness to ``tell the judge how they intimidated you ...
tell the judge, for God's sake!''
	   The witness stuck by his story that the alleged go-between in
Ruiz Massieu's assassination _ Sen. Manuel Munoz Rocha _ had called
Salinas the night of the murder.
	   But other witnesses repeatedly changed their stories during the
trial, which has held periodic sessions since early 1995. Even
Salinas contradicted himself on his relationship with Munoz Rocha,
who disappeared soon after the killing and is now presumed dead.
	   A previous team of prosecutors in the murder case has been
charged itself with torturing witnesses to extract testimony.
	   Meanwhile, prosecutors produced almost no physical evidence in
arguing Salinas ordered the murder of Ruiz Massieu, who was a
former brother-in-law and the No. 2 man in the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   ``We won't present witnesses who would have seen how the killing
was carried out ... or who saw who ordered it,'' prosecutor Jose
Ramos conceded early on.
	   Salinas' brother, who lives in self-imposed exile in Ireland,
has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied any
knowledge of his brother's actions.
	   An acquittal in the murder case won't mean freedom for Salinas,
his lawyers say.
	   ``If Mr. Salinas manages to win an acquittal in the homicide
case, then the government and prosecutors will turn all their guns
on trying for a conviction on money matters,'' lawyer Raul Cardenas
predicted.
	   Salinas sits in the high-security Almoloya prison, guarded by
heavily armed soldiers in the middle of a corn field outside the
capital. He also faces trial for ``illegal enrichment'' _ a
catchall charge that covers such things as taking bribes, aiding
drug traffickers and misusing public funds.
	   Swiss prosecutors who investigated Salinas' foreign bank
accounts said his fortune came from money laundering and drug
bribes, but a Mexican judge dismissed money-laundering charges
earlier this year. Mexican prosecutors never filed any specific
drug-related charges.
	   Salinas denies the illegal enrichment charges, saying he sent
the dlrs 132 million _ part of which he claims belonged to business
associates _ out of Mexico to Swiss bank accounts ``because he
didn't think it was proper to have business dealings in Mexico
while his brother was president,'' said Cardenas, his lawyer.
	   The Mexico attorney general's office says Salinas used at least
four aliases and forged documents to hide extensive real estate and
bank holdings acquired while holding a second-tier post in his
brother's government that paid about dlrs 40,000 a year. He also
used false names to transfer the dlrs 132 million out of the
country, officials say.
	   Although he denies the specific money charges, Salinas himself
has publicly admitted to capitalizing on ``the huge opportunities''
available to him as a sibling of Mexico's president.
	   Salinas has undergone a striking turnabout since his fall.
	   He was peremptory and arrogant when he entered prison in
February 1995, just three months after his brother left the
presidency in disgrace.
	   His hair is completely gray now and during court hearings he
greets reporters from behind the bars with friendly phrases like:
``God bless you, kids.''
	   Authorities have barred journalists from interviewing Salinas,
but he has sent several statements to the news media through his
legal team.
	   ``To date, neither my lawyers nor my family have been able to
see me except from behind glass, behind bars or once a week under
strict observation,'' Salinas said in a message released in August.
	   ``I am allowed a pen and a notebook, which is illegally opened,
photocopied and handed over to third parties, which has allowed the
government to see all my correspondence and defense strategies,''
he added.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore feature designator &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 9th graf that Iraq ``usually'' gives escorts to
monitors. INSERTS 12 graf with comment from official in Baghdad,

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms inspections have been sharply
limited by Saddam Hussein's government, although one group of
inspectors is still busy. But they go only where Iraqi officials
expect them to.
	   These monitors check remote-controlled cameras and sensors at
potential weapons-making sites, making sure nothing has been
tampered with in the surveillance program to ensure Iraq is not
renewing weapons production.
	   The monitoring crews are responsible for inspecting about 300
sites in Baghdad and around the country.
	   ``They are busy,'' said Nils Carlstrom, the inspectors' chief in
Baghdad. ``There are day inspections, night inspections, all the
time.''
	   The routine monitoring goes largely unnoticed because it
involves sites visited dozens of times before, causing some to
question how much the monitoring can really do to prevent Iraq from
secretly resuming arms production.
	   The monitors' work contrasts with the surprise visits to new
sites that are now blocked by Iraq. The last six or seven
disarmament inspectors who do that work left Baghdad on Aug. 8,
three days after Iraq announced it was halting cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections since Iraq's
defeat in the Gulf War.
	   Until the commission declares Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, trade and other sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted. The sanctions have hit
Iraq hard, banning regular sales of its economic mainstay, oil.
	   Saddam's government has long maintained it has destroyed its
weapons systems and its refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors
is meant to force the issue. It halted the inspections by simply
refusing to supply needed Iraqi escorts to U.N. teams.
	   It still usually gives escorts to the monitors who continue
their routine, visiting factories and laboratories and making long
trips by helicopter to remote sites.
	   But even with this work, Iraq's ban affects monitoring, too,
since the monitors cannot pursue leads they might get about
possible weapons activity at new sites, Richard Butler, the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, has complained.
	   Butler said Thursday that Iraq also has challenged the U.N.
monitors on which sites will be considered as having been inspected
before.
	   Caroline Cross, an aide to Carlstrom, said Saturday the monitors
had been refused access to one previously inspected missile site
and not given escorts to visit two other such sites. But she added
that the monitoring mission still was ``pretty much unharmed.''
	   Scott Ritter, the arms inspector who resigned Aug. 26 with
scathing criticism of the United Nations' handling of the
inspections, said Iraq has succeeded in cutting the guts out of the
inspection program.
	   ``There is an illusion of arms control taking place,'' he said.
``Right now we are not doing meaningful inspections in Iraq.''
	   Ritter accused the United Nations _ and the U.S. government _ of
knuckling under and refusing to challenge Iraq for fear of creating
a fizzled confrontation like the one in February when Iraq last
challenged the inspection system.
	   The divided U.N. Security Council _ China opposes U.S. and
British demands for stronger action against Iraq _ has taken no
practical steps to renew the broader inspections.
	   In Baghdad, the U.N. monitors are under orders not to talk to
reporters so details of their work are not public. Carlstrom, a
Swedish major general, defends the monitoring as a valuable part of
the inspection process.
	   He says the monitors keep cameras running that could detect
suspicious items showing up in labs or on assembly lines. The
monitors also can go through filing cabinets and storage boxes to
keep track of what is going on at the various sites.
	   The monitors are dogged in their work. They show up at the
commission's headquarters, a small hotel on Baghdad's outskirts, at
6 a.m. and it is often 10 p.m. by the time they finish.
	   There are no apparent tensions between the monitors and the
Iraqi people. Carlstrom said the monitors are free to move around
Baghdad and at night their cars can be seen parked outside
restaurants in affluent areas.

Anderlecht suffers heaviest league defeat in 61 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's long-time soccer powerhouse
Anderlecht struggled Sunday to come to terms with its heaviest
league defeat since 1937, a 6-0 thrashing by first division
newcomers Westerlo.
	   ``We are all ashamed of this result. The supporters are ashamed.
I hope the players are ashamed,'' said club Chairman Roger Vanden
Stock.
	   The defeat Saturday night leaves the Brussels team second from
the bottom of the first division with two points from four games.
Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times. Westerlo is
enjoying only its second season in the first division.
	   Anderlecht officials blamed the defeat on the injuries to
Belgian internationals Enzo Scifo and Lorenzo Staelens and the
absence of Swedish striker Par Zetterberg, on duty with his
national team.

Report: Murdoch to buy Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction, announcement of Man Utd statement on Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Media magnate Rupert Murdoch was reported Sunday
to have made a 575 million pound (dlrs 950 million) bid to buy
soccer giant Manchester United.
	   According to the Sunday Telegraph, Murdoch has already
negotiated a deal with United chairman Martin Edwards. Edwards, the
paper says, is selling his 14 percent stake in the club for 80
million pounds (dlrs 132 million).
	   Manchester United director Maurice Watkins said Sunday he would
not elaborate on the club's plans but would have something to say
on Monday.
	   ``I certainly don't think we will have any more to say at this
stage,'' he said. ``There is likely to be a more formal statement
sometime tomorrow morning.''
	   Although the reported move was described as pure speculation by
officials of Murdoch's satellite TV company BSkyB, the prospect of
his buying one of the world's most famous and financially
successful clubs would make a huge impact on soccer business in
Britain.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain with very few live games being shown on regular
terrestrial stations on the BBC and ITV. Sky also has exclusive
rights to cover England's games such as Saturday's European
Championship qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   Tim Allen, BSkyB's director of corporate communications, told
Sky News: ``The reports are speculation, but it's understood there
have been negotiations.''
	   The sale of England's wealthiest club, which was floated on the
stock market in 1991, to BSkyB could give the broadcasting company
a stranglehold on the television and marketing rights to Premier
League football.
	   Manchester United's own television network called `MU TV' is
preparing to launch later this week and, if the a sale to Murdoch
went through, it is likely that the only way of seeing the team
play would be through pay-per-view TV.
	   Although United has a 55,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford,
almost all the seats go to season ticket holders and the waiting
list for the few that become available is several years long.
	   Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty, who has been an
outspoken critic of the way the club has been run while remaining a
fan of the team, said the supporters would never forgive chairman
and chief executive Edwards if he did sell out to Murdoch.
	   ``Once Murdoch gets hold of the club he will no longer have to
negotiate with the Premier League over the introduction of
pay-per-view,'' Docherty said.
	   ``I don't think he will stop there, I think he might try to get
hold of another couple of top clubs yet.
	   ``Everything will be geared towards television, there will be no
fans sitting in the stands, they will all behind glass entertaining
their business clients.
	   ``The game has already moved away from the true fans and this
type of thing just dilutes the passion even more,'' Docherty said.
	   ``If this deal goes through I would no longer support the club
because from a football point of view it just wouldn't be the same.
	   ``Martin Edwards is not a football man and never has been. He
has already made a lot of money selling shares and good luck to him
but I don't think the fans would ever forgive for selling out to
Murdoch,'' the former manager said.
	   ``That club is worth 1 billion (pounds) and for Murdoch to get
his hands on it would be like winning the Lottery.''
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Searchers have detected signals coming
from one of Swissair Flight 111's missing recorders, but
preliminary dives failed to locate it under the sea, officials
said. Search commanders said Saturday that a Canadian submarine had
detected signals coming from one of the recorders. The recorders
could provide clues into the cause of the crash late Wednesday that
killed all 229 people aboard. Divers working at a depth of 190 feet
(58 meters) tried to pinpoint the location but were hindered by
limited visibility. They planned to resume the search on Sunday.
Onshore, relatives of the crash's victims sent wreaths out to sea
Saturday and carried away jars of water from the ocean where their
loved ones died. (CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to agree on
forming a new government to handle Russia's burgeoning economic
crisis, his press service confirmed. Yeltsin proposed the meeting
on Friday, prompting lawmakers to postpone a second vote on
confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The
Communist-dominated parliament has already rejected Chernomyrdin

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi rejected the
terms of an American and British offer to try two Libyan suspects
in the Pan Am bombing case in the Netherlands, but a Scottish
defense lawyer suggested he was simply bargaining. In a speech late
Saturday, Gadhafi accused the United States and Britain of trying
to use the Netherlands as ``a transit point'' in the case and
demanded guarantees that the suspects would not leave the
Netherlands if convicted. The offer calls for the trial of the two
Libyans _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ in
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would be transferred to
Britain to serve their time, according to the deal. The 1988
bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270
people. (LIBYA)
	   BEIJING _ Greeted by appeals from dissidents to free a jailed
colleague and end detentions without trial, U.N. human rights chief
Mary Robinson arrived in China Sunday on a groundbreaking mission.
In an indication of the hopes China's persecuted dissidents place
on the first ever visit by a U.N. high commissioner for human
rights, activists sent open letters seeking Robinson's help in
curbing police powers and demanding their rights to form political
parties. Whether Robinson can urge human rights improvements
without alienating leaders from the ruling Communist Party will be
a major test of her 10-day trip. She and Chinese leaders plan to
sign an agreement on future cooperation, hoping to dispel the
confrontation that has marked relations between Beijing and her
office. (CHINA-UN-RIGHTS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, the internationally acclaimed
director awarded a special Oscar for his half-century career in
filmmaking, died at his home Sunday, a spokesman for his production
company said. He was 88. Kurosawa's films included epics such as
``The Seven Samurai'' and the Oscar-winning ``Rashomon,'' the first
Japanese film to win an international award. His work inspired a
generation of directors both in Japan and in the United States. The
director died early Sunday afternoon in his Tokyo home, said Toru
Tanaka an official of Kurosawa Film Production. The cause of death
was not immediately known. Kurosawa, known as ``The Emperor'' for
his perfectionism and extravagance, was one of the few Japanese
directors to find fame on international screens.

Rossi takes 250-cc race, Harada finishes tenth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with 500-cc race &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   IMOLA, Italy (AP) _ Italian teammates Valentino Rossi and Loris
Capirossi on Sunday gave Aprilia a 1-2 triumph at the home circuit
in the 250-cc race of the City of Imola Grand Prix.
	   Japan's Tetsuya Harada, braving a left ankle fracture and a
mid-race spill, finished tenth and held a commanding lead in the
world championship standings, with 180 points, 12 ahead of
Capirossi.
	   Harada, injured in a fall during Saturday's practice, skidded
off the track at the Variante Bassa corner while dueling with Rossi
for first place in the 11th event of the world competition.
	   Unrestrained by pain and anger, Harada grabbed his undamaged
Aprilia, resumed racing and set the fastest lap on his way to tenth
place, 39.5 seconds behind the winner.
	   Rossi, a former 125-cc world champion, captured his second
career victory in the upper class on his first season in the
250-cc.
	   ``It was a special victory, because it came at an Italian
track,'' Rossi said. ``I knew Harada was not at 100 percent and
that he could have some problems in the race. I'm happy with my
victory, not with his spill.''
	   Rossi, who had scored his previous victory in the Dutch GP at
Assen, completed the 23-lap race at the Enzo and Dino Ferrari
circuit of Imola in 43 minutes. 43.815 seconds.
	   Capirossi, recovering from a slow start which initially
relegated him to tenth place, finished second with a gap of 2.6
seconds.
	   Italy's Stefano Perugini, riding a Honda, placed third, 4.1
seconds behind, for an all-Italian podium.
	   Honda teammates Tohru Ukawa of Japan and Olivier Jacque of
France placed fourth and fifth respectively.
	   Japan's Tomomi Manako led from start to finish on his Honda to
win the 125-cc class race ahead of Italian rising teenage star
Marco Melandri.
	   Melandri, also on a Honda, tried to overtake Manako at the very
last corner but the Japanese rider fought off the attack and edged
the 16-year-old rival by 0.08 seconds at the finish line.
	   Manako won the 21-lap race in 42 minutes, 5.831 seconds.
	   Two other Japanese riders, Masao Azuma on a Honda and Kazuto
Sakata on a Aprilia, finished third and fourth respectively.
	   Sakata held a commanding lead in the championship with 198
points, compared with Melandri's 158. Manako was third, with 147.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin message to European finance
ministers, one candidate saying he doesn't want prime minister's
job. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to agree on
forming a new government to handle Russia's burgeoning economic
crisis, his press service confirmed.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communist-dominated parliament has already
rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said Sunday that he would hold talks
Monday with eight members of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, eight members of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Communist deputy speaker of the Duma appealed to all sides
to reach an agreement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Svetlana Goryacheva urged opposition lawmakers to ``brush aside
ambitions, think of Russia's future and conclude an agreement with
the authorities.''
	   She said that many lawmakers ``have utterly forgotten about
Russia and become entangled in political games and lengthy
discussions.''
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. Chernomyrdin held the job for five years before
being fired in March and rehired Aug. 23 as Russia's economy went
into a tailspin.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   Chernomyrdin sent a message Sunday to the finance ministers of
Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help of
the international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``I want to stress that in the process of deep economic
transformation, we are seeking active relations with our partners
in the G-8 and international financial organizations,''
Chernomyrdin said. ``We value their attention and aid.''
	   Chernomyrdin's letter was a response to Britain's decision to
call an emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.
	   The Communists and their hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin for creating Russia's current predicament. On Saturday
they said they had as many as nine alternatives for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats and the
speaker of the Federation Council, Yegor Stroyev.
	   The State Duma is scheduled to consider the matter again Monday,
after meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Stroyev told reporters Sunday that he doesn't want the job.
	   ``I'm personally interested in pulling the country out of the
crisis and it is necessary to delect a candidate of accord to
implement this idea,'' Stroyev said.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Federation Council passed a non-binding motion on Friday
endorsing Chernomyrdin, putting pressure on the Duma to confirm his
appointment.
	   But the governor of the Samara region, chairman of the Council's
budget committee, said Sunday that Chernomyrdin ``cannot lead the
country out of the crisis, whoever joins his Cabinet.''
	   Konstantin Titov told Interfax that Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor
and one of the opposition's proposed candidates for prime minister,
was someone who ``can consolidate the nation.''

Authorities hunt for convict who held policeman hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities launched a manhunt Sunday for
a Romanian convict who held a police officer hostage for almost
eight hours before releasing him and fleeing in a taxi.
	   The man, identified as Sorin Matei, 27, grabbed police officer
Thanassis Krystaloyiannis, whose age was not released, in central
Athens on Saturday afternoon after threatening him with a hand
grenade during a police operation to arrest a group of Romanians
accused of armed robbery. Police have described Matei as ``a very
dangerous criminal.''
	   The other three suspects were arrested, police said.
	   Matei then stole a car and, using the officer's service
revolver, forced Krystaloyiannis to drive to a remote area in the
city's northern suburbs.
	   Special police forces cordoned off the area but were unable to
intervene as the man had reportedly pulled the pin on the hand
grenade and was also threatening to shoot Krystaloyiannis.
	   Following about six hours of negotiations, during which Matei
fired twice into the air, authorities allowed him to leave, still
holding Krystaloyiannis at gunpoint. His sole demand had been to be
allowed to escape, authorities said.
	   The standoff was broadcast live by at least three national
television stations.
	   Matei released the police officer in Athens' port of Piraeus,
just south of the capital, early Sunday and fled in a taxi,
Krystaloyiannis said.
	   Police believe the man was acting under the influence of drugs,
and say his behavior became erratic when he apparently began
suffering withdrawal symptoms after a few hours.
	   Matei was reportedly serving an 18-year prison sentence but
managed to escape from custody in the southern Greek port of
Patras. No date was given for his escape. He has been convicted of
various offenses, including drug charges, armed robbery and
burglary, police said.

Report: Group allegedly spying for Israel arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ More than 20 people, including a woman,
have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, a Beirut
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Ad Diyar newspaper said the arrests followed a security sweep
carried out by the Lebanese army in the neighborhood of Chiyeh in
Beirut's southern suburbs in the past few days.
	   The suspects were providing a Cyprus-based branch of the Israeli
intelligence service, Mossad, with information, the paper said,
quoting unidentified ``informed sources.''
	   It did not say what kind of information the suspects allegedly
gave to Mossad.
	   The network was uncovered based on information from a Lebanese
suspected of being a spy for Israel and of helping Israeli troops
in the assassination of a guerrilla leader in south Lebanon last
month, the paper said.
	   Hossam al-Amin, a commander of the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal
guerrilla movement, was killed when a missile fired from an Israeli
attack helicopter struck his car in south Lebanon.
	   The paper's report could not immediately be confirmed by
security officials. The latest arrests were believed to be separate
from a spy ring that the government said it uncovered on July 8.
	   Then, Lebanon accused 77 people of passing information to Israel
on Lebanese and Syrian troop movements and the activities of
Lebanese guerrillas. At the time, officials said 17 of the suspects
were under arrest and the remaining 60 were at large.
	   Government Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud said the 77 faced charges for
``the crimes of contacting the Israeli enemy and its agents'' and
passing information to them. If convicted, the suspects could face
the death penalty.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids
contacts with the Jewish state.

Spain's Clemente under fresh pressure to resign after loss to
</HEADLINE>
Cyprus &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Coach Javier Clemente faced a renewed
chorus of calls to resign Sunday after Spain suffered a humiliating
3-2 defeat to a Cyprus team made up mostly of bank clerks and
electricians.
	   ``Get out of here!'' screamed the front page of the sports daily
El Mundo Deportivo.
	   A close-up of a hand giving the thumbs-down sign, and pointing
at Clemente's name, filled the front page of another sports
newspaper, Marca.
	   El Pais called the loss Saturday night in Larnaca in a
qualifying round for European Championship in 2000 the most
embarrassing defeat in the history of Spanish soccer.
	   But Clemente remained defiant.
	   Already in hot water over highly-rated Spain's dismal
performance in the World Cup, where it failed to get past the first
round, Clemente insisted after Saturday's match that he would not
step down.
	   ``Resign? Absolutely not. I have a lot of confidence in
myself,'' he told a raucous post-game news conference.
	   The head of the Spanish soccer federation, Angel Villar, also
said he was sticking with Clemente.
	   Spanish newspapers were quick to point out that the
dragon-slaying Cypriot team had only four professional players, who
compete in the Greek league. The rest work for the Cypriot national
telephone company, or as electricians, or in banks. The coach is a
police inspector.
	   In an opinion piece entitled ``Time for a Change,'' El Pais was
merciless in its criticism of Clemente.
	   ``As a national coach he is finished, and vulnerable to
disasters like what happened in Cyprus. At the current time he has
none of the qualities needed to generate an atmosphere of optimism
or lead any kind of program in Spanish football.''

Report: Taiwan to build heavy patrol boats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's navy will build between 6 and 10
heavy patrol boats, possibly basing them on a foreign design, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The boats, to weigh between 1,500 and 2,000 tons, will replace
aging craft now in use, but their design, armaments and other
features have yet to be decided, the United Daily News said,
quoting navy sources.
	   Designs from boatyards in the United States, France, Germany,
Spain and Italy are now being considered, with plans calling for
the purchase of one foreign boat to be used as a pattern for later
models built by a Taiwanese yard, the report said.
	   Military spokesmen were unavailable for comment.
	   The reported plan comes amid a general upgrading of the navy.
	   Taiwan has ordered six advanced Lafayette class frigates from
France, leased six Knox-class frigates from the United States, and
is building seven frigates based on the U.S. Perry class.
	   It is also developing a fleet of fast missile boats that will
use concealed compartments and angled hulls similar to those on the
Lafayette class frigates to deflect and confuse radar.

Spain's Clemente under fresh pressure to resign after loss to
</HEADLINE>
Cyprus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Coach Javier Clemente faced a renewed
chorus of calls to resign Sunday after Spain suffered a humiliating
3-2 defeat to a Cyprus team made up mostly of bank clerks and
electricians.
	   ``Get out of here!'' screamed the front page of the sports daily
El Mundo Deportivo.
	   A close-up of a hand giving the thumbs-down sign, and pointing
at Clemente's name, filled the front page of another sports
newspaper, Marca.
	   El Pais called the loss Saturday night in Larnaca in a
qualifying round for the European Championship in 2000 the most
embarrassing defeat in the history of Spanish soccer.
	   But Clemente remained defiant.
	   Already in hot water over highly-rated Spain's dismal
performance in the World Cup, where it failed to get past the first
round, Clemente insisted after Saturday's match that he would not
step down.
	   ``Resign? Absolutely not. I have a lot of confidence in
myself,'' he said at a raucous post-game news conference.
	   The head of the Spanish soccer federation, Angel Villar, also
said he was sticking with Clemente.
	   Spanish newspapers were quick to point out that the
dragon-slaying Cypriot team had only four professional players, who
compete in the Greek league. The rest work for the Cypriot national
telephone company, or as electricians, or in banks. The coach is a
police inspector.
	   In an opinion piece entitled ``Time for a Change,'' El Pais was
merciless in its criticism of Clemente.
	   ``As a national coach he is finished, and vulnerable to
disasters like what happened in Cyprus. At the current time he has
none of the qualities needed to generate an atmosphere of optimism
or lead any kind of program in Spanish football.''

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestant leader of
Northern Ireland's new assembly said Sunday he will not shake hands
with Gerry Adams, president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, in
their first one-on-one meeting this week.
	   But Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, First Minister in the
new assembly provided for in the peace agreement in this British
province, said he was confident the Irish Republican Army now faces
surrendering its weapons quickly or being exposed as a holdout.
	   ``There is a point about hands being held out open to show they
are not containing any weapons, but Mr. Adams cannot do that,''
Trimble said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   He added that the recent appointment of Adams' deputy, Martin
McGuinness, to liaise with an official commission on surrendering
weapons put the IRA and other anti-British movements ``on to a
conveyor belt which will lead to actual decommissioning or it will
be very clear, very quickly that they are refusing.''
	   On Saturday, the 110-member Ulster Unionist executive committee
indicated approval _ without a vote _ for Trimble to meet Adams.
	   Trimble had already invited all the party leaders in the
assembly, including Adams, to a meeting on Monday. But the
one-on-one encounter with Adams later in the week shapes up as
hugely significant historically and a new step in the peace
process.
	   Meanwhile, a policeman was hospitalized with critical head
injuries and another one was less seriously hurt in clashes
Saturday between Protestants and Catholics in Portadown, 25 miles
(40 kms) from Belfast.
	   The clashes, involving up to 700 people at the peak, erupted
while U.S. President Clinton wound up a visit to both parts of
Ireland and hailed the peace agreement as an example to the rest of
the world.
	   In Portadown, police were attacked with gasoline bombs after
separating opposing factions before a Protestant parade. A
Catholic-owned bedding store was burned down and another
Catholic-owned business damaged.
	   In a raid Saturday night on a shed in a blue-collar Protestant
district of Portadown, Corcraine, police seized gasoline, bottles,
sugar and rags _ ingredients for making more bombs.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The European Union governments said
Sunday they are ready to help Russia out of its financial and
economic crisis but offered no fresh money or even a reprieve on
its debt repayments. They urged money lenders to be kind to Moscow
and amend their loan criteria.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the EU foreign ministers urged Moscow
to stay the course on economic reforms and not ``revert to a
command economy.''
	   ``We see a continued reform process as an expression of Russia's
commitment to democracy and market economy and the integration into
the world economy,'' the statement said. ``The responsibilities for
these reforms lies with Russia.''
	   The statement underscored the EU's wish to help Moscow
financially through aid programs of the EU itself and the
International Monetary Fund and other international institutions.
``We stand ready to cooperate further with the Russian authorities
in support of sustained efforts towards stabilization and reform,''
it said.
	   The ministers urged money lenders like the IMF to show some
heart and be generous, especially in the case of Russia whose
economic and financial collapse severely impacts on the average
Russian.
	   ``Against this background the existing programs of the
international financial institutions should be reviewed,'' said the
statement, criticizing the conditions the IMF and others want to
see fullfilled before they open their wallets to those in need.
	   The EU statement made no mention of a moratorium on Russia's
debts or even a rescheduling of repayments.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Saturday such a
possibility ``was inevitable,'' but German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel ruled out a reprieve for cash-strapped Russia.

Estrada orders probe of reported killings of Filipino workers
</HEADLINE>
abroad &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has ordered
an investigation of reports that a number of Filipinos working
abroad were killed for their internal organs, which were then sold,
officials said Sunday.
	   At least two such killings of Filipino workers occurred recently
in a foreign country, press undersecretary Icasiano Gutierrez said.
The country's name was not disclosed.
	   Estrada strongly condemned the killings.
	   Gutierrez said a syndicate has recruited workers in impoverished
Philippine rural areas and sent them abroad, where they were
drugged and killed. The workers' internal organs then were sold to
medical schools, hospitals or patients needing organ transplants,
he said.
	   The murdered workers were reported either as missing or having
committed suicide.
	   The killings were discovered by William Gatchalian, Estrada's
aide looking into problems of Filipino workers abroad.
	   A report by Gatchalian on two recent killings would be the
starting point of a government investigation, Gutierrez said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos have escaped poverty and
unemployment in the Philippines by working abroad, mostly as
domestic help or construction workers.
	   Estrada, a former movie star who won the May 11 elections on a
pro-poor platform, has pledged to allocate more government
resources to create jobs and ensure adequate food for poor
Filipinos.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The French car company Peugeot will invest
dlrs 37.5 million in building a factory to produce car engines in
the free zone at Ismailiya, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of
Cairo.
	   The governor of Ismailiya, Abdel-Aziz Salameh, was quoted by the
Al-Hayat newspaper on Sunday as saying the project will create
3,000 new jobs.
	   A recent study by the Arab Organization for Industrial
Development said there were 14 car manufacturing factories in Egypt
with invested capital of dlrs 2.6 billion and production capacity
of 100,000 cars a year.
	   The study predicts that Egyptians will buy 110,000 a year by the
year 2000.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ More than 100 Jordanian firms will
participate in a trade fair in Iraq next month, underlining growing
interest in the Iraqi market, an official said Sunday.
	   Farouk Haddidi, director of the Jordan Export Development and
Commercial Centers Federation, said the firms will display
industrial products, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals at the 10-day
Baghdad International Trade Fair which opens Oct. 1.
	   ``It is rare to see such a considerable number of firms
participating in a trade fair,'' he said. ``We hope we will be able
to hike Jordanian exports to this important market.''
	   Iraq's trade with Jordan amounted to more than dlrs 1 billion a
year before the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
ensuing Gulf War. Trade has since dwindled to dlrs 220 million a
year primarily because of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after the
invasion.
	   The sanctions include a ban on oil exports, the country's
economic mainstay. But the United Nations has allowed partial Iraqi
oil sales in the last two years to help Baghdad purchase food and
medicine.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Japan has granted Jordan 7.4 billion yen
(dlrs 63 million) to rehabilitate a water treatment plant and
double water supply to the capital, the Japanese Embassy said
Sunday.
	   The donation follows dlrs 11.3 million that Tokyo dispersed in
May to the northwestern Zai water treatment plant, one of Amman's
main sources of drinking water.
	   Amman is home to 40 percent of the country's 3.8 million
population. A Japanese Embassy statement said the latest grant was
agreed upon Saturday.
	   It said the money will be used to restore four pumping stations
linking Zai with water wells in Deir Alla farther north, doubling
to 90 million cubic meters (3.2 billion cubic feet) the annual
water supply to Amman in the year 2002.
	   The grant also envisages dispatching Jordanian water officials
to Japan for training, the statement added. The grant brings total
Japanese donations to Jordan's water sector since 1995 to dlrs 150
million.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain-based Gulf Air signed an
agreement Sunday with Morocco's Royal Air Maroc to enable the two
Arab carriers to jointly operate direct flights between the Gulf
and North Africa.
	   The ``code sharing agreement,'' the first of its kind among Arab
carriers, will result in three weekly flights operated jointly by
the two airlines between Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and
Casablanca, Morocco, said a Gulf Air statement.
	   According to the agreement, the companies will share the profit
or losses of the joint flights.
	   Gulf air is equally owned by the governments of Bahrain, Abu
Dhabi, Qatar and Oman. Air Maroc is 94 percent owned by the
Moroccan government, with the remaining shares held by investors.

Thailand's first female crocodile tamer can't escape fame

<TEXT>
	   SRIRACHA, Thailand (AP) _ Bored with the life of a food vendor,
a young Thai woman decided last year to tackle a bigger challenge _
taming crocodiles.
	   Duangduen Pongpetch, 19, is now the country's first female
crocodile tamer.
	   Her employer, the Sriracha Tiger Zoo and Crocodile Farm, held a
coming-out party for her and her charges Saturday, serving
reporters and other guests a feast that included barbecued
crocodile meat on skewers. Char-broiled scorpions were a side dish.
	   Duangduen, from Sisaket province in Thailand's poor northeast,
applied for the job at the private zoo in Chonburi province, 70
kilometers (44 miles) southeast of Bangkok, after several months of
observing a male crocodile tamer at work while she was selling food
and drinks to visitors.
	   She then took a 15-day training course before holding her first
show.
	   Even after she got the job seven months ago, she kept her new
career a secret from her family, fearing opposition.
	   But she couldn't keep it secret for long. Becoming Thailand's
first female crocodile tamer put her on the front pages of the
country's newspapers.
	   There were no objections from her family when they realized she
was a rising star with more income she could send home. Her salary
for the dangerous work is 5,000 baht (dlrs 125) a month.
	   Duangduen starts each show with a traditional ``Wai Kru''
ceremony to pay respects to the teachers of the taming trade,
dancing around a crocodile with a pike in her hand.
	   Small but muscular, the 50-kilogram (110-pound) woman then pulls
a 200-kilogram (440-pound) tame crocodile out of a knee-deep pond.
	   Duangduen uses a small wooden stick to poke different parts of
the reptile's body to relay her orders.
	   She gleams with pride while lying down on the reptile's back.
	   But the most applauded part of each show is when she waves and
smiles while putting her head between the reptile's mighty jaws.
	   A fading scar above her left eyebrow is a reminder of a mistake
she made during this part of the show several months ago.
	   The crocodile unexpectedly closed its mouth, and while Duangduen
also moved quickly, one tooth scratched her forehead.
	   ``That experience made me more aware of how fast their jaws are
and I now must practice to be faster,'' Duangduen told The
Associated Press after Saturday's afternoon show.
	   Nonetheless, the more time she spends with the reptiles, the
more she likes them, she says.
	   Sompong Temsiriphong, managing director of the zoo, says having
a woman crocodile tamer has attracted more visitors.
	   ``People are used to seeing a man with crocodiles, so they
praise her bravery in taking the job,'' he said.
	   Another woman now shares the six daily shows with Duangduen.
Waewjai Salangam, 24, the wife of a trainer at the zoo, took the
job after witnessing Duangduen's success.
	   ``We expect more women to join this career,'' said Sompong.
``The job is not as dangerous as people think because all the
reptiles on show have been tamed for years. The girls need only be
brave.''
	   The really nasty crocodiles, he said, go straight to the head of
the queue for the slaughterhouse.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, says that the country will not enter into a military
confrontation with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, the Tehran Times
reported Sunday.
	   The statement came amid concerns in the U.S. intelligence
community that Iran was poised for an incursion into Afghanistan.
Iran last week massed troops and equipment on the border for
military exercises.
	   Iran also has warned the Taliban religious army that it would
take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of Iranians believed
held captive by the militia.
	   The English-language Tehran Times quoted Khamenei's comments
from a question-and-answer session last Thursday at Teachers
Training University.
	   He said he was ``personally following the developments of Iran
related to Afghanistan'' and ``assured that there will be no
confrontation with the Taliban,'' the paper said.
	   The paper did not say why there was a delay in reporting the
comments of Khamenei, who also is commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians, including 11
diplomats and a journalist from the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the diplomats, and
Iranian officials fear they may have been killed.
	   The Afghan militia acknowledged holding some Iranian truck
drivers, and on Thursday freed five of them. They arrived in Tehran
on Sunday, IRNA reported.
	   The drivers, who were received at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport by
their families and officials from the Foreign Ministry, said they
were held in the southern city of Kandahar along with several dozen
other Iranians.
	   The freed drivers said they had no information about the
diplomats or the IRNA correspondent.
	   The missing Iranian diplomats were working at the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif when the city was overrun by the
Taliban.
	   The Taliban released the five drivers as a goodwill gesture. But
Iran has said this was insufficient and warned the militia Saturday
that it would take unspecified steps if the remaining Iranians were
not freed.
	   A political commentary on state-run Tehran radio on Sunday
criticized the United States for calling on Iran to show restraint
toward Afghanistan.
	   ``The Taliban's treatment of the citizens of Iran and the
silence of international forums on the issue shows that Tehran has
suffered political damage and a blow to its prestige even before
resorting to military action to defend its rights,'' the broadcast
said.
	   It added that ``Iran is prepared to defend strongly what its
national interest requires it to do,'' but did not say what this
involved.
	   Iran carried out military maneuvers on its border with
Afghanistan last week in which 70,000 troops, more than 150 tanks
and squadrons of fighter planes were involved. Tehran has said the
forces will remain in the area.

Singapore PM worries about youth not reading Chinese newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Young, bilingual Singaporeans are not reading
the republic's main Chinese newspaper, although they do watch
Mandarin television programs and movies, Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said Sunday.
	   ``Newspapers are an important vehicle for transmitting cultural
values,'' Goh said in a speech celebrating the 75th anniversary of
Lianhe Zaobao, Singapore's main Chinese daily.
	   He said, ``Failure to reach out to this younger generation will
result in lower readership, and over time, render Zaobao less
influential.''
	   ``The task is particularly important today given our openness,
and the fact that the young have so many distractions and
alternative media to get information from,'' Goh said.
	   Singapore's newspapers are controlled by the government, and Goh
said the editors ``must constantly explore novel ways'' of reaching
out to young Chinese-speakers and find out what will make them read
the paper.
	   He said it was disconcerting that a Hong Kong University survey
in July found that teen-agers there perceive Chinese culture to be
inferior to Western culture.
	   ``It would be a sad day if similar results were thrown up in a
survey of Singapore youth,'' Goh said.
	   Despite the loss of the young, the readership of Singapore's
Chinese papers is growing, Goh said. Lianhe Zaobao has a readership
of more than 800,000, he said, and its online edition gets 26
million hits per month, mostly from the United States and China.
	   Singapore's population of about 3.1 million is more than 77
percent Chinese.

Prime minister pledges to bring back failed businessman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard promised
Sunday to ``leave no stone unturned'' in the hunt for Christopher
Skase following reports the Australian fugitive businessman had
managed to avoid being thrown out of Spain.
	   Opposition justice spokesman Nick Bolkus said reports that
Skase's new Spanish visa was legal, allowing him to launch a new
bid for permanent residency, showed the Australian government was
not serious about bringing Skase back to Australia to face trial.
	   Bolkus said Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone had politicized the
chase for Skase, but the failed businessman remained secure in
Spain.
	   But Howard insisted the government had not abandoned hope of
bringing Skase, 49, back to Australia.
	   ``We'll continue to pursue it,'' Howard told a television
current affairs show Sunday. ``The government will leave no stone
unturned to get Skase back to this country to face Australian
justice.''
	   Howard said it was an outrage that Skase was allowed to get away
in the first place.
	   ``But we'll bend every effort to get him back.''
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
Mallorca, Spain, where he fled after being charged in 1992 in
connection with the 1.5 billion Australian dollar (U.S. dlrs 930
million) collapse of his Qintex group of companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was too ill to return to Australia.

With EU-Foreign Ministers-Russia Text

 &UR; If Moscow was hoping for more EU money, it was disappointed &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) - If Moscow was hoping for more financial
help from the European Union to ease the Russian economic crisis,
Sunday's meeting of EU foreign ministers could only have been a big
disappointment.
	   If the Russian leadership thought a little debt relief might be
on the horizon, that dream was dealt a cruel blow as well.
	   But if President Boris Yeltsin and his future prime minister,
whoever that may be, can be satisfied with words of encouragement
and the possibility of more financial aid somewhere down the line,
then the two-day gathering of EU foreign ministers in the
birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wasn't so bad.
	   The 15-nation EU, made up of some of the world's richest
countries, concluded that economic stability will come to Russia
only after serious political reform, and only the Russians
themselves can achieve that.
	   ``We trust that Russia will not revert to a command economy but
proceed along the path of structural reforms in order to establish
a social market economy,'' the ministers said in a statement,
adding: ``We stand ready to cooperate further with the Russian
authorities in support of sustained efforts toward stabilization
and reform.''
	   EU countries are making a large contribution to the Russian
economy through such international organizations as the
International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. And European commercial banks have
extended billions of dollars in loans.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine says the West has to
realize just how far back the Russians are starting.
	   ``When you think about Russia today, you can't compare it to the
Western economies of the 1990s,'' he said. ``You have to think
rather in terms of the 1950s.''
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who chaired the
Salzburg meeting, said the prospects were gloomy.
	   ``The gross domestic product in Russia is that of Namibia or
lower,'' he said. ``Pensioners face the prospect of hyperinflation.
Workers are facing huge wage arrears.''
	   Also of concern, he said, is the spillover effect into other
East European nations.
	   ``There was a 40 percent drop in the Hungarian stock market in
the past week. Some of these countries are in a very precarious
position.''
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini suggested Russia might be
offered some rescheduling of its debt repayments, saying such a
move was ``inevitable.'' But German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
torpedoed the idea.
	   ``We must do all we can to think about how we can help Russia
through these difficult times, but we must not rush into a debt
moratorium,'' he said.
	   Kinkel has to look out for German banks, which have loaned
Russia about dlrs 30 billion, most of it government guaranteed. He
said if Moscow wants continued German support for such loans, the
debts have to be repaid.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called a meeting this week
of senior officials from the G-7 nations - the United States,
Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and Britain - to discuss how
to help Russia. Nobody is willing to say what kind of help might
emerge there, but debt is certain to come up.
	   Joyce Quin, Britain's deputy foreign secretary, emphasized the
``real sense of social solidarity with the Russians.'' This, she
said, was emphasized in the declaration's call for international
institutions to review their programs, taking the Russian social
context into consideration.
	   In the end, the EU did what it usually does. It decided to send
a delegation to the scene to assess the situation and report back.

Egypt again halts work on controversial highway near pyramids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has again halted work on a
controversial highway running near the Great Pyramids at Giza until
international archaeological experts can be consulted, Al-Akhbar
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The paper quoted Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury as saying that
Egypt would invite experts from the Paris-headquartered U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to consult on the
highway's path.
	   Construction first was halted in 1994, and the following year
Egypt announced that it had reached an agreement with UNESCO to
reroute it around the pyramids, but details remained to be worked
out.
	   Construction on other parts of the 100-kilometer (60 mile)
highway _ a ring road around Cairo _ has continued, but work again
was approaching the Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus pyramids.
	   UNESCO is involved because the pyramids plateau is a U.N. World
Heritage Site.
	   ``This is a clear decision by the prime minister, that no one
can build anything in that area,'' Zahi Hawass, director of
antiquities for the Giza pyramids, told The Associated Press.
	   Hawass said that the Construction Ministry had proposed a tunnel
to carry traffic past the pyramids' area, but that this was
rejected by el-Ganzoury and President Hosni Mubarak.
	   ``UNESCO is supposed to come and do an assessment of the
situation,'' Hawass said. ``We are waiting for UNESCO and the
Egyptian government to reach a solution for the ring road.''
	   UNESCO had opposed the initial design for the road, saying that
pollution from auto exhaust and vibrations from traffic could
damage the 4,500-year-old pyramids.
	   Along with the Sphinx, they are the only survivors of the seven
wonders of the ancient world.
	   There also is fear that development will follow the highway,
bring more traffic to the area.
	   Construction on the highway began in 1985. It is designed to
divert trucks and automobiles around the capital, Cairo.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers have detected signals
coming from one of Swissair Flight 111's missing recorders, but
preliminary dives failed to locate it under the sea, officials
said.
	   Search commanders said Saturday that a Canadian submarine had
detected signals coming from one of the recorders. The recorders
could provide clues into the cause of the crash late Wednesday that
killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Divers working at a depth of 190 feet (58 meters) tried to
pinpoint the location, but were hindered by limited visibility and
planned to resume the hunt Sunday.
	   The searchers also said sonar probes had detected a cylindrical
object, about 30 feet (9 meters) long, on the seabed. Whether it
was part of the fuselage or just a rock remained to be determined,
navy Capt. Phil Webster said.
	   Relatives of the victims sent wreaths out to sea Saturday and
carried away jars of water from the ocean where their loved ones
died.
	   Also Saturday, crash investigators released excerpts from the
final conversation between the plane's pilots and air traffic
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the
crash, then spent 10 minutes getting directions for a rapid descent
from 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) and for dumping fuel into the
ocean before heading toward an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   The plane made two sharp turns, then communications ceased six
minutes before the plane hit the water. The crew's last words were:
``We are declaring an emergency ... we have to land immediately.''
	   ``All of the conversations were very professional,'' said Vic
Gerden, the chief crash investigator. Communications became less
clear in the last stages, suggesting that the pilots may have
donned oxygen masks that affected their speech, he said.
	   Gerden said the aircraft was about 30 tons overweight for a safe
landing, and needed about 12 minutes of flying to rid itself of
excess fuel. Landing so heavily could have forced the aircraft off
the runway, he said.
	   Using information from Canadian authorities, Swissair
reconstructed the final phase of the flight in a simulator, the
chief executive of Swissair's parent company said in Zurich on
Sunday.
	   Flight 111 couldn't have made a direct approach to Halifax from
the point where it made its first trouble call because it was
flying too high and was too heavy, SAirGroup CEO Philippe
Bruggisser said.
	   The trouble call was made 70 miles (112 kilometers) out of
Halifax, but the pilots would have needed 130 miles (210
kilometers) to make a direct landing, Swissair designated chief
pilot Rainer Hiltebrand said at the news conference where
Bruggisser also spoke.
	   One point in the published radio conversation was unclear,
according to chief MD-11 pilot Christian Stuessi.
	   ``We are starting vent now'' could have meant either that the
plane was starting to dump fuel or that the pilots were opening the
cockpit windows for ventilation, he said.
	   The first group of relatives to return from Halifax arrived in
Geneva Sunday morning aboard an Airbus A-313, Bruggisser said.
There were 74 people on the special flight, including grief
counselors.
	   Also, Bruggisser confirmed that memorial services will take
place Friday in New York, Geneva and Zurich. Places and times
weren't set yet.
	   More than 300 family members have flown to Halifax from New
York, the plane's starting point, and Geneva, its intended
destination.
	   Most of them were driven in chartered buses Saturday to Peggy's
Cove, the tiny, picturesque fishing village near the ocean crash
site that has become the base for the search operation.
	   Police and soldiers kept a large media contingent well away from
the area cordoned off for the mourners, and only a few agreed to
speak with journalists.
	   One of them was Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California,
whose father, John Mortimer, a former executive of The New York
Times, was among the victims.
	   ``My father would have wanted me to be here,'' she said. ``It's
ironic that he has died in the ocean that he loved. ... In an odd
way, it's very comforting to me to come here and see this beautiful
place.''
	   Security forces have barred people, boats and planes not
involved in the search from the entire search area, including
several miles (kilometers) of coast. About 250 soldiers were
combing the shoreline in search of debris and body parts.
	   The process of identifying the bodies was expected to take
weeks, because most of the human remains found so far have been
fragments.
	   Only on Saturday morning did officials announce the first
positive identification _ a French woman whose name was not
released.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said
pathology teams were working around the clock on ``a daunting
task'' and described in a shaken tone how he had struggled to
inform relatives how badly damaged the bodies were.

Rossi takes 250-cc race, Doohan wins 500-cc
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Doohan's victory in 500-cc race &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   IMOLA, Italy (AP) _ Reigning world champion Michael Doohan
dominated the 500-cc race in Sunday's City of Imola Grand Prix and
vaulted to second place in the world championship standings, only
four points behind Italian leader Max Biaggi.
	   Biaggi, winner of the previous Grand Prix at Brno, finished
third at the home track of Imola, also preceded by Spain's Alex
Criville.
	   It was another triumph in the most titled class for the
Japanese-made Honda bikes which took the top four positions at the
Enzo and Dino Ferrari circuit.
	   Doohan, an Australian veteran rider, piled up 185 points,
compared with Biaggi's 189, as he captured his fifth season victory
and the 51st of his career.
	   Doohan trailed Biaggi by 13 points prior to Sunday's event, the
11th of the world motorcycle racing championship.
	   With four races left, the fight for the world title still was
wide open in the 500-cc with three riders within seven points.
	   Criville has 182 points and could become an unwanted third party
in the duel behind Doohan and Biaggi, a former 250-cc world
champion on his first season in the upper class.
	   Biaggi was faster than Doohan at the start and led the race in
the first three laps.
	   Then the world champion and Criville landed a successful attack
on Biaggi during the fourth lap.
	   As soon as he rode to first place Doohan gradually improved his
advantage and led Criville by 6.5 seconds at the end of the 25-lap
race, clocking a winning time of 46 minutes. 0.092 seconds.
	   Biaggi had a gap of 8.7 seconds from the winner.
	   Brazilian Alex Barros beat Frenchman Jean Michel Bayle for
fourth place.
	   Bayle, who rode a Yamaha, started in pole position but was
unable to keep the pace of the best Honda riders.
	   ``I could not do any better today, because I had problems
throughout the race with the rear tire,'' Biaggi explained. ``I'm
still leading the championship but things are getting increasingly
difficult. However I'm confident about the next race.''
	   The next Grand Prix, of Catalunya, is scheduled at Barcelona on
Sept. 20.
	   Italian teammates Valentino Rossi and Loris Capirossi gave
Aprilia a 1-2 triumph in the 250-cc class.
	   Japan's Tetsuya Harada, braving a left ankle fracture and a
mid-race spill, finished tenth and held a commanding lead in the
championship standings, with 180 points, 12 ahead of Capirossi.
	   Harada, injured in a fall during Saturday's practice, skidded
off the track at the Variante Bassa corner while dueling with Rossi
for first place.
	   Unrestrained by pain and anger, Harada grabbed his undamaged
Aprilia, resumed racing and set the fastest lap on his way to tenth
place, 39.5 seconds behind the winner.
	   Rossi, a former 125-cc world champion, captured his second
career victory in the upper class on his first season in the
250-cc.
	   ``It was a special victory, because it came at an Italian
track,'' Rossi said. ``I knew Harada was not at 100 percent and
that he could have some problems in the race. I'm happy with my
victory, not with his spill.''
	   Rossi, who had scored his previous victory in the Dutch GP at
Assen, completed the 23-lap race in 43 minutes. 43.815 seconds.
	   He carried Italian fans away sporting dyed hair with the three
colors of the national flag.
	   Capirossi, recovering from a slow start which initially
relegated him to tenth place, finished second with a gap of 2.6
seconds.
	   Italy's Stefano Perugini, riding a Honda, placed third, 4.1
seconds behind, for an all-Italian podium.
	   Honda teammates Tohru Ukawa of Japan and Olivier Jacque of
France placed fourth and fifth respectively.
	   Japan's Tomomi Manako led from start to finish on his Honda to
win the 125-cc class race ahead of Italian rising teenage star
Marco Melandri.
	   Melandri, also on a Honda, tried to overtake Manako at the very
last corner but the Japanese rider fought off the attack and edged
the 16-year-old rival by 0.08 seconds at the finish line.
	   Manako won the 21-lap race in 42 minutes, 5.831 seconds.
	   Two other Japanese riders, Masao Azuma on a Honda and Kazuto
Sakata on a Aprilia, finished third and fourth respectively.
	   Sakata held a commanding lead in the championship with 198
points, compared with Melandri's 158. Manako was third, with 147.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister intends to launch an unprecedented public campaign against
the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But first he
must assess his support.
	   Four days after he was stripped of his official positions of
deputy and finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, remained hunkered
down at home Sunday.
	   With the exception of a brief statement after Friday prayers at
a neighborhood mosque, Anwar has not gone out, preferring to meet
supporters in small groups in his living room and occasionally talk
to reporters.
	   Anwar has said he intends to make a nationwide tour to launch
his political reform campaign. But for now he's staying put.
	   ``Security is at least guaranteed here,'' he said.
	   A clutch of supporters and about two dozen reporters have kept a
vigil at Anwar's two-story house in the posh Damansara Heights
neighborhood since Thursday.
	   Anwar says he is awaiting arrest. But Malaysian police said
Saturday they want to complete their investigations into
allegations of sexual misconduct, abuse of power and leaking state
secrets before an arrest is considered.
	   Observers say Anwar cannot focus on his political agenda until
his immediate future is known _ whether he will remain free or
imprisoned under the Internal Security Act.
	   The dreaded act allows suspects to be detained without trial if
they are deemed a threat to national security.
	   Although Anwar has spoken of an Indonesian-style campaign for
political reform and free press, it will have to wait until he can
defend himself against mounting charges.
	   New allegations were flung at him Saturday, when the country's
top police official accused Anwar of trying to interfere with the
investigation, abuse his position and tamper with evidence.
	   On Sunday, Entrepreneur Development Minister Mustapa Mohamed, a
member of the Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National
Organization, said Anwar was dismissed from the party because of
suspicions about his personal and moral conduct.
	   ``The UMNO Supreme Council members feel enough doubts had been
created over Anwar to warrant the action that has been instituted
against him,'' said Mustapa, who added that the dismissal did not
result from policy differences or a political conspiracy.
	   Few observers have been able to judge the support Anwar may
enjoy. Barring two public displays by hundreds of supporters
shouting ``Long live Anwar'' and ``We want justice,'' there have
been no massive protests against his ouster.
	   ``There is no need to seek a recourse that may risk arrest under
Internal Security Act unless, of course, the strategy is to force
the authorities to use the act so that one can achieve political
martyrdom,'' said an editorial in Sunday's New Straits Times.
	   The government-backed newspaper said most of Anwar's supporters
appeared to be from a Malay Islamic group that he founded during
his radical student days.
	   Since he was expelled by Mahathir from the ruling United Malays
National Organization on Thursday, Anwar has received little
sympathy from his former colleagues. Only a handful have visited
him and there have been more people from the opposition parties and
human rights groups at his home.
	   Whether Anwar can carve out support from outside the powerful
UMNO, which has governed Malaysia since independence from Britain
in 1957, is the big question.
	   The rift between Anwar and Mahathir dates back more than one
year, but did not surface until the July party convention. Anwar's
allies launched a broadside on corruption in high places and
nepotism among top UMNO leaders, which many saw as the first open
challenge to Mahathir's leadership.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Comparing Kosovo to Rwanda, a top
U.S. official toured a devastated area of the Serbian province on
Sunday and pushed for independent investigations into reported
massacres.
	   John Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official,
demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow access to
forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
	   Shattuck was joined by former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole and other
Western officials on his fact-finding tour, which comes amid a push
to stop the bloodshed and prevent further humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died and an estimated 265,000 have
been driven from their homes since February, when Serb forces
launched a crackdown on armed secessionists in the largely
Albanian-populated province.
	   Their 150-kilometer (90-mile) drive took them through the
war-torn towns of Kijevo, Decane and Malisevo in southwestern
Kosovo, an area lined with bombed-out brick houses, stray cattle
and very few civilians.
	   ``The only other place I have seen as eerie as this is in
Rwanda,'' said Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human
rights, standing on a hillside overlooking a charred suburb of
Decane.
	   Groups of stray dogs barked or tore the flesh of dead cows amid
dozens of roofless brick houses. Stray horses, many still bridled,
wandered among the heavily laden grapevines and cornfields of the
uninhabited area.
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting Sunday, although
the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Serb police
exchanged fire late Saturday with gunmen in the northern town of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The four-car convoy consisting of Dole, Shattuck and other
Western officials did see an ethnic Albanian home ablaze in Kijevo,
where Serbian police patrolled nearly empty streets. Serb forces
have been embarked on a scorched-earth campaign for months, trying
to extinguish resistance and drive out ethnic Albanians.
	   The officials visited a site near the former Kosovo Liberation
Army stronghold of Orahovac where the Serbs say they buried up to
40 ethnic Albanian fighters.
	   Standing near garbage heaps around the graves, Shattuck called
on Milosevic to allow access to international forensic
investigators into reported sites of massacres of both Serbs and
ethnic Albanians.
	   Authorities are unwilling, he said, ``to confront the fact that
massive war crimes have been committed here, and probably are going
to be committed, and (they) have to be fully investigated and
prosecuted.''
	   He said he would make that point when he reports his findings to
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Shattuck and Dole are to meet Milosevic on Monday in the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
	   Dole, who heads the non-governmental International Commission
for Missing Persons, said he will seek assurances that Serb
security forces are not harming hundreds of men whom they recently
detained in ethnic Albanian villages.
	   While helping to resettle civilians in villages they fled
earlier this year, Serbian police also have rounded up some 450
ethnic Albanian men of fighting age, saying they were former KLA
fighters who ditched arms and uniforms after recent battlefield
losses.
	   In bombed-out Orahovac, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs who
returned after intense fighting in July clamored around the
entourage to relate stories of missing or dead relatives. Dozens
more crowded the doorway of the Serbian Red Cross center to receive
portions of flour, cooking oil and pasta.
	   Three Serb women stood in front of a mosque to ask the entourage
for help in finding their missing sons and husbands, whom they said
were captured by the KLA.
	   The mosque imam, trembling with anger, loudly evicted them from
the grounds.
	   In another illustration of high tension between civilians of the
two sides, a young Albanian woman told Dole and Shattuck that Serb
police and civilians regularly discriminate against the ethnic
Albanians living in Orahovac. She accused the Red Cross of denying
food to many Albanians.
	   Three middle-aged Serb women then yelled that they know where
she lives and they will take her to the police station for talking
to Dole.

Premier says Greece will meet EMU targets, seek to deflate regional
</HEADLINE>
tensions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis Sunday pledged to
keep Greece in line with its goals for European economic and
monetary union, and also seek to deflate regional tensions and
problems with rival Turkey.
	   ``We think we have to fight for it, it concerns the completion
of our European Monetary Union goals. We will try, but society also
has to realize the importance of this,'' Simitis told reporters in
this northern port city.
	   During his weekend visit here, Simitis delivered his annual
state of the economy address at the Salonica International Trade
Fair. He expressed confidence Greece will meet four out of the five
requirements for Greece's 2001 participation in the Euro zone by
the end 1999
	   Greece aims to bring inflation below 2 percent by the end of
next year and Simitis said ``we consider the target for 1999
feasible.'' He added that ``we have to fight for the fulfillment of
this target because it is the criterion that will put us in the
EMU.''
	   The year-on-year inflation rate was running at 5 percent in
August and the government expects it to ease to 4.5 percent at the
of 1998. Simitis added that by year's end, the general government
deficit will fall below 3 percent of the gross domestic product, to
2.4 percent from 4 percent in 1997. Criteria to join the Euro zone
are an inflation rate below 2 percent and a deficit below 3
percent.
	   Simitis said Greece's economic health also depended on stability
in the Balkan region, something his government was trying to help
achieve.
	   ``We have to be extra careful because we are a breath away from
these areas,'' he said referring to the crisis in the
Albanian-dominated Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and the potential
for its spillover into Albania and Macedonia.
	   Simitis hoped tensions will be reduced with Turkey over the
Aegean Sea _ where the two NATO allies have long-standing disputes
_ and the divided eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
	   ``Despite the tension that Turkey is causing from time to time,
and despite its expansionist policies, I do not see the Aegean as
an area where things are not under control and where there will be
problems,'' he said.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent November's
deployment of Russian-made S-300 missiles by Greek Cypriots. Athens
has said any such action will lead to war.
	   Simitis complained the missiles ``are not and end in
themselves'' and said the main problem with Cyprus was Turkey's
invasion of the island in 1974. ``We will continue our efforts to
bring back the discussion back to the important issues.''
	   Turkey invaded and occupied northern Cyprus in 1974 following an
abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece. A Turkish Cypriot breakaway state is only recognized by
Ankara, and United Nations sponsored talks to reunify the island
have been deadlocked for more than a year.
	   Simitis is expected to discuss the Aegean and Cyprus during a
meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz at a Balkan summit
in Turkey on Oct. 12.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Turkey on Sunday called for
closer security cooperation among Middle Eastern countries to
combat terrorism and bring stability to the volatile region.
	   Speaking to reporters, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
reaffirmed that increased security cooperation between his country
and Israel should not been seen as a threat to Arabs states.
	   ``Our military cooperation with Israel is not directed against
any country in the region,'' Yilmaz said after a 90-minute meeting
with his Jordanian counterpart, Fayez Tarawneh.
	   ``Any country which attaches importance to the peace and
stability in the region and is not involved in terrorism is invited
to this cooperation,'' he added.
	   However, Tarawneh, sitting next to Yilmaz, said: ``We are not
part of any coalition or any alliance of a security nature.''
	   But he added: ``The region needs a security cooperation, in a
global definition and comprehensive nature, against terrorism and
full understanding of good neighborhood relations that would put
the region in most stable condition.''
	   Jordan came under fire from Arab countries, especially Syria,
when it sent an observer to joint Israeli-Turkish maneuvers off
Israel's coast last November.
	   Arab states and Iran considered the drills a threat to regional
security.
	   Syria _ which fell out with Jordan after King Hussein signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994 _ fears that an emerging alliance
between Turkey, Israel and Jordan could weaken its military and
political clout in the region.
	   Turkey has signed several military cooperation agreements with
Israel since 1996. It allows Israeli jets to use its airspace for
training, and Israel upgrades Turkey's F-4 fighter fleet under a
contract worth dlrs 630 million signed two years ago.
	   Yilmaz, who is on his first visit to the region since his
Motherland Party came to power earlier this year, was scheduled to
meet with Crown Prince Hassan later in the day.
	   He will travel Monday to neighboring Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
	   Yilmaz said he discussed with Tarawneh ways to end a stalemate
in Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, which broke down for the
second time in January because of Israel's rejection of a U.S.
proposal to pullout from further 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   He said the U.S. initiative ``constitutes a possible way out for
the resumption of the (peace) process'' and that a French-Egyptian
proposal to hold an international conference on the Middle East
peace process ``also has merits.''
	   ``We are deeply concerned about the present stalemate. We
support all efforts that will bring about a breakthrough,'' he
said.
	   Yilmaz, who is accompanied by 100 business executives, said he
and Tarawneh signed three accords for closer cooperation in
agriculture, sports and youth and improving the specifications of
Jordanian output.
	   Tarawneh said a joint trade committee, idle since 1992, will
convene soon and that trade ministers from both countries will meet
later this year to discuss ways to increase trade exchange from the
current annual volume of dlrs 190 million.

Boos and applause at premiere of film on Britain's martyr to music

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Emily Watson went memorably mad in
``Breaking the Waves.'' In ``Hilary and Jackie,'' she's a martyr to
her music, doomed to die young.
	   Now it's time, the actress says, for something on a lighter
note.
	   ``I was sad. I was very sad,'' she said of finishing ``Hilary
and Jackie,'' which had its world premiere Sunday at the Venice
Film Festival. ``I walked by the sea in Devon to get over it.''
	   The movie tells the tragic life story of British cellist
Jacqueline Du Pre, who died of multiple sclerosis at the age of 42,
and her relationship with her older sister, Hilary.
	   The film was eagerly awaited, in part because of Watson, whose
remarkable 1996 debut in ``Breaking the Waves'' garnered her an

Pre's sister, Hilary, and her brother, Piers. The book created a

was sick of the emotionally empty world of celebrity and starved
for what she saw as ``normal'' love.
	   Watson said it wasn't easy to grasp _ or convey _ this aspect of
the intense sibling relationship. ``I got to where I did understand
it,'' she said. ``I had to understand that to tell the story.''

Jackie,'' said the filmmakers spent long hours with the Du Pre
family, but Berenboim refused to participate. ``The film was made
with a whole lot of love,'' Tucker said Sunday. ``People have

Tudjman: OSCE bans may jeopardize Bosnian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman maintained
Sunday that an international ban on more than a dozen Croat
candidates from next weekend's Bosnian elections could jeopardize
the peace process there.
	   ``Such decisions and threats could have incalculable
repercussions upon the upcoming elections ... and the entire peace
process in Bosnia,'' he said in a statement issued following his
meeting with a delegation of Bosnian Croats.
	   On Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe banned 18 candidates of the Bosnian branch of Tudjman's
party from running in nationwide elections next Saturday and
Sunday.
	   The OSCE, a 54-nation forum, is overseeing the balloting on
behalf of the international community in an attempt to patch up the
country after the 1992-5 war.
	   Hundreds of candidates from Tudjman's ruling party, the Croatian
Democratic Union, are running for various offices in the election,
including the Croat seat on the three-member joint presidency as
well as national, regional and local posts.
	   The Bosnian Croat candidates were struck from the election race
in response to persistently unfair election coverage from
neighboring Croatia's state-run television, broadcast throughout
western Bosnia. The OSCE maintains that it has authority to hold a
station in a foreign, sovereign country to election rules
established following the Dayton Peace Accord which ended the
Bosnian war. Tudjman signed the Dayton pact.
	   The Bosnian Croat delegation led by President Ante Jelavic
denounced the action as an ``ungrounded and undemocratic act''
directed at ``imposing election results.''
	   The director of Croatian Radio and Television, Ivica Vrkic, also
lambasted the decision, accusing the OSCE of ``championing its own
interests'' in Bosnia.
	   The emergency meeting with the Bosnian delegation was meant to
show Tudjman's solidarity with its sister party.
	   ``The Croat leadership unanimously supports these assessments
and views,'' the statement from Tudjman's office said Sunday.
	   It further urged the international organization ``to reconsider
and revoke its decision to prevent election engineering and enable
democratic elections.''
	   Zagreb threatened to support a possible decision by the Bosnian
branch of the Croatian Democratic Union to boycott the elections.

Boos and applause at premiere of film on Britain's martyr to music

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Emily Watson went memorably mad in
``Breaking the Waves.'' In ``Hilary and Jackie,'' she's a martyr to
her music, doomed to die young.
	   Now it's time, the actress says, for something on a lighter
note.
	   ``I was sad. I was very sad,'' she said of finishing ``Hilary
and Jackie,'' which had its world premiere Sunday at the Venice
Film Festival. ``I walked by the sea in Devon to get over it.''
	   The movie tells the tragic life story of British cellist
Jacqueline Du Pre, who died of multiple sclerosis at the age of 42,
and her relationship with her older sister, Hilary.
	   The film was eagerly awaited, in part because of Watson, whose
remarkable 1996 debut in ``Breaking the Waves'' garnered her an
Academy Award nomination and worldwide accolades, and in part
because of sensational new revelations about Du Pre's life.
	   At a prescreening Saturday, the audience reaction was mixed:
both boos and applause.
	   But festival director Felice Laudadio said Sunday that's typical
of this year's festival.
	   No clear front-runners for the big Venice prizes have emerged
yet, although there was pre-festival talk that Watson could be a
contender for best actress.
	   Her performance in ``Hilary and Jackie'' lacks the astonishing
emotional vulnerability of ``Breaking the Waves,'' but her
immersion in the role is still evident.
	   Watson said Sunday that she spent months relearning the cello in
order to play the role of Du Pre.
	   In one wordless, memorable scene, Watson heartbreakingly conveys

	   Struggling with trembling hands, she reaches out from her

Latin American leaders warn of spreading market crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Latin American markets are being
rattled by the Russian and Asian economic crises, but a meltdown
can be avoided if industrialized nations take proper steps,
regional leaders said this weekend.
	   The 14-member Rio Group of Latin American leaders urged the
world's seven most-industrialized nations and world financial
groups ``to immediately take the necessary steps to restore
stability and guarantee growth of the world economy.''
	   Financial worries were the top priority of the annual summit
after Latin America's largest market, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange,
suffered a 14 percent midday slide on Friday, prompting markets and
currencies across the region to tumble.
	   When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo arrived for Saturday's
gathering, he suggested the group focus on the financial crisis.
	   In addition to the group's 59-point declaration on a wide range
of regional concerns, it added a seven-point declaration on the
financial turmoil.
	   ``So far, the costs of this instability are manageable in the
measure that we have not seen an economic contraction in the United
States or Europe,'' Zedillo said as the summit wrapped up late
Saturday.
	   But if industrialized economies should further weaken, it could
provoke a world recession, he said. ``This is what we believe
should be avoided at any price,'' Zedillo said.
	   The Rio Group expressed confidence that its economies can
withstand the current storm _ a position echoed by the
International Monetary Fund last week.
	   The Mexican leader, who will preside over the Rio Group's 1999
meeting, noted that his country and other Latin American nations
have made structural reforms and policy adjustments in recent
years.
	   This year, Mexico and others have had to survive an abrupt fall
in world oil prices and in the value of basic grains, Zedillo
noted.
	   Referring to investors concerned about the spread of the Asian
and Russian crises, Zedillo urged the international community to do
whatever it could to prevent further pull-out from emerging
markets.
	   The 10 Latin American presidents attending the summit along with
four top officials from other countries expressed their confidence
in free-market reforms that have swept the region in the last
decade.
	   ``We reaffirm our commitment to handle in a responsible way
those economic policy mechanisms that guarantee growth and
stability,'' their statement read.
	   The group also addressed regional unity, development, the need
to protect democracy and human rights, poverty, drug trafficking
and terrorism.
	   It criticized the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which punishes
businesses that trade with Cuba, as harmful to international
commerce and as an example of a nation wrongly attempting to impose
its laws outside of its territory.
	   The group also opposed Washington's annual process of certifying
whether nations have cooperated in the fight against drug
trafficking.
	   Eight nations _ Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina,
Brazil, Peru and Uruguay _ founded the alliance in Rio de Janeiro
in 1986. Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay joined later.
	   Two countries were the temporary representatives for their
regions: El Salvador for Central America and Guyana for the
Caribbean.

Lancashire thrash Derbyshire by nine wickets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England batsman John Crawley scored an unbeaten
half-century Sunday as Lancashire cruised to a nine-wicket win over
Derbyshire in a rain-affected domestic limited-overs final at
Lord's.
	   Derbyshire managed a total of 103, going back in for 19 minutes
Sunday morning after bad light stopped play Saturday with the score
at 92 for seven.
	   In reply, Lancashire lost only one wicket, Michael Atherton for
10, before Crawly (53) and Neil Fairbrother (38) combined to score
the required runs.
	   Derbyshire started positively, with Australia's Michael Slater
and Kim Barnett combining for a first-wicket partnership of 70.
	   But distaster struck after Slater was bowled by Ian Austin for
34. Derbyshire crashed, losing seven wickets for 11 runs in the
space of 55 deliveries.
	   Austin took three for 14 off 10 overs, while Peter Martin took
four for 19 off nine overs.
	   Derbyshire added just 11 runs for the loss of the last three
wickets in 27 balls when play resumed Sunday to register the
third-lowest total in a final at Lord's.
	   Crawly reached his half-century with his 11th boundary in 90
balls to steer Lancashire to the the first of a possible three
domestic titles this season.

Report: Diana's bored brother to leave South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONON (AP) _ Princess Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, is bored
with life in South Africa and plans to return permanently to
Britain early next year and run the family estate, Althorp, The
Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   Spencer, 34, who complained that media attention on his failing
marriage and his then-wife's problems with eating, drugs and
alcohol drove him from Britain, moved to Cape Town four years ago.
	   He has spent more tim in Britain recently, and The Sunday
Telegraph said he was buoyed by the success of a Diana exhibition
he ran at Althorp to coincide with the first anniversary of his
sister's death in Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   Asked to comment on The Sunday Telegraph report, a spokeswoman
for Spencer said he will return to Britain next spring because of a
book he is writing on the Spencer family requires research.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Spencer plans ``to keep a base'' in South Africa where his four
children live with their mother.
	   Spencer and his ex-wife, the former Victoria Lockwood, were
divorced in Cape Town last December amid considerable publicity.
She accused him of being a serial adulterer.
	   The Sunday Telegraph said Spencer planned to keep his home in
Cape Town's Constantia district to use when he visits the children.

Italian doctor says comments on Austrian skiers were
</HEADLINE>
misinterpreted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The lawyer for an Italian doctor who
reportedly implied that top Austrian skiers use
performance-enhancing drugs claimed in a letter released in Austria
on Sunday that the remarks were misinterpreted.
	   Herbert Schonhuber, head of the medical commission for the
Italian winter sports federation, stirred up a furor in Austria
last week when Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper quoted him as
questioning the increase in muscle mass of Olympic double-gold
medalist Hermann Maier in particular.
	   He told the newspaper he had no proof of doping but said such
muscle growth is impossible ``with clean methods.''
	   Maier, who won three World Cup titles besides the two gold
medals in his debut year on the World Cup circuit, immediately
denied that he takes drugs.
	   Trying to defuse the controversy, Schonhuber told Austrian media
after the flap erupted that he was merely reporting on speculation
in the ski community.
	   In a legal followup, Schonhuber's lawyer Emanuele Principi wrote
a letter to the Austrian Ski Federation, which had challenged his
statements. Writing from Milan on Thursday, he said the doctor was
``very displeased by the wrong and tendentious interpretations''
made regarding his remarks.
	   He said Schonhuber had singled out Maier only because he is
``considered the world leader of skiing'' and because he had told
Austrian TV he had gained over 18 kilograms (40 pounds).
	   Austrian ski officials, who faxed a copy of the letter to media
Sunday, expressed satisfaction with what they characterized as an
apology.
	   ``With this apology, the Austrian Ski Federation considers the
affair over,'' it said.
	   Skiers are regularly tested for drug use, and no evidence has
been found of Maier taking drugs. The Austrian superstar said
similar allegations have been made before about skiers who come out
of nowhere to make a name for themselves.

Stateless Arabs not in Kuwait since 1965 cannot become citizens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Stateless Arabs whose names were not included in a
1965 census will not be considered for Kuwaiti citizenship and will
be treated as illegal residents, the government said Sunday.
	   A Cabinet statement said the decision was adopted by a state
committee that has for years been trying to decide what to do with
more than 120,000 persons who have lived here for decades without
becoming citizens.
	   These people believe they have earned the right to gain
citizenship, and many say they just lack the documents to prove
their nationality. But the government says most of the stateless
Arabs are nationals of neighboring countries who have hidden their
passports in the hope of becoming Kuwaitis and benefiting from the
welfare state.
	   The government statement did not say how many stateless Arabs
were registered in the census, which is believed to be the first
since independence from Britain in 1961. The census was also the
first since the implementation of the country's tough
naturalization law.
	   However, not all stateless Arabs who prove they lived in Kuwait
in or before 1965 will be granted citizenship, the Cabinet
statement said.
	   A deadline will be set for the stateless Arabs to produce their
passports and become ``legal residents,'' said the statement. It
warned those who fail to do so would be prosecuted.
	   The stateless Arabs, who are called Bidouns _ from the Arabic
phrase ``bidoun+ jansiya,'' or without citizenship _ are a problem
for Kuwait since most claim they have nowhere to go and come from
families who have lived here for generations. Most Bidouns have
been blocked from working or sending their children to school since
the 1990 Iraqi invasion and subsequent Gulf War.

U.S. embassy cautions American citizens in the face of political
</HEADLINE>
violence in Lesotho &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ As protesters moved onto the palace
grounds of this small mountain kingdom, an American diplomat said
Sunday that the United States embassy was warning U.S. citizens to
use caution in the face of political violence.
	   Ray Brown, charge d'affairs at the U.S. embassy, said the
warning was issued Saturday because of a leaflet distributed Friday
by opposition activists that said they would view as their enemy
people in vehicles with foreign license plates.
	   The embassy's warning ``is for Americans that were traveling to
or residing in Lesotho to show vigilance and caution and avoid
protest venues,'' Brown told The Associated Press.
	   The South African Press Association reported that protesters
were pouring into the capital, Maseru, from outlying regions. But a
diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity said protesters
were not visible in the streets, although many had moved onto the
royal grounds and were cooking over fires.
	   The government said over the weekend that it would not tolerate
the use of force or intimidation to keep people from going to work
and police had been positioned to deal with any disturbances, the
South African Press Association reported. The government's warning
was broadcast over the state-run Radio Lesotho.
	   Clashes between police, soldiers and demonstrators on Thursday
and Friday resulted in two deaths. The circumstances of both
shooting deaths were unclear. Government officials said they were
investigating.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties have regularly
protested outside the palace of King Letsie III since Aug. 4,
claiming the May election was rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy, which won 79 of 80 seats in the National
Assembly.
	   International election observers in May said they saw no
instances of fraud.
	   The votes were recounted, and a commission headed by South
Africa's Constitutional Court Judge Pius Langa and including
Botswana and Zimbabwe was expected to submit a report next week on
the allegations.
	   Last month, opposition activists shut down the capital, forcibly
turning back cars after warning in leaflets that people would be
injured if they came to work.
	   Surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a nation of 2 million
that has long been plagued by political upheaval.

 &UR; Three months later, EU says Yugoslav flight ban is a fact &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Three months after the European Union
said it would halt commercial flights to Yugoslavia, the measure
got final approval Sunday only when Greece dropped its last-minute
reservations.
	   At a weekend EU foreign ministers meeting, Theodoros Pangalos of
Greece said Athens will respect the ban, one of series of sanctions
to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his crackdown
on independence-minded Kosovo province and its overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian population.
	   The flight ban was announced in June, but Greek resistance had
threatened to undermine further the EU's already weak standing in
the Kosovo crisis.
	   The foreign ministers failed to name a Kosovo envoy to match the
shuttle diplomacy of Christopher Hill, the American envoy, who has
cobbled together a tentative peace deal.
	   ``It cannot be right that Hill takes care of these things,''
said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. ``I think we (the EU)
need to show the flag more in Kosovo.'' Kinkel had urged his
colleagues to name a special envoy.
	   The EU has tried in vain for months to get former Spanish Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez _ now the Kosovo envoy of the Organization
of Security and Cooperation in Europe _ to act also as the EU point
man in Kosovo.
	   Hill has managed to get moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
to endorse a framework deal under which he and Milosevic negotiate
self-rule for Kosovo within Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   While falling short of the demand for independence, it would end
the fighting. The accord would be reviewed in three to five years.
	   The tentative agreement has yet to win the backing of
hard-liners in the Kosovo Liberation Army but diplomats hope enough
KLA fighters will ultimately accept it.
	   ``Moderate forces (in Kosovo) need to be reinforced,'' said
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, the EU meeting
chairman. ``And radical forces need to sing a different tune so
that they will not endanger the peace process.''
	   He said the accord that Hill has concluded was a ``glimmer of
hope'' for Kosovo where war has made 300,000 people homeless.
	   Schuessel said for the EU it was a matter of high priority that
refugees are resettled in their villages or elsewhere in Kosovo.
	   It has earmarked some dlrs 5 million for that purpose, concerned
about a wave of Albanian Kosovars spilling into the EU. German
officials believe some 15,000 are headed towards Germany,.
	   Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, welcomed the
tentative U.S.-negotiated agreement for Kosovo adding both sides
must now be forced to implement it. ``We have to keep up the
pressure and sanctions on Belgrade ... and maintain our support for
Mr. Rugova,'' he told reporters.
	   The foreign ministers, concerned the Kosovo war has made 300,000
people homeless, vowed to step up efforts to find safe areas in the
Serb province for displaced persons.

 &UR; Germans see jobs endangered by Russian economic crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The unsettled economic and political
crisis in Russia that came to a head last month, could lead to the
loss of tens-of-thousands of jobs in Germany, especially in the new
eastern states, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   In an interview with the Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, Klaus Werner of the Institute for Economic Research in
Halle, said that in 1997 eastern Germany exported some 3.2 billion
marks (dlrs 1.8 billion) in products to Russia, representing some
49,500 industrial jobs.
	   ``If the Russian business were to break off, they would be in
danger,'' the newspaper quoted Werner as saying.
	   Wolfgang Kartte, the former chairman of the Federal Cartel
Office and now a Russian business consultant for German companies,
told the newspaper that especially mid-sized companies were
endangered by the crisis, because they had no investment
guarantees.
	   ``While the big concerns are insured by the state, the small
companies must find their own way clear,'' Kartte said.
	   The report said the Darguner Brewery in Mecklenburg-Western
Pommerania state, which produces some 700,000 hectoliters (18.5
million gallons) of beer per year, has already laid off 25 of its
85 employees.
	   ``We exported about 40 percent of our beer to Russia. Now we
sell practically not a drop there,'' the newspaper quoted brewery
chief Wolfgang Voss as saying.
	   The MTW ship builders in Wismar in the same state are also
worried, the report said.
	   ``We are watching the developments in Russia with great
concern,'' Bild am Sonntag quoted MTW spokesman Diethelm Tabel as
saying. ``We have just started building three special ships for an
oil company in Murmansk.''
	   The report said the contract was worth 158 million marks (dlrs
91.3 million) and represented 60 percent of MTW's expected business
for 1999. ``With us 400 jobs depend on the contract,'' Tabel told
the newspaper.
	   Companies in the eastern state of Thuringia had been enjoying a
record increase in business with Russia that was up 57 percent in
1997 over the previous year.
	   ``Russia is Thuringia's third largest export partner,'' the
report quoted Gerald Grusser, chairman of the Industry and Trade
Chamber in Erfurt as saying. About 140 companies employing some
30,000 people are involved in business with Russia.
	   But with the crisis ``many firms are facing finalization of new
contracts, and now that won't be. Others are calling in concerned
because the money from their Russian trade partners is not being
transferred to Germany,'' the report quoted Grusser as saying.
	   Western business is also being hit, the report said.
	   Corina Nienstedt, of the Hamburg Trade Chamber told the
newspaper ``At the moment exports to Russia are zero. In 1997
Hamburg exported 1.6 billion marks (dlrs 924,855) worth of goods to
Russia, a 100 percent increase over 1996. Now especially small and
mid-sized exporters are affected.''

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dies at 88

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, whose hauntingly poetic vision,
innovative style and stunning technical virtuosity made him Japan's
most celebrated film director, died at his home Sunday. He was 88.
	   Minoru Tabata, an official of Kurosawa Film Production, said
Kurosawa died of a stroke before he could be taken to a hospital.
	   ``I can't say what it was about, but he was working on one more
film,'' Hiromichi Horikawa, a director who studied under Kurosawa,
told national broadcaster NHK.
	   Among those who mourned his passing were French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Chirac called him a ``great master of the seventh art.''
	   ``Cinema today has lost one of its giants,'' Jospin said in a
statement, calling ``The Seven Samurai,'' ``Rashomon'' and
``Kagemusha'' ``among the greatest works of the world
cinematographic heritage.''
	   Also in France, Steven Spielberg, whose ``Saving Private Ryan''
opened the Deauville film festival Saturday, called the director
``the pictorial Shakespeare of our time.''
	   Spielberg said he was ``deeply saddened'' by news of Kurosawa's
death but ``encouraged by the fact that he continued to work into
his 80s.''
	   Filmmakers throughout the world have been influenced by
Kurosawa, who fused the pinpoint precision of traditional Japanese
theatrical forms with stunning, larger-than-life spectacles.
	   Standing nearly 6 feet (180 centimeters) tall, rarely seen
without his trademark sunglasses and beret, Kurosawa cut an
imposing figure, with an imperious perfectionism that earned him
the nickname ``Emperor Kurosawa.''
	   He once ordered the tearing down of an entire feudal castle
built for 1957's ``Throne of Blood'' because builders had used
steel nails _ something they could not have done in the 16th
century, when the film was set.
	   Though spectacular, Kurosawa's career also was marked by
disappointments. He once tried to kill himself after a film
flopped. Japanese studios shunned him for decades.
	   But at the height of his powers, he was the uncontested master.
Over his half-century, 30-film career, his movies brought him three
Oscars and the acclaim of audiences and critics worldwide.
	   ``Take myself, subtract films, and the remainder is zero,'' he
once wrote.
	   ``He had a god-like vision that translated well to American
movies,'' said Naoko Kimura, an independent film critic in Tokyo.
	   ``His philosophy on directing is part of modern film making,''
she said.
	   Kurosawa's 52-year-old son, Hisao, a director himself, told a
news conference that ``my father has done almost what he wanted to
do.''
	   Kurosawa had a love-hate relationship with his homeland. He drew
deeply on classic Japanese themes like the warrior spirit and the
beauty of futile self-sacrifice. But he looked elsewhere for
financial and artistic support.
	   Several of Kurosawa's films were remade in America into hit
Westerns _ ``The Seven Samurai'' was the basis for ``The
Magnificent Seven'' and ``Yojimbo'' inspired ``A Fistful of
Dollars.''
	   In the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese studios, focusing on soft porn
and cheap romances, gave Kurosawa short shrift even as his
reputation grew overseas. In 1980, George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg persuaded 20th Century Fox to back ``Kagemusha''
(``Shadow Warrior'') after financiers at home balked.
	   Even as late as 1985, Kurosawa's reputation as a hothead and a
spendthrift made it hard to find Japanese backing for the film he
described as his ``life's work'' _ ``Ran,'' a loose adaptation of
``King Lear'' set in 16th-century Japan.
	   French producer Serge Silberman agreed to work with him on the
film, a beautifully drawn but brutally pessimistic depiction of
three samurai sons battling their father.
	   With a price tag topping dlrs 10 million, ``Ran'' was then the
most expensive movie in Japanese film history. But it brought
Kurosawa a round of new honors, including a lifetime achievement
award at Cannes.
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910 to a family that had held samurai rank,
Kurosawa was the youngest of eight children of a military school
administrator.
	   He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art school and
tiring of poverty as a painter. In 1936 he spotted a film studio's
advertisement for a director's assistant. He got the job.
	   At 33, he directed his first film, ``Sugata Sanshiro'' (``The
Judo Saga''). It was a hit in wartime Japan, but Kurosawa's vision
conflicted with some nationalist sentiments, and drew heated
attacks from the military.
	   His breakthrough came in 1950, with ``Rashomon,'' the first
Japanese film to gain recognition abroad. It won the Academy Award
for Best Foreign Film in 1951 and launched him on a decade of
landmark films that included ``Seven Samurai'' (1954) and ``Throne
of Blood'' (1957).
	   Rashomon featured actor Toshiro Mifune, who also reached
worldwide fame and starred in 16 Kurosawa movies.
	   Mifune died last December at age 77.
	   ``Dodeskaden'' was a critical and commercial flop in 1970, and
the next year Kurosawa attempted suicide. But he made a comeback in
1975 with the bleakly lovely Siberian-set ``Dersu Uzala,'' which
brought him his second Oscar.
	   In 1990, he became the first Japanese to receive the Honorary
Oscar for lifetime achievements.
	   Kurosawa stirred controversy with his 1991 film, ``Rhapsody in
August,'' whose presentation of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki was
called one-sided and simplistic by American critics.
	   The film, which starred Richard Gere, focused on the plight of a
family that lost an uncle in the bombing but made no mention of
Japan's role in starting the war.
	   Disappointments followed. ``Dreams,'' a 1990 series of
vignettes, was delicately wrought but described by one critic as
``a snooze.'' And 1993's ``Madadayo,'' about an elderly writer and
his literary coterie, barely registered at the box office.
	   ``I don't regret anything. I found the perfect job,'' Kurosawa
said in an interview when he was 75. ``All this time I've thought
of nothing but movies.''
	   Kurosawa's wife, actress Yoko Yaguchi, died in 1985 after 35
years of marriage. Besides son Hisao, they had a daughter, Kazuko.
	   Two private ceremonies for the family have been scheduled _ a
wake at his home Monday and a funeral there Tuesday.
	   A ``farewell meeting'' is to be held Sept. 13 at Kurosawa Film
Studio in Yokohama, 29 kilometers (18 miles) south of Tokyo.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, is bored
with life in South Africa and plans to return permanently to
Britain early next year and run the family estate, Althorp, The
Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   Spencer, 34, who complained that media attention on his failing
marriage and his then-wife's problems with eating, drugs and
alcohol drove him from Britain, moved to Cape Town four years ago.
	   He has spent more time in Britain recently, and The Sunday
Telegraph said he was buoyed by the success of a Diana exhibition
he ran at Althorp to coincide with the first anniversary of his
sister's death in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   Asked to comment on The Sunday Telegraph report, a spokeswoman
for Spencer said he will return to Britain next spring because a
book he is writing on the Spencer family requires research.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Spencer plans ``to keep a base'' in South Africa where his four
children live with their mother.
	   Spencer and his ex-wife, the former Victoria Lockwood, were
divorced in Cape Town last December amid considerable publicity.
She accused him of being a serial adulterer.
	   The Sunday Telegraph said Spencer planned to keep his home in
Cape Town's Constantia district to use when he visits the children.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two tourists suffered minor
injuries when a bomb exploded Sunday on a street in downtown
Prague, police said.
	   Spokeswoman Eva Brozova said a Spaniard and a Dutch woman were
slightly injured when the bomb, planted in a garbage can, went off
Sunday afternoon on Jilska Street. Several windows and a car were
damaged in the blast in Old Town, the area most popular with
foreign tourists.
	   It was not immediately clear who planted the bomb or what
explosive was used, Brozova said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk expressed
pessimism Sunday that talks he is mediating will lead the country
out of its political crisis and reportedly told participants he
will abdicate if the effort fails.
	   He made the threat as demonstrations decrying the results of the
recent national election continued in the capital.
	   The seriousness of Sihanouk's remarks was hard to judge because
he regularly employs such threats as a political bargaining chip.
	   In a statement released by the palace Sunday evening, the king
said only that the meetings, conducted in a ``brotherly
atmosphere,'' had failed to produce any results so far and would
continue Monday.
	   The 75-year-old monarch's powers are limited by the
constitution, but many Cambodians revere him as a symbol of moral
authority.
	   Sihanouk presided Sunday over the second of three days of
meetings in the northwestern province of Siem Reap that he had
hoped would help resolve the deadlock that has followed July's
parliamentary elections.
	   The talks bring together representatives from the three rival
political parties, the national election committee and the
country's highest appeals body.
	   Eng Chhay Ieng, a representative of the opposition Sam Rainsy
Party, said Sunday's meeting produced no results because technical
issues raised by opposition parties _ how to deal with their
election complaints _ received no response.
	   He quoted the king as telling representatives of all sides that
he would ``step down from the throne if the crisis cannot be
settled.''
	   Representatives of two other parties at the talks later
confirmed that Sihanouk had made such a statement.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
the July 26 polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government on its own.
	   The leading opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party have accused Hun Sen of cheating at the polls. They
have threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if their
allegations of fraud _ dismissed as baseless by election
authorities loyal to Hun Sen _ are not properly investigated.
	   So far, disagreements between the opposing sides at the talks
have been ``total and irreversible,'' the king said in a letter to
U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher, released by the palace as
Sunday's talks opened. Rohrabacher has taken an active interest in
Cambodian affairs.
	   ``I am very pessimistic and I am not anticipating that the
responsible Cambodian parties will, through an honorable
compromise, lead our unfortunate country and our unhappy people out
of this more and more tragic crisis,'' Sihanouk wrote.
	   Tol Lah, the chief FUNCINPEC representative at the talks,
described Sunday's session as fruitless. He said a suggestion by
Hun Sen's party to deal with election-related complaints after
convening parliament was ``impossible.''
	   Since the elections, tensions have been mounting in Phnom Penh,
where demonstrators have been staging an around-the-clock vigil
against Hun Sen for two weeks.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy led 10,000 people through the
streets of Phnom Penh Sunday. They clogged traffic when they
marched and rode motorcycles to the National Assembly _ the site of
the anti-government vigil _ after holding a two-hour rally at the
main sports stadium.
	   ``As long as the march is peaceful, I think it is productive,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``While they are talking in Siem Reap, everyone in
the whole world can see that people in Cambodia want democracy.''
	   The protests have been largely violence-free, but angry mobs
were reported Friday to have killed as many as five ethnic
Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them of being
responsible for a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   In their public speeches, FUNCINPEC head Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, who condemned the killings, have played on the
anti-Vietnamese prejudices held by many Cambodians.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh, the
king's son, as co-premier in a bloody coup. Hun Sen hoped the new
polls would help him win back legitimacy in the eyes of the
international community and foreign aid.

Chinese president declares victory over northern flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Chinese
president's remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin declared victory
Sunday over the worst flooding to sweep northeast China in decades
but said the country faced another battle rebuilding.
	   Ending a tour of disaster areas in the northeast, Jiang praised
the people and military for working together in combating the
flooding, state media reported.
	   ``The nation should carry forth this spirit in helping the
people to resume production and rebuild their homes,'' the Xinhua
News Agency quoted Jiang as saying.
	   Flooding caused by rains that fell earlier and harder than usual
have killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left millions
homeless. Economic losses have exceeded 166 billion yuan (dlrs 20
billion). Worst hit have been the northeast and the Yangtze River
basin in central China.
	   Water levels remain above the emergency stages on major rivers
in both regions, and the national flood control headquarters said
Sunday the rivers would not drop below the danger level for at
least two more weeks.
	   With the first frost due before the end of the month, governors
of northeastern provinces assured Jiang that steps were being taken
to help flood victims survive the winter, state media reported.
	   Heilongjiang province has been collecting coal and other fuel
for the victims; Inner Mongolia will give each family that lost its
home 1,000 yuan (dlrs 120), Xinhua said.
	   In southwestern China, officials have closed down timber trading
centers along the upper Yangtze in Sichuan province as part of a
ban on logging ordered after the summer floods, Xinhua said in a
separate report.
	   Unrestrained felling of forests on the upper Yangtze and its
tributaries has been blamed for creating the worst flooding in
central China in 44 years. The bare hillsides are unable to trap
rains or hold top soil. Xinhua said 600 million tons of silt now
washes into the upper Yangtze every year.
	   Tang Song, a Sichuan logger named a national modal worker in May
for his years of prodigious clear-cutting, said he was shocked by
footage of the flooding he saw on government-run television.
	   ``I'm partly to blame for the disastrous floods,'' the official
China Daily quoted Tang as saying.
	   In its Business Weekly edition, China Daily said some 100,000
timber industry workers are affected by the ban. Two-thirds will
have to take retirement under a government reorganization plan,
while the others will be given jobs protecting forests and
replanting trees, the newspaper said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official toured a
devastated area of the Serbian province of Kosovo on Sunday and
pushed for independent investigations into reported massacres.
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. State Department's top human rights
official, demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow
access to forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
	   Shattuck was joined by former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole and other
Western officials on his fact-finding tour, which comes amid a push
to stop the bloodshed and prevent further humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died and an estimated 265,000 have
been driven from their homes since February, when Serb forces
launched a crackdown on armed secessionists in the largely
Albanian-populated province.
	   Authorities are unwilling, he said, ``to confront the fact that
massive war crimes have been committed here, and probably are going
to be committed, and (they) have to be fully investigated and
prosecuted.''
	   He said he would make that point when he reports his findings to
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Shattuck and Dole were to meet Milosevic on Monday in the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
	   Their 150-kilometer (90-mile) drive on Sunday took them through
the war-torn towns of Kijevo, Decane and Malisevo in southwestern
Kosovo, an area lined with bombed-out brick houses, stray cattle
and very few civilians.
	   ``The only other place I have seen as eerie as this is in
Rwanda,'' said Shattuck, referring to the civil war-torn eastern
African country as he stood on a hillside overlooking a charred
suburb of Decane.
	   Groups of stray dogs barked or tore the flesh of dead cows amid
dozens of roofless brick houses. Stray horses, many still bridled,
wandered among the heavily laden grapevines and cornfields of the
uninhabited area.
	   No new fighting was reported Sunday, although the official
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Serb police exchanged fire late
Saturday with gunmen in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, EU foreign ministers gave final approval
Sunday to a measure to halt commercial flights to Yugoslavia
because of the situation in Kosovo. Serbia is the larger of two
republics that comprise Yugoslavia, and federal troops participated
in the crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The flight ban, which is one of several international sanctions
aimed at ending the violence, was announced in June, but Greek
resistance had threatened to undermine further the EU's already
weak standing in the Kosovo crisis.
	   The four-car convoy carrying Dole, Shattuck and other Western
officials did see an ethnic Albanian home ablaze in Kijevo, where
Serbian police patrolled nearly empty streets. Serb forces have
embarked on a scorched-earth campaign for months, trying to
extinguish resistance and drive out ethnic Albanians.
	   The officials also visited a site near the former Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold of Orahovac, where the Serbs say they
buried up to 40 ethnic Albanian fighters.
	   Dole, who heads the non-governmental International Commission
for Missing Persons, said he will seek assurances that Serb
security forces are not harming hundreds of men whom they recently
detained in ethnic Albanian villages.
	   While helping to resettle civilians in villages they fled
earlier this year, Serbian police also have rounded up some 450
ethnic Albanian men of fighting age, saying they were former KLA
fighters who ditched arms and uniforms after recent battlefield
losses.
	   In bombed-out Orahovac, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs who
returned after intense fighting in July clamored around the
entourage to relate stories of missing or dead relatives. Dozens
more crowded the doorway of the Serbian Red Cross center to receive
portions of flour, cooking oil and pasta.

Protestant leader rejects Sinn Fein handshake; policeman badly
</HEADLINE>
hurt &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with 5th-6th grafs, Sinn Fein comment;
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestant leader of
Northern Ireland's new assembly said Sunday he will not shake hands
with Gerry Adams, president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, in
their first one-on-one meeting this week.
	   But Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, First Minister in the
new assembly provided for in the peace agreement in this British
province, said he was confident the Irish Republican Army now faces
surrendering its weapons quickly or being exposed as a holdout.
	   ``There is a point about hands being held out open to show they
are not containing any weapons, but Mr. Adams cannot do that,''
Trimble said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   He added that the recent appointment of Adams' deputy, Martin
McGuinness, to liaise with an official commission on surrendering
weapons put the IRA and other anti-British movements ``on to a
conveyor belt which will lead to actual decommissioning or it will
be very clear, very quickly that they are refusing.''
	   Adams, speaking on radio in the Republic of Ireland, said Adams'
comments were ``rather negative, '' but added, ``We can do business
with anyone.''
	   ``How well we can do it is down to the type of partnership that
is forged,'' said Adams.
	   On Saturday, the 110-member Ulster Unionist executive committee
indicated approval _ without a vote _ for Trimble to meet Adams.
	   Trimble had already invited all the party leaders in the
assembly, including Adams, to a meeting on Monday. But the
one-on-one encounter with Adams later in the week shapes up as
hugely significant historically and a new step in the peace
process.
	   Also this week, early jail releases are due to begin of
convicted terrorists from the IRA and from pro-British Protestant
paramilitary groups that have declared cease-fires. The releases
are part of the accord.
	   Meanwhile, a policeman was hospitalized with critical head
injuries and another one was less seriously hurt in clashes
Saturday between Protestants and Catholics in Portadown, 25 miles
(40 kms) from Belfast.
	   The clashes, involving up to 700 people at the peak, erupted
while U.S. President Clinton wound up a visit to both parts of
Ireland and hailed the peace agreement as an example to the rest of
the world.
	   In Portadown, police were attacked with gasoline bombs after
separating opposing factions before a Protestant parade. A
Catholic-owned bedding store was burned down and another
Catholic-owned business damaged.
	   In a raid Saturday night on a shed in a blue-collar Protestant
district of Portadown, Corcraine, police seized gasoline, bottles,
sugar and rags _ ingredients for making more bombs.

Short on cash? Bills paid in Russia in cars, wine, company shares

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Some big construction companies in Chelyabinsk
didn't have the cash to pay their taxes this spring, so they
offered to build a subway system in their Ural Mountains city
instead.
	   Instead of wages, seamstresses at a clothing factory in Siberia
accepted grocery carts to transport vegetables from their garden
plots. Their bosses initially offered them coffins.
	   The governments of Ukraine and Moldova proposed settling their
debts to the Russian gas monopoly in sugar and wine, knowing that
Gazprom has accepted payments from others in the form of steel,
turbines, gas pipes and shares in truck and tractor companies.
	   In Russia's underdeveloped financial system, where bank loans,
personal checks, credit cards and other forms of credit are still
in their infancy, barter deals are again on the rise.
	   Many workers, factories and even government departments just
don't have the money to pay their bills. The situation is likely to
get worse during the current economic crisis, while the ruble is
losing value daily, people are having trouble getting money from
banks and it's not clear who is in charge of the country's
finances.
	   Economists and government officials say that the pervasive use
of the centuries-old practice of barter is skewing the economy and
preventing the development of a modern, free-market system. Barter
now accounts for about half the transactions in Russian industries
and 40 percent of national tax payments.
	   ``Barter is undoubtedly a key problem for our country,'' said
Boris Fyodorov, Russia's chief tax collector, in announcing plans
to crack down on the practice.
	   Bartering isn't new to Russia; it is a centuries-old practice
that flourished even during the Soviet era, when Moscow bartered
weapons to its allies and promised to build oil tankers if PepsiCo
would increase soft drink production. But that was under communism,
not the market economy Russia is trying to build now.
	   Companies that don't have cash can't buy new equipment or pay
their bills. Workers aren't paid and taxes aren't collected _ two
of the biggest problems facing the Russian economy.
	   While some companies turn to barter because they genuinely
cannot pay, others use it to hide revenue and avoid paying taxes
and shareholders, said Barry Ickes, an associate economics
professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies the Russian
economy.
	   Companies that owe overdue taxes especially like barter, Ickes
said. By law, any money they receive and put in their bank account
is immediately seized by tax authorities.
	   Companies that admit they barter say it's the only way they can
collect any payment at all for their goods or services.
	   ``Either we refuse to take any payment at all (from
cash-strapped companies) or we receive some payments in goods,''
said Gennady Yezhov, a spokesman for Gazprom, Russia's largest
company and its largest tax delinquent.
	   Gazprom collects on average less than 10 percent of its payments
in cash, Yezhov said. In a really good month, the figure rises to
17 percent. Last month it was only 7 percent.
	   ``Of course we would like to get cash,'' said Yezhov, press
secretary to the chairman of Gazprom's board. ``We dream about it.
... Unfortunately, it is not possible right away.''
	   Yezhov said bartering means extra work for Gazprom and other
companies because they often don't want the goods they receive, and
have to sell or trade them to someone else.
	   Bartering allows inefficient companies to continue producing
these unwanted goods, Ickes said. If they couldn't pay their bills
in goods, they'd have to close or start producing something for
which there is a demand.
	   Bartering can also disguise the true value of companies _ and
ultimately the Russian economy _ and allow companies to hide the
details of some transactions. Bribes and other forms of corruption
can continue to flourish.
	   ``When you don't have a straightforward cash system, you can
keep lots of things off the balance sheets,'' said Julia Shvets, an
economist with the European Center for Economic Policy, a Moscow
think tank on the Russian economy.
	   ``It's not always clear who is dealing with whom and what is the
exact arrangement between the supplier and the customer,''

Psychiatrist: suspect fit to stand trial in killing of Briton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A prosecution psychiatrist called by the
prosecution testified Sunday that an ex-Israeli army officer who
killed a British tourist and wounded the victim's girl friend is
competent to stand trial.
	   Roberto Mester was testifying at the Beersheba District Court in
the case of Daniel Okev, 45, a former paratroop officer who has
confessed to shooting and killing Jeffrey Hunter, 22, and wounding
Hunter's girlfriend, Charlotte Gibb.
	   The two tourists were hitch-hiking in August 1997 in southern
Israel when Okev gave them a ride but stopped at an isolated spot
in the desert and shot them.
	   Okev claims that he did this because he was traumatized by
service in an army special forces squad, code-named ``Rimon'' _
Hebrew for pomegranite and also for grenade. The unit hunted down
and executed suspected Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip in
the early 1970s, his lawyer David Yiftach said.
	   The former commander of the unit, reserve Maj. Gen. Meir Dagan,
testified earlier about Okev's experiences, but the testimony was
heard behind closed doors.
	   On Monday Yiftach will cross-examine the prosecution's
psychiatrist.
	   He wil that he is - that he had ``diminished responsibility'' for
the killing due to his mental condition, Yiftach told The
Associated Press.

Examples of barter deals in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Let's Make a Deal &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some examples of barter deals in Russia:
	   _The Ryazansky Air Co., a small passenger airline in central
Russia, couldn't afford to pay its pilots, so it offered them old
airplanes that were in such bad condition they couldn't be repaired
any more. The pilots sold the planes to local residents who
converted them into small summer homes in the countryside, the Novy
Izvestia newspaper said. Those with small plots had to cut the
wings off the AN-2 planes, but used them as fences, the newspaper
said. Many converted the planes' tails into storage rooms and the
cockpits into bars, it said.
	   _Gaz, one of biggest automakers, paid its 1997 tax bill in cars.
	   _The Czech Republic recently told Russia it could pay part of
its debt to that country in spare parts for its Soviet-era fighter
planes.
	   _The Samara region on the Volga River owed money to the federal
unemployment fund, which in turn owed money to the Mari El region.
Samara was allowed to pay its debt to the federal fund by shipping
goods several hundred miles (kilometers) back up the Volga River to
Mari El. Most of the goods, which included 10 tons of toxic
chemicals, were of little use to unemployed workers in Mari El.
	   _A rundown district in St. Petersburg that owed money to Gazprom
instead gave the national gas monopoly a share in a revitalization
project. Gazprom will have to pay some of the reconstruction costs,
but will eventually own some of the new buildings.

China's Jiang congratulates North Korea's Kim on appointment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin has congratulated
neighboring communist leader Kim Jong Il on being renamed head of
North Korea's military, China's state television reported Sunday.
	   Jiang expressed ``warm congratulations'' in a telegram sent to
Kim Saturday, hours after North Korea's parliament reappointed him
head of the National Defense Commission, China Central Television
reported.
	   The telegram noted the ``traditional friendship'' between the
two peoples and said relations would be further enhanced under the
efforts of China's Communist Party and North Korea's Workers Party,
CCTV reported.
	   Persistent reports in Japanese and South Korean media have said
Kim plans to travel to China later this year on his first trip
abroad since the death of his father, revolutionary leader Kim Il
Sung, in 1994.
	   Relations between the communist neighbors have been strained in
recent years as China worried about North Korea's economic decline
and possible collapse as a state.
	   Kim, who heads the Workers Party as well as the military, was
expected to be named state president by the parliament Saturday.
But the post was left vacant, apparently out of respect for the
elder Kim.
	   In China, Jiang holds all three titles, heading the state, the
military and the party.

Report: Murdoch to buy Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with BSkyB confirmation, adds reaction. ADDS reaction
sports minister, FA, premier league, supporters

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Media magnate Rupert Murdoch was negotiating to
buy Premier League soccer giant Manchester United, his television
network BSkyB confirmed Sunday.
	   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper revealed Murdoch had made a 575
million pound (dlrs 950 million) bid to buy soccer giant Manchester
United.
	   According to the Sunday Telegraph, Murdoch has already
negotiated a deal with United chairman Martin Edwards. Edwards, the
paper says, is selling his 14 percent stake in the club for 80
million pounds (dlrs 132 million).
	   Manchester United director Maurice Watkins said Sunday he would
not elaborate on the club's plans but would have something to say
on Monday.
	   ``I certainly don't think we will have any more to say at this
stage,'' he said. ``There is likely to be a more formal statement
sometime tomorrow morning.''
	   Although the reported move was described as pure speculation by
officials of Murdoch's satellite TV company BSkyB, the prospect of
his buying one of the world's most famous and financially
successful clubs would make a huge impact on soccer business in
Britain.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain with very few live games being shown on regular
terrestrial stations on the BBC and ITV. Sky also has exclusive
rights to cover England's games such as Saturday's European
Championship qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   Tim Allen, BSkyB's director of corporate communications, told
Sky News early Sunday: ``The reports are speculation, but it's
understood there have been negotiations.''
	   Sky news later confirmed that Murdoch was negotiating with
Manchester United.
	   The sale of England's wealthiest club, which was floated on the
stock market in 1991, to BSkyB could give the broadcasting company
a stranglehold on the television and marketing rights to Premier
League football.
	   Manchester United's own television network called `MU TV' is
preparing to launch later this week and, if the a sale to Murdoch
went through, it is likely that the only way of seeing the team
play would be through pay-per-view TV.
	   Although United has a 55,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford,
almost all the seats go to season ticket holders and the waiting
list for the few that become available is several years long.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks said the deal could be
subjected to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.
	   ``There are clear implications here that make me feel that this
is not something that can just be treated as if it were just a
normal takeover of one publicly quoted company by another,'' Banks
said Sunday.
	   ``If you buy up the biggest football club in the country then
clearly the implications for commercial policy are fairly
profound.''
	   ``There is already an Office of Fair Trading examination of the
deal between the Premier League and BSkyB, which is due out soon
and reference to the Office of Fair Trading would be something that
ministers could do.''
	   Manchester United Independent Supporters Association chairman
Andy Walsh said one man did not have the right to sell the success
the club had built-up over 100 years on a whim.
	   ``Rupert Murdoch will rape and pillage Manchester United,'' he
said.
	   Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty, who has been an
outspoken critic of the way the club has been run while remaining a
fan of the team, said the supporters would never forgive chairman
and chief executive Edwards if he did sell out to Murdoch.
	   ``Once Murdoch gets hold of the club he will no longer have to
negotiate with the Premier League over the introduction of
pay-per-view,'' Docherty said.
	   ``I don't think he will stop there, I think he might try to get
hold of another couple of top clubs yet.
	   ``Everything will be geared towards television, there will be no
fans sitting in the stands, they will all behind glass entertaining
their business clients.
	   ``The game has already moved away from the true fans and this
type of thing just dilutes the passion even more,'' Docherty said.
	   ``If this deal goes through I would no longer support the club
because from a football point of view it just wouldn't be the same.
	   ``Martin Edwards is not a football man and never has been. He
has already made a lot of money selling shares and good luck to him
but I don't think the fans would ever forgive for selling out to
Murdoch,'' the former manager said.
	   ``That club is worth 1 billion (pounds) and for Murdoch to get
his hands on it would be like winning the Lottery.''
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   England's Football Association spokesman Steve Double said he
was waiting for a public statement from Old Trafford but the game's
governing body would consult with lawyers to discuss the
ramifications of a Murdoch take-over.

Judge okays extradition of U.S. teen-ager accused of murder

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Sheinbein would be charged as adult in Maryland, but

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a case that had strained relations between
the United States and Israel, an Israeli judge ruled Sunday that an
American teen-ager wanted for murder can be returned to Maryland to
face the charges.
	   But 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein will not be immediately
extradited. His lawyer has 50 days to appeal the decision to the
Israeli Supreme Court, and the delay could run to months while the
appeal is heard.
	   Sheinbein, a suspect in the brutal murder last year of Alfredo
Tello Jr., remained expressionless when the decision was announced.
Sheinbein's brother draped an arm around him as their mother,
Victoria, cried nearby.
	   District Judge Moshe Ravid upheld Sheinbein's claim to Israeli
citizen but, in a surprise, said that this was not enough to
protect him from prosecution abroad. Israeli law allows for
citizens to be tried in Israel instead of being extradited.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in the
56-page decision.
	   Sheinbein's lawyer, former Justice Minister David Libai, said he
was ``very surprised'' by the decision and would soon appeal it.
His client will remain in an Israeli jail until the Supreme Court's
decision on the case, which could take several months, Libai said.
	   ``This is a very new and original interpretation of the law,''
Libai told reporters after the decision.
	   U.S. Embassy Spokesman Larry Schwartz said the United States
welcomed the decision and looked forward to further cooperation on
the case with Israeli officials in the event of an appeal.
	   ``It is uncertain when Sheinbein will return to the United
States if he appeals the decision. At the beginning of the process
Israeli officials estimated it might take a year or more. We plan
to discuss the decision and arrangements for Sheinbein's return to
the United States with Israeli authorities soon,'' Schwartz said.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Tello was discovered in the garage of an empty
house near the Sheinbein home in Silver Spring, Maryland. Shortly
after arriving, he was picked up by police and hospitalized
briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's lawyer fought the U.S.
extradition request based on the citizenship law.
	   The claims caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and
threatened relations between the two allies. Members of the U.S.
Congress called for delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was
not returned.
	   But the United States backed down when Israel's Justice Ministry
rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims.
	   Libai said the family had brought Sheinbein to Israel in part to
prevent him from committing suicide. He said that, in the wake of
anger in the Hispanic community, that the family was concerned that
Sheinbein would become the target for revenge attacks, especially
in U.S. jails.
	   ``The family is worried that inmates could take revenge,'' Libai
told The Associated Press.
	   The Maryland resident would be tried as an adult in the United
States even though he allegedly committed the crime at the age of
17. But Libai said the Israeli judicial system could try Sheinbein
as a minor, which would minimize the sentence if he was found
guilty.
	   Youths convicted of murders in Israel usually receive 16-year
sentences as opposed to adults whose average sentence is 24 years.
	   Israeli legal officials have said a murder trial in Israel would
be very expensive since witnesses, aides, evidence and the victim's
family would have to be flown to the country.
	   In addition, prison life in Israel is much less severe than in
the United States since murders and rapes are uncommon, and many
prisoners get one week end off a month after the first quarter of
the sentence.
	   Neither Sheinbein nor the family would comment on the court
decision Sunday. Prior to the decision, the father, Sol, kicked a
photographer in frustration after journalists pushed past him to
get pictures of his son.
	   Sol Sheinbein was charged in Maryland with helping his son to
flee the United States.

Fighters beat BlueWave 7-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson drove in two runs and Kip Gross
pitched a three-hitter over five innings as the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters beat the Orix BlueWave 7-5 at
Tokyo Dome Sunday.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, doubled home a run
in the six-run third inning and hit his 27th homer of the season in
the seventh.
	   Gross, formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, is 1-1 this
season.
	   The Fighters are 1 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Seibu
Lions, who blanked the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 6-0 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   Hisanori Yokota, 31, held the Hawks to three hits for his fifth
victory against eight defeats this season and his first shutout
victory in 11 years.
	   The Lions' Domingo Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A
Rochester team, hit a two-run home run, his 24th homer of the
season, in the eighth inning.
	   At Chiba, the Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Chiba Lotte Marines
tied 2-2 in 12 innings _ the Pacific League limit for
regular-season games.
	   The Buffaloes led 2-1 on Tuffy Rhodes' second home run of the
game in the sixth, but the Marines tied on Kiyoshi Hatsushiba's
one-run single in the eighth.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 20 homers.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose singled home one run in the
second inning and Takanori Suzuki drove in the other in the third
with a ground ball as the Yokohama BayStars beat the Chunichi
Dragons 2-0 at Nagoya Dome.
	   Rose formerly played for the California Angels.
	   The BayStars, who extended their winning streak to four, are
five games ahead of the second-place Dragons, who suffered their
third straight defeat.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, the Yomiuri Giants rapped out 15 hits,
including a two-run home run by Hideki Matsui, and downed the
Yakult Swallows 8-2.
	   Matsui has 30 homers and leads the league.
	   At Toyama, Nathan Minchey scattered six hits over eight innings
and Itsuki Asai singled home the first run in the second inning as
the Hiroshima Toyo Carp blanked the Hanshin Tigers 2-0.
	   Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, is 12-9.

Pope speaks out against horoscopes, psychics; urges prayer instead

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II urged people
Sunday to turn to prayer rather than psychics and astrology when
they're looking for guidance, delivering a tough message in a
nation where horoscopes and lucky lotto numbers preoccupy many.
	   John Paul, speaking from his window at his summer retreat
outside Rome, noted it was a time of year when many were returning
to school, returning to work, and laying plans for the future.
	   ``If we want to plan our lives well, we must learn to decipher
the design written in the mysterious signals that God has put in
our daily stories,'' the pope told the faithful gathered below for
his weekly Sunday speech.
	   ``For this, neither horoscopes nor magic forecasts work,'' he
said. ``What works is prayer, real prayer, coupled always with a
choice of life that conforms with the law of God.''
	   ``No one but God knows our future and can guide our steps in the
right direction.''
	   In Italy, in particular, matters psychic have a high profile in
everyday life. Morning TV shows air daily horoscopes and celebrity
interviews offer such tips as how to decode dreams to get the best
lottery numbers.

Thai national soccer team offers to quit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ All players on Thailand's national
soccer team have offered to quit following their poor performance
in last week's Tiger Cup tournament in Vietnam, which included them
trying to lose a match, Thai newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Indonesia and Thailand were fined the maximum dlrs 40,000 each
Friday by the ASEAN Football Federation for failing to play to win
during their Aug. 31 match.
	   Both teams had sought to lose to avoid traveling to Hanoi from
Ho Chi Minh City to play Vietnam's team. Indonesia resorted to
kicking the ball into its own goal in the penultimate minute to
ensure its loss.
	   The poor performance drew outcries from fans and fines and
criticism from a number of sporting bodies.
	   For the Thai team, the shame continued when it suffered an
unexpected 3-0 defeat at the hands of Vietnam in the semifinals.
	   Before returning to Thailand Sunday, team captain Natee
Thongsukkaew told reporters Saturday that ``we realized that we
failed to deliver at the tournament and have let down the Thai
fans.''
	   Natee was quoted by the newspaper The Nation as saying the team
had been extremely discouraged by the criticism.
	   The offer to quit followed team manager Thirachai Vuthitham's
resignation last week.
	   ``The team manager has shown his responsibility for the team's
poor performance. Individuals should not be blamed, let everyone
pay the price,'' Natee declared, saying he was speaking on behalf
of the team.
	   If the resignations are approved by the Football Association of
Thailand, the whole team must be replaced within three months
before the Asian Games in Bangkok in December.
	   Indonesia has already pulled its national team out of the Asian
Games, The Nation reported.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 16th graf, `I'm personally ...,' to fix typo in
`select.' &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will meet face to face on
Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an attempt to agree on
forming a new government to handle Russia's burgeoning economic
crisis, his press service confirmed.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communist-dominated parliament has already
rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said Sunday that he would hold talks
Monday with eight members of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, eight members of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Communist deputy speaker of the Duma appealed to all sides
to reach an agreement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Svetlana Goryacheva urged opposition lawmakers to ``brush aside
ambitions, think of Russia's future and conclude an agreement with
the authorities.''
	   She said that many lawmakers ``have utterly forgotten about
Russia and become entangled in political games and lengthy
discussions.''
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. Chernomyrdin held the job for five years before
being fired in March and rehired Aug. 23 as Russia's economy went
into a tailspin.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   Chernomyrdin sent a message Sunday to the finance ministers of
Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help of
the international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``I want to stress that in the process of deep economic
transformation, we are seeking active relations with our partners
in the G-8 and international financial organizations,''
Chernomyrdin said. ``We value their attention and aid.''
	   Chernomyrdin's letter was a response to Britain's decision to
call an emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.
	   The Communists and their hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin for creating Russia's current predicament. On Saturday
they said they had as many as nine alternatives for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats and the
speaker of the Federation Council, Yegor Stroyev.
	   The State Duma is scheduled to consider the matter again Monday,
after meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Stroyev told reporters Sunday that he doesn't want the job.
	   ``I'm personally interested in pulling the country out of the
crisis and it is necessary to select a candidate of accord to
implement this idea,'' Stroyev said.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Federation Council passed a non-binding motion on Friday
endorsing Chernomyrdin, putting pressure on the Duma to confirm his
appointment.
	   But the governor of the Samara region, chairman of the Council's
budget committee, said Sunday that Chernomyrdin ``cannot lead the
country out of the crisis, whoever joins his Cabinet.''
	   Konstantin Titov told Interfax that Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor
and one of the opposition's proposed candidates for prime minister,
was someone who ``can consolidate the nation.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's long-time soccer powerhouse
Anderlecht struggled Sunday to come to terms with its heaviest
league defeat since 1937, a 6-0 thrashing by first division
newcomers Westerlo.
	   ``We are all ashamed of this result. The supporters are ashamed.
I hope the players are ashamed,'' said club Chairman Roger Vanden
Stock.
	   The defeat Saturday night left the Brussels team with just two
points from four games. Anderlecht fell to bottom of the first
division Sunday after Kortrijk's victory over Oostende left the
``mauve and whites'' as the only team without a win.
	   Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times. Westerlo is
enjoying only its second season in the first division.
	   Anderlecht officials blamed the defeat on the injuries to
Belgian internationals Enzo Scifo and Lorenzo Staelens and the
absence of Swedish striker Par Zetterberg on duty with his national
team.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami
claimed election victory Sunday over the governing socialists for
his conservative party, which is advocating putting Malta back on
track for EU membership.
	   Labor leader and Prime Minister Alfred Sant, conceding defeat,
announced that he had handed in his resignation to Malta's
president.
	   ``I have been advised that the projections will confirm our
win,'' Fenech Adami told wildly cheering supporters from a balcony
of his headquarters.
	   Official results are expected Monday. In past elections,
supporters of losers have gone on rampages on this tiny island
where politics is a feverish passion, and Fenech Adami, who was
defeated by Sant in 1996, the previous parliamentary elections,
appealed for calm.
	   ``We are one people,'' he said. ``Remember, we are all Maltese
brothers and sisters.
	   About 95 percent of the 278,000 eligible voters turned out
Saturday in an election called three years early by Sant in hopes
of strengthening his Labor party's sometime tenuous one-vote
majority in the 65-seat parliament.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Comparing Kosovo to Rwanda, a top
U.S. official toured a devastated area of the Serbian province on
Sunday and pushed for independent investigations into reported
massacres.
	   John Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official,
demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow access to
forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
	   U.S. Sen. Bob Dole accompanied him on his fact-finding tour,
which comes amid a push to stop the bloodshed and prevent further
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died and
an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes since
February, when Serb forces launched a crackdown on armed
secessionists in the largely Albanian-populated province.
	   Authorities are unwilling, Shattuck said, ``to confront the fact
that massive war crimes have been committed here, and probably are
going to be committed, and (they) have to be fully investigated and
prosecuted.''
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights said he
would make that point when he reports his findings to the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Ahead of a Monday meeting in Belgrade between the U.S. officials
and Milosevic, Dole said the Yugoslav leader must be ready for a
cease-fire or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   Their 150-kilometer (90-mile) drive took them through the
war-torn towns of Kijevo, Decane and Malisevo in southwestern
Kosovo, an area lined with bombed-out brick houses, stray cattle
and very few civilians.
	   ``The only other place I have seen as eerie as this is in
Rwanda,'' said Shattuck, standing on a hillside overlooking a
charred suburb of Decane.
	   Groups of stray dogs barked or tore the flesh of dead cows amid
dozens of roofless brick houses. Stray horses, many still bridled,
wandered among the heavily laden grapevines and cornfields of the
uninhabited area.
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting Sunday, although
the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Serb police
exchanged fire late Saturday with gunmen in the northern town of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers gave
final approval to a measure to halt commercial flights to
Yugoslavia because of the situation in Kosovo. Serbia is the larger
of two republics that comprise Yugoslavia, and federal troops
participated in the crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The flight ban, which is one of several international sanctions
aimed at ending the violence, was announced in June. But Greek
resistance had threatened to undermine further the EU's already
weak standing in the Kosovo crisis.
	   The four-car convoy carrying Dole, Shattuck and other Western
officials did see an ethnic Albanian home ablaze in Kijevo, where
Serbian police patrolled nearly empty streets. Serb forces have
embarked on a scorched-earth campaign for months, trying to
extinguish resistance and drive out ethnic Albanians.
	   The officials also visited a site near the former Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold of Orahovac, where the Serbs say they
buried up to 40 ethnic Albanian fighters.
	   Dole, who heads the non-governmental International Commission
for Missing Persons, said he will seek assurances that Serb
security forces are not harming hundreds of men whom they recently
detained in ethnic Albanian villages.
	   In bombed-out Orahovac, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs who
returned after intense fighting in July clamored around the
entourage to relate stories of missing or dead relatives. Dozens
more crowded the doorway of the Serbian Red Cross center to receive
portions of flour, cooking oil and pasta.
	   ``What we have seen is tremendous suffering, suffering that will
only escalate dramatically once winter sets in a month from now,''
Dole said. ``We also heard testimony from eyewitnesses to some of
the crimes and atrocities. These accounts were chilling.
	   ``This is a war against civilians for political purposes,'' he
said.

Louise Woodward says she's had 50 marriage proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Louise Woodward, the former au pair convicted of
killing an American baby, says she has had some 50 proposals of
marriage from lovestruck suitors, The Sunday Times reported.
	   ``I tend to get a lot of gifts from them: Valentine things like
flowers and chocolates,'' Ms. Woodward, 20, was quoted as saying in
her first newspaper interview since returning to Britain.
	   ``You always get people who see a picture or your face on TV and
fall in love with it. They tend to keep my photograph by their
bed.''
	   Until last week, Ms. Woodward had kept a low public profile
since returning June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld her
conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen. He died of head injuries in February 1997 while in
her care.
	   She promised not to sell her story _ which would be
controversial anyway as British media guidelines generally bar
convicted criminals from profiting from their stories.
	   However, last Monday Ms. Woodward stepped into the limelight by
taking part with her American lawyer Barry Scheck in a public
debate on allowing TV cameras into court rooms. Ms. Woodward
maintained that television turned her trial into a soap opera.
	   She said in the newspaper interview that she has a bulging mail
bag and an Internet site on which people pass on messages to her
lawyers.
	   Some letters, she said, came from ``loonies,'' but none was
scary. ``I've got lots of friends out there,'' she said.
	   She has had many offers for interviews in Britain and one to do
some modeling. ``But I won't do a Monica Lewinsky,'' added Ms.
Woodward in an apparent reference to a photoshoot in Vanity Fair by
the White House intern who had a relationship with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
	   The Sunday Times said a lawyer was present during the interview
and kept interrupting and banning questions. The newspaper did not
identity the lawyer but said Ms. Woodward regularly invoked
Scheck's name and ``banters continually'' with her attorney.

Hoddle insists he's not ready to quit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle, under
increasing pressure to stand down after his side lost its opening
Euro 2000 qualifer to Sweden, insisted Sunday he would not quit.
	   He said he had two years to run on his England contract and was
considering an extension as England's Football Association pushed
for contract negotiations.
	   England slumped to a 2-1 loss in Stockholm on Saturday despite
scoring the first goal after 76 seconds through captain Alan
Shearer.
	   It was England's first match since it was eliminated from the
France 98 World Cup by Argentina in a second-round penalty
shoot-out.
	   Since the World Cup, Hoddle has come under fire for allegedly
betraying the confidences of players in his controversial World Cup
diary and for using faith healer Eileen Drewery in team
preparation.
	   Hoddle has been linked with a move to his old club Tottenham to
replace Christian Gross as manager _ a move described as ``an
escape route'' in a Mail on Sunday headline.
	   But Hoddle said the loss to Sweden was not a disaster and did
not threaten his job.
	   ``The disappointment for me as a football manager is the three
points we lost,'' he said Sunday.
	   ``...you get criticised in the job. I've been criticised in the
past and it'll happen in the future no doubt. The bottom line is
that we've got to respond.
	   ``If there were two games to go in the (Euro 2000) qualifying
stages and running out of time and points, then obviously it would
be one hell of a task but we've still got a lot of points on the
board to get.''
	   Hoddle said his team's confident start against Sweden proved the
rumoured rift in the team _ caused by revelations in his book and
criticism of him in a a book published by veteran defender Tony
Adams _ did not exist.

Khamenei: Iran will not clash with Taliban

freed men were abducted a year ago. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, says that the country will not enter into a military
confrontation with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, the Tehran Times
reported Sunday.
	   The statement came amid concerns in the U.S. intelligence
community that Iran was poised for an incursion into Afghanistan.
Iran last week massed troops and equipment on the border for
military exercises.
	   Iran also has warned the Taliban religious army that it would
take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of Iranians believed
held captive by the militia.
	   The English-language Tehran Times quoted Khamenei's comments
from a question-and-answer session last Thursday at Teachers
Training University.
	   He said he was ``personally following the developments of Iran
related to Afghanistan'' and ``assured that there will be no
confrontation with the Taliban,'' the paper said.
	   The paper did not say why there was a delay in reporting the
comments of Khamenei, who also is commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians, including 11
diplomats and a journalist from the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the diplomats, and
Iranian officials fear they may have been killed.
	   The Afghan militia acknowledged holding some Iranian truck
drivers, and on Thursday freed five of them. They arrived in Tehran
on Sunday, IRNA reported.
	   The drivers, who were received at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport by
their families and officials from the Foreign Ministry, said they
were held in the southern city of Kandahar along with several dozen
other Iranians.
	   The freed drivers said they had no information about the
diplomats or the IRNA correspondent.
	   Later, Tehran radio reported that two of the freed men were
traders who were captured in Afghanistan about a year ago.
	   The broadcast, which was monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation, did not provide further details.

Yeltsin to meet Monday with lawmakers, unions, to forge deal

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia still wants aid and cooperation from the
West, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Sunday on the
eve of a crucial meeting that could help determine the makeup and
course of Russia's new government.
	   Chernomyrdin sent a message to the finance ministers of Britain,
Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help of the
international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Russia news agencies reported.
	   ``I want to stress that in the process of deep economic
transformation, we are seeking active relations with our partners
in the G-8 and international financial organizations,''
Chernomyrdin said. ``We value their attention and aid.''
	   Chernomyrdin's letter was a response to Britain's decision to
call an emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.
	   Russia is in the midst of one of its most serious economic and
political crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The economy has been in freefall, with the government devaluing
the ruble and effectively defaulting on foreign loans. And ever
since President Boris Yeltsin fired the previous Cabinet headed by
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, the country has been groping its
way through the crisis without a government.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has so far
opposed Yeltsin's nomination of Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
Chernomyrdin headed the government for five years before Kiriyenko
took over earlier this year, and the political opposition blames
him for the country's predicament.
	   Yeltsin will meet face to face on Monday with lawmakers and
union leaders in an attempt to agree on forming a new government,
his press service said.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming Chernomyrdin. The
Communist-dominated Duma has already rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said he would meet with eight members of
each house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Duma is scheduled to vote on Chernomyrdin later in the day.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Communist deputy speaker of the Duma appealed to all sides
to reach an agreement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Svetlana Goryacheva urged opposition lawmakers to ``brush aside
ambitions, think of Russia's future and conclude an agreement with
the authorities.''
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not yet caused serious unrest, but Yeltsin's most
radical opponents have tried to exploit it. Viktor Anpilov, head of
the radical Russian Labor movement, led a small but angry
demonstration of mostly elderly communists near the Kremlin on
Sunday, and called for a military coup.
	   ``Force! Force!'' the crowd shouted as Anpilov said, ``We have
to work with the army.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Turkey on Sunday called for
closer security cooperation among Middle Eastern countries to
combat terrorism and bring stability to the volatile region.
	   Speaking to reporters, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
reaffirmed that increased security cooperation between his country
and Israel should not been seen as a threat to Arabs states.
	   ``Our military cooperation with Israel is not directed against
any country in the region,'' Yilmaz said after a 90-minute meeting
with his Jordanian counterpart, Fayez Tarawneh.
	   ``Any country which attaches importance to the peace and
stability in the region and is not involved in terrorism is invited
to this cooperation,'' he added.
	   However, Tarawneh, sitting next to Yilmaz, said: ``We are not
part of any coalition or any alliance of a security nature.''
	   But he added: ``The region needs a security cooperation, in a
global definition and comprehensive nature, against terrorism and
full understanding of good neighborhood relations that would put
the region in most stable condition.''
	   Later, Crown Prince Hassan said at another news conference that
the Middle East should follow the footsteps of the Koreas and set
up a ``methodology'' to discuss security concerns because the
region lacks a ``conflict resolution or conflict prevention
initiative of any kind.''
	   ``We're living in this region in a very congested area, an area
where any weapon of mass destruction effectively can destroy us
here as we speak,'' Hassan said following a one-hour meeting with
Yilmaz.
	   ``We are living in the smoking area,'' he added.
	   Hassan said with ``the Korean peninsula developing compensation
over weapons of mass destruction, it is ironic and sad that this is
the only region in the world where there is no security agenda or
identity.''

Irish police make largest seizure of cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish police said Sunday they have
intercepted a consignment of prime cocaine valued at around 100
million pounds (dlrs 160 million) from a Spanish-registered yacht,
the largest seizure of drugs in the Irish Republic.
	   Police seized more than 650 pounds (300 kilograms) of the drug
from the catamaran Gemeos, which put into the southwest Irish port
of Kinsale last week. A British man and an Irishman who were aboard
have been held for questioning, but a third man escaped.
	   ``The tests have shown the cocaine is of an extremely high level
of purity,'' with a very high street value, said a police
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Police said the yacht had come from the Caribbean, but they
believe the drugs originated in Colombia. News reports said they
suspect much of the stash was destined for sale in Britain.

Greens want coalition with Social Democrats, but reject
</HEADLINE>
pre-conditions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The Greens, pushing to join in a
government with the leftist Social Democratic Party after Germany's
Sept. 27 elections, on Sunday rejected pre-conditions set by SPD
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   At the same time, top Greens members Juergen Trittin and Joschka
Fischer said they could accept forming a coalition with the SPD
even with a single vote majority in parliament, to unseat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative-centrist government of 16
years.
	   Despite protests by the environmentalist Greens, Schroeder has
said he will not derail a 9.8 billion marks (dlrs 5.5 billion)
planned magnetic train link between Hamburg and Berlin by 2005. The
plan would cut travel time for the 297-kilometer (185-mile) trip by
two-thirds, to about an hour.
	   The Greens have challenged the project because of its cost and
charge the powerful electromagnetic force that will drive the train
could have adverse health consequences for humans and animals.
	   Trittin was quoted by the Berliner Mogrenpost newspaper as
saying he could not understand how Schroeder could repeatedly talk
about controlling public financing, but not about the economic
results of the so-called ``Transrapid'' train.
	   In an interview to appear in Monday editions of the economics
daily, Handelsblatt, Greens executive board spokeswoman, Gunda
Roestel, said the party rejects Schroeder's insistence on
construction of the Transrapid and other projects as pre-conditions
for a coalition.
	   Latest polls show the Social Democrats lead by 41 percent of
some 2,000 people asked if the elections were held now, to 37
percent for Kohl's conservatives, with the Greens at 6 percent, and
the centrist Free Democrats, Kohl's junior coalition partners, at
the bare 5 percent needed to get into parliament.
	   That leaves many speculating that the most likely arrangement
would be an SPD-Greens coalition if Kohl's conservatives are
defeated.
	   In an interview in Monday's editions of Der Spiegel weekly,
Fischer, the Greens faction leader in parliament, said the party
would form a coalition with the SPD even with a ``one vote,''
majority.
	   Decisive is reaching a coalition agreement ``in which the fringe
elements of both factions feel included,'' Fischer said.
	   While the Greens are banking on getting into a coalition and
gaining their first direct voice in running Germany, Schroeder has
said he is leaving the door open for all considerations, including
a possible grand coalition with Kohl's conservatives. That thought
has been largely rejected by Kohl's side.

Struver claims European Masters title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with quotes, detail, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany's Sven Struver won
the first hole of a playoff over Sweden's Patrik Sjoland on Sunday
to win the European Masters.
	   Struver, who began the day four shots back of the Swede, nailed
down the victory when he birdied the first extra-hole, draining a
pressure-packed four-foot putt on the tricky par-4 18th.
	   Minutes earlier, Struver had sunk an almost identical putt on
the same hole to set up the playoff.
	   The 31-year-old German carded a final round 5-under 66, while
Sjoland, the leader after three rounds struggled to a 1-under 70.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, No. 2 on the European Tour
money list, rallied with a 4-under 67 to finish third just
two-strokes back of the leaders. His third place finish, however,
was not enough to move into the European No. 1 spot in front of Lee
Westwood, who shot a final round 3-under 68 to finish nine shots
off the pace.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, the 1996 European champion and
five-time European No. 1, also finished nine shots back after
carding a final round 4-under 67.
	   Last year's winner Costantino Rocca of Italy was fourth, five
shots back after firing a 3-under 68.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers have detected signals
coming from one of Swissair Flight 111's missing recorders, but
preliminary dives failed to locate it under the sea, officials
said.
	   Search commanders said Saturday that a Canadian submarine had
detected signals coming from one of the recorders. The recorders
could provide clues into the cause of the crash late Wednesday that
killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Divers working at a depth of 190 feet (58 meters) tried to
pinpoint the location, but were hindered by limited visibility
Saturday. Divers went in again briefly Sunday, but were stymied by
murky water and hoped to resume their search later. Also Sunday,
two ships were back out performing sonar probes.
	   Searchers said Saturday that sonar probes had detected a
cylindrical object, about 30 feet (9 meters) long, on the seabed.
Whether it was part of the fuselage or just a rock remained to be
determined, navy Capt. Phil Webster said.

Report: Group allegedly spying for Israel arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ More than 20 people have been arrested on
suspicion of spying for Israel, a Beirut newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The arrests followed a recent Lebanese army sweep of Beirut's
southern suburbs, Ad Diyar newspaper said.
	   The suspects allegedly were providing information to a
Cyprus-based branch of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service,
the paper said, quoting unidentified sources.
	   It did not say what kind of information the suspects
communicated.
	   The latest arrests are believed to be separate from a 77-person
spy ring the government said it uncovered in July.
	   The paper's report could not immediately be confirmed by
security officials.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids
contacts with the Jewish state.

India's floods may slow growth rate and raise food prices
</HEADLINE>

	   PARSASHUKRULLAH, India (AP) _ Floodwaters that began to rise two
months ago have submerged hundreds of acres (hectares) of ready
crops, threatening a plunge in India's annual foodgrain production
and a steep rise in food prices.
	   Experts say the floods will hurt an economy already hit by
recession, especially after the government listed agriculture as
its top priority in its first annual budget this year.
	   ``This could push down the government's projected growth rate of
over 6 percent, and prices will go up,'' said leading economist
S.P. Gupta, chairman of the Society for Social and Economic
Transition in New Delhi. ``There will be an inflation buildup, and
I don't know how long the present value of the rupee can be
maintained.''
	   On Sunday, 10 more people died in the swirling floodwater,
raising the number of dead to 1,625 since the monsoon rains broke
over northern India in early July. Officials in Lucknow, capital of
the worst hit state, that of Uttar Pradesh, said floods swept over
18 more villages Sunday, inundating 2,500 acres (1,000 hectares) of
standing crops.
	   Floods regularly ravage India's eastern region. But this year's
floods, the worst in nearly 60 years, wrecked agrarian communities
across northern and eastern India _ in Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Bihar
and West Bengal, where more than 325 million people live.
	   Ajit Kumar Singh, an economist at the Giri Institute of
Development Studies, an independent think-tank in Lucknow, said the
damage to crops, and the resulting shortfall in foodgrain, could
cause food prices to increase all over the country.
	   Other economists and government officials shrugged off the
pessimistic predictions, saying India's economy, heavily dependent
for decades on agriculture, has the resilience to deal with natural
calamities like floods.
	   ``The economy now has the depth and flexibility to handle sudden
depths in agriculture,'' said former federal minister Yoginder
Alagh, a top agricultural economist.
	   Officials have estimated the total damage to agriculture, houses
and industrial production at more than 63 billion rupees (dlrs 1.5
billion) in Uttar Pradesh alone, where the gross domestic product
is 900 billion rupees (dlrs 24 billion).
	   ``There is considerable damage to a lot of crops, but on a
balance sheet I will still count this year as a normal year _ the
losses will be made up by other crops,'' said Mangala Rai, deputy
director of the government run Indian Council of Agricultural
Research in New Delhi.
	   That's not quite the case for Kamal Ahmad Khan. Last year,
tractors plowed furrows in his sugarcane field in the village of
Parsashukrullah, 640 kilometers (400 miles) southeast of the Indian
capital, New Delhi. This year, motorized boats roar by.
	   ``It was an excellent crop. I hoped to earn a lot,'' said Khan,
one of 14 million people whose homes have either been marooned or
washed away.

Struver claims European Masters title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with quotes, detail, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany's Sven Struver won
the first hole of a playoff over Sweden's Patrik Sjoland on Sunday
to win the European Masters.
	   Struver, who began the day four shots back of the Swede, nailed
down the victory when he birdied the first extra hole, draining a
pressure-packed 4-foot (1.2-meter) putt on the tricky par-4 18th.
	   Minutes earlier, Struver had sunk an almost identical putt on
the same hole to set up the playoff.
	   The 31-year-old German carded a final round 5-under 66, while
Sjoland, the leader after three rounds, struggled to a 1-under 70.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, No. 2 on the European Tour
money list, rallied with a 4-under 67 to finish third just two
strokes back of the leaders. His third place finish, however, was
not enough to move him into the European No. 1 spot in front of Lee
Westwood, who shot a final round 3-under 68 to finish nine shots
off the pace.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, the 1996 European champion and
five-time European No. 1, also finished nine shots back after
carding a final round 4-under 67.
	   Last year's winner, Costantino Rocca of Italy was, fourth, five
shots back after firing a 3-under 68.

Gross says he was forced to leave Tottenham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sacked Tottenham coach Christian Gross said Sunday
he was forced to leave the Premier League team prematurely after
only 10 months in charge.
	   Gross, whose sudden departure was announced in a Tottenham
statement on Saturday, called a press conference Sunday, where he
said he shouldn't have been judged after three games this season.
	   ``I didn't go, I had to go,'' Gross said.
	   ``I am disappointed but for me the months I have spent in
England have been a success.
	   ``I came in at a difficult time when the situation was really
serious, and the fact we avoided relegation was a big success.''
	   Tottenham struggled to avoid relegation last season and then
conceeded six goals in losing its first two games this season
before a 1-0 win over Everton at Liverpool last week.
	   ``I think it is too short to judge me and decide my fate. It is
not a failure for me to be judged after three games, especially
after a big win at Everton,'' he said.
	   ``I am not angry, I am disappointed.''
	   Gross, who coached Grasshoppers to two Switzerland league
championships in succession before taking over at Tottenham in
November last year, said he was leaving the club in good shape.
	   ``This is the first time results have not gone well for me (as
manager) but I have to deal with this in a positive way and I will
do so,'' he said.
	   ``The players have not been unsupportive but I came in with new
methods and maybe it was hard for them at the beginning, but now
they are used to it and I felt the team was behind me.
	   ``I have my way of doing things and I am convinced it is the
right way.
	   ``I don't think I made too many mistakes and I am leaving behind
a club in an excellent mood, otherwise we wouldn't have had such a
big result at Everton.''
	   Gross faced the media Sunday flanked by Tottenham chairman Alan
Sugar, the man who sacked him.
	   Sugar said continual negative media coverage of Gross' term in
charge at Spurs forced him into sacking the Swiss coach on
Saturday.
	   ``I think one has to say we were faced with an untenable
situation created...by the media, and the board felt that Christian
_ no matter how professional or how good he is _ had been destroyed
by the media. It is as simple as that,'' he said.
	   However, Sugar said it was not a knee-jerk reaction to a poor
start to the season or in response to demands by hundreds of fans
who demonstrated outside White Hart Lane two weeks ago chanting for
Gross to be sacked.
	   Gross refused to resign after the protest but speculation about
his tenure had been mounting for weeks before Sugar announced the
move, unexpectedly on a weekend when no Premier League games were
being played due to Euro 2000 qualifiers.
	   Tottenham has not announced a new manager, although former
players Hoddle and German striker Jurgen Klinsmann have reportedly
been approached.
	   David Pleat, Tottenham director of football, will act as
temporary manager.

Buckingham Palace will study report on overhauling the monarchy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Buckingham Palace promised Sunday to study a
report by an influential ``think tank'' that proposes overhauling
the monarchy to eliminate the sovereign's remaining political and
religious functions _ but said any changes to the present system
are a matter for Parliament.
	   The report by the left wing group Demos does not call for
abolition of the monarchy. But it says a referendum should be held
on the next monarch and that if it were negative, it would open the
way for people to vote in favor of Britain becoming a republic.
	   ''The Demos report is another contribution to the general
constitutional debate'' around the monarchy, said a Buckingham
Palace spokeswoman. ``Whilst we will read the report with interest,
any issues of constitutional reform would be a matter for
Parliament to decide.''
	   She added that ``the constitutional role and other aspects of
the monarchy have evolved over many years and have continued to do
so during this reign.''
	   The Demos group is reported to have influenced government
thinking on a number of vital domestic issues, and one of its
founders now works at Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
office.
	   But Downing Street has said the report does not reflect the
government's views and that no one in the government was involved
in drawing it up.
	   ''The report has nothing to do with the government,'' a
spokesman said Sunday, speaking anonymously.
	   The report suggests that the monarch's role should be that of
head of state, but that he or she should have ``minimal connection
with the executive, the legislature or the judiciary.''
	   That would mean the monarch would no longer appoint the prime
minister, dissolve Parliament, appoint judges, or give the final
assent allowing bills to become laws.
	   The report calls on the royals to use state schools and
hospitals, to offer awards for educational achievements at schools
in deprived areas and open their accounts to more public scrutiny.
	   The 1559 law that makes the monarch the head of the Church of
England, should be repealed, suggests the report, to be published
formally on Monday.
	   The monarch's present role is largely symbolic and government
ministers must approve her official actions and statements.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami on
Sunday claimed election victory over the governing socialists for
his conservative party, which is advocating putting Malta back on
track for European Union membership.
	   Labor leader and Prime Minister Alfred Sant, conceding defeat,
announced that he had handed in his resignation to Malta's
president.
	   Official results were expected sometime on Monday, but party
officials have access to partial tallies of the handwritten
ballots. Nationalist party sources said the winning percentage of
votes was expected to be close to the lines of Fenech Adami's 1992
victory, when he won nearly 52 percent of the vote, and that Labor
would get approximately 4 percent less.
	   ``I have been advised that the projections will confirm our
win,'' Fenech Adami, 64, who had back-to-back terms as premier from
1987-1996, told wildly cheering supporters from a balcony of his
headquarters.
	   In past elections, supporters of losers have gone on rampages on
this tiny island, where politics is a feverish passion. Fenech
Adami, who was defeated by Sant in 1996, called for calm.
	   ``We are one people,'' Fenech Adami said. ``Remember, we are all
Maltese brothers and sisters.
	   About 95 percent of the 278,000 eligible voters turned out
Saturday in an election called three years early by Sant in hopes
of strengthening his Labor party's sometimes tenuous one-vote
majority in the 65-seat parliament.
	   Shortly after coming to office in 1996, Sant, 50, froze Malta's
EU bid, and the election was largely viewed as a sounding of
whether Maltese were willing to have the nation make the fiscal
sacrifices needed for EU eligibility.
	   Maltese industry receives heavy government protection, and
paring a budget deficit would likely mean cutting jobs in the heavy
state sector.
	   The Nationalists contended any sacrifices would be worth it to
attract foreign investment and EU funds for such infrastructure as
new roads, important for Malta's biggest money-maker, tourism.
	   Labor campaigned by advocating a free-trade-area agreement with
Brussels, which would stop short for now of pushing for EU
membership.
	   Winners' victory announcements traditionally set off explosions
of joy and fireworks as revelers surge through the streets.
	   Worried about the prospect of smashed storefronts and tipsy
revelers or angry losers, most shops and businesses, ranging from
airline offices to dry cleaners, announced they would stay
shuttered on Monday. Sunday is a traditional closing day.
	   A tiny environmentalist party, Democratic Alternative, was
expected to gather roughly 1 percent of the vote.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Faced with an almost unspeakably
grim task, pathologists, dentists and DNA experts are working
nonstop to piece together the torn remains of Swissair Flight 111's
victims.
	   Those 229 bodies were so totally shattered by their fall into
the sea Wednesday that even Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner
struggled to find the words to describe the work he faces.
	   ``To us it's a very difficult task because of the enormity of
it,'' said Dr. John Butt, who had just come from a meeting with the
families where, for the first time, he told them how bad the
situation was.
	   One French family was able to visually identify a loved one
Friday and take the remains home. Certain physical characteristics
allowed that woman to be identified, Butt said, adding that further
identifications of those aboard the New York-to-Geneva-bound jet
would be much more difficult.
	   ``Using the tools of radiology and dental X-ray for comparisons,
I fear, is not going to be that successful either,'' he said.
``It's a question of the substance of the remains. I just don't
want to go any further than that. But I have had to explain that to
the families, with reluctance I must say.''
	   Butt spoke slowly and haltingly, and was visibly shaken as he
talked about the process during a news conference Saturday.
	   Six teams of medical experts worked furiously in a corrugated
metal airplane hangar at a Canadian military air base in
Shearwater, near Halifax.
	   Among the experts called in to help is Dr. James Young, the
chief medical examiner for Ontario, who earlier this year headed an
international team investigating the death of jailed Nigerian
opposition leader Moshood Abiola.
	   Searchers in Peggy's Cove, the picturesque fishing community
nearest to the point where the plane fell into the sea, place
recovered human remains in plastic bags. These are flown by
helicopter to the base, where they are immediately placed in one of
five refrigerated trucks brought in for the operation.
	   The giant building on the air base is divided into four sections
where officials use various methods to try to identify the pieces
of flesh and bone.
	   In one area the remains are visually inspected, photographed and
fingerprinted. Then they are taken to another section where any
pieces of clothing or keepsake items are removed and recorded.
After that, radiologists take X-rays of any bones and dentists make
imprints and X-rays of teeth. Finally technicians take tissue
samples for DNA testing, which are taken to Ottawa by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police for testing.
	   Butt said many relatives have provided blood samples for DNA
matching. One family called from overseas, he said, asking where
they could have their blood drawn. DNA was likely to be the most
reliable way to identify the victims, he said.
	   In Peggy's Cove, searchers have described picking up pieces of
skull with trailing long brown hair, thick wide pieces of flesh
from a torso with a navel visible, and material that appeared to be
human intestines.
	   Canadian soldiers have been dispatched to the shoreline and
islands in the area to pick up any remains that have washed ashore.
	   In the early hours of the search, authorities were issuing a
count of how many ``bodies'' had been recovered, but soon they
realized that the victims were so ripped apart that it was
impossible to know how many people they truly had.
	   Butt held out some hope that authorities would find a larger
piece of the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11's fuselage that might hold
bodies that were more intact.
	   ``I hope there will be less fragmented material _ I hate to use
that word _ but I hope we will see more of what we can consider a
body,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Three months after the European Union
said it would prohibit flights of the Yugoslav national carrier to
EU points, the measure got final approval Sunday only when Greece
dropped its last-minute reservations.
	   At a weekend EU foreign ministers meeting, Theodoros Pangalos of
Greece said Athens will respect the ban, one of series of sanctions
to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his crackdown
on independence-minded Kosovo province and its overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian population.
	   The ban on JAT flights was announced in June, but Greek
resistance had threatened to undermine further the EU's already
weak standing in the Kosovo crisis.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Comparing Kosovo to Rwanda, a top
U.S. official toured a devastated area of the Serbian province on
Sunday and pushed for independent investigations into reported
massacres.
	   John Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official,
demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow access to
forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
	   U.S. Sen. Bob Dole accompanied him on his fact-finding tour,
which comes amid a push to stop the bloodshed and prevent further
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died and
an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes since
February, when Serb forces launched a crackdown on armed
secessionists in the largely Albanian-populated province.
	   Authorities are unwilling, Shattuck said, ``to confront the fact
that massive war crimes have been committed here, and probably are
going to be committed, and (they) have to be fully investigated and
prosecuted.''
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights said he
would make that point when he reports his findings to the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Ahead of a Monday meeting in Belgrade between the U.S. officials
and Milosevic, Dole said the Yugoslav leader must be ready for a
cease-fire or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   Their 150-kilometer (90-mile) drive took them through the
war-torn towns of Kijevo, Decane and Malisevo in southwestern
Kosovo, an area lined with bombed-out brick houses, stray cattle
and very few civilians.
	   ``The only other place I have seen as eerie as this is in
Rwanda,'' said Shattuck, standing on a hillside overlooking a
charred suburb of Decane.
	   Groups of stray dogs barked or tore the flesh of dead cows amid
dozens of roofless brick houses. Stray horses, many still bridled,
wandered among the heavily laden grapevines and cornfields of the
uninhabited area.
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting Sunday, although
the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Serb police
exchanged fire late Saturday with gunmen in the northern town of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers gave
final approval to a measure to ban flights of the Yugoslav national
airline JAT to EU points because of the situation in Kosovo. Serbia
is the larger of two republics that comprise Yugoslavia, and
federal troops participated in the crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants.

Report: Murdoch to buy Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with BSkyB, Manchester United statements

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Media magnate Rupert Murdoch was negotiating to
buy Premier League soccer giant Manchester United, his satellite
television network BSkyB confirmed Sunday.
	   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper revealed Murdoch had made a 575
million pound (dlrs 950 million) bid to buy soccer giant Manchester
United.
	   According to the Sunday Telegraph, Murdoch has already
negotiated a deal with United chairman Martin Edwards. Edwards, the
paper says, is selling his 14 percent stake in the club for 80
million pounds (dlrs 132 million).
	   BSkyB released a brief statement Sunday confirming negotiations
were taking place between Murdoch and Manchester United.
	   ``The board of British Sky Broadcasting Group plc has noted the
recent press speculation and confirms that it is in discussions
which may or may not lead to an offer being made for Manchester
United PLC,'' the statement said.
	   Manchester United issued a statement saying negotiations were in
place which ``may or may not lead to an offer being made for the
company''.
	   ``Any decision taken by Manchester United will take into account
the interests of shareholders, the club's fans, players and
staff,'' the statement said.
	   Manchester United director Maurice Watkins said a formal
statement would be issued on Monday.
	   ``I certainly don't think we will have any more to say at this
stage,'' he said.
	   The prospect of Murdoch buying one of the world's most famous
and financially successful clubs would make a huge impact on soccer
business in Britain.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain with very few live games being shown on regular
terrestrial stations on the BBC and ITV. Sky also has exclusive
rights to cover England's games such as Saturday's European
Championship qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   The sale of England's wealthiest club, which was floated on the
stock market in 1991, to BSkyB could give the broadcasting company
a stranglehold on the television and marketing rights to Premier
League football.
	   Manchester United's own television network called `MU TV' is
preparing to launch later this week and, if the a sale to Murdoch
went through, it is likely that the only way of seeing the team
play would be through pay-per-view TV.
	   Although United has a 55,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford,
almost all the seats go to season ticket holders and the waiting
list for the few that become available is several years long.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks said the deal could be
subjected to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.
	   ``There are clear implications here that make me feel that this
is not something that can just be treated as if it were just a
normal takeover of one publicly quoted company by another,'' Banks
said Sunday.
	   ``If you buy up the biggest football club in the country then
clearly the implications for commercial policy are fairly
profound.''
	   ``There is already an Office of Fair Trading examination of the
deal between the Premier League and BSkyB, which is due out soon
and reference to the Office of Fair Trading would be something that
ministers could do.''
	   Manchester United Independent Supporters Association chairman
Andy Walsh said one man did not have the right to sell the success
the club had built-up over 100 years on a whim.
	   ``Rupert Murdoch will rape and pillage Manchester United,'' he
said.
	   Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty, who has been an
outspoken critic of the way the club has been run while remaining a
fan of the team, said the supporters would never forgive chairman
and chief executive Edwards if he did sell out to Murdoch.
	   ``Once Murdoch gets hold of the club he will no longer have to
negotiate with the Premier League over the introduction of
pay-per-view,'' Docherty said.
	   ``I don't think he will stop there, I think he might try to get
hold of another couple of top clubs yet.
	   ``Everything will be geared towards television, there will be no
fans sitting in the stands, they will all behind glass entertaining
their business clients.
	   ``The game has already moved away from the true fans and this
type of thing just dilutes the passion even more,'' Docherty said.
	   ``If this deal goes through I would no longer support the club
because from a football point of view it just wouldn't be the same.
	   ``Martin Edwards is not a football man and never has been. He
has already made a lot of money selling shares and good luck to him
but I don't think the fans would ever forgive for selling out to
Murdoch,'' the former manager said.
	   ``That club is worth 1 billion (pounds) and for Murdoch to get
his hands on it would be like winning the Lottery.''
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   England's Football Association spokesman Steve Double said he
was waiting for a public statement from Old Trafford but the game's
governing body would consult with lawyers to discuss the
ramifications of a Murdoch take-over.

Leaders on both sides of apartheid to get notice of negative
</HEADLINE>
portrayal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Leaders from both sides of the
struggle over apartheid have received notices that they may be
portrayed negatively in the Truth and Reconcilation Commission's
final report, a commission official said Sunday.
	   The panel has sent letters to anti-apartheid activists and
supporters of the system of white-minority rule alerting them to
possible negative portrayals in its final report, commission
spokesman Vuyani Green told The Associated Press.
	   The list included 200 names from both sides, including former
apartheid President P.W. Botha, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife,
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the current Deputy Defense Minister
Ronnie Kasrils and other leaders, the Sunday Times in Johannesburg
reported.
	   It cited the panel's chief investigator, Dumisa Ntsebeza, as the
source of the names.
	   ``The commission has sent out notices to a number of people
informing them that (it) was contemplating making findings that
might be detrimental to their good names ... and that they might
want to consider making responses,'' Green said.
	   Under the law setting up the commission that spent two years
investigating death squad executions and torture under white
minority rule, the panel must inform people who will be portrayed
negatively in public hearings or reports.
	   The final report documenting the panels' first phase of work is
to be finished by October. The panel continues to consider amnesty
applications.
	   Green said he could neither ``confirm or deny'' that people
mentioned Sunday in the Times and a second paper, the Sunday
Independent, had been sent letters.
	   Botha, who ruled during some of apartheid's darkest and most
violent times in the 1980s, refused to testify before the panel
which then brought him to court on contempt charges.
	   Madikizela-Mandela allegedly was involved in torture and
killings in the black township of Soweto, the families of alleged
victims told the commission. The panel, headed by Nobel Laureate
Desmond Tutu, spent over a week last year probing the allegations.
	   A commander in the armed wing of the African National Congress,
Kasrils was involved in a massacre in 1992 when hundreds were shot.
	   The Sunday Independent mentioned a long list of former apartheid
activists that have been sent letters, including former Defense
Minister Magnus Malan, Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen and
Afrikaner Resistance Movement leader Eugene TerreBlanche.

Judge okays extradition of U.S. teen-ager accused of murder

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a case that has strained relations between
the United States and Israel, an Israeli judge ruled Sunday that an
American teen-ager wanted for murder can be returned to Maryland to
face the charges.
	   But 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein will not be immediately
extradited. His lawyer has 50 days to appeal the decision to the
Israeli Supreme Court, and the delay could run to months while the
appeal is heard.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was discovered in the garage of
an empty house near the Sheinbein home in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Shortly after arriving, he was picked up by police and hospitalized
briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine, which was under British rule before
the Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's lawyer fought the U.S.
extradition request based on the citizenship law.
	   District Judge Moshe Ravid on Sunday upheld Sheinbein's claim to
Israeli citizenship but said that was not enough to protect him
from prosecution abroad. Israeli law allows for citizens to be
tried in Israel instead of being extradited.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in the
56-page decision.
	   Sheinbein remained expressionless when the decision was
announced. Sheinbein's brother draped an arm around him as their
mother, Victoria, cried nearby.
	   Sheinbein's lawyer, former Justice Minister David Libai, said he
was ``very surprised'' by the decision and would soon appeal it.
His client will remain in an Israeli jail until the Supreme Court's
decision on the case, which could take several months, Libai said.
	   ``This is a very new and original interpretation of the law,''
Libai told reporters after the decision.
	   U.S. Embassy Spokesman Larry Schwartz said the United States
welcomed the decision and looked forward to further cooperation on
the case with Israeli officials in the event of an appeal.
	   The case has caused an uproar in Israel and the United States
and threatened relations between the two allies.
	   The Maryland resident would be tried as an adult in the United
States even though he allegedly committed the crime at the age of
17. But, Libai said, the Israeli judicial system could try
Sheinbein as a minor, which would minimize the sentence if he was
found guilty.

Sunday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. The fund is the nominal

executive director. He takes its helm at a time when there is talk
in Russia's parliament of renationalizing some privatized property.

Basque nationalists reject proposed peace overture to ETA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque region's president joined the
Madrid government Sunday in rejecting a Socialist Party call for
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to make a peace overture to the
Basque extremist group ETA.
	   Socialist Party chairman Joaquin Almunia proposed Friday that
Aznar set a deadline for ETA's separatists to benefit from a
program offering reduced jail terms in exchange for laying down
weapons and renouncing terrorism.
	   Almunia said Aznar should convene a special summit of political
parties to formulate what Almunia called a joint ``peace offer'' to
ETA. He gave no details, saying his party needed to talk to the
government and other parties first.
	   On Sunday, Jose Antonio Ardanza, president of the Basque
regional government, dismissed the idea as an electoral ploy ahead
of Basque regional voting on October 25.
	   Speaking in the Basque town of Elciego, Ardanza recalled that
when he himself unveiled a peace plan early this year, the
Socialists and the ruling Popular Party said he was acting with an
eye to the elections and they refused to discuss the initiative.
	   ``Logically, with a month to go until the elections, a proposal
of this type is not at all opportune,'' said Ardanza, a member of
the moderate Basque Nationalist Party.
	   On Saturday the government also rejected the Socialist appeal,
accusing the party of acting out of turn because there are already
two political forums on how to end political violence in the Basque
country.
	   One is among parties represented in the Basque parliament, the
other among those in the national legislature.
	   The government also said peace plans should be presented
discreetly.
	   ``All initiatives unveiled publicly and unilaterally are doomed
to failure,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said.
	   Almunia's move appears aimed at seizing back the initiative from
Basque nationalist parties that are maneuvering furiously ahead of
the elections on October 25.
	   ETA's legal political wing, for instance, Herri Batasuna,
changed its name on Thursday and said it was incorporating a
broader cross-section of Basque society, including church and labor
groups, to boost its electoral appeal. The new name is Euskal
Herritarrok, which means Basque People.
	   And the Basque Nationalist Party has broken with other parties
in the region by holding talks with ETA's political wing in a bid
to wrest a ceasefire from the armed separatists.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym that stands for +Basque+ Homeland
and freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in an independence drive
that began in the late 1960s under the dictator Gen. Francisco
Franco.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Despite rain and clouds, some 400,000
people poured into downtown Frankfurt for two days of the city's
second ``Skyscraper Festival,'' that ended Sunday.
	   The festival, featuring music groups throughout the banking area
and around the ``Alte Oper'' opera house, also had a wire-walking
act, a mass bungee jump by 25 people, fireworks, and daredevil
climber Stefan Glowacz scaling the 166 meters (545 foot) outside
wall of Dresdner Bank in 30 minutes.
	   Officials said some 70,000 people accepted the invitation to
visit the inside of 15 of the multi-story buildings that most only
see as part of the skyline when driving into work, or while
approaching Frankfurt international airport in an airliner.
	   Located on the Main river, Frankfurt's skyline has gained the
city the nickname ``Mainhattan,'' a takeoff on Manhattan in New
York that locals in this banking city are proud of.
	   The festival that officials expect to continue to feature as an
annual event, is sponsored by a conglomeration of banks, the
Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, and private Hit Radio FFH.

Emerson: `Sampras will win more than 12 Grand Slams'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sooner or later, maybe on the concrete hard
courts of the U.S. Open or the rubberized surface at Australia,
perhaps on the supple grass of Wimbledon or even the red clay of
the French Open, Pete Sampras will break Roy Emerson's record of 12
Grand Slam singles championships.
	   That prediction comes from the man who set the tennis standard
three decades ago.
	   ``Pete is a fantastic player,'' Emerson said at the U.S. Open.
``He's going to break my record. He's only 27. He has a lot of
tournaments ahead of him. I have a lot of admiration for him, for
his ability and the way he conducts himself on and off the court.''
	   Sampras, who has 11 Slams, one away from Emerson's record,
turned into the second week of the U.S. Open on cruise control, set
for a round of 16 match Monday against Marat Safin.
	   What Emerson likes about him is his versatility.
	   ``He is more of an all-court player who can come in and stay
back,'' he said. ``He is not one-dimensional.''
	   So how come Sampras has been unable to figure out the French
Open, the only Slam he has failed to win? Don't blame the slow clay
of Roland Garros. He's solved that same surface elsewhere.
	   ``He won the Italian,'' Emerson said. ``He can win the French.''
	   Emerson's dozen Slams include six Australian Opens, and two each
at the United States, Wimbledon and French. His string began in
1961 with the Australian and U.S. championships and ended in 1967
when he won the last of five straight Australians and his second
French.
	   He came closest to a single-season sweep of the Slams in 1964
when he won three, missing only in the French, the same tournament
that has troubled Sampras.
	   It is tough to compare his string with Sampras' 11-Slam run
which includes four U.S. Opens, five Wimbledons and two Australian
Opens and started in 1990.
	   ``It's a different time,'' Emerson said. ``Most of my wins were
on clay and grass. Now there are two other surfaces that suit
Pete's game. Pete doesn't play doubles. I did. Maybe that's an
advantage. Doubles can be tough on the way to the finals.''
	   Emerson thought modern tennis offers more obstacles to Sampras,
simply because there are so many high quality players on the
professional tour.
	   ``There's a lot of depth in the majors now,'' he said. ``Winning
even one or two matches can be tough. We seeded eight players. They
seed 16. He's done well.''
	   Sampras is a tennis throwback _ no earrings, no ponytail, no
outrageous outfits. He'd feel perfectly comfortable in Emerson's
era surrounded by players like Rod Laver, Pancho Gonzalez, John
Newcombe and Ken Rosewall.
	   ``He'd certainly be up there and admired for all the
championships he's won,'' Emerson said. ``He's got an endless
amount in him.''
	   Emerson's Slam titles record has lasted 31 years. The mark is
tennis' verson of American baseball's home run record, also under
siege this year.
	   ``I knew 12 would be hard to beat,'' Emerson said.

Military parade marks Chechen `independence'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 15,000 people turned out in the capital
of Chechnya on Sunday for a military parade celebrating the
self-proclaimed independence of the breakaway republic, a news
agency said.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, the parade in central Grozny marked the
seventh anniversary of the storming of the Chechen parliament
building in 1991. That event helped unleash an independence
movement that fought a two-year war of secession against Russia.
	   Russia still considers Chechnya to be a Russian republic, but
Chechnya considers itself independent and carries out many of the
functions of an independent country.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An anti-tank missile hit a house during a training
mission, killing one person and injuring another, a Russian news
agency reported Sunday.
	   Russian peacekeeping forces in the breakaway Georgian province
of South Ossetia fired the missile during training Saturday,
ITAR-Tass said, citing the Russian Defense Ministry.
	   The missile struck a house near the town of Tskhinvali, injuring
two residents, one of whom died later.
	   The incident was under investigation, authorities said.
	   South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in 1990 when it was still
part of the Soviet Union. The fighting ended after Russian
peacekeepers were deployed in the region in 1992, but talks on a
political settlement have stalled.

Struver claims European Masters title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, detail, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany's Sven Struver beat
Sweden's Patrik Sjoland on the first playoff hole Sunday to win the
European Masters.
	   Struver, who began the day four shots back of the Swede, nailed
the victory when he birdied the first extra hole, draining a
pressure-packed 4-foot (1.2 meter) putt on the tricky par-4 18th.
	   Minutes earlier, Struver had sunk an almost identical putt on
the same hole to set up the playoff.
	   ``I've never won in sudden death before so this was good,'' said
Struver, who collected about dlrs 200,000 for the win. ``I played
the 18th five times and birdied it four times. It was sure nice to
make birdie to get into sudden death and then to win with a birdie
was even better.''
	   The 31-year-old German carded a final round 5-under 66 for a 263
total, while Sjoland, the leader after three rounds, struggled to a
70.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, No. 2 on the European Tour
money list, rallied with a 4-under 67 to finish third at 265. His
third place finish, however, was not enough to move him into the
European No. 1 spot in front of Lee Westwood, who shot a final
round 68 for 272.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, the 1996 European champion and
five-time European No. 1, also finished nine shots back after
carding a final round 67.
	   Last year's winner, Costantino Rocca of Italy, was fourth at 268
after a 68.
	   Struver, who steadily made up ground throughout the day, sank a
3-foot (0.9-meter) birdie putt on 18, forcing Sjoland to drop a
tricky 2-footer (0.6-meter) to send the tournament into the
playoff.
	   Sjoland, who shot a 9-under par 62 on Saturday, began the day
with what looked to be a comfortable four-stroke lead over the
German.
	   After 14 holes, Sjoland was still clinging to a two-shot lead,
but Struver collected his second birdie of the day on 15 to narrow
the deficit to a single stroke.
	   Sjoland began to show signs of pressure, bogeying the 16th while
Struver parred to leave the two men even.
	   Sjoland regained a one-stroke lead sinking a 7-foot (2.1-meter)
putt for a birdie on 17.
	   On the 18th hole Struver set up an easy birdie putt for himself
after leaving his second shot just 4 feet (1.2 meters) short of the
pin.
	   ``I was absolutely concentrated and didn't let it go,'' said
Struver, who had four birdies and an eagle in the final round. ``I
was like playing on another planet.
	   The purse at the tournament was 2 million francs (dlrs 1.2
million). The tournament is also the first European event which
counts valuable Ryder Cup points. Europe will attempt to defend its
title against the United States at the Country Club in Brookline,
New Jersey.

Judge okays extradition of U.S. teen-ager accused of murder

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a case that had strained relations between
the United States and Israel, an Israeli judge ruled Sunday that an
American teen-ager wanted for murder can be returned to Maryland to
face the charges.
	   But 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein will not be immediately
extradited. His lawyer has 50 days to appeal the decision to the
Israeli Supreme Court, and the delay could run to months while the
appeal is heard.
	   Sheinbein, a suspect in the brutal murder last year of Alfredo
Tello Jr., remained expressionless when the decision was announced.
Sheinbein's brother draped an arm around him as their mother,
Victoria, cried nearby.
	   District Judge Moshe Ravid upheld Sheinbein's claim to Israeli
citizen but, in a surprise, said that this was not enough to
protect him from prosecution abroad. Israeli law allows for
citizens to be tried in Israel instead of being extradited.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in the
56-page decision. He added that Sheinbein, who had never visited
Israel before the murder, had no connection to the country.
	   Sheinbein's lawyer, former Justice Minister David Libai, said he
was ``very surprised'' by the decision and would soon appeal it.
His client will remain in an Israeli jail until the Supreme Court's
decision on the case, which could take several months, Libai said.
	   ``This is a very new and original interpretation of the law,''
Libai told reporters after the decision.
	   U.S. Embassy Spokesman Larry Schwartz said the United States
welcomed the decision and looked forward to further cooperation on
the case with Israeli officials in the event of an appeal.
	   ``It is uncertain when Sheinbein will return to the United
States if he appeals the decision. At the beginning of the process
Israeli officials estimated it might take a year or more. We plan
to discuss the decision and arrangements for Sheinbein's return to
the United States with Israeli authorities soon,'' Schwartz said.
	   The ruling was also welcomed by Robert Dean, State's Attorney in
Montgomery County, Maryland, where the murder took place. ``The
family of Alfredo Tello, who have been most deeply affected by
this, as well as the entire community of Montgomery County, are
thankful and grateful for the ruling.''
	   U.S. Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md, who represents Montgomery
County, said ``I am very pleased and heartened by the decision of
the Israeli court that Samuel Sheinbein is extractable to
Montgomery County, Maryland for trial.''
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Tello was discovered in the garage of an empty
house near the Sheinbein home in Silver Spring, Maryland. Shortly
after arriving, he was picked up by police and hospitalized
briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine which was under British rule before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's lawyer fought the U.S.
extradition request based on the citizenship law.
	   The claims caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and
threatened relations between the two allies. Members of the U.S.
Congress called for delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was
not returned.
	   But the United States backed down when Israel's Justice Ministry
rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims.
	   Libai said the family had brought Sheinbein to Israel in part to
prevent him from committing suicide. He said that, in the wake of
anger in the Hispanic community, that the family was concerned that
Sheinbein would become the target for revenge attacks, especially
in U.S. jails.
	   ``The family is worried that inmates could take revenge,'' Libai
told The Associated Press.
	   The Maryland resident would be tried as an adult in the United
States even though he allegedly committed the crime at the age of
17. But Libai said the Israeli judicial system could try Sheinbein
as a minor, which would minimize the sentence if he was found
guilty.
	   Youths convicted of murders in Israel usually receive 16-year
sentences as opposed to adults whose average sentence is 24 years.
	   Israeli legal officials have said a murder trial in Israel would
be very expensive since witnesses, aides, evidence and the victim's
family would have to be flown to the country.
	   In addition, prison life in Israel is much less severe than in
the United States since murders and rapes are uncommon, and many
prisoners get one week end off a month after the first quarter of
the sentence.
	   Neither Sheinbein nor the family would comment on the court
decision Sunday. Prior to the decision, the father, Sol, kicked a
photographer in frustration after journalists pushed past him to
get pictures of his son.
	   Sol Sheinbein was charged in Maryland with helping his son to
flee the United States.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official toured a
devastated area of the Serbian province of Kosovo on Sunday and
pushed for independent investigations into reported massacres.
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. State Department's top human rights
official, demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow
access to forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
	   Shattuck was joined by former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole and other
Western officials on his fact-finding tour, which comes amid a push
to stop the bloodshed and prevent further humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died and an estimated 265,000 have
been driven from their homes since February, when Serb forces
launched a crackdown on armed secessionists in the largely
Albanian-populated province.
	   Authorities are unwilling, he said, ``to confront the fact that
massive war crimes have been committed here, and probably are going
to be committed, and (they) have to be fully investigated and
prosecuted.''
	   He said he would make that point when he reports his findings to
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Ahead of a Monday meeting in Belgrade between the U.S. officials
and Milosevic, Dole said the Yugoslav leader must be ready for a
cease-fire or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   Their 150-kilometer (90-mile) drive on Sunday took them through
the war-torn towns of Kijevo, Decane and Malisevo in southwestern
Kosovo, an area lined with bombed-out brick houses, stray cattle
and very few civilians.
	   ``The only other place I have seen as eerie as this is in
Rwanda,'' said Shattuck, referring to the civil war-torn eastern
African country as he stood on a hillside overlooking a charred
suburb of Decane.
	   Groups of stray dogs barked or tore the flesh of dead cows amid
dozens of roofless brick houses. Stray horses, many still bridled,
wandered among the heavily laden grapevines and cornfields of the
uninhabited area.
	   No new fighting was reported Sunday, although the official
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Serb police exchanged fire late
Saturday with gunmen in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers gave
final approval to a measure to ban flights of the Yugoslav national
airline JAT to EU points because of the situation in Kosovo. Serbia
is the larger of two republics that comprise Yugoslavia, and
federal troops participated in the crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants.

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dead at 88
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, whose hauntingly poetic vision,
innovative style and stunning technical virtuosity made him Japan's
most celebrated film director, died at home in Tokyo on Sunday. He
was 88.
	   Minoru Tabata, an official of Kurosawa Film Production, said
Kurosawa died of a stroke before he could be taken to a hospital.
	   ``I can't say what it was about, but he was working on one more
film,'' Hiromichi Horikawa, a director who studied under Kurosawa,
told national broadcaster NHK.
	   ``My father has done almost what he wanted to do,'' said
Kurosawa's 52-year-old son Hisao, a director himself.
	   Filmmakers throughout the world have been influenced by
Kurosawa, who fused the pinpoint precision of traditional Japanese
theatrical forms with stunning, larger-than-life spectacles.
	   Standing nearly 6 feet (180 centimeters) tall, rarely seen
without his trademark sunglasses and beret, Kurosawa cut an
imposing figure. That, with his imperious perfectionism, earned him
the nickname ``Emperor Kurosawa.''
	   He once ordered that an entire feudal castle built for 1957's
``Throne of Blood'' be torn down because builders had used steel
nails _ something they could not have done in the 16th century,
when the film was set.
	   Though spectacular, Kurosawa's career was also marked by
disappointments. He tried to kill himself after a film flopped.
Japanese studios shunned him for decades.
	   But at the height of his powers, he was the uncontested master.
Over his half-century, 30-film career, his movies brought him three
Oscars and the acclaim of audiences and critics worldwide.
	   ``Take myself, subtract films, and the remainder is zero,'' he
once wrote.
	   Director Steven Spielberg, whose ``Saving Private Ryan'' opened
the Deauville film festival in France on Saturday, called Kurosawa
``the pictorial Shakespeare of our time.''
	   ``Although in cinema everything was invented in the 1920s, he
created a very personal story-telling style in which you can see
his talent,'' said Juan Antonio Bardem, chairman of the Spanish
Film Directors Association and a Japanese cinema buff.
	   ``Cinema today has lost one of its giants,'' French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said, calling ``The Seven Samurai,''
``Rashomon'' and ``Kagemusha'' ``among the greatest works of the
world cinematographic heritage.'' French President Jacques Chirac
called Kurosawa a ``great master of the seventh art.''
	   At the Venice Film Festival, journalists and others in the press
room honored Kurosawa with a standing ovation when festival
director Felice Laudadio announced his death.
	   The festival set a commemorative showing for Monday of
``Rashomon,'' for which Kurosawa won its Golden Lion award in 1951.
	   ``He became a cinematographer with a universal cult following,
admired for the intelligence, the spectacle and the extraordinary
human force and emotion of his films, telling of and translating,
profoundly as no one else could, the history and people of his
beloved and hated Japan,'' Laudadio said.
	   Kurosawa did indeed have a love-hate relationship with his
homeland. He drew deeply on classic Japanese themes like the
warrior spirit and the beauty of futile self-sacrifice. But he
looked elsewhere for financial and artistic support.
	   Several of Kurosawa's films were remade in America into hit
Westerns _ ``The Seven Samurai'' was the basis for ``The
Magnificent Seven'' and ``Yojimbo'' inspired ``A Fistful of
Dollars.''
	   ``He had a god-like vision that translated well to American
movies,'' said Naoko Kimura, an independent film critic in Tokyo.
	   In the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese studios, focusing on soft porn
and cheap romances, gave Kurosawa short shrift even as his
reputation grew overseas. In 1980, George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg persuaded 20th Century Fox to back ``Kagemusha'' after
financiers at home balked.
	   Even as late as 1985, Kurosawa's reputation as a hothead and a
spendthrift made it hard to find Japanese backing for the film he
described as his life's work _ ``Ran,'' a loose adaptation of
``King Lear'' set in 16th-century Japan.
	   French producer Serge Silberman agreed to work with him on the
film, a beautifully drawn but brutally pessimistic depiction of
three samurai sons battling their father.
	   With a price tag topping dlrs 10 million, ``Ran'' was then the
most expensive movie in Japanese history. But it brought Kurosawa a
round of new honors, including a lifetime achievement award at
Cannes.
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910 to a family that had held samurai rank,
Kurosawa was the youngest of eight children of a military school
administrator.
	   He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art school and
tiring of poverty as a painter. In 1936 he spotted a film studio's
advertisement for a director's assistant. He got the job.
	   At 33, he directed his first film, ``Sugata Sanshiro,'' or ``The
Judo Saga.'' It was a hit in wartime Japan, but Kurosawa's vision
conflicted with some nationalist sentiments and drew heated attacks
from the military.
	   His breakthrough came in 1950, with ``Rashomon,'' the first
Japanese film to gain recognition abroad. It won the Academy Award
for Best Foreign Film in 1951 and launched him on a decade of
landmark films that included ``Seven Samurai'' (1954) and ``Throne
of Blood'' (1957).
	   ``Rashomon'' featured Toshiro Mifune, who also reached worldwide
fame and starred in 16 Kurosawa movies. He died in December at age
77.
	   ``Dodeskaden'' was a critical and commercial flop in 1970, but
he made a comeback in 1975 with the bleakly lovely Siberian-set
``Dersu Uzala,'' which brought him his second Oscar.
	   In 1990, he became the first Japanese to receive the honorary
Academy Award for lifetime achievements.
	   Kurosawa stirred controversy with his 1991 film, ``Rhapsody in
August,'' whose presentation of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki was
called one-sided and simplistic by American critics.
	   The film, which starred Richard Gere, focused on the plight of a
family that lost an uncle in the bombing but made no mention of
Japan's role in starting the war.
	   Disappointments followed. ``Dreams,'' a 1990 series of
vignettes, was delicately wrought but described by one critic as
``a snooze.'' And 1993's ``Madadayo,'' about an elderly writer and
his literary coterie, barely registered at the box office.
	   Kurosawa's wife, actress Yoko Yaguchi, died in 1985 after 35
years of marriage. Besides son Hisao, they had a daughter, Kazuko.
	   Two private ceremonies have been scheduled _ a wake at his home
Monday and a funeral there Tuesday.
	   A ``farewell meeting'' is to be held Sept. 13 at Kurosawa Film
Studio in Yokohama, 29 kilometers (18 miles) south of Tokyo.
	   ``I don't regret anything. I found the perfect job,'' Kurosawa
said in an interview when he was 75. ``All this time I've thought
of nothing but movies.''

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami
claimed election victory Sunday and said he would move quickly to
revive Malta's European Union membership bid, which had been frozen
by the Labor Party of Prime Minister Alfred Sant.
	   Sant, conceding he had failed in his gamble that early elections
would strengthen his socialists' one-vote majority in the 65-seat
parliament, announced that he had handed in his resignation to
Malta's president.
	   Official results of Saturday's election were expected sometime
Monday, but party officials had access to partial tallies of the
handwritten ballots.
	   Nationalist party sources said the winning percentage of votes
was expected to be close to the lines of Fenech Adami's 1992
victory, when he won nearly 52 percent of the vote, and that Labor
would get about 4 percent less than that.
	   ``I have been advised that the projections will confirm our
win,'' said Fenech Adami, 64, whose back-to-back terms as
conservative premier from 1987-1996 had followed 16 years of then
largely anti-Western Labor government.
	   ``The first thing that I am going to do is to inform the EU that
the Maltese people want membership,'' said a smiling Fenech Adami.
Brussels in 1993 had given the 1990 application a positive review
as an early step in the membership process.
	   Jubilant backers hopped into cars and snaked through the streets
waving Nationalist and EU flags.
	   Although the election was widely read as a sounding on whether
to push for EU membership, the Nationalists, smarting from their
1996 defeat after a pro-EU campaign, had advocated holding a formal
referendum on the issue if they won.
	   Shortly after coming to office in 1996, Sant froze Malta's EU
bid, indicating Malta was not ready for the sacrifices needed for
EU eligibility.
	   Sant, a 50-year-old Harvard Business School-educated management
consultant, did not mention the EU issue as he conceded defeat.
	   Instead, he said he had miscalculated public anger over higher
utility rates imposed by his government as a deficit-cutting
measure.
	   As supporters cheered wildly outside Nationalist Party
headquarters, Fenech Adami came out onto a balcony and appealed for
calm.
	   In past elections, supporters of losers have gone on rampages on
this tiny island, where politics is a feverish passion and the
overwhelming majority of citizens are either diehard Nationalists
or Labor followers.
	   Worried about the prospect of smashed storefronts and tipsy
revelers or angry losers, most shops and businesses, ranging from
airline offices to dry cleaners, announced they would stay
shuttered on Monday.
	   ``We are one people,'' Fenech Adami said. ``Remember, we are all
Maltese brothers and sisters.''
	   About 95 percent of the 278,000 eligible voters turned out for
the election, called three years early.
	   Maltese industry receives heavy government protection, and
paring a budget deficit would likely mean cutting jobs in the heavy
state sector.
	   The Nationalists contended any sacrifices would be worth it to
attract foreign investment and EU funds for such infrastructure as
new roads, important for Malta's biggest money-maker, tourism.
	   A tiny environmentalist party, Democratic Alternative, was
expected to gather roughly 1 percent of the vote.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Murky, choppy seas Sunday hindered
divers looking for the fuselage and flight recorders of Swissair
Flight 111. Ashore, worshipers mourned the 229 victims at memorial
services; one minister broke into tears.
	   ``It's been horrible what's been going on the past week,'' the
Rev. Richard Walsh told his congregation at St. Peter's Anglican
Church in Hacketts Cove, near the site of Wednesday's crash.
	   He wept briefly, then told the 30 worshippers, ``I'll be okay.''
	   Walsh later preached at St. John's Church in Peggy's Cove, the
fishing village serving as base for the huge search operation. In
the closing hymn, the congregation sang, ``Hear o Lord our earnest
prayer for those who travel by the air.''
	   Canadian navy and coast guard ships, as well as police and
military divers, were trying to track down tantalizing signals and
sonar readings that might lead them the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11's
fuselage and flight recorders, down there somewhere under about 190
feet (60 meters) of water.
	   But Capt. Robert Frank, a spokesman for the search team, said
the diving operation was being slowed by poor visibility at lower
depths and six-foot (two-meter) swells on the surface.
	   Help for the searchers was on its way. The USS Grapple, a U.S.
Navy supply ship which helped in the deep-sea investigation of the
TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, embarked Sunday from Philadelphia
with a team of divers and special equipment for underwater recovery
operations.
	   The Swissair plane, en route from New York to Geneva, crashed 16
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit and decided
to attempt an emergency landing. The plane started toward the
Halifax airport, but made a couple of sharp turns as it tried to
lose altitude and dump fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair officials said they had
reconstructed the final phase of the flight, based on information
from Canadian investigators. They said the plane couldn't have made
a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first distress
call because it was flying too high and was too heavy.
	   The call was made 70 miles (112 kilometers) out of Halifax, but
the pilots would have needed 130 miles (210 kilometers) to make a
direct landing, said Swissair's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand.
	   However, he said, attempting to land in Halifax was still better
than trying for Boston, which the pilots initially suggested to
controllers.
	   Swissair said memorial services for victims would be held Friday
in New York, Geneva and Zurich.
	   A series of memorial services was planned over the next several
days in Halifax and surrounding towns.
	   At the service in Peggy's Cove, Walsh said residents of the area
would remember these tragic days for their rest of their lives.
	   ``Every time we drive by the ocean or the rocks, we will
remember the people who have become spiritually part of our
community,'' he said. ``We will remember and we will never
forget.''

	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Emily Watson went memorably mad in
``Breaking the Waves.'' In ``Hilary and Jackie,'' she's a martyr to
her music, doomed to die young.
	   Now it's time, the actress says, for something on a lighter
note.
	   ``I was sad. I was very sad,'' she said of finishing ``Hilary
and Jackie,'' which had its world premiere Sunday at the Venice
Film Festival. ``I walked by the sea in Devon to get over it.''
	   The movie tells the tragic life story of British cellist
Jacqueline Du Pre, who died of multiple sclerosis at the age of 42,
and her relationship with her older sister, Hilary.
	   The film was eagerly awaited, in part because of Watson, whose
remarkable 1996 debut in ``Breaking the Waves'' garnered her an
Academy Award nomination and worldwide accolades, and in part
because of sensational new revelations about Du Pre's life.
	   At a prescreening Saturday, the audience reaction was mixed:
both boos and applause.
	   But festival director Felice Laudadio said Sunday that's typical
of this year's festival.
	   No clear front-runners for the big Venice prizes have emerged
yet, although there was pre-festival talk that Watson could be a
contender for best actress.
	   Her performance in ``Hilary and Jackie'' lacks the astonishing
emotional vulnerability of ``Breaking the Waves,'' but her
immersion in the role is still evident.
	   Watson said Sunday that she spent months relearning the cello in
order to play the role of Du Pre.
	   In one wordless, memorable scene, Watson heartbreakingly conveys
the agony Du Pre must have felt as she wasted away, no longer able
to play, deprived, as Watson put it, ``of her voice.''
	   Struggling with trembling hands, she reaches out from her
wheelchair and puts on the famed recording of Elgar's cello
concerto that she made along with her husband, conductor and
pianist Daniel Barenboim. She listens for a few moments, then sobs.
	   The film is based on the book ``A Genius in the Family,'' by Du
Pre's sister, Hilary, and her brother, Piers. The book created a
sensation in Britain, where Du Pre is something of a musical saint.
	   In it, Hilary tells how she ``gave'' her husband to Jackie, who
was sick of the emotionally empty world of celebrity and starved
for what she saw as ``normal'' love.
	   Watson said it wasn't easy to grasp _ or convey _ this aspect of
the intense sibling relationship. ``I got to where I did understand
it,'' she said. ``I had to understand that to tell the story.''
	   Anand Tucker, making his feature-film debut with ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' said the filmmakers spent long hours with the Du Pre
family, but Berenboim refused to participate. ``The film was made
with a whole lot of love,'' Tucker said Sunday. ``People have
responded to it very emotionally.''

Dutch sprinter wins second leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CADIZ, Spain (AP) _ Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands won the
second leg of the Tour of Spain on Sunday, a grueling 234-kilometer
(147 mile) trek between Cordoba and Cadiz.
	   In the overall standings the tour leader is still Markus Szberg
of Switzerland, who won the first leg on Saturday. He's followed by
Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and Giuliano Figueras of
Mapei.
	   Blijlevens, a member of the TVM team, covered Sunday's leg in a
time of 6 hours, 30 minutes and 24 seconds. It was the longest of
the 22 stages that make up the tour.
	   After a sprint finish, second place went to Italian Giovanni
Lombardi of Telekom, and third to Australia's Robbie McEwen of the
Rabobank team.
	   Blijlevens dedicated his win to a TVM team doctor and another
team official who are still in France as a result of the doping
probes that marred the Tour de France in July and prompted the TVM
to pull out.
	   ``This is like a dream, after the torture of the Tour. We needed
something like this to recover our morale,'' he said.
	   Sunday's stage also saw the tour's first fall. Just seconds away
from the finish line as he rode in the middle of the pack, Spain's
David Etxebarria of ONCE-Deutsche Bank team hit the ground, causing
several other riders to fall.
	   There were no reports of serious injuries, although Etxebarria
suffered bruises and scrapes and his bike was ruined.
	   However the race did suffer a casualty Sunday _ Belgian star
Frank Vandenbroucke of the Lotto Mobistar team pulled out of the
competition because of what was described as an oral infection.
	   Carlos Osorio of Colombia, riding for Avianca Telecom, also
pulled out for an undisclosed reason.
	   The Tour of Spain is cycling's first big race since July's Tour
de France was tarnished by doping scandals.
	   Among the 22 teams taking part in Spain is Festina, the
top-rated French squad that was ejected from the Tour de France
after admitting to systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Monday's third leg is a 192.6-kilometer (120-mile) route from
Cadiz to Estepona.

Khamenei: Iran will not clash with Taliban

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, says that the country will not enter into a military
confrontation with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, the Tehran Times
reported Sunday.
	   The statement came amid concerns in the U.S. intelligence
community that Iran was poised for an incursion into Afghanistan.
Iran last week massed troops and equipment on the border for
military exercises.
	   Iran also has warned the Taliban religious army that it would
take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of Iranians believed
held captive by the militia.
	   The English-language newspaper said Khamenei's comments came
during a question-and-answer session Thursday at Teachers Training
University.
	   He said he was ``personally following the developments of Iran
related to Afghanistan'' and ``assured that there will be no
confrontation with the Taliban,'' the paper said.
	   The paper did not say why there was a delay in reporting the
comments of Khamenei, who also is commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians, including 11
diplomats and a journalist from the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the diplomats, and
Iranian officials fear they may have been killed.
	   The Afghan militia acknowledged holding some Iranian truck
drivers, and on Thursday freed five of them. They arrived in Tehran
on Sunday, IRNA reported.
	   The drivers, who were received at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport by
their families and officials from the Foreign Ministry, said they
were held in the southern city of Kandahar along with several dozen
other Iranians.
	   The freed drivers said they had no information about the
diplomats or the IRNA correspondent.
	   Later, Tehran radio reported that two of the freed men were
traders who were captured in Afghanistan about a year ago.
	   The broadcast, which was monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp., did not provide further details.

Speculation about three-way summit as new U.S. effort begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With a new U.S. diplomatic effort poised to
begin, Israeli and Palestinian officials on Sunday suggested the
possibility of a new round of meetings in Washington or even a
three-way summit with President Clinton.
	   Negotiations on a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
have been stalled for 18 months, and Clinton vowed during a visit
to Ireland that he would pursue ways to break the impasse.
	   A flurry of diplomatic activity appeared in the offing beginning
with a visit, starting Wednesday, of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross, who is returning to the region for the first time since May.
	   With the Mideast leaders expected at the U.N. General Assembly
later this month, Israel radio said the Clinton administration
hoped to bring both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser
Arafat to Washington - for either separate meetings or a three-way
summit.
	   ``Netanyahu has offered to meet Arafat for months now in hopes
they can reach agreement on a second redeployment. Until now,
Arafat has said no,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to
Netanyahu.
	   A senior Palestinian official indicated a Clinton-Arafat meeting
was more likely than a three-way summit.
	   ``I don't exclude the possibility of a meeting between President
Arafat and President Clinton,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian negotiator.
	   ``But as far as a trilateral meeting...I think this will heavily
depend on the outcome of Mr. Ross' visit to the region.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz declined comment on the
speculation about a summit, which some observers viewed as a trial
balloon.
	   Netanyahu planned a five-day visit to the United States,
starting Sept. 23 when he is scheduled to deliver a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly. Arafat will also be there and was scheduled
to speak Sept. 28.
	   The Israeli leader squelched reports in the Israeli media that
he had opened a secret channel with a senior Palestinian
negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, and held a series of meetings.
	   The reports prompted anger from right-wing members of the
coalition Cabinet, but Netanyahu said he had only met with Qureia
once five weeks ago.
	   Negotiations between Qureia, also known as Abu Alaa, and
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho led to a draft document which
Israeli officials say spelled out Israel's agreement to a 13
percent pullback.
	   Israel had been insisting that it could give no more than 10
percent, but then agreed to a U.S. compromise that three more
percent would be designated as a ``nature reserve'' under
Palestinian control.
	   However, an Israeli official said Qureia accepted the document,
but Arafat disowned the deal after a visit to Cairo, where the
Egyptian government was apparently cool to the idea.
	   ``No agreements have been reached,'' Erekat said in an
interview, adding that the Palestinians didn't agree to Israeli
conditions to use of three percent of the land.

Chernomyrdin: Russia still wants help from West
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Chernomyrdin remarks on TV &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia still wants aid and cooperation from the
West, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Sunday on the
eve of a crucial meeting that could help determine the makeup and
course of Russia's new government.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said in an
interview on the popular television program ``Itogi.''
	   He said Russia needed to at least double its gold and foreign
currency reserves, ``hopefully through the (assistance) of the
global financial system,'' he said.
	   His remarks were the latest effort by Chernomyrdin to reassure
Western governments and Russian reformers that he hopes to avoid
retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation, which some
people have predicted.
	   Chernomyrdin also sent a message Sunday to the finance ministers
of Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help
of the international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Russian news agencies reported.
	   The letter was a response to Britain's decision to call an
emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.
	   Russia is in the midst of one of its most serious economic and
political crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The economy has been in freefall, with the government devaluing
the ruble and effectively defaulting on foreign loans. Ever since
President Boris Yeltsin fired the previous Cabinet headed by Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, the country has been groping its way
through the crisis without a government.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has so far
opposed Yeltsin's nomination of Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
Chernomyrdin headed the government for five years before Kiriyenko
took over earlier this year, and the political opposition blames
him for the country's predicament.
	   Yeltsin will meet Monday with lawmakers and union leaders in an
attempt to agree on forming a new government, his press service
said.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming Chernomyrdin. The
Communist-dominated Duma has already rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   Yeltsin's press service said he would meet with eight members of
each house of parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Duma is scheduled to vote on Chernomyrdin later in the day.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that could add to the current turmoil.
	   The Communist deputy speaker of the Duma appealed to all sides
to reach an agreement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Svetlana Goryacheva urged opposition lawmakers to ``brush aside
ambitions, think of Russia's future and conclude an agreement with
the authorities.''
	   The ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S. dollar (16
cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to the dollar
(5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not yet caused serious unrest, but Yeltsin's most
radical opponents have tried to exploit it. Viktor Anpilov, head of
the radical Russian Labor movement, led a small but angry
demonstration of mostly elderly communists near the Kremlin on
Sunday, and called for a military coup.
	   ``Force! Force!'' the crowd shouted as Anpilov said, ``We have
to work with the army.''

 &UR; Hoddle insists he's not ready to quit Eds: Adds Venables quotes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle, under
increasing pressure to stand down after his side lost its opening
Euro 2000 qualifer to Sweden, insisted Sunday he would not quit.
	   He said he had two years to run on his England contract and was
considering an extension as England's Football Association pushed
for contract negotiations.
	   England slumped to a 2-1 loss in Stockholm on Saturday despite
scoring the first goal after 76 seconds through captain Alan
Shearer.
	   It was England's first match since it was eliminated from the
France 98 World Cup by Argentina in a second-round penalty
shoot-out.
	   Since the World Cup, Hoddle has come under fire for allegedly
betraying the confidences of players in his controversial World Cup
diary and for using faith healer Eileen Drewery in team
preparation.
	   Hoddle has been linked with a move to his old club Tottenham to
replace Christian Gross as manager _ a move described as ``an
escape route'' in a Mail on Sunday headline.
	   But Hoddle said the loss to Sweden was not a disaster and did
not threaten his job.
	   ``The disappointment for me as a football manager is the three
points we lost,'' he said Sunday.
	   ``...you get criticised in the job. I've been criticised in the
past and it'll happen in the future no doubt. The bottom line is
that we've got to respond.
	   ``If there were two games to go in the (Euro 2000) qualifying
stages and running out of time and points, then obviously it would
be one hell of a task but we've still got a lot of points on the
board to get.''
	   Hoddle said his team's confident start against Sweden proved the
rumoured rift in the team _ caused by revelations in his book and
criticism of him in a a book published by veteran defender Tony
Adams _ did not exist.
	   However, former England coach Terry Venables said the furor over
Hoddle's book had obviously created problems for the England
manager.
	   ``The book didn't help,'' he said Sunday. ``(the contoversy) put
him under extra pressure where there is plenty of pressure
anyway.''
	   Venables, who led the England side to the semi-finals at Euro 96
before leaving the job when the FA refused to renew his contract,
attributed some blame for England's loss to the FA officials.
	   ``The officers and stuffed-shirt councillors at the FA are more
interested in keeping their jobs for 30 years than in producing a
winning England team,'' he said.

President to run again in Burkina Faso elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ President Blaise Campaore
announced Sunday he will run for another term in presidential
elections scheduled for mid-November.
	   Addressing cheering supporters at a balloon-filled rally at an
outdoor plaza in the capital, Campaore said the ruling Congress for
Democracy and Progress had nominated him in a party meeting earlier
in the day.
	   ``I gladly accept the honor to serve my people again,'' Campaore
said as children waved streamers and traditional musicians played
on long wooden drums.
	   The elections, scheduled for November 15, are the second since
Campaore took power in a bloody 1987 coup. He won the first
elections in 1991 as the only candidate after it was boycotted by
opponents.
	   An opposition coalition of the country's nine largest opposition
political parties warned Sunday it will boycott the upcoming poll
unless the government allows the list of candidates to be drawn up
by the country's independent electoral body.
	   The coalition also demanded that the elections date be
postponed.
	   The government has said it will draw up the final list, and
Campaore did not respond to the opposition demands in his Sunday
announcement.

Palestinian youth prepare for showdown with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In anticipation of a May 1999
showdown with Israel, 135 young Palestinians swore on Sunday to
defend Gaza if and when a Palestinian state is declared.
	   The 11-20 year-olds, from Yasser Arafat's Fatah youth
organization, have been training for three months in the use of
automatic weapons and in hand-to-hand combat.
	   At the swearing-in ceremony they demonstrated how they would
defend convoys and capture Israeli undercover troops attempting to
enter Gaza.
	   Arafat has stated that he will unilaterally declare an
independent Palestinian state in May 1999 if he does not achieve
this in the negotiations with Israel.
	   Israel has warned that this will mean the end of the Oslo peace
process.
	   An Israeli official said Sunday the arming and training of more
Palestinians, however young, is a violation of the peace process
because the Palestinian security forces are already much bigger
than the Oslo agreement permits.
	   Under the agreement the Palestinians are allowed to have 24,000
armed police, but according to the Palestinian Authority's budget,
released on March 31, there are 40,000, said Moshe Fogel, director
of the Israel government press office.
	   Currently, 500 youths are in training, said Abd e-Raouf Bardakh,
a leader of the Fatah youth movement in the Gaza Strip.
	   They are training ``to meet any surprise following the
announcement of the Palestinian State, which might lead to the
Israelis coming back into Gaza,'' he said.
	   Fogel told The Associated Press if the Palestinians put more
people under arms ``that is another indication that they're not
living up to the letter of the agreement.''

Dutch sprinter wins second leg of Tour of Spain

<TEXT>
	   CADIZ, Spain (AP) _ Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands won the
second leg of the Tour of Spain on Sunday, a grueling 234-kilometer
(147 mile) trek between Cordoba and Cadiz.
	   In the overall standings the tour leader is still Switzerland's
Markus Szberg of the Post Swiss team, who won the first leg on
Saturday. He's followed by France's Laurent Jalabert of
ONCE-Deutsche Bank and Italy's Giuliano Figueras of Mapei.
	   Blijlevens, a member of the TVM team, covered Sunday's leg in a
time of 6 hours, 30 minutes and 24 seconds. It was the longest of
the 22 stages that make up the tour.
	   After a sprint finish, second place went to Italian Giovanni
Lombardi of Telekom, and third to Australia's Robbie McEwen of the
Rabobank team.
	   Blijlevens dedicated his win to a TVM team doctor and another
team official who are still in France as a result of the doping
probes that marred the Tour de France in July and prompted the TVM
to pull out.
	   ``This is like a dream, after the torture of the Tour. We needed
something like this to recover our morale,'' he said.
	   Sunday's stage also saw the tour's first fall. Just seconds away
from the finish line as he rode in the middle of the pack, Spain's
David Etxebarria of ONCE-Deutsche Bank team hit the ground, causing

Dutch sprinter wins second leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CADIZ, Spain (AP) _ Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands won the
second leg of the Tour of Spain on Sunday, a grueling 234-kilometer
(147-mile) trek between Cordoba and Cadiz.
	   The overall tour leader is still Markus Szberg of Switzerland,
riding for Post Swiss, who won the first leg on Saturday. He's
followed by Frenchman Laurent Jalabert, of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and
Italian Giuliano Figueras, of Mapei.
	   Blijlevens, a member of the TVM team, covered Sunday's leg in 6
hours, 30 minutes and 24 seconds. It was the longest of the 22
stages that make up the tour.
	   After a sprint finish, second place went to Italian Giovanni
Lombardi of Telekom, and third to Australia's Robbie McEwen of the
Rabobank team.
	   Blijlevens dedicated his win to a TVM team doctor and another
team official who are still in France as a result of the doping
probes that marred the Tour de France in July and prompted TVM to
pull out of the race.
	   ``This is like a dream, after the torture of the Tour (de
France). We needed something like this to recover our morale,'' he
said.
	   Sunday's stage also saw the tour's first fall. Just seconds away
from the finish line as he rode in the middle of the pack, Spain's
David Etxebarria of ONCE-Deutsche Bank team hit the ground, causing
several other riders to fall.
	   There were no reports of serious injuries, although Etxebarria
suffered bruises and scrapes and his bike was ruined.
	   However the race did suffer a casualty Sunday _ Belgian star
Frank Vandenbroucke of the Lotto Mobistar team pulled out of the
competition because of what was described as an oral infection.
	   Carlos Osorio of Colombia, riding for Avianca Telecom, also
pulled out for an undisclosed reason.

Seles, Hingis, Kafelnikov, Henman win at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis and Monica Seles survived the
swirling winds and determined opponents Sunday to reach the women's
singles quarterfinals at the U.S. Open.
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, outlasted fellow American Kimberly Po
6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in a fourth-round match at the National Tennis
Center. It was the Day 7 opener in Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   A petulant Hingis, bouncing her racket on the court several
times in anger, followed with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Nathalie Dechy of
France 6-4, 6-4.
	   ``There's no other Grand Slam with so much wind. It's not fair
to the players. I've played in wind, but this is wind,'' Seles
said, emphasizing the last word. ``It moves the ball two meters.
	   ``It made me tentative. Every ball you're hitting has to be 100
percent, and I wasn't today, for sure.''
	   Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 11 seed from Russia, and No. 13 Tim
Henman of Britain advanced to the men's fourth round.
	   Kafelnikov defeated Germany's Nicolas Kiefer 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 and
Henman downed qualifier Michael Kohlmann of Germany 6-3, 7-5, 1-6,
6-4.
	   Coming off her fourth consecutive Canadian Open title, Seles
came into the year's final Grand Slam tournament as one of the
favorites. Po, however, had other ideas.
	   Po kept the pressure on Seles the entire match, reaching break
point time and time again during the three sets. But she wasn't
able to convert as Seles ran out to a 6-2, 4-1 lead.
	   Then Po's shots, which had been sprayed all over the court,
started finding the corners and the angles. She ripped off the next
six games to level the match and take a 1-0 lead in the third set.
	   Seles finally broke Po in the fifth game when she whipped a
sharply-angled backhand crosscourt that nipped the left sideline.
When she broke Po's service again, in the ninth, it closed out the
match.
	   Seles also broke four rackets during the match.
	   ``I took them right from the stringing and the air-conditioning,
and I think it was too much for them,'' said Seles, who heard them
crack as they broke.
	   ``I have two rackets left,'' she said, ``but going at this pace
... I better call Yonex immediately.''

Indian and Pakistani prime ministers to meet later this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The prime ministers of India and
Pakistan will meet later this month in New York, where both are
scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly, a
domestic news agency reported Sunday.
	   The initiative for the meeting between Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif came
from Pakistan, the United News of India quoted Vajpayee's spokesman
Brajesh Misra as saying.
	   Mishra said the meeting would be held on September 23. He said
the two countries had agreed to resume official level talks, but
details on how this would not be available until after the meeting
in New York, according to UNI.
	   The proposed meeting raises hopes of a breakthrough in stalled
talks between the two neighbors following a series of nuclear tests
in May this year.
	   The two prime ministers met on the sidelines of a regional
summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka, two months ago to discuss, among
other things, their dispute over the territory of the Himalayan
border territory of Kashmir. Those talks were inconclusive.
	   Kashmir, which was divided between the two countries following
two wars, has been the main issue of dispute since the subcontinent
gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   The two prime ministers were scheduled to meet again in Durban,
South Africa, earlier this month, but Sharif called off his trip
citing domestic engagements.

Pinochet says he's not responsible for human rihgts abuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was quoted Sunday
as saying he had ``nothing to do'' with human rights abuses during
his military regime.
	   In an interview with the Santiago daily El Mercurio, Pinochet
claimed he has no information on the whereabouts of 1,102
dissidents who have not been located since they were detained by
his security services.
	   He also said calling him responsible for human rights abuses
``is the most unjust accusation ever done against a man.''
	   ``I had nothing to do with that,'' he said. ``When I heard of
some criminal act, I relayed the case to the courts.''
	   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody coup in 1973 and ruled
until 1990, was accused of widescale human rights abuses during his
rule.
	   More than 3,100 people were killed for political reasons during
his 17 years in power, and 1,102 people are still missing,
according to a months-long investigation by the civilian government
that succeeded Pinochet. Thousands more were tortured and forced
into exile.
	   Pinochet has often denied the allegations, although he has
admitted in the past that ``mistakes were made by both sides,''
referring to his govenrment and the groups that resorted to
violence to fight it.
	   In the newspaper interview published Sunday, he said he could
not speak for his subordinates.
	   ``That's a different thing,'' he said. ``I do not know, that was
a problem that was beyond my reach. That's what people do not
understand.''
	   The former ruler, who lost presidential elections in 1990, has
retained substantial political and military clout by becoming a
senator for life, a guarantee he established for himself in the
constitution written by his regime.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, whose hauntingly poetic vision,
innovative style and stunning technical virtuosity made him Japan's
most celebrated film director, died at home in Tokyo on Sunday. He
was 88.
	   Minoru Tabata, an official of Kurosawa Film Production, said
Kurosawa died of a stroke before he could be taken to a hospital.
	   ``I can't say what it was about, but he was working on one more
film,'' Hiromichi Horikawa, a director who studied under Kurosawa,
told national broadcaster NHK.
	   ``My father has done almost what he wanted to do,'' said
Kurosawa's 52-year-old son Hisao, a director himself.
	   Filmmakers throughout the world have been influenced by
Kurosawa, who fused the pinpoint precision of traditional Japanese
theatrical forms with stunning, larger-than-life spectacles.
	   ``The term `giant' is used too often to describe artists. But in
the case of Akira Kurosawa, we have one of the rare instances where
the term fits. Aside from the fact that he was the man who almost
singlehandedly introduced Japanese cinema to the West, his
influence on filmmakers throughout the entire world is so profound
as to be almost incomparable,'' said director Martin Scorsese.

Norwegian PM extends depression sick-leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik's sick
leave for depression has been extended for one week, said acting
Prime minister Anne Enger Lahnstein to Norweigan state television
NRK Sunday.
	   ``He is getting better, but he still needs a little time to
relax and recover,'' said Lahnstein.
	   But she insisted that Bondevik would be back in his job well
before parliament starts debating the budget October 2.
	   Bondevik took a week's sick leave last Sunday for a depressive
reaction due to overwork, just as his fragile three-party
government was to start difficult negotiations about next year's
budget.
	   Bondevik had been under considerable pressure as Norway's
economy soured during the summer due to low oil prices, spillover
from the Asian crisis and a perception that his government was weak
and unable to handle necessary tightening.
	   Just a day before Bondevik became ill, the Oslo daily VG cited
government sources saying Bondevik was considering postponing a
costly cash support scheme for mothers who stay home with their
young children, a favourite cause of his Christian People's Party.

Pinochet says he's not responsible for human rihgts abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES incorrect reference to Pinochet losing elections in
last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet was quoted Sunday
as saying he had ``nothing to do'' with human rights abuses during
his military regime.
	   In an interview with the Santiago daily El Mercurio, Pinochet
claimed he has no information on the whereabouts of 1,102
dissidents who have not been located since they were detained by
his security services.
	   He also said calling him responsible for human rights abuses
``is the most unjust accusation ever done against a man.''
	   ``I had nothing to do with that,'' he said. ``When I heard of
some criminal act, I relayed the case to the courts.''
	   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody coup in 1973 and ruled
until 1990, was accused of widescale human rights abuses during his
rule.
	   More than 3,100 people were killed for political reasons during
his 17 years in power, and 1,102 people are still missing,
according to a months-long investigation by the civilian government
that succeeded Pinochet. Thousands more were tortured and forced
into exile.
	   Pinochet has often denied the allegations, although he has
admitted in the past that ``mistakes were made by both sides,''
referring to his govenrment and the groups that resorted to
violence to fight it.
	   In the newspaper interview published Sunday, he said he could
not speak for his subordinates.
	   ``That's a different thing,'' he said. ``I do not know, that was
a problem that was beyond my reach. That's what people do not
understand.''
	   The former ruler has retained substantial political and military
clout by becoming a senator for life, a guarantee he established
for himself in the constitution written by his regime.

Judge okays extradition of U.S. teen-ager accused of murder

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a case that has strained relations between
the United States and Israel, an Israeli judge ruled Sunday that an
American teen-ager wanted for murder can be returned to Maryland to
face the charges.
	   But 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein will not be immediately
extradited. His lawyer has 50 days to appeal the decision to the
Israeli Supreme Court, and the delay could run to months while the
appeal is heard.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was discovered in the garage of
an empty house near the Sheinbein home in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Shortly after arriving, he was picked up by police and hospitalized
briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father who was
born in pre-state Palestine, which was under British rule before
the Jewish state was founded in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens
cannot be extradited and Sheinbein's lawyer fought the U.S.
extradition request based on the citizenship law.
	   District Judge Moshe Ravid on Sunday upheld Sheinbein's claim to
Israeli citizenship but said that was not enough to protect him
from prosecution abroad. Israeli law allows for citizens to be
tried in Israel instead of being extradited.
	   ``The defendant can be extradited because under the extradition
law a citizen is defined as someone who has the status of Israeli
citizen and has a connection to the country,'' Ravid wrote in the
56-page decision. He added that Sheinbein, who had never visited
Israel before the murder, had no connection to the country.
	   Sheinbein remained, 8th graf

Olympic champ Mueller launches bid for world title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Switzerland's Olympic champion Xeno
Mueller successfully launched his campaign for a title at the world
rowing championships on Sunday, qualifying directly for the
semifinals of the men's single scull.
	   Mueller, a gold medalist in Atlanta two years ago, completed the
2,000 meter heat in 6 minutes, 54 seconds and 97 seconds, ahead of
American James Koven.
	   Koven will get another opportunity to qualify in a repechage
heat, along with Olympic silver medalist Derek Porter of Canada.
The Canadian finished third in his heat, won by Czech Vaclav
Chalupa.
	   Rob Waddell of New Zealand and Iztok Cop of Slovenia also
advanced to the semis.
	   Russia's sculling sensation Irina Fedotova, winner of all three
World Cup events in her first season racing in single scull,
qualified for the women's semifinal, recording the fastest time of
all the heats to finish first in 7:28.78.
	   Germany's Katrin Rutschow won her leg in 7:29.24, while Trine
Hansen of Denmark crossed first in hers in 7:33.94.
	   In the men's coxless four, quadruple Olympic gold medalists
Steve Redgrave, double gold medalist Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster
and James Cracknell began the defense of their title, winning their
heat in 6:04.58.
	   The Britons will get plenty of challenge from the fast, young
Australian four Geoffrey Stewart, Boden Hanson, Benjamin Dodwell
and James Stewart, who crossed in a blistering 6:03.55. The Italian
crew Walter Molea, Riccardo Di Rossi, Lorenzo Carboncini, Carlo

the semifinals.

Head of Russian Orthodox Church calls for end to political
</HEADLINE>
squabbling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the Russian Orthodox Church called on
politicians Sunday to turn away from confrontation and lead Russia
out of its crisis, a news agency said.
	   Patriarch Alexy II prayed for accord among the country's
leaders, and said that ``if peace is not achieved, the consequences
may be irreversible,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   It was an unusual foray into secular affairs for the patriarch,
who has not taken a prominent role so far in responding to Russia's
economic woes. He spoke after his return from a recent trip to
Siberia.
	   ``Primarily, the crisis makes people suffer,'' Alexy told
worshippers at the Christ the Savior Cathedral. ``The price rise
will affect every person, the economic problems will harm every
family, and at this time one should not ponder personal ambitions
or party affiliation but think about the future and our people.''
	   Although the patriarch did not take sides in the political
battle now unfolding in the Kremlin, he did thank one key player,
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, for his assistance in rebuilding the
cathedral, ``which was a symbol of both the revival of belief and
the spiritual revival of all of Russia.''
	   Luzhkov, a popular nationalist, is considered a leading prospect
for the Russian presidency in the next election and has recently
been discussed as a potential candidate for prime minister.

Speculation about three-way summit as new U.S. effort begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With a new U.S. diplomatic effort poised to
begin, Israeli and Palestinian officials on Sunday suggested the
possibility of a new round of meetings in Washington or even a
three-way summit with President Bill Clinton.
	   Negotiations on a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
have been stalled for 18 months, and Clinton vowed during a visit
to Ireland last week that he would try to break the impasse.
	   A flurry of diplomatic activity appeared in the offing beginning
with a visit, starting Wednesday, of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross. It is his first visit to the region since May.
	   With the Mideast leaders expected at the U.N. General Assembly
later this month, Israel radio said the Clinton administration
hoped to bring both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser
Arafat to Washington _ for either separate meetings or a three-way
summit.
	   ``Netanyahu has offered to meet Arafat for months now in hopes
they can reach agreement on a second redeployment. Until now,
Arafat has said no,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to the prime
minister.
	   A senior Palestinian official indicated a Clinton-Arafat meeting
was more likely than a three-way summit.
	   ``I don't exclude the possibility of a meeting between President
Arafat and President Clinton,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian negotiator.
	   ``But as far as a trilateral meeting...I think this will heavily
depend on the outcome of Mr. Ross' visit to the region.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz declined comment on the
speculation about a summit, which some observers viewed as a trial
balloon.
	   Netanyahu planned a five-day visit to the United States,
starting Sept. 23, when he is scheduled to deliver a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly. Arafat will also be there and was scheduled
to speak Sept. 28.
	   The Israeli leader squelched reports in the Israeli media that
he had opened a secret channel with a senior Palestinian
negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, and held a series of meetings.
	   The reports prompted anger from right-wing members of his
Cabinet, but Netanyahu said he had only met with Qureia once five
weeks ago.
	   Negotiations between Qureia, and Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak
Molcho led to a draft document which Israeli officials say spelled
out Israel's agreement to a 13 percent pullback from the West Bank.
	   Israel had been insisting that it could give no more than 10
percent, but then agreed to a U.S. compromise that the final 3
percent would be designated as a ``nature reserve'' under
Palestinian control.
	   However, an Israeli official said Qureia accepted the document,
but Arafat disowned the deal after a visit to Cairo, where the
Egyptian government was apparently cool to the idea.
	   ``No agreements have been reached,'' Erekat said.

U.S. to give more grain to Bangladesh as flood relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DHA101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _The United States has announced an
additional 200,000 tons of grain to help people affected by floods
in Bangladesh, domestic news agencies reported Sunday.
	   The U.S. commitment is in addition to an earlier donation of
200,000 tons in response to an appeal by Bangladesh for dlrs 879
million to aid at least 30 million flood victims.
	   The total U.S. help now stands at dlrs 65 million, the UNB news
agency said, quoting the U.S. embassy in the Bangladeshi capital
Dhaka.
	   Torrential monsoon rains battered large parts of the country
again over the weekend, causing overflowing rivers to swell
further. The floods have killed 800 people so far.
	   Weather experts on Sunday said that the flood situation was
likely to worsen in the coming days. As many as 32 of 47 districts
in the country are submerged under flood water.
	   A United Nations survey of the impact of the floods said this
year's flooding exceeded the severity and damage caused by a
similar catastrophe in 1988, when 2,000 people died and massive
damage was done to the economy.

Greece draws 2-2 against Slovenia in Euro 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovic scored two goals
Sunday to give his country a 2-2 draw against Greece in their first
Group Two qualifier match for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Norway, Albania, Georgia and Latvia are the other teams in that
group.
	   Greece played aggressive from the start and came close to score
in the 6th minute when Demis Nikolaidi shot wide from three meters
(yards) off a center from Vassilis Borbokis.
	   The visitors reacted soon and with midfield pressing and sudden
counter attacks they started causing problems to the Greek defense.
	   In one such attack in the 19th, Zahovic gave his team the lead
off a pass from Milan Osterc.
	   Four minutes before the end of the first half, Yiannis
Kalitzakis' header in front of the Slovenian goalmouth went just
wide, scraping past Marko Simeunovic's right post.
	   The Greeks regrouped after the rest period and levelled with a
penalty taken by Nikos Machlas in the 55th.
	   Costas Ftantzeskos who replaced Vassilis Tsartas in the 46th,
gave Greece a 2-1 lead with a free kick from 30 meters (yards). The
ball hit the crossbar and then the goalkeeper's back to enter the
net.
	   Machlas failed to increase the score in the 65th as his shot,
face-to-face with Simeunovic, hit the Slovenian right bar
	   Seven minutes later, Miran Pavlin gave a perfect pass to Zahovy
who easily beat goaltender Ilias Atmatzidis to make the final 2-2.
	   Lineups:
	   Greece: Ilias Atmatzidis, Michalis Kasapis (Grigoris Georgatos,
77th), Marinos Ouzounidis, Yiannis Kalitzakis, Demis Nikolaidis,
Theodoros Zagorakis, Vassilis Tsartas (Costas Frantzeskos, 46th),
Vassilis Borbokis (Nikos Limberopoulos 82nd), Nikos Dabitzas, Nikos
Machlas, Dimitris Markos.

Radical Islamic groups threatens to kidnap Americans in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ A radical Islamic group threatened
Sunday to attack U.S. property and kidnap Americans in Pakistan
unless Washington apologizes to the Muslim world for a missile
strike in Afghanistan.
	   An estimated 15,000 members of the militant Movement for the
Enforcement of Islam in English marched in Peshawar, a frontier
town on the Afghan border, shouting ``Death to America.''
	   It was the largest anti-American demonstration to date in
Peshawar, 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of the capital, Islamabad.
	   The United States launched cruise missile strikes on Aug. 20
against suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan, as well as a
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan that Washington feared was being
used to make biological weapons, in retaliation for the bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 258 people.
	   Washington believes terrorist camps in Afghanistan were run by
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom the United States blames
for funding the embassy bombings.
	   During the rally in Peshawar, militant leader Maulana Sufi
Mohammed threatened to attack American property in Pakistan and
kidnap Americans unless Washington apologizes for the missile
strike. He did not set a deadline.
	   The group was founded in 1992 to push for the strict enforcement
of Islamic law. The fast-growing group's violent actions include
attacks on an airport and Pakistani government installations in
1994.
	   The United States has already evacuated more than half its
diplomatic staff and all dependents of government employees from
Pakistan because of rising anti-American sentiment.

Kabila, other leaders, arrive in Zimbabwe for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila
arrived in this northwestern Zimbabwean resort Sunday, putting to
rest fears that he would boycott a peace summit seeking a
cease-fire in Congo and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   The talks, convened by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, were
scheduled to formally begin on Monday.
	   Kabila has been trying to suppress a rebel insurrection since
late July, but rebels now control a quarter of the vast
mineral-rich central African country.
	   The rebels, who were not included at two previous summits over
the past month, were also expected to attend.
	   ``Anybody involved in the Congo (who) can make a contribution to
bring peace to the country is welcome to the Victoria Falls
conference,'' Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge was
quoted as saying by the South African Press Association.
	   Other leaders who arrived Sunday included Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, Mugabe and
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organization of African
Unity.
	   ``This summit should bring peace to the Congo,'' Museveni told
reporters.
	   The Ugandan president said a crucial part of the discussion
would be democratic reform in Congo. Hopes for democracy rose when
Kabila last year overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, ending three
decades of tyrannical rule.
	   Kabila has promised free elections, but he also has arrested
opposition activists and stirred up ethnic enmities.
	   The conflict, the largest threat to security in Central Africa
in years, has drawn in five other countries. Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola have all sent troops to back Kabila.
	   Meanwhile, Kabila has accused Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring
the month-long rebellion against him and demanded their withdrawal
from Congolese soil. Uganda and Rwanda deny backing the rebels.
	   In behind-the-scene discussions at last week's Nonaligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, regional leaders agreed in
principle to withdraw troops to the border regions, where they can
monitor security, according to media reports in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Uganda and Angola claim that Congo harbors opponents to
their respective governments, and stationing their troops at the
borders would help keep such forces out, The Sunday Times of
Johannesburg reported.
	   Foreign and defense ministers from Congo and its allies Namibia,
Zimbabwe and Angola met on Saturday in Harare to discuss the summit
agenda.

Clergy comfort townspeople, promise to remember crash victims

<TEXT>
	   HACKETTS COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ With a tragedy dropping from
the skies on his little parish, the Rev. Richard Walsh has never
been needed so much.
	   Churchgoers here say Walsh, a man with a firm handshake and hair
as white as his flowing robe, is not prone to emotions. But on
Sunday, Walsh had to cry.
	   ``This has been a horrible week,'' he said, pausing to choke
back tears in his first sermon of the day to 30 people at St.
Peter's Church. ``I'm sorry, I'll be okay.''
	   As the remains of passengers and their possessions wash up on
the shore, Walsh has worked around the clock to counsel the
residents of the small fishing villages on the edge of St.
Margaret's Bay.
	   Standing under the stained glass image of Jesus walking on
water, moments before giving his first sermon, Walsh said he hadn't
put much thought into what would possibly be the most important
services of his career.
	   ``I've had to deal with death all through my ministry,'' he
said. ``But I've never had to deal with anything at this level.''
	   At the Anglican churches of St. Peter's and St. John's in
Peggy's Cove _ where family members of the victims have gathered to
look out over the ocean _ Walsh thanked townspeople, emergency
workers and volunteers for doing all they can to help.
	   ``This is Nova Scotia, this is what we do,'' he said.
	   Walsh said routines would soon return to normal, but the people
around St. Margaret's Bay would never forget the disaster. He
prepared them for what's to come.
	   ``The cameras and crews are going to depart. Then we'll have the
morbidly curious who will come and look out and be disappointed
they didn't see anything and they will go, quickly, I hope,'' he
said. ``The tourists will come back,'' men will return to work,
``and they will remember,'' he said.
	   The words were a comfort for many of the parishioners, including
Ray Boutilier of Hackett's Cove, who helped recover human remains
aboard his fishing charter boat.
	   Boutilier, a World War II veteran, said he wished he hadn't gone
because it dredged up memories of the war. When he got back to the
dock he found a white sock tangled in his prop.
	   Helen Levy, whose husband was killed in a car crash years ago
while returning from work in Halifax, said the plane crash brought
back memories of grieving for her husband and a rush of sympathy
for the victims' families.
	   ``When I got the call about the car accident I had this awful
sick feeling in my stomach,'' she said. ``I'd hoped I'd never feel
it again. I know what those people are feeling.''
	   Walsh was not alone in comforting the townspeople.
	   David Bugler, an Anglican priest from Cobbleskill, New York, was
returning from a vacation in Peggy's Cove when he heard news of the
plane crash on the radio and turned his car around to help. While
Walsh has looked after townspeople, Bugler has comforted victims'
family members at Peggy's Cove.
	   Bugler said he has mostly listened to them. One time he provided
hot chocolate to a man and two his young boys who lost a wife and
mother. They drank it looking over the ocean as the sun set and it
seemed to help.
	   ``There was a young woman who was crying and I walked up to her
and said, `Who is it?''' Bugler said. ``She said `My cousin.' She
was a young woman who had three children who went down with her.
That's pretty heavy stuff.''
	   Walsh said he has had one happy occasion in the middle of the
despair _ a wedding _ on Friday. But it too had been touched by the
disaster: The groom was a crew member aboard the Canadian Coast
Guard helicopter first on the scene of the crash.
	   ``Life goes on,'' Walsh said. ``It has to.''

Brazilian Olympian loses part of leg in yachting accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Olympic yachting medalist Lars
Grael lost most of his right leg when his vessel was hit by another
boat Sunday.
	   Grael was competing in the national championships in Vitoria,
250 miles (410 kilometers) northeast of Rio, when the crash
occurred, said Alice Monjaedem, a spokeswoman at Unimed hospital.
	   ``He has lost most of his right leg from above the knee
downwards and is undergoing surgery,'' Monjaedem said. ``There is
little chance his leg can be sewn back.''
	   Grael, 34, a Brazilian yachting champion, won bronze medals at
the 1988 and 1996 Olympics.

Czech Republic struggles for 1-0 win over Faeroe Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Czech Republic, runners-up at the last
European soccer championship in 1996, limped to a 1-0 win over
Faeroe Islands with a late goal Sunday in its opening Euro 2000
qualifier.
	   The Czech Republic, beaten 2-1 by Germany in the Euro 96 final,
struggled at Toftir _ on a tiny Atlantic island between Scotland
and Iceland _ until Vladimir Smicer scored in the 84th minute.
	   Smicer fired the ball past goalie Jakup Mikkelsen to score the
clincher but the goal was booed by fans angry that the referee had
not stopped the game while a Faeroese player lay injured in back
play.
	   The Czech Republic, which failed to qualify for the France 98
World Cup finals despite its success at Euro 96, retained its
unbeaten record over Faeroe Islands in three matches since 1989.
	   The Faeroe Islands, which had to clear its qualifying matches
due to climatic conditions, had already lost 5-0 to Estonia and 1-0
to Bosnia in Group 9 qualifiers.
	   In other matches being played Sunday to complete round one,
Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovic scored two goals in a 2-2 tie with Greece
in a group 2 qualifier in Greece.
	   Slovenia opened the scoring when Zahovic netted his first in the
19th minute.
	   Greece equalized and then grabbed the lead early in the second
half through penalties by Nikos Machlas in the 55th minute and
Costas Ftantzeskos, which rebounded off the goalkeeper's back,
minutes later.
	   Ftantzeskos hit the post with another penalty attempt in the
65th minute, which ultimately cost the home team a victory.
	   But Slovenia drew level 73rd minute when Miran Pavlin gave a
perfect pass to Zahovy, who easily beat goaltender Ilias
Atmatzidis.
	   In Burgas, Bulgaria, Poland easily defeated Bulgaria 3-0.
	   Sylwester Czereszewski opened the score in the 19th minute when
he fired a shot from 12 yards over head of the goalkeeper. He
scored again just on halftime to give the visitors a 2-0 advantage
at the break.
	   Tomasz Iwan scored Poland's third goal in the opening minutes of
the second period when he dribbled brilliantly through the
Bulgarian defense.
	   In other matches, Hungary was playing Portugal in Budapest,
Macedonia was at home to Malta and Norway was playing Latvia in
Oslo.
	   On Saturday, first-round Euro qualifiers produced some surprises
with World Cup holder France held 1-1 by Iceland and Spain upset
3-2 by Cyprus.
	   The French, 3-0 winners over Brazil in the World Cup final two
months ago, fell behind in Reykjavik after a blunder by 'keeper
Fabien Barthez who chased out of his goal and was beaten by a
header by Rikhardur Dadason.
	   Christophe Dugarry leveled three minutes later but the French
failed to recapture its World Cup form in its first competitive
game under new coach Roger Lemerre.
	   Spain, humiliated after first round elimination from the World
Cup, suffered more embarassment in its loss to the
semi-professional Cyprus team at Larnaca.
	   Cyprus got away to a 3-1 lead and Spain hit back with a goal
five minutes from time but it was too little, too late.
	   Sweden beat England 2-1 at Stockholm, striking back from one
goal down after Alan Shearer's goal in the 76th second gave England
a 1-0 lead.
	   The England captain fired-in a bending free kick two minutes
into the game but the Swedes replied with two goals in two minutes
by Andreas Andersson (30th) and Johan Mjallby (32nd).
	   Ireland stunned World Cup semifinalist Croatia 2-0 in Group 8,
while Italy cruised to a 2-0 win over Wales in Liverpool and the
Ukraine scored a 3-2 win over Russia at Kiev.

Greece draws 2-2 against Slovenia in Euro 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovic scored two goals
Sunday to give his country a 2-2 draw against Greece in their first
Group Two qualifier match for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Norway, Albania, Georgia and Latvia are the other teams in the
group.
	   Greece played aggressively from the start and came close to
scoring in the sixth minute, when Demis Nikolaidi shot wide from 3
meters (yards) off a center from Vassilis Borbokis.
	   The visitors reacted with midfield pressing and sudden counter
attacks, causing problems for the Greek defense.
	   In one such attack in the 19th minute, Zahovic gave his team the
lead off a pass from Milan Osterc.
	   Four minutes before the end of the first half, Yiannis
Kalitzakis' header in front of the Slovenian goalmouth went just
wide, scraping past Marko Simeunovic's right post.
	   The Greeks regrouped after the rest period and evened the score
with a penalty taken by Nikos Machlas in the 55th.
	   Costas Ftantzeskos, who replaced Vassilis Tsartas in the 46th,
gave Greece a 2-1 lead with a free kick from 30 meters (yards). The
ball hit the crossbar and then the goalkeeper's back to enter the
net.
	   Machlas failed to increase the score in the 65th as his shot,
face-to-face with Simeunovic, hit the Slovenian right bar
	   Seven minutes later, Miran Pavlin gave a perfect pass to Zahovy
who easily beat goaltender Ilias Atmatzidis to make the final 2-2.

Euro 2000 Group 8 qualifier at Skopje.
	   Bozinov scored the opening goal in 20th minute when he swooped
on a rebound from a free kick near the goal mouth and drove the
ball into the back of the net.
	   He scored again in the 48th when he accepted a well-timed pass
from left-field and sent the ball under the bar, much to the
delight of the 4,000 fans at the main stadium in Macedonia's
capital.
	   Macedonia's other star was Artim Saciri, who also scored twice
after coming on a substitute in the second half.

minute and his second came four minutes later when he scored after
taking a pass in the penalty area.

Palestinian youth prepare for showdown with Israel

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In anticipation of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's pledge to declare an independent Palestinian
state in May 1999, 135 young Palestinians swore on Sunday to defend
Gaza against any Israeli incursion.
	   The youths _ ages 11 to 20 _ are from Arafat's Fatah youth
organization and have been training for three months in the use of
automatic weapons and in hand-to-hand combat.
	   At the ceremony, they demonstrated how they would defend convoys
and capture Israeli undercover troops attempting to enter Gaza.
	   Under the Mideast peace process started by the 1993 Oslo peace
accords, Israel withdrew from most of the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat has stated that he will unilaterally declare an
independent Palestinian state in May if he does not achieve this
goal in negotiations with Israel. Israel has warned that this will
mean the end of the Oslo peace process.
	   An Israeli official said Sunday the arming and training of more
Palestinians, however young, is a violation of the peace process
because the Palestinian security forces are already much bigger
than the Oslo agreement permits.
	   Under the agreement, the Palestinians are allowed to have 24,000
armed police. But according to the Palestinian Authority's latest
budget there are 40,000, said Moshe Fogel, director of the Israel
government press office.
	   Fogel told The Associated Press if the Palestinians put more
people under arms ``that is another indication that they're not
living up to the letter of the agreement.''
	   Currently, 500 youths are in training, said Abd e-Raouf Bardakh,
a leader of the Fatah youth movement in the Gaza Strip.
	   They are training ``to meet any surprise following the
announcement of the Palestinian state, which might lead to the
Israelis coming back into Gaza,'' he said.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami
claimed election victory Sunday and said he would move quickly to
revive Malta's European Union membership bid, which had been frozen
by the Labor Party of Prime Minister Alfred Sant.
	   Sant, conceding he had failed in his gamble that early elections
would strengthen his socialists' one-vote majority in the 65-seat
parliament, resigned allowing for Fenech Adami to be quickly sworn
in.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sa Pinto scored two goals in Portugal's
3-1 win over Hungary as the visitors fought back from 0-1 down in
the European Championship soccer qualifier at Budapest on Sunday.
	   The Hungarians took the lead 32nd minute when Ferenc Horvat
scored from in front of the Portugese net after good lead up down
the right flank by Tibor Dombi.
	   The Hungarians played mostly a defensive game and held a
one-goal advantage at the break but Portugal's more daring game
plan resulted in a win.
	   Portugal's offensive thrusts were thwarted in the first half,
not only by Hungarian goalie, Gabor Kiraly, but also by a
torrential downpour which lasted throughout the 92 minutes of play.
	   An energized Portuguese team came on the field in the second
half and Sa Pinto scored in the 56th minute, dampening Hungarian
spirits as the host team had hoped to turn around a history of
losing to the Portuguese national team.
	   Whatever hopes were left nose-dived in the 76th minute when Sa
Pinto rushed the Hungarian net and fired in the ball from 10
meters.
	   In the 84th minute, Rui Costa scored on a free kick from 20
meters to seal the result.
	   Both countries hope to host the 2004 European Soccer
Championship.
	   Lineups:
	   Hungary _ Gabor Kiraly, Pal Lakos, Csaba Feher, Janos Hrutka,
Janos Matyus, Krisztian Lisztes (Pal Dardai, 46th), Gabor Halmai,
Bela Illes, Tibor Dombi (Zoltan Kovacs, 76th), Ferenc Horvath
(Gyoergy Korsos, 76th), Istvan Hamar.
	   Portugal _ Vitor Baia, Luis Figo, Carlos Secretario, Jorge
Costa, Paulinho Santos, Joao Pinto, Paulo Madeira, Rui Costa, Paulo
Bento, Sa Pinto, Teixeira Dimas.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Labor leaders said Sunday they will
widen the scope of the public sector strike which has gripped the
country for the past four days, as no agreement was reached in pay
talks with the government.
	   Nearly 300,000 employees were on strike. Garbage piled up in the
streets of Tel Aviv Sunday as municipal sanitation workers joined
the stoppage. All government offices, post offices, railroads and
seaports were closed.
	   Hospitals and clinics were treating emergency cases only.
Telephone information and repair services were shut down
	   Engineers and technicians at Ben Gurion International Airport
downed tools, but the airport was still operating.
	   Administrative and laboratory workers at the country's
universities were also on strike.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said the wage hikes demanded by
the unions would cause runaway inflation. Amir Peretz, head of the
giant Histadrut trade union federation accused Neeman of scaring
the public with figures many times greater than the real cost of
the increases.
	   Peretz threatened to shut down the airport altogether, beginning
Monday, and to add the state-owned electricity company workers to
the strike.
	   Hopes for an end to the six day-old teachers strike that has
delayed the start of the school year for almost two million
students, were also dashed Thursday night as union leaders and the
treasury accused each other of bad faith.
	   In spite of the recriminations both sides continued with the
marathon negotiations Sunday night.

	   The Swissair plane crashed Wednesday, 16 minutes after the
pilots reported smoke in the cockpit and decided to attempt an
emergency landing. The plane started toward the Halifax airport,
but made two sharp turns as it tried to descend and dump fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair officials said they had
reconstructed the final phase of the flight, based on information
from Canadian investigators. They said the plane couldn't have made
a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first distress
call because it was flying too high and was too heavy.
	   The call was made 70 miles (110 kms) out of Halifax, but the
pilots would have needed 130 miles (210 kms) to make a direct
landing, Swissair's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand, said. However,
he said attempting to land in Halifax was still better than trying
for Boston, which the pilots initially suggested to controllers.
	   Swissair said memorial services for victims would be held Friday
in New York, Geneva and Zurich.
	   A series of memorial services was planned over the next several
days in Halifax and surrounding towns.
	   At the service in Peggy's Cove, Walsh said residents of the
region would remember these tragic days for the rest of their
lives.
	   ``Every time we drive by the ocean or the rocks, we will
remember the people who have become spiritually part of our
community,'' he said. ``We will remember and we will never
forget.''

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - Latvia handed Norway its first loss at home
since 1991, stunning a team that made the second round of the World
Cup only two months ago 3-1 in their opening Group 2 European
Championship qualifier Sunday night.
	   Espen Baardsen, replacing the injured Frode Grodas in goal, had
a nightmare debut at Ulleval Stadium. Baardsen had hardly touched
the ball when Marians Pahars made it 1-0 in the 11th minute,
capitalizing on a slow Norwegian defense.
	   Stale Solbakken equalized for Norway in the 17th. But Baardsen,
who had a great game for Tottenham in a 1-0 win over Everton in the
Premier League last week, gave up two more goals within 12 minutes
in the second half.
	   Andrejs Stolcers made it 2-1 in the 53rd and Mihails Zemlinskis
completed the scoring in the 65th on a penalty shot before 11,031
fans at Ulleval.
	   ``I never thought we would lose against Latvia,'' said Nils
Johan Semb, who replaced Egil Olsen as Norway's coach after the
World Cup. ``I knew they would rely on counter-attacks, which they
did. They capitalized 100 percent on their scoring chances. We
missed so many opportunities.''
	   Frodas, who played all games in the World Cup, broke a finger
during a practice session Thursday and will not make his comeback
with Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga until next month.
	   Other teams in Group 2 are Georgia, Albania, Greece and
Slovenia.
	   Referee Sergei Shmolik of Belarus booked two players, Olegs
Karavajevs of Latvia (83rd minute) and Ronny Johnsen of Norway
(87th).
	   Norway was unbeaten in 14 games before losing 1-0 to Italy in
the second round-opener in the World Cup.
	   Lineups:
	   Norway:
	   Espen Baardsen - Vegard Heggem (Henning Berg, 61st minute), Erik
Hoftun, Ronny Johnsen, Stig Inge Bjornebye - Ole Gunnar Solskjar
(Jostein Flo, 63rd) Petter Rudi (Havard Flo, 80th), Kjetil Rekdal,
Stale Solbakken, Frank Strandli - Tore Andre Flo.
	   Latvia:
	   Olegs Karavajevs - Mihails Zemlinskis - Juris Laizans (Viktors
Lukasevics, 52nd), Arturs Zakresevskis, Valerijs Ivanovs - Imants
Bleidelis, Valentins Lobanovs, Vladimirs Babicevs, Aleksejs Sarando
(Rolands Bulders, 75th) - Andrejs Stolcers, Marians Pahars
(Alexandrs Isakovs , 82nd)

Czech Republic struggles for 1-0 win over Faeroe Islands

 &UR; Eds: Updates, Adds remaining three results

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Czech Republic, runners-up at the last
European soccer championship in 1996, limped to a 1-0 win over
Faeroe Islands with a late goal Sunday in its opening Euro 2000
qualifier.
	   The Czech Republic, beaten 2-1 by Germany in the Euro 96 final,
struggled at Toftir _ on a tiny Atlantic island between Scotland
and Iceland _ until Vladimir Smicer scored in the 84th minute.
	   Smicer fired the ball past goalie Jakup Mikkelsen to score the
clincher but the goal was booed by fans angry that the referee had
not stopped the game while a Faeroese player lay injured in back
play.
	   The Czech Republic, which failed to qualify for the France 98
World Cup finals despite its success at Euro 96, retained its
unbeaten record over Faeroe Islands in three matches since 1989.
	   The Faeroe Islands, which had to clear its qualifying matches
due to climatic conditions, had already lost 5-0 to Estonia and 1-0
to Bosnia in Group 9 qualifiers.
	   In other first round matches Sunday, Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovic
scored two goals in a 2-2 tie with Greece in a group 2 qualifier in
Greece.
	   Slovenia opened the scoring when Zahovic netted his first in the
19th minute.
	   Greece equalized and then grabbed the lead early in the second
half through penalties by Nikos Machlas in the 55th minute and
Costas Ftantzeskos, which rebounded off the goalkeeper's back,
minutes later.
	   Ftantzeskos hit the post with another penalty attempt in the
65th minute, which ultimately cost the home team a victory.
	   But Slovenia drew level 73rd minute when Miran Pavlin gave a
perfect pass to Zahovy, who easily beat goaltender Ilias
Atmatzidis.
	   In Burgas, Bulgaria, Poland easily defeated Bulgaria 3-0.
	   Sylwester Czereszewski opened the score in the 19th minute when
he fired a shot from 12 yards over the head of the goalkeeper. He
scored again just on halftime to give the visitors a 2-0 advantage
at the break.
	   Tomasz Iwan scored Poland's third goal in the opening minutes of
the second period when he dribbled brilliantly through the
Bulgarian defense.
	   In other matches, Hungary crashed to a 3-0 defeat by Portugal at
Budapest and Macedonia thrashed Malta 4-0 in Skopje, with Risto
Bosinov scoring two goals on debut.
	   Latvia handed Norway its first loss at home since 1991, stunning
a team that made the second round of the World Cup only two months
ago 3-1 in their opening Group 2 qualifier.
	   On Saturday, first-round Euro qualifiers produced some surprises
with World Cup holder France held 1-1 by Iceland and Spain upset
3-2 by Cyprus.
	   The French, 3-0 winners over Brazil in the World Cup final two
months ago, fell behind in Reykjavik after a blunder by 'keeper
Fabien Barthez who chased out of his goal and was beaten by a
header by Rikhardur Dadason.
	   Christophe Dugarry leveled three minutes later but the French
failed to recapture its World Cup form in its first competitive
game under new coach Roger Lemerre.
	   Spain, humiliated after it was eliminated in the first round of
the World Cup, suffered more embarassment in its loss to the
semi-professional Cyprus team at Larnaca.
	   Cyprus got away to a 3-1 lead and Spain hit back with a goal
five minutes from time but it was too little, too late.
	   Sweden beat England 2-1 at Stockholm, striking back from one
goal down after Alan Shearer's goal in the 76th second gave England
a 1-0 lead.
	   The England captain fired-in a bending free kick two minutes
into the game but the Swedes replied with two goals in two minutes
by Andreas Andersson (30th) and Johan Mjallby (32nd).
	   Ireland stunned World Cup semifinalist Croatia 2-0 in Group 8,
while Italy cruised to a 2-0 win over Wales in Liverpool and the
Ukraine scored a 3-2 win over Russia at Kiev.

More Israeli unions joining nation-wide strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new sectors joining strike, CORRECTS Sunday sted
Thursday, penultimate graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's giant Histadrut trade union federation
decided Sunday to widen the scope of the public sector strike which
has gripped the country for the past four days, as no agreement was
reached in pay talks with the government.
	   The federation decided that Ben-Gurion international airport
would be shut down at 9 a.m. local time Monday. The country's
seaports would also be paralyzed.
	   The state-owned electricity company would be on a sabbath
footing beginning 6 a.m. Monday morning, which meant that only the
most urgent repairs would be carried out.
	   Bank employees would join the strike after a few days, the
federation decided, but no decision was made on precisely when.
	   Nearly 300,000 employees were already on strike Sunday. Garbage
piled up in the streets of Tel Aviv Sunday as municipal sanitation
workers joined the stoppage. All government offices, post offices,
railroads and seaports were closed.
	   Hospitals and clinics were treating emergency cases only.
Telephone information and repair services were shut down
	   Engineers and technicians at Ben-Gurion International Airport
had downed tools, but the airport was still operating.
	   Administrative and laboratory workers at the country's
universities were also on strike.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said the wage hikes demanded by
the unions would cause runaway inflation. Histadrut leader Amir
Peretz accused Neeman of scaring the public with figures many times
greater than the real cost of the increases.
	   Hopes for an end to the six day-old teachers strike that has
delayed the start of the school year for almost two million
students were also dashed Sunday night as union leaders and the
treasury accused each other of bad faith.
	   In spite of the recriminations both sides continued with the
marathon negotiations Sunday night.

<TEXT>
	   TOMAKOMAI, Japan (AP) _ Katsunori Kuwabara overcame Shinichi
Yokota's late charge Sunday and beat him on the 38th hole for a
1-up victory in the Japan PGA Matchplay Championship Promise Cup.
	   In an 18-hole round for third place, Myanmar's Zaw Moe defeated
defending champion Shigeki Maruyama 3 and 2.
	   Kuwabara, whose only previous title came in the 1995 Acom
International, seemed headed for an easy victory as he built a 4-up
lead halfway through the regulation 36 holes.
	   But Yokota, also seeking his second career victory, caught up on
the second 18.
	   The 29-year-old Kuwabara finally captured the title by parring
the second extra hole. Yokota reached the green in three shots and
missed a 12-foot (3.5-meter) putt for par.
	   ``I didn't play any differently in the latter half compared to
when I was taking a 5-up lead,'' Kuwabara said. ``He just didn't
give up and he played so well.''
	   Kuwabara collected 30 million yen (dlrs 223,600) from a purse of
100 million yen (dlrs 746,000), and received a five-year exempt
status on the tour. The match play tournament is one of the Japan
PGA Tour's four major events.

Divers find crucial flight-data recorder of Swissair Flight 111
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with large pieces of wreckage found,
details on identification of bodies. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ In a huge advance for investigators,
divers battling murky, choppy seas found one of the two flight
recorders of Swissair Flight 111 on Sunday, as well as three large
pieces of wreckage believed to be the plane's fuselage.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the flight-data
recorder would be flown to a laboratory in Ottawa for examination.
If in good condition, it would provide more than 100 types of
technical data that could be of vital help in explaining why the
MD-11 jetliner plunged into the sea Wednesday, killing all 229
people on board.
	   The so-called black box and the wreckage were found five miles
(8 kms) offshore at a depth of 190 feet (58 meters) by divers
working with hand-held sonar devices. Gerden said the divers were
able to work at that depth for only about seven minutes at a time,
with their visibility limited to about 10 feet (3 meters).
	   The discoveries were a huge breakthrough for investigators, who
previously had gathered little concrete evidence to assist their
probe into why the plane's cockpit filled with smoke and why the
cockpit crew's emergency conversation with traffic controllers was
cut off six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers will continue searching for the second black-box _ the
cockpit voice recorder that would reveal other noises in the
cockpit in addition to the already available conversation with
controllers.
	   Help for the searchers was on its way. The USS Grapple, a U.S.
Navy rescue and salvage ship which assisted in the deep-sea
investigation of the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, embarked Sunday
from Philadelphia, bound for the search area.
	   The ship, expected to arrive Wednesday, carries equipment
capable of lifting 300 tons, plus more than 30 divers able to reach
depths of up to 190 feet (58 meters).
	   On land, victims' families and residents were still trying to
come to grips with the tragedy. More than 300 family members have
flown to Halifax from New York, the plane's starting point, and
Geneva, its intended destination.
	   ``This has been a horrible week,'' said the Rev. Richard Walsh,
pausing to choke back tears in his sermon at St. Peter's Anglican
Church in a coastal town near the search site.
	   ``I'm sorry, I'll be OK,'' he told his congregation after a
pause.
	   The Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the pilots reported
smoke in the cockpit and decided to attempt an emergency landing.
The plane started toward the Halifax airport, but made two sharp
turns as it tried to descend and dump fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair officials said they had
reconstructed the final phase of the flight, based on information
from Canadian investigators. They said the plane couldn't have made
a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first distress
call because it was flying too high and was too heavy.
	   The call was made 70 miles (110 kms) out of Halifax, but the
pilots would have needed 130 miles (210 kms) to make a direct
landing, Swissair's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand, said. However,
he said attempting to land in Halifax was still better than trying
for Boston, which the pilots initially suggested to controllers.
	   Swissair said memorial services for victims would be held Friday
in New York, Geneva and Zurich.
	   A series of memorial services was planned over the next several
days in Halifax and surrounding towns.
	   Walsh, at one of the services, said residents of the region
would remember these tragic days for the rest of their lives.
	   ``Every time we drive by the ocean or the rocks, we will
remember the people who have become spiritually part of our
community,'' he said. ``We will remember and we will never
forget.''
	   At a military air base outside Halifax, pathologists continued
the grim and technically difficult task of trying to identify the
badly fragmented human remains that have been retrieved from the
crash site thus far.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said he has
been groping for gentle ways to convey to the victims' families
that few of them will take possession of mostly intact bodies.
	   Butt also said he had been seeking advice from the medical
officials who handled body identification after the crash of TWA
Flight 800. Asked to compare the state of the bodies in the two
crashes, Butt replied, ``This is much more difficult.''

Floods inundate India's Kaziranga's wildlife park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Rising flood waters in northeastern
India have inundated the famous Kaziranga wildlife park, forcing
almost all the animals to flee, the United News of India reported .
	   ``There is nothing to protect inside the park. All the animals
have fled,'' said J. Bora, head of the park's Bagoria range, where
more than 50 percent of the animals live.
	   The Kaziranga national park is the last major home of the
one-horned rhinoceros. The park is also famous for deer, elephants,
tigers, bears and many water bird species including the pelican.
	   The 430-square-kilometer (250-square-mile) park in Assam state
is under 18 feet (six meters) of water, said the park's director,
B.S. Bonal.
	   Details of damage were not immediately available because
Kaziranga is in a remote part of Assam. But the Diphaloo River,
which runs along the forest reserve, is reported to be swollen by
torrential monsoon rain and has merged with the much larger
Brahmaputra River, UNI said.
	   Forest guards were patrolling a national highway near the park
in heavy rain to make sure that animals running away were not hit
by speeding vehicles.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Notre Dame's upset of Michigan did more than
help the Irish forget about a summer of lawsuits and rules
violations _ it put them back in the Top 10.
	   The Fighting Irish, coming off their first six-loss season since
1986, beat the defending co-national champion Wolverines 36-20 on
Saturday and moved into the No. 10 spot in The Associated Press'
first regular-season Top 25 college football poll.
	   While the Irish leaped 12 spots in the poll, Michigan tumbled
eight places from No. 5 to No. 13. Notre Dame was last ranked in
the Top 10 late in the 1996 season.
	   Ohio State retained the No. 1 ranking with a convincing 34-17
victory over West Virginia, while the Mountaineers fell nine places
from No. 11 to No. 20.
	   The Buckeyes received 39 first-place votes and 1,708 points from
the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. Florida
State, which opened its season last week with a 23-14 win over
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic, remained No. 2 with 22
first-place votes and 1,667 points.
	   In the preseason poll, the Buckeyes led the Seminoles by only
five points and eight first-place votes. Now the lead is 41 points
and 17 first-place votes.
	   Two other games among ranked teams caused a shakeup in the
rankings: Washington moved up seven places to No. 11 after its
42-38 win over Arizona State, which fell from No. 8 to No. 14; and
Colorado beat Colorado State 42-14 to move into the rankings at No.
16, while the Rams fell out of the Top 25 after a No. 15 preseason
rating.
	   Florida, a 49-10 winner over I-AA The Citadel, was No. 3 with
four first-place votes and 1,571 points, while Nebraska (two
first-place votes, 1,546 points) remained No. 4 with a 38-7 win
over Alabama-Birmingham.
	   Kansas State, a 66-0 winner over I-AA Indiana State, moved up a
spot to No. 5 with two first-place votes and 1,418 points, with
UCLA following at No. 6, LSU at No. 7, Tennessee at No. 8, Penn
State at No. 9 and Notre Dame at No. 10.

 &UR; Greece 2, Slovenia 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Athens, a missed penalty by Costas Ftantzeskos in the 65th
minute cost Greece a win over Slovenia.
	   Greece trailed 1-0 after a first-half goal by Zlatko Zahovic but
kicked two penalties in the second half, including one by
Ftantzeskos, to take the lead.
	   Ftantzeskos' second penalty attempt hit the post and Greece
maintained its one-goal buffer until Zahovic scored his second for
Slovenia in the 73rd minute to tie the match.
 &UR; Norway 1, Latvia 3 &QC; 
	   In Oslo, Norway lost its first international at home since 1991
when Latvia scored an upset win at Ulleval Stadium.
	   Norway, which won 14 consecutive matches before losing to Italy
in the second round at the World Cup in France two months ago, was
level at 1-1 at halftime.
	   Latvia's Marians Pahars beat slow defense to score the opener
but Norway hit back six minutes later with a goal through Stale
Solbakken, who plays for Tottenham in England's Premier League.
	   Latvia put the result beyond doubt with two goals within 12
minutes in the second half, Andrejs Stolcers scoring in the 53rd
minute and Mihails Zemlinskis converting a penalty shot in the 65th
minute.
 &UR; Group 5 &QC; 
 &UR; Bulgaria 0, Poland 3 &QC; 
	   In Burgas, Poland easily accounted for Bulgaria but could have
won by a bigger margin.
	   Polish striker Sylwester Czeresewski fired in two first-half
goals before Tomasz Iwan confused the Bulgarian defense in an
individual effort near goal to increase the margin to three early
in the second half.
	   Poland continued to dominate but missed several chances in the
second half, which could have further embarrassed a Bulgarian team
going through a rebuilding phase after a first-round exit at the
World Cup.
 &UR; Group 7 &QC; 
 &UR; Hungary 1, Portugal 3 &QC; 
	   At the People's Stadium in Budapest, Hungary gave up an early
lead and slumped to a loss to Portugal in front of 50,000
supporters.
	   Ferenc Horvat opened the scoring in the 32nd minute but Portugal
dominated the rest of the match and scored the next three,
including a double to Sa Pinto in the 56th and 76th minutes.
	   Heavy rain stifled attacking play for the bulk of the match.
 &UR; Group 8 &QC; 
 &UR; Macedonia 4, Malta 0 &QC; 
	   In Skopje, debutant Risto Bozinov and replacement Artim Saciri
scored two goals apiece as Macedonia cruised to an easy win over
Malta.
	   Bozinov scored in the 20th and 48th minutes, while Saciri scored
a long-range goal in the 75th minute and completed his second late
in the game after coming on as a substitute in the second half.
 &UR; Group 9 &QC; 
 &UR; Faeroe Island 0, Czech Republic 1 &QC; 
	   In Toftir, the Czech Republic, runners-up in the Euro 96
tournament, struggled in low visibility to beat the UEFA minnow,
Faeroe Islands.
	   The game was almost suspended on several occasions as fog
settled over the tiny Atlantic island but play continued until
after Vladimir Smicer scored the clincher in the 84th minute.

Chicago physicist says he'll clone himself with wife's help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A Chicago physicist who provoked controversy
earlier this year by announcing plans to clone humans says the
first person he will try to copy is himself.
	   Richard Seed said his wife, Gloria, has agreed to carry an
embryo that would be created by combining the nucleus of one of his
cells with a donor egg, The Boston Globe reported in its Sunday
editions.
	   Seed declined to give his wife's age, but described her as
``post-menopausal.'' He refused to give details of how the
pregnancy would work.
	   Seed's plan to clone humans drew fire from people who said it
was immoral and carries the risk of still births or abnormal
fetuses.
	   ``I have decided to clone myself first to defuse the criticism
that I'm taking advantage of desperate women with a procedure
that's not proven,'' the 69-year-old said Saturday at a meeting of
the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences, a group of
academic researchers.
	   Seed has three Harvard degrees, including a Ph.D., but no
medical degree, no money and no institutional backing. Also,
California and Michigan have banned human cloning and dozens of
other states are considering bans. Mainstream scientists have
unofficially agreed to a five-year moratorium on the practice.
	   Nonetheless, Seed says he has been invited to set up research
laboratories in two other countries and that he will move his Human
Clone Clinic to Mexico if Congress forbids his research. He also
has vowed to produce a pregnancy with a human clone within 2 1/2
years.
	   Cloning would be the first step in discovering immortality, Seed
said Saturday during his talk. He also said he has received
hundreds of calls, including from parents of dying children who
want to clone them.
	   People at the conference said cloning could be used to produce a
child for an infertile couple, to replace a dead child or to
product a child who could donate bone marrow or other vital tissue
to a sick family member.

Seles and Hingis: the talk of the town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There could be plenty of chatter when Monica
Seles plays Martina Hingis in the U.S. Open quarterfinals. And not
at one another.
	   Seles and Hingis spent much of Sunday muttering to themselves,
complaining about the conditions and the quality of their games.
	   And there was plenty to talk about with both struggling, Seles
defeating Kimberly Po 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 and Hingis subduing Nathalie
Dechy 6-4, 6-4.
	   With winds whipping through the National Tennis Center, every
serve was an adventure, every return an event.
	   ``The conditions were so tough,'' Seles said. ``It was so windy.
Just the whole match. I never felt that I could control where the
ball was going. It's tough in that wind to take any control because
it just swirls around.
	   ``This is more than wind. You hit a ball and it goes here
instead of going here. It can vary by two meters. I never played in
conditions like this.''
	   If it's any consolation, Hingis had the same experience. And by
the same two meters.
	   ``I had trouble,'' she said. ``The ball is coming right at you
and then, all of a sudden, it's two meters next to you. You kind of
want to hit the ball already and it's going away and away. You feel
like, `Hey, what's the matter?' You think it's going to be an easy
shot. Boom! You hit it in the net or something goes wrong.''
	   The conditions wore Seles and Hingis down, forcing a change in
their tactics.
	   ``I became a lot more tentative,'' Seles said. ``I didn't feel
if I hit the ball, the ball is going to go there. I felt kind of
very unsure. And I don't like that feeling.''
	   Hingis said the wind was shifting constantly. She'd have the
wind at her back one moment and an instant later, it was blowing in
her face.
	   It's enough to make a player talk to herself.
	   Seles said she was holding frequent discussions.
	   ``If I'm positive, I say, `Come on!' If I'm negative, then I say
terrible stuff to myself,'' she said.
	   In what language does she conduct these discussions?
	   ``In every language that comes to my mind,'' she said,
``depending on my choice of words.''
	   Hingis thinks that's not at all unusual.
	   ``I guess everybody talks to herself,'' she said.
	   Hingis said she sometimes talks to herself in German. Other
times, she tries to think graphically.
	   ``You kind of have the pictures of what you could do, how you
could do it better,'' she said. ``Then suddenly, it doesn't happen,
again and again.''
	   And that's when the talking starts all over again.

Speculation about three-way summit as new U.S. effort begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jewish settlers attempt to seize building in
Hebron &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With a new U.S. diplomatic effort poised to
begin, Israeli and Palestinian officials on Sunday suggested the
possibility of a new round of meetings in Washington or even a
three-way summit with President Clinton.
	   Negotiations on a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
have been stalled for 18 months, and Clinton vowed during a visit
to Ireland that he would pursue ways to break the impasse.
	   A flurry of diplomatic activity appeared in the offing beginning
with a visit, starting Wednesday, of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross, who is returning to the region for the first time since May.
	   With the Mideast leaders expected at the U.N. General Assembly
later this month, Israel radio said the Clinton administration
hoped to bring both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser
Arafat to Washington - for either separate meetings or a three-way
summit.
	   ``Netanyahu has offered to meet Arafat for months now in hopes
they can reach agreement on a second redeployment. Until now,
Arafat has said no,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to
Netanyahu.
	   A senior Palestinian official indicated a Clinton-Arafat meeting
was more likely than a three-way summit.
	   ``I don't exclude the possibility of a meeting between President
Arafat and President Clinton,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian negotiator.
	   ``But as far as a trilateral meeting...I think this will heavily
depend on the outcome of Mr. Ross' visit to the region.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz declined comment on the
speculation about a summit, which some observers viewed as a trial
balloon.
	   Netanyahu planned a five-day visit to the United States,
starting Sept. 23 when he is scheduled to deliver a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly. Arafat will also be there and was scheduled
to speak Sept. 28.
	   The Israeli leader squelched reports in the Israeli media that
he had opened a secret channel with a senior Palestinian
negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, and held a series of meetings.
	   The reports prompted anger from right-wing members of the
coalition Cabinet, but Netanyahu said he had only met with Qureia
once five weeks ago.
	   Negotiations between Qureia, also known as Abu Alaa, and
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho led to a draft document which
Israeli officials say spelled out Israel's agreement to a 13
percent pullback.
	   Israel had been insisting that it could give no more than 10
percent, but then agreed to a U.S. compromise that three more
percent would be designated as a ``nature reserve'' under
Palestinian control.
	   However, an Israeli official said Qureia accepted the document,
but Arafat disowned the deal after a visit to Cairo, where the
Egyptian government was apparently cool to the idea.
	   ``No agreements have been reached,'' Erekat said in an
interview, adding that the Palestinians didn't agree to Israeli
conditions to use of three percent of the land.
	   In the divided West Bank city of Hebron, Jewish settlers tried
Sunday to move into a Palestinian owned apartment building, but
were stopped by the owners and their families.
	   The incident happened in the Israeli-controlled part of the
city.
	   About 70 Palestinian neighbors and a smaller crowd of settlers
gathered, and scuffles ensued. Israeli police and soldiers
separated the two groups, which later dispersed quietly.
	   Tension has been high in Hebron since a prominent rabbi was
stabbed to death in his home August 20 by a suspected Palestinian
intruder, who is thought to have escaped into the Palestinian
controlled part of the city.
	   Since the stabbing, several Palestinians have been beaten and
stoned by settlers in the streets and Israeli police say they
intend to prosecute a number of settlers for assault.

Poll: Public feels left out of Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ On the eve of the first large-scale effort
to provide details about the 2002 Winter Games, a new poll raises
the question: Does anyone care?
	   A copyright poll published in Sunday's Deseret News found that
58 percent of Utah residents polled said they don't feel at all a
part of the Games. About half said they don't want to.
	   Sixty-nine percent said they don't know enough about plans, and
a majority said Olympic organizers are not doing what they can to
involve the public.
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials say they've done the
best they can, especially given limited financial resources.
	   On Tuesday, Olympic organizers, Gov. Mike Leavitt and other
state and local government leaders are sponsoring an ``Olympic
Forum'' at the Salt Palace to discuss plans with the hundreds of
invited community, business and religious leaders. The public is
also invited.
	   Ken Bullock, a SLOC Board of Trustee member and executive
director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, a sponsor of the
forum, said Utah can still rally behind the Games, but organizers
must be more forthcoming with information.
	   ``We've lost two or three years of opportunities to teach people
about the Olympics ... more importantly what it means to them,''
Bullock said. ``I would still be very optimistic people will come
out and we'll put on a great face.''
	   SLOC chief executive officer Frank Joklik agrees with Bullock,
and hopes Tuesday's meeting gives the public the information it
wants.
	   ``We've got to clearly give information, but at the same time we
need to ... get a bit of a better view of public concerns about the
quality and the type of information they're getting,'' Joklik said.
	   The poll of 407 Utah residents was conducted for the Deseret
News by Dan Jones and Associates in August and has a 5 percent
margin of error.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Randy Moss, passed over by 19 teams in last
spring's draft, caught two long touchdown passes to lead the
Minnesota Vikings to a surprisingly easy 31-7 victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
	   Moss became the first rookie in team history with two TDs in his
first game. Brad Johnson matched a career high with four TD passes
to help give the Vikings the early edge over the Buccaneers in the
pursuit of Green Bay in the NFC Central.
	   The Bucs' defense was off-balance all afternoon, and the running
game generated only 68 yards with Pro Bowl backs Warrick Dunn and
Mike Alstott.
 &UR; Seahawks 38, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Ricky Watters, returning to Veterans Stadium
with the Seattle Seahawks, wasn't even the focal point in their
victory over Philadelphia _ the worst home opening loss in Eagles
history.
	   Joey Galloway had a career-high 142 yards receiving and scored
two touchdowns as the Seahawks handed Philadelphia its first
shutout in a home opener since 1941. Fans who packed the stadium to
boo Watters, who left the Eagles as a free agent, quickly lost
interest.
	   After proclaiming that the Eagles had the worst preseason he'd
ever seen, coach Ray Rhodes suffered his worst loss as
Philadelphia's coach.
	   Warren Moon, the Seahawks' 41-year-old quarterback, passed for
204 yards and three touchdowns. Watters, who led Philadelphia to
the playoffs twice, rushed 16 times for 67 yards.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Bears 23 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mark Brunell went 8-for-9 in an 87-yard game-winning
drive Sunday as Jacksonville rallied to beat the Bears.
	   Brunell threw for 73 yards on the drive, hitting Jimmy Smith
with a 4-yard TD pass with 29 seconds left.
	   It was the third straight victory on opening day for
Jacksonville, touted in the preseason as a Super Bowl contender. It
was just the third time in 15 years Chicago has lost an opener,
though the Bears came close to an upset thanks to Curtis Enis.
	   The fifth overall pick in the draft, who sat out most of
training camp during a holdout, rushed for 77 yards on 12 carries
and set up two late scores.
 &UR; Giants 31, Redskins 24 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, All-Pro Michael Strahan scored
on a 24-yard interception return as New York's opportunistic
defense scored or set up three third-quarter touchdowns over
error-prone Washington.
	   The Redskins, second to the NFC champion Giants last season,
were picked by many experts to dethrone New York after spending
dlrs 57 million to shore up the middle of their defense with
tackles Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson.
	   The Giants defense had eight sacks and intercepted consecutive
passes from Gus Frerotte early in the second half to set up two
quick touchdowns for a 24-10 lead.
	   One of the sacks forced Frerotte out of the game in the third
quarter with a sprained left shoulder. Third-string quarterback
Trent Green, who got to play because backup Jeff Hostetler has a
knee injury, twice got Washington within seven points.
 &UR; Packers 38, Lions 19 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the first matchup of reigning MVPs
in NFL history, Brett Favre's Packers beat Barry Sanders' Detroit
Lions.
	   Sanders' streak of 14 consecutive regular-season 100-yard
rushing games came to an end as he gained 70 yards on 17 carries.
Favre was a workmanlike 23-for-31 for 193 yards and a touchdown
before hooking up with Antonio Freeman for an 84-yard TD pass with
1:53 left.
	   Detroit's Terry Fair returned a kickoff 101 yards for a
touchdown at the end of the third quarter, and Roell Preston
promptly replied with a 100-yard TD return to restore Green Bay's
12-point lead, 31-19.
	   Fair returned six kickoffs for 244 yards and Preston returned
four for 163. The Packers have won 28 straight games at Lambeau
Field.
 &UR; Saints 24, Rams 17 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mike Ditka's second season started out a lot
better than the first, despite losing quarterback Billy Joe Hobert.
	   New Orleans turned two first-half turnovers into touchdowns and
had only one turnover, contrasting with a mistake-filled
performance from St. Louis. Lamar Smith caught one touchdown pass
and threw for another on an option play.
	   The Saints opened in St. Louis for the second straight year.
Ditka lost 38-24 to Dick Vermeil last year in the coaching comeback
game for both men. New Orleans led the rematch 24-0 with 4:45 left
in the first half and ended a four-game losing streak against the
Rams.
	   But Hobert ruptured his right Achilles' tendon dropping back to
pass on the artificial turf with 14:20 remaining. Hobert, who is
probably out for the season, was 11-for-23 for 170 yards and one
touchdown before being replaced by Danny Wuerffel.
 &UR; Steelers 20, Ravens 13 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Kordell Stewart scored Pittsburgh's first
touchdown after the Ravens botched a punt, and the Steelers took
advantage of Baltimore's shoddy kicking game.
	   Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh left for good midway in the
second quarter after hyperextending the ring finger on his right
hand. The injury apparently happened when he hit the ground after
being hit by Carnell Lake.
	   Backup Eric Zeier threw a 64-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine
Lewis with 2:48 left to bring Baltimore to 20-13. But a 68-yard
punt by Josh Miller left the Ravens at their 4 with 27 seconds
left.
	   Matt Stover missed three field goals, two of them because of
poor snaps. Long snapper Harper Le Bel, a replacement for the
injured Brian Kinchen, lowlighted a miserable day by sending a
one-hopper to punter Kyle Richardson in the third quarter.
	   Richardson was tackled for a 31-yard loss, and Stewart scored
from the 1 for a 13-3 lead. Stewart threw a 20-yard TD pass to
Charles Johnson on Pittsburgh's next possession to make it 20-3
with 10 minutes left.

	   MINNEAPOLIS: minutes left.
 &UR; Oilers 23, Bengals 14 &QC; 
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Al Del Greco made his first three field-goal
attempts, while Dave Krieg took over for an injured Steve McNair
and steadied Tennessee against Cincinnati.
	   It was a costly game for the Oilers, who lost five players to
injury. The most prominent was McNair, who hurt his elbow late in a
ragged first half and didn't return.
	   Krieg, who hadn't played much in two years, led the Oilers to a
second-half touchdown and put Del Greco in position to kick two
field goals. Krieg completed seven of 13 passes for 129 yards
without an interception.
	   Del Greco hit from 38, 31 and 48 yards before hitting the right
upright on a 47-yard attempt in the closing minutes, ending his
streak of consecutive field goals at 12.
 &UR; Falcons 19, Panthers 14 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Chris Chandler threw for 268 yards
and two touchdowns for Atlanta as he overcame a Carolina defense
that had six sacks and kept him on the run much of the game.
	   Atlanta was 7-3 last season when Chandler, who has been bothered
by concussions, finished games he started. The Falcons were 0-6
when he wasn't around at the end.
	   He completed 17 of 32 passes against Carolina, helping the
Falcons win their road opener for the first time since 1986.
	   Atlanta converted one interception and two Carolina punting
miscues into 12 points, dooming the Panthers to their fourth
consecutive home loss.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Randy Moss, passed over by 19 teams in last
spring's draft, caught two long touchdown passes to lead the
Minnesota Vikings to a surprisingly easy 31-7 victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
	   Moss became the first rookie in team history with two TDs in his
first game. Brad Johnson matched a career high with four TD passes
to help give the Vikings the early edge over the Buccaneers in the
pursuit of Green Bay in the NFC Central.
	   The Bucs' defense was off-balance all afternoon, and the running
game generated only 68 yards with Pro Bowl backs Warrick Dunn and
Mike Alstott.
 &UR; Seahawks 38, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Ricky Watters, returning to Veterans Stadium
with the Seattle Seahawks, wasn't even the focal point in their
victory over Philadelphia _ the worst home opening loss in Eagles
history.
	   Joey Galloway had a career-high 142 yards receiving and scored
two touchdowns as the Seahawks handed Philadelphia its first
shutout in a home opener since 1941. Fans who packed the stadium to
boo Watters, who left the Eagles as a free agent, quickly lost
interest.
	   After proclaiming that the Eagles had the worst preseason he'd
ever seen, coach Ray Rhodes suffered his worst loss as
Philadelphia's coach.
	   Warren Moon, the Seahawks' 41-year-old quarterback, passed for
204 yards and three touchdowns. Watters, who led Philadelphia to
the playoffs twice, rushed 16 times for 67 yards.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Bears 23 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mark Brunell went 8-for-9 in an 87-yard game-winning
drive Sunday as Jacksonville rallied to beat the Bears.
	   Brunell threw for 73 yards on the drive, hitting Jimmy Smith
with a 4-yard TD pass with 29 seconds left.
	   It was the third straight victory on opening day for
Jacksonville, touted in the preseason as a Super Bowl contender. It
was just the third time in 15 years Chicago has lost an opener,
though the Bears came close to an upset thanks to Curtis Enis.
	   The fifth overall pick in the draft, who sat out most of
training camp during a holdout, rushed for 77 yards on 12 carries
and set up two late scores.
 &UR; Giants 31, Redskins 24 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, All-Pro Michael Strahan scored
on a 24-yard interception return as New York's opportunistic
defense scored or set up three third-quarter touchdowns over
error-prone Washington.
	   The Redskins, second to the NFC East champion Giants last
season, were picked by many experts to dethrone New York after
spending dlrs 57 million to shore up the middle of their defense
with tackles Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Faced with an almost unspeakably
grim task, pathologists, dentists and DNA experts have been working
round the clock to piece together the torn remains of Swissair
Flight 111's victims.
	   The bodies have been so shattered by the plunge into the sea
that even Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner struggles to find
words to describe the work he faces.
	   ``To us, it's a very difficult task because of the enormity of
it,'' Dr. John Butt said after meeting with the families and
telling them for the first time how bad the situation was.
	   A French family was able to identify the body of one woman
Friday and take her home. Butt said he hopes the body of an infant
_ which he said is not completely intact _ will be identified soon.
The others, however, will be much more difficult, he said.
	   ``Using the tools of radiology and dental X-ray for comparisons,
I fear, is not going to be that successful either,'' he said.
``It's a question of the substance of the remains. I just don't
want to go any further than that. But I have had to explain that to
the families, with reluctance, I must say.''
	   Butt, speaking haltingly, was visibly shaken as he talked about
the process during news conferences Saturday and Sunday.
	   Six teams of medical experts have worked furiously to identify
the pieces of flesh and bone in a corrugated metal airplane hangar
at a Canadian military air base in Shearwater, near Halifax.
	   Among the experts called in to help is Dr. James Young, the
chief medical examiner for Ontario, who earlier this year headed an
international team investigating the death of jailed Nigerian
opposition leader Moshood Abiola.
	   The human remains recovered from the ocean have been placed into
plastic bags and flown by helicopter to the base, where they are
immediately stored in one of six refrigerated trucks or two freezer
trucks brought in for the operation. Butt said three of the
trailers were already completely full.
	   He said authorities are dividing body parts into those with
potentially identifiable characteristics, such as limbs or tattoos,
and those without. The larger pieces are tested while the smaller
ones are frozen.
	   The hangar where the giant morgue is set up has been divided
into four sections.
	   In one area, the remains are visually inspected, photographed
and fingerprinted. Then they are taken to another section, where
any pieces of clothing or keepsake items are removed and recorded.
After that, radiologists take X-rays of any bones and dentists make
imprints and X-rays of teeth. Finally, technicians take tissue
samples that are sent to laboratories all over Canada for DNA
testing, which will likely be the most reliable way to identify the
victims. Officials here have asked the U.S. Department of Defense
to help in running the DNA tests.
	   Butt said between 150 and 170 families have provided blood
samples to help match the DNA of victims to their relatives. He
said officials are trying to find at least two members from each
family to make the tests more accurate.
	   He said computer experts have been working to create a program
that can handle the vast amount of DNA data that will be generated
from these tests and match body parts to eachother and to families.
	   Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, meanwhile, are
interviewing the families of all the victims to get details
physical descriptions _ tattoos, amputations, birthmarks _ and ask
their help in gathering medical records.

Novotna battles wind to beat Spirlea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Swirling winds and bad serves were not enough to
keep Jana Novotna out of the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open.
	   Trying to add the U.S. crown to her Wimbledon title this summer,
Novotna beat Irina Spirlea 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round Sunday.
	   Spirlea was hurt by five double faults at key times to help the
third-seeded Novotna advance to the quarterfinals.
	   Novotna said the wind on Stadium 2 prevented the players from
performing at their best.
	   ``It's very important that you just go out there and forget
about the wind and just try to win,'' Novotna said. ``Don't play
any spectacular points, don't play spectacular tennis. Just go out
there, do your job, just do it well.''
	   Although the Czech had four double faults of her own, it was
Spirlea's that came at the wrong times.
	   One in the eighth game of the first set helped to give Novotna a
5-3 lead. Two double faults in a row in the fifth game of the
second set put Spirlea behind 3-2, and two more in the ninth game
helped to end the match in 63 minutes.
	   Novotna hasn't dropped a set as the tournament enters its second
week.
	   ``This is the most important thing for a seeded player. Just get
into the second week,'' she said. ``I think that's when we usually
start to play much better tennis than we do in the first week.
	   ``Now it's up to competing and just doing well in individual
matches.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOW WINDY WAS IT? &LR;  The Novotna-Spirlea match was not the only
one affected by the winds, which gusted from the west at up to 14
mph (23 kph) on a warm summer day.
	   Defending women's champion Martina Hingis, sixth-seeded Monica
Seles and men's 13th-seeded Tim Henman all said the windy
conditions were tough.
	   ``The wind was terrible today. It was spinning around. You
always thought from this side you are going to have the better
side,'' Hingis said after coming back from a break down in each set
to beat Nathalie Dechy 6-4, 6-4. ``You have the wind in your back .
You are going to make the shot. You just kind of control the game.
... All of a sudden everything turns around against you. It wasn't
very easy.''
	   Seles, who advanced with a sloppy 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 victory over
Kimberly Po, said the winds in the 2-year-old Arthur Ashe Stadium
were much worse than those in the old main stadium, which was where
the Novotna and Henman matches were played.
	   ``There are times when you think you're serving into the wind,
then suddenly as you throw the ball up, you're downwind,'' Henman
said after beating qualifier Michael Kohlmann 6-3, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ACE UPDATE: &LR;  With a week to go, the women players have beaten
their record for the number of aces.
	   With 17 aces on Saturday _ none by the top 10 servers _ the
women's field has produced 419 aces, bettering the mark of 415 for
the entire tournament last year.
	   The men, meanwhile, have 1,737 aces through Saturday, with Goran
Ivanisevic leading with 63 in three matches.
	   The fastest serves for the first week are Marat Safin for the
men at 135 mph (217.3 kph) and Venus Williams for women at 117 mph
(188.3 kph).
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GARRISON HONORED: &LR;  Zina Garrison, who won two medals at the
1988 Olympics, will be honored by the U.S. Tennis Association.
	   For her combination of sportsmanship, fellowship and service to
tennis, Garrison will receive the USTA Service Bowl Award.
	   Garrison, a former WTA Top 10 player, won the 1988 doubles at
the Seoul Olympics with Pam Shriver and also took the singles
bronze medal. She reached the Wimbledon final in 1990, losing to
Martina Navratilova.
	   Past award winners include Shriver, Billie Jean King and Maureen
Connolly.

	   MILTON, Florida (AP) _ Dana Quigley made a 33-foot (10-meter)
birdie putt on the 18th hole Sunday to beat Jim Colbert by one
stroke in the dlrs 1.1 million Emerald Coast Classic, his second
victory on the Senior PGA Tour.
	   Quigley's first win came last year in the Northville Long Island
Classic on the day his father, Wally, died of cancer.
	   On Sunday, Quigley said he was ``talking to my dad'' before his
putt on the par-4, 422-yard (129-meter) 18th hole at The Moors Golf
Club.
	   ``Someone upstairs was pushing that baby in the hole all the
way,'' Quigley said.
	   ``It was just like it was magical,'' he said. ``Honest to
goodness, I can't explain it, and it certainly doesn't make any
sense. The putter just moved and the ball just went on line.''
	   The double-break putt gave Quigley a 5-under-par 65 and a
10-under 200 total. The victory earned him a career-best dlrs
165,000 and increased his 1998 earnings to dlrs 808,355. He had won
dlrs 150,000 at Northville.
	   Colbert closed with a 66 and finished one stroke ahead of
Leonard Thompson, who shot a 69.
	   Quigley and Colbert, playing together, began the day four
strokes behind second-round leader and defending champion Isao
Aoki, but the Japanese star shot a 72 to finish tied for fourth
with Hale Irwin, David Lundstrom and Bob Duval.
	   Irwin increased his leading money total for this year to dlrs
2,302,350. He also is the career money leader with dlrs 12,968,209.
	   ``I missed three 6-footers, and for it to come down to one shot,
that hurts,'' Colbert said. ``They were all dead straight and I
missed them.''
	   Quigley was the first player to win the Emerald Coast without a
playoff in the tournament's four-year history. In addition to Aoki,
who won last year with a tournament-record 196, prior winners were
Lee Trevino in 1996 and Raymond Floyd in 1995.
	   Quigley joined the over-50 circuit last year and is thrilled to
be competing with big name players after an on-and-off career on
the regular tour where he earned only dlrs 92,298 over 16 years.
	   ``This is pure joy,'' said Quigley, who learned of his father's
death just after the trophy presentation. ``Last year, I don't want
to say I was robbed of the enjoyment of the win but it was
certainly taken away from me 20 minutes after the presentation.
This year, this is euphoria.''

Famed Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa dead at 88

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, whose hauntingly poetic vision,
innovative style and stunning technical virtuosity made him Japan's
most celebrated film director, died at home in Tokyo on Sunday. He
was 88.
	   Minoru Tabata, an official of Kurosawa Film Production, said
Kurosawa died of a stroke before he could be taken to a hospital.
	   ``I can't say what it was about, but he was working on one more
film,'' Hiromichi Horikawa, a director who studied under Kurosawa,
told national broadcaster NHK.
	   ``My father has done almost what he wanted to do,'' said
Kurosawa's 52-year-old son Hisao, a director himself.
	   Filmmakers throughout the world have been influenced by
Kurosawa, who fused the pinpoint precision of traditional Japanese
theatrical forms with stunning, larger-than-life spectacles.
	   ``The term `giant' is used too often to describe artists. But in
the case of Akira Kurosawa, we have one of the rare instances where
the term fits. Aside from the fact that he was the man who almost
singlehandedly introduced Japanese cinema to the West, his
influence on filmmakers throughout the entire world is so profound
as to be almost incomparable,'' said director Martin Scorsese.
	   ``Kurosawa has had a tremendous impact and influence on other
filmmakers as well as the other cultures,'' said Stephen Prince,
author of a 1991 book Kurosawa called ``The Warriors Camera''. ``We
are not going to see that kind of filmmaking again.''

Khamenei: Iran will not clash with Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Taliban statement in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, says that the country will not enter into a military
confrontation with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, the Tehran Times
reported Sunday.
	   The statement came amid concerns in the U.S. intelligence
community that Iran was poised for an incursion into Afghanistan.
Iran last week massed troops and equipment on the border for
military exercises.
	   Iran also has warned the Taliban religious army that it would
take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of Iranians believed
held captive by the militia.
	   The English-language newspaper said Khamenei's comments came
during a question-and-answer session Thursday at Teachers Training
University.
	   He said he was ``personally following the developments of Iran
related to Afghanistan'' and ``assured that there will be no
confrontation with the Taliban,'' the paper said.
	   The paper did not say why there was a delay in reporting the
comments of Khamenei, who also is commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians, including 11
diplomats and a journalist from the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the diplomats, and
Iranian officials fear they may have been killed.
	   On Sunday, Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said the
militia has called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
intervene to ease the tensions. He said the Taliban is trying to
locate the missing Iranians, and if unable to do so, called for the
two countries to form a commission to investigate the situation
together.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Randy Moss, passed over by 19 teams in last
spring's draft, caught two long touchdown passes to lead the
Minnesota Vikings to a surprisingly easy 31-7 victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
	   Moss became the first rookie in team history with two TDs in his
first game. Brad Johnson matched a career high with four TD passes
to help give the Vikings the early edge over the Buccaneers in the
pursuit of Green Bay in the NFC Central.
	   The Bucs' defense was off-balance all afternoon, and the running
game generated only 68 yards with Pro Bowl backs Warrick Dunn and
Mike Alstott.
 &UR; Seahawks 38, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Ricky Watters, returning to Veterans Stadium
with the Seattle Seahawks, wasn't even the focal point in their
victory over the Eagles.

More Israeli unions joining nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's giant Histadrut trade union federation
decided Sunday to widen the scope of a public sector strike that
has gripped the country for the past four days.
	   The federation decided that Ben-Gurion international airport
would be shut down at 9 a.m. local time Monday. The country's
seaports would also be paralyzed.
	   The state-owned electricity company would be on a sabbath
footing beginning 6 a.m. Monday morning, which meant that only the
most urgent repairs would be carried out.
	   Nearly 300,000 employees were already on strike Sunday. Garbage
piled up in the streets of Tel Aviv Sunday as municipal sanitation
workers joined the stoppage. All government offices, post offices,
railroads and seaports were closed.
	   Hospitals and clinics were treating emergency cases only.
Telephone information and repair services were shut down. Teachers
are also on strike.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said the wage hikes demanded by
the unions would cause runaway inflation. Histadrut leader Amir
Peretz accused Neeman of scaring the public with figures many times
greater than the real cost of the increases.

Ohio State's hot, Michigan's not on first full weekend of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ohio State won, Michigan lost.
	   Too bad the results were from Saturday's games instead of Nov.
21, when the Ohio State-Michigan showdown could determine whether
coach John Cooper gets a chance to play in a national title game.
	   On college football's first full Saturday, though, No. 1 Ohio
State will gladly take an impressive 34-17 road win over No. 20
West Virginia.
	   ``I'm a happy football coach,'' Cooper said after Joe Germaine
threw for 301 yards and two TDs and the Buckeyes held Amos Zereoue
to 77 yards rushing _ minus 3 in the second half. ``We walked into
a great hostile crowd and we won the game.''
	   Michigan simply got caught sleepwalking. The defending
co-national champions were knocked out of the Top 10 in stunning
fashion, losing to No. 10 Notre Dame 36-20 at South Bend, Ind., as
Jarious Jackson threw for two touchdowns and Autry Denson ran for
two others in a 30-point second half.
	   ``Our defense tired, we missed four field goals and we didn't
run the ball well,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ``We've got a
long way to go. We've got a lot of corrections to make, and not a
long time to do it.''
	   The results shook up the rankings in the AP's first
regular-season Top 25 poll. The Irish moved from No. 22 into the
Top 10 for the first time since late in 1996, while the Wolverines
tumbled from No. 5 to No. 13.
	   Ohio State, which started the preseason poll with a five-point
lead over Florida State, strengthened its position and now holds a
41-point edge over the Seminoles. But the Buckeyes are 1-8-1 vs.
Michigan, and twice in the last four years had national title shots
ended with losses to the Wolverines.
	   It didn't take long for a few other stars to shine as the
Heisman Trophy race shifted from the mail to the field.
	   _ Tim Couch threw for seven TDs and a school-record 498 yards as
Kentucky routed Louisville 68-34 in the first game at Papa John's
Cardinal Stadium.
	   _ Daunte Culpepper threw for 370 yards and four TDs and ran for
69 yards and two more scores in Central Florida's 64-30 win over
Louisiana Tech in Ruston, Louisiana The Bulldogs' Tim Rattay threw
for 524 yards and three TDs, while Troy Edwards caught 13 passes
for 206 yards. Last week, Rattay threw for 590 yards and Edwards
set an NCAA record with 405 yards receiving in a loss to Nebraska.
	   _ Ricky Williams ran for 215 yards and a school-record six TDs
in Texas' 66-36 victory over New Mexico State as he opened his
quest to become the NCAA's leading career rusher. Williams' next
goal: He needs 75 yards to surpass Earl Campbell's school record of
4,443 yards.
	   Some great individual efforts were overshadowed by dramatic
finishes.
	   At the Carrier Dome. the post-Peyton Manning era began with a
win as Tee Martin led Tennessee into position for Jeff Hall's
27-yard field goal on the game's final play for a 34-33 win over
Syracuse. Martin threw two TD passes and ran for another; Donovan
McNabb didn't hurt his Heisman chances in defeat as he threw for
300 yards and two TDs and also ran for a score.
	   At Tempe, Arizona, Brock Huard threw for 318 yards and four TDs
_ the final one a 63-yarder to Reggie Davis on a fourth-and-17 with
28 seconds left as No. 11 Washington shocked No. 14 Arizona State
42-38.
	   For the Sun Devils, J.R. Remond ran for 108 yards and a TD;
caught four passes for 68 yards and returned a punt 61 yards to set
up the Sun Devils' TD that gave his team a late 38-35 lead. A few
minutes earlier, he had a 67-yard return for a score called back
because of a penalty.
	   ``I'm emotional right now,'' Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder
said, ``but J.R. Redmond is the best football player in the
country.''
	   In other Top 25 games, it was: No. 3 Florida 49, The Citadel 10;
No. 4 Nebraska 38, Alabama-Birmingham 7; No. 5 Kansas State 66,
Indiana State 0; No. 9 Penn State 34, Southern Mississippi 6; No.
15 Georgia 56, Kent 3; No. 16 Colorado 42, Colorado State 14; No.
17 Wisconsin 26, San Diego State 14; No. 24 Oregon 48, Michigan
State 14; and Miami of Ohio 13, North Carolina 10.
	   In other games of note, Doug Williams' coaching debut was a
success as Grambling began the post-Eddie Robinson era with an 11-0
win over Alcorn State; and Rutgers ended a 14-game losing streak
with a 7-6 win over I-AA Richmond.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 34, No. 20 West Virginia 17 &QC; 
	   The David Boston-Dee Miller duo combined for 13 catches for 239
yards and two TDs, and Michael Wiley ran for 140 yards and a TD to
give Germaine all the help he needed.
	   ``They have a lot of weapons to defense,'' WVU coach Don Nehlen
said. ``But their defense is really something special. They kept
wearing us down.''
	   West Virginia was held to 78 yards rushing, 310 overall.

	   NEW YORK, 310 overall:
 &UR; No. 10 Notre Dame 36, No. 13 Michigan 20 &QC; 
	   The Irish (1-0) left a six-loss season and a summer of troubles
behind as coach Bob Davie opened his second campaign with one of
the school's biggest wins in years.
	   Trailing 13-6 at halftime, Notre Dame scored on its first five
second-half possessions to end Michigan's 12-game winning streak.
It was the most points allowed by the Wolverines since 1991, when
they lost 51-31 to Florida State.
	   Michigan fumbled the ball away twice in the second half and
missed four of six field goal attempts. The defense, which returned
nine starters from the nation's top-ranked unit in '97, allowed 376
yards. Think they miss Charles Woodson?
	   Tom Brady, in his first start for Michigan, was 23-of-36 for 267
yards.
 &UR; No. 3 Florida 49, Citadel 10 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, Jesse Palmer threw for 301 yards and
four TDs and Terry Jackson ran for 127 yards and two scores.
 &UR; No. 4 Nebraska 38, Alabama-Birmingham 7 &QC; 
	   At Lincoln, Nebraska, Eric Crouch, making his first college
start, ran for two TDs and passed for another. Playing for the
injured Bobby Newcombe, Crouch was 11-of-17 for 127 yards.
 &UR; No. 5 Kansas St. 66, Indiana St. 0 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop ran for two TDs and threw
for a third and the kicking teams scored twice as the Wildcats came
within one point of the school record.
 &UR; No. 9 Penn St. 34, Southern Mississippi 6 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, Cordell Mitchell ran for 99
yards in his first start and the Lions held the Golden Eagles to 9
yards rushing. Joe Paterno goes for career win No. 300 on Saturday
against Bowling Green,
 &UR; No. 15 Georgia 56, Kent 3 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Quincy Carter, the first freshman
quarterback to start a season-opener for the Bulldogs, threw for
235 yards and three TDs. Olandis Gary and Robert Arnaud each added
two rushing TDs.
 &UR; No. 16 Colorado 42, 15 Colorado St. 14 &QC; 
	   At Denver, Mike Moschetti threw three TD passes and Cedric
Cormier returned a punt 82 yards for another score at Mile High
Stadium.
	   Moschetti, a junior-college transfer playing in his first major
college game, helped the Buffaloes beat the Rams (1-1) for the
eighth straight time.
 &UR; No. 17 Wisconsin 26, San Diego St. 14 &QC; 
	   At San Diego, Mike Samuel scored the go-ahead touchdown on a
47-yard quarterback draw early in the fourth quarter and Wisconsin,
playing without injured tailback Ron Dayne, rallied to win its
opener.
 &UR; No. 24 Oregon 48, Michigan St. 14 &QC; 
	   At Eugene, Oregon, Akili Smith threw four TD passes and Reuben
Droughns rushed for 202 yards and scored three TDs. Michigan State
fell to 0-2 and plays host to Notre Dame on Saturday.
 &UR; Miami of Ohio 13, North Carolina 10 &QC; 
	   At Chapel Hill, North Carolina, John Scott kicked a 37-yard
field goal with one second left and Travis Prentice ran for 162
yards as Miami of Ohio ruined Carl Torbush's regular-season
coaching debut and knocked the Tar Heels out of the Top 25.
	   Freshman quarterback Ronald Curry replaced injured starter Oscar
Davenport after four plays. Davenport could be out as long as five
weeks with an injured left knee.

Divers find crucial flight-data recorder of Swissair Flight 111

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ In a huge advance for investigators,
divers battling murky, choppy seas found one of the two flight
recorders of Swissair Flight 111 on Sunday, as well as three large
pieces of wreckage believed to be the plane's fuselage.
	   Another search team said it had located 19 concentrations of
human remains on the seabed. Douglas Copp of American Rescue Team
International said it was too early to tell how many bodies might
be at those locations.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the flight-data
recorder would be flown to a laboratory in Ottawa for examination.
If in good condition, it would provide more than 100 types of
technical data that could be of vital help in explaining why the
MD-11 jetliner plunged into the sea Wednesday, killing all 229
people on board.
	   The so-called black box and the wreckage were found five miles
(8 kms) offshore at a depth of 190 feet (58 meters) by divers
working with hand-held sonar devices. Gerden said the divers were
able to work at that depth for only about seven minutes at a time,
with their visibility limited to about 10 feet (3 meters).
	   The discoveries were a huge breakthrough for investigators, who
previously had gathered little concrete evidence to assist their
probe into why the plane's cockpit filled with smoke and why the
cockpit crew's emergency conversation with traffic controllers was
cut off six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers will continue searching for the second black-box _ the
cockpit voice recorder that would reveal other noises in the
cockpit in addition to the already available conversation with
controllers.
	   The flight-data recorder was found near the three large pieces
of wreckage.
	   ``Some of them are squashed. It's in very poor shape, but it is
visible and it looks like an aircraft fuselage,'' said Capt. Phil
Webster, a navy spokesman.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Felix Morisseau-Leroy, a Haitian poet and
playwright who used his native language of Creole in his work, has
died from complications from a stroke. He was 86.
	   Morisseau suffered from a stroke in February that paralyzed the
left side of his body. He died Saturday.
	   ``He devoted his life to the respect and dignity of all
Haitians,'' said Jan Mapou, who brought Morisseau's groundbreaking
play ``Antigone'' in Creole to Miami for the first time in early
May.
	   ``He is one of the pioneers of the Creole language, which he
advocated as the best tool for the education of Haitian people,''
said Mapou.
	   Using Creole _ the common language of Haitians _ separated
Morisseau from many of his literary contemporaries in the Caribbean
country, who spoke and wrote only in French .
	   Before Morisseau, there was no written Creole. At his play's
premier in 1953 in Port-au-Prince, Creole-speaking Haitians saw a
serious play in their own language for the first time.
	   Morisseau fled Haiti in 1959 and lived in Europe and Africa. His
poems and plays continued to circulate clandestinely in Haiti until
he returned from exile for a visit in 1986. He was a guest of honor
at President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's 1991 inauguration.
	   In addition to his wife Renee, Morisseau is survived by children
Axel Morisseau-Leroy of Miami, Maag Mitton of New York and Jean
Morisseau-Leroy of Cameroon, and seven grandchildren. Services are
pending.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet said he had
``nothing to do'' with human rights abuses during his military
regime, a daily newspaper reported Sunday.
	   In an interview with El Mercurio, Pinochet said he had no
information on the whereabouts of 1,102 dissidents who have been
unaccounted for after being detained by his security services.
	   ``How can I help?'' he asked. ``I have queried some of my
friends, but nobody knows anything.''
	   Pinochet seized power in a bloody Sept. 11, 1973, coup and ruled
until 1990. The former ruler has retained substantial political and
military power by becoming a senator for life, a guarantee written
into the constitution of his regime.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Anyone under 18 found on the
streets without an adult after 11 p.m. will be arrested and fined
up to dlrs 5,000, Mayor Cesar Castellanos said Sunday.
	   The curfew was imposed in the capital to combat crime by gangs.
	   Castellanos also said youths cannot be in shopping centers,
hotels or amusement centers after midnight.
	   ``I will close any business that fails to respect the law,'' he
said.
	   About half of Honduras' 200 estimated gangs operate in
Tegucigalpa. Officials estimate there are 20,000 gang members in
the capital.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With presidential elections less than a
month away, voters see President Fernando Henrique Cardoso as the
most able candidate to handle an international financial crisis,
according to a poll published Sunday.
	   In the poll, 43 percent of voters thought Cardoso was the best
candidate to handle a worldwide financial crisis, while 18 percent
thought Luiz Inacio da Silva, the far left candidate and Cardoso's
chief rival, would do a better job.
	   Seven percent named other candidates as more able, and 16
percent said none could handle a dramatic economic slump. Sixteen
percent had no opinion.
	   IBOPE polling firm questioned 2,000 voters. No margin of error
was given. The poll was published in the O Globo newspaper.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains caused a mudslide that killed
three people in the village of Francisco Villa in the southern
state of Chiapas, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   State civil defense officials said the three were waiting until
they could cross the swollen Pijijapan River when a waterlogged
hillside above them gave way.
	   Storms in recent days have damaged or destroyed 200 houses in
the Pijijapan area, about 70 miles south of the state capital of
Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thirty-six people have been arrested on
charges of looting railway cars carrying rice and milk to eastern
Cuba, Cuban news media reported Sunday.
	   The government's Prensa Latina news agency, monitored here, said
those arrested were suspected of stealing more than 3,000 bags of
rice and about 600 of powdered milk, apparently destined for the
black market.
	   Police investigator Odalys Silva Pena told the weekly Juventud
Rebelde that those arrested include a train engineer and six night
watchmen at the train station in the eastern city of Santiago.

Police arrest suspects in attempted kidnap of Mexican singer's
</HEADLINE>
daughter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police say they have arrested two men
suspected of attempting to kidnap the 6-year-old daughter of
Mexican pop singer Alejandra Guzman, newspapers reported Friday.
	   The two men allegedly belong to a gang led by Raul Bruno Navas,
alias ``The Godfather,'' who is jailed on kidnapping charges.
	   Police said they caught Pedro Gonzalez Tovar, 21, and Juan
Romero Martinez, 18, as they collected some 200,000 pesos _ about
dlrs 20,000 _ they had demanded from a businessman after
threatening to harm his family.
	   In searching the suspects, police found an agenda with names of
other victims _ including that of Guzman.
	   Police said the two confessed to extorting 140,000 _ nearly dlrs
16,000 _ from Guzman with a threat against her daughter Frida Sofia
and of participating in a June 23 attempt to kidnap the child.
	   Guzman's secretary Victor Bonilla was attacked while taking the
girl to visit friends of the child's grandmother, actress Silvia
Pinal. Bonilla was beaten with a bat and the attackers grabbed the
child.
	   But patrolmen nearby chased the attackers and caught four
suspects, rescuing the girl.
	   Guzman's pop-rock songs are popular throughout Latin America.

Rebels free American rancher after 5-month abduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels freed an American Sunday
after holding him captive for more than five months.
	   Donald Lee Cary, who turned 64 Sunday, was handed over to the
International Red Cross by the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia outside the town of Medina, 40 miles (65 kilometers)
southeast of the capital.
	   ``It's a great gift,'' a relieved Cary told radio reporters. He
said he thought he had fractured a rib in a fall, but was otherwise
fit.
	   A government official who helped facilitate the release said he
had no information on how much, if any, ransom was paid. Colombia
has the world's highest kidnapping rate and foreigners taken
hostage fetch the highest ransoms.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Cary has
lived in Colombia for 19 years. He could not confirm radio reports
that Cary came to Colombia after retiring to take up cattle
ranching.
	   Cary, who was kidnapped at his ranch near Bogota on March 21,
said he spent most of his captivity walking through rugged
mountains and was held at about six different rebel camps.
	   ``There was a lot of walking,'' Cary told the Radionet network.
	   No U.S. hometown was available for Cary and there was no
immediate word on whether he planned to remain in Colombia.

Franchitti wins race; Zanardi takes championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Dario Franchitti won another
race and Alex Zanardi wrapped up his second straight CART FedEx
Series championship on Sunday in a crashed-filled Vancouver
Molson-Indy.
	   Franchitti, who earned his first CART victory two weeks earlier
at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, passed Michael Andretti for the lead
seven laps from the end and pulled away to a win worth dlrs 100,000
from the race purse and an additional dlrs 340,000 bonus from
Marlboro for becoming the first driver to win from the pole in 22
races.
	   Zanardi needed only to be leading by 88 points with four races
remaining to become the first driver since Bobby Rahal in 1987 to
win consecutive titles in the open-wheel series. With his closest
competitors, teammate Jimmy Vasser, Adrian Fernandez and Greg Moore
all finishing out of the points Sunday, Zanardi's fourth-place
finish gave him a 92-point margin and the title.
	   The 31-year-old Italian had what he called ``a brain failure''
and spun and stalled the engine on his Reynard-Honda while running
third under caution on lap 16. By the time he was push-started by
safety workers and made a pit stop for tires, Zanardi had fallen
all the way to 24th, last on the lead lap.
	   He was able to use pit stop strategy and some bad luck by other
drivers in the 28-car field to move back into contention.
	   Car owner Ganassi said, ``That's why this guy is the best. He's
come back from things like that so many times. That's why he's the
champion.''
	   For the second straight year, Zanardi, who is expected to leave
CART for Formula One next season, will collect the dlrs 1 million
PPG Cup prize for his team at the end of the season.
	   But Franchitti got the big payoff Sunday, using a tire advantage
to pull away from Andretti at the end on the all-new Vancouver
street circuit, moved several hundred yards (meters) since last
year because of current and future construction at the Concord
Pacific Place complex.
	   The 27-year-old Scotsman drove his Team KOOL-Green Reynard-Honda
across the finish line 3.437 seconds in front of Andretti's
Newman-Haas Swift-Ford.
	   ``My tires, I think, were better than his,'' said Franchitti,
who was on Firestones while Andretti was on Goodyears. ``I got a
run off the corner, but I didn't think I would be able to pass. We
did and I got the money.''
	   The race was shortened by four laps due to a two-hour time
limit, but Andretti said the extra laps probably wouldn't have
helped him catch Franchitti.
	   ``I couldn't hold off Dario,'' he said. ``I was really saving
fuel and I could see him charging. I think they probably told him
he had enough fuel and to go.''
	   Scott Pruett finished third in the race, while four-time
Vancouver winner Al Unser Jr. was fifth, followed by defending race
winner Mauricio Gugelmin.
	   One reason the race went long was seven full-course caution
periods, most brought out for crashes.
	   Vasser, who came into the race with at least a mathematical
chance to catch him teammate, saw his shot at a second title end
when he banged together with Patrick Carpentier and slid into a
tire wall on lap 11.
	   The most spectacular incident of the day came on lap 55 when
several drivers got together on the narrow course and Moore wound
up driving over the top of the car of P.J. Jones.
	   Rookie Alex Barron, who was the first driver ever to lead a CART
event while using a Toyota engine, spun out and crashed while
leading on lap 63, and Paul Tracy banged into the rear of rookie
Tony Kanaan's car on lap 68, sending the Brazilian into a tire
wall.
	   Gil de Ferran, who also crashed in qualifying on Saturday,
slammed into a tire wall on the last lap and finished 13th after
running seventh late in the race.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ In a huge advance for investigators,
divers battling murky, choppy seas found one of the two flight
recorders of Swissair Flight 111 on Sunday, as well as three large
pieces of wreckage believed to be the plane's fuselage. Vic Gerden,
the chief crash investigator, said the flight-data recorder would
be flown to a laboratory in Ottawa for examination. If in good
condition, it would provide more than 100 types of technical data
that could be of vital help in explaining why the MD-11 jetliner
plunged into the sea Wednesday, killing all 229 people on board.
Another search team said it had located 19 concentrations of human
remains on the seabed. Douglas Copp of American Rescue Team
International said it was too early to tell how many bodies might
be at those locations. (CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH).
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia still wants aid and cooperation from the
West, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Sunday on the
eve of a crucial meeting that could help determine the makeup and
course of Russia's new government. ``Russia is now enmeshed in the
global financial system, and this system doesn't want any
collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said in an interview on the popular
television program ``Itogi.'' He said Russia needed to at least
double its gold and foreign currency reserves, ``hopefully through
the (assistance) of the global financial system,'' he said. His
remarks were the latest effort by Chernomyrdin to reassure Western
governments and Russian reformers that he hopes to avoid
retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation, which some
people have predicted. Chernomyrdin also sent a message Sunday to
the finance ministers of Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying
that ``with the help of the international community, we will manage
to stabilize the situation,'' Russian news agencies reported.
(RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Latin American markets are being
rattled by the Russian and Asian economic crises, but a meltdown
can be avoided if industrialized nations take proper steps,
regional leaders said this weekend. The 14-member Rio Group of
Latin American leaders urged the world's seven most-industrialized
nations and world financial groups ``to immediately take the
necessary steps to restore stability and guarantee growth of the
world economy.'' Financial worries were the top priority of the
annual summit after Latin America's largest market, the Sao Paulo
Stock Exchange, suffered a 14 percent midday slide on Friday,
prompting markets and currencies across the region to tumble. In
addition to the group's 59-point declaration on a wide range of
regional concerns, it added a seven-point declaration on the
financial turmoil. (LATAM SUMMIT)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official toured a
devastated area of the Serbian province of Kosovo on Sunday and
pushed for independent investigations into reported massacres. John
Shattuck, the U.S. State Department's top human rights official,
demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allow access to
forensic specialists to find out the truth behind alleged
atrocities against both ethnic Albanians and Serbs. Shattuck was
joined by former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole and other Western officials on
his fact-finding tour, which comes amid a push to stop the
bloodshed and prevent further humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.
Hundreds of people have died and an estimated 265,000 have been
driven from their homes since February, when Serb forces launched a
crackdown on armed secessionists in the largely Albanian-populated
province. The U.S. officials are scheduled to meet Monday with
Milosevic, then later report their findings to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   PARSASHUKRULLAH, India (AP) _ Floodwaters that began to rise two
months ago have submerged hundreds of acres (hectares) of ready
crops, threatening a plunge in India's annual foodgrain production
and a steep rise in food prices. Experts say the floods will hurt
an economy already hit by recession, especially after the
government listed agriculture as its top priority in its first
annual budget this year. ``This could push down the government's
projected growth rate of over 6 percent, and prices will go up,''
said leading economist S.P. Gupta, chairman of the Society for
Social and Economic Transition in New Delhi. ``There will be an
inflation buildup, and I don't know how long the present value of
the rupee can be maintained.'' On Sunday, 10 more people died in
the swirling floodwater, raising the number of dead to 1,625 since
the monsoon rains broke over northern India in early July.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The grind of doing a sitcom for 10 years didn't
fatigue Faith Ford.
	   The ``Murphy Brown'' co-star, who played perky newswoman Corkie
Sherwood until the show's demise last season, is back working the
same long sitcom hours on her own show, ``Maggie Winters.''
	   ``You'd think I was an eager beaver,'' Ford says in the Sept. 11
Entertainment Weekly. ``But actually I'm a creature of habit. I
found a medium I love, and I didn't want to leave it behind.''
	   Ford plays a woman returning home to live with her mother after
leaving an unfaithful husband.
	   ``Maggie may be a raw, exposed nerve when you meet her,'' Ford
said, ``but she't not negative about it. She's made a decision to
move forward rather than look back and blame anybody.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Supermodel Cindy Crawford knows how
childhood cancer can change people's lives forever. Her younger
brother died of cancer when she was 8.
	   Crawford, 32, told families of childhood cancer patients
Saturday the odds of survival are greater than they were for her
brother more than 20 years ago, thanks to medical advances.
	   ``Yes, my brother died,'' she said, ``but for the parents who
are getting the news that their child has cancer or leukemia, it
doesn't have to mean they're going to lose their child.''
	   Crawford spoke at a reunion of about 700 former and current
child cancer patients and their families at the University of
Wisconsin. The event marked the 25th anniversary of UW Hospital's
cancer center. Crawford's brother was treated at the hospital.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Christina Applegate has news for her fans.
Oversexed bimbo Kelly Bundy from ``Married ... With Children''
isn't really her.
	   Applegate transforms herself from the caricature role she's best
known for into a smart, single mom in her new TV show, ``Jesse.''
	   ``Some people will be surprised, and some people already knew I
was just playing a character all those years,'' Applegate says in
the Sept. 11 Entertainment Weekly.
	   As Jesse, Applegate also wants to make sure she doesn't slip
into a new stereotype.
	   ``It's not about a young career woman in her late 20s to early
30s who's neurotic,'' Applegate said. ``It's more of a
family-oriented comedy.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Holland's House of Orange had
three royal reasons to party over the weekend: the 72nd birthday of
Prince Claus and two landmark coronation anniversaries.
	   The birthday Sunday of Claus, husband of Queen Beatrix,
coincided with the 100th anniversary of the crowning of Queen
Wilhelmina and the 50th anniversary of the day her daughter,
Princess Juliana, became queen.
	   The German-born prince was marking his birthday quietly at home
with family and close friends, Dutch media reported. He is said to
have fully recovered from emergency surgery in June to treat an
enlarged prostate.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Louise Woodward is being deluged by suitors,
receiving about 50 marriage proposals along with cards, flowers and
candy since the au pair's return to England from America after her
manslaughter conviction.
	   ``I tend to get a lot of gifts from them: Valentine things like
flowers and chocolates,'' Ms. Woodward says in The Sunday Times.
``You always get people who see a picture or your face on TV and
fall in love with it. They tend to keep my photograph by their
bed.''
	   The 20-year-old returned home in June after a Massachusetts
court upheld her involuntary manslaughter conviction in the death
of an 8-month-old baby who died of head injuries in 1997 while in
her care. She maintains she is innocent.
	   Her notoriety has brought loads of fan mail and an Internet site
where people send messages.
	   Some letters, she said, came from ``loonies,'' but none were
scary. ``I've got lots of friends out there,'' she said.

	   FORT DEFIANCE, Virginia (AP) _ At age 79, the Rev. Billy Graham
admits he might have taken his own preaching about devotion to
family values more to heart.
	   The minister was among celebrants Saturday at Augusta Springs
Presbyterian Church for the wedding of a granddaughter, Noelle.
	   Graham, who has counseled presidents and led faith crusades
around the world, said he's glad he can now focus on his family
more after a half-century of Christian ministry.
	   ``I've neglected them,'' Graham said. ``I've traveled too much,
written too many articles, written too many books.''

Cardinals beat Reds 5-2; Pirates defeat Cubs 4-3

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire went 0-for-3 with a walk Sunday in
the St. Louis Cardinals' 5-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds, missing
what would have been his record-tying 61st homer when a
sixth-inning drive hooked just foul.
	   While Cardinals fans were disappointed McGwire remained one home
run behind Roger Maris' mark, on deck in a head-to-head matchup
with Sammy Sosa, who has 58 home runs and comes to town with the
Chicago Cubs for a two-game series that starts Monday afternoon.
	   Brian Jordan hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth, and Ray
Lankford and Fernando Tatis hit consecutive homers. Juan Acevedo
(8-3) was the winner and Hudek (5-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Cubs 3
	   In Pittsburgh, Sosa went homerless for the first time in four
games, allowing Jason Kendall to stop Chicago's six-game winning
streak with a 10th-inning homer off Dave Stevens (1-2).
	   Sosa, who was 2-for-5, struck out for the 144th strikeout this
season, helping Rich Loiselle (2-7) get out of a two-out, two-on
jam in the 10th.
 &UR; Braves 4, Mets 0
	   In New York, John Smoltz (14-3) pitched a three-hitter for his
second shutout of the season and struck out 12 as New York remained
a game behind Chicago in the NL wild-card race.
	   Marty Malloy homered off Rick Reed (16-9) in his major league
debut, and Andruw Jones, Ryan Klesko and Andres Galarraga also
homered as Atlanta stopped a three-game losing streak.
 &UR; Rockies 12, Padres 2
	   In Denver, Jamey Wright (9-12) allowed six hits in eight
innings, Dante Bichette reached 200 hits and Mike Lansing hit an
inside-the-park homer.
	   NL batting leader Larry Walker went 3-for-3, raising his average
to .350, as Colorado hammered Joey Hamilton (12-12) for seven runs
_ four earned _ in four innings.
 &UR; Brewers 5, Phillies 4
	   In Milwaukee, Fernando Vina hit an RBI single off Wayne Gomes
(9-6) and another run scored on third baseman Scott Rolen's error
as Milwaukee rallied in the ninth.
	   David Weathers (6-5) got the win in relief.

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Soviet-made cars rumble over pot-holed streets.
Concrete-block apartments built with Soviet aid cast shadows over
afternoon soccer games. And from a hilltop, a 30-foot-tall
(9-meter-tall) marble bust ived in Cuba,
many of them sent by the Kremlin as soldiers, engineers and other
technical specialists. When communism collapsed, Soviet aid
vanished, and many people from Russia and other former Soviet
republics returned home.
	   But about 2,000 Russians stayed behind.
	   ``I am a Cuban, practically,'' says Elvira Taskaeva, 54, who
arrived two decades ago with a Cuban man she met in Russia. The two
married and had a daughter, and Taskaeva worked devising industrial
design standards for the Cuban government.
	   When Taskaeva divorced, she had no family in Russia to return
to. So she and her daughter stayed, living in a fifth floor
apartment on Havana's outskirts. Taped to the door are the words of
Isaiah 40:8 in Spanish: ``The grass withers and the flowers fall,
but the word of our God stands forever.''
	   Taskaeva, an ardent Christian, believes Cuba is where she is to
live out her life.
	   ``I am never going back,'' she says. ``I don't have anywhere to
go.''
	   Many former Soviets in Cuba tell similar stories. During the
Cold War, Cuban students studied everything from aviation to
engineering in cities throughout the Soviet Union. Many returned
home with spouses.
	   Tatiana Gaidemskaya came with her Cuban husband. A blonde
Ukrainian with bright blue eyes who grew up trudging through snow
in boots, she soon learned to wear thin dresses and sandals.
	   At first, she didn't know Spanish. He didn't know Russian or
Ukrainian. But they married and had a daughter.
	   When they divorced, Gaidemskaya had no easy way home. Now 35,
she sells small pizzas from her barred front porch for Cuban pesos
while her 11-year-old daughter plays inside. The girl speaks
Ukrainian and Spanish, and sometimes tells her mother she wants to
see her relatives.
	   But going back is a distant hope.
	   ``I can't go. I don't have money,'' Gaidemskaya says, sullenly
running her eyes across the cracked concrete floor. ``For the
moment, I have no other choice. I live here like any other Cuban.
At least I'm able to have this little business.''
	   A man calling outside interrupts. Any pizza for sale?
	   ``No,'' she calls back. ``We aren't working today.''
	   The reason: The water is off.
	   ``Without water, I can't do anything _ not even bathe, or clean
or cook,'' she says. ``We've been without water for three days now.
And I don't know if tomorrow will be different.''
	   Not far from Gaidemskaya's house, a flame burns at a memorial to
Soviet soldiers who died during service in Cuba. To aid the Cuban
government during the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent military
personnel, along with thousands of civilians with needed skills.
	   One was Dimas Garcia, who died in 1982. A Spanish-born Russian,
he was the type of worker Cuban revolutionary Ernesto ``Che''
Guevara had sought when he visited the Soviet Union in the early
1960s, says Garcia's widow, 74-year-old Basilisa Alvarran.
	   Most importantly, Garcia could speak Spanish. The Cuban
government needed people like him to fill the positions of
well-educated Cubans who left the island after Fidel Castro won
power in 1959. Garcia taught metal working in a Havana technical
school.
	   Years later, one of his sons moved back to Moscow and married a
Russian woman. His other son, Antonio Garcia, mastered Russian in
Cuba and still uses the language when speaking with his mother.
	   ``There are times that we use both languages, mixed,'' says
Garcia, 37. ``Sometimes my mother tells me: 'Take the clothes down
from the line because the `dozhd' is coming.' That means rain.''
	   Until several years ago, many Cuban schools taught Russian. With
the end of Soviet communism, Cuban interest in the language waned.
Some Russian teachers returned home; others began teaching English.
	   But children in primary grades through high school can still
learn the tongue of Lenin from teachers who speak it fluently at
Havana's Russian school.
	   Pavel Alba Arbakova, 9, is one of those going to the school this
fall. His Russian mother, Svetlana Arbakova, and Cuban father,
Eduardo Alba Cabrera, decided it would be good for him.
	   ``He knows Russian, knows how to communicate with you. But he
doesn't know how to read or write,'' Alba says while driving the
family's Soviet-made Lada hatchback to visit friends after work.
	   ``What I know how to do is talk,'' the boy blurts from the back
seat.
	   Pavel says he considers himself mostly Russian; after all, he
was born there. But he looks like his Cuban father when he gestures
with his hands, raising an open palm or an index finger as Spanish
words roll from his mouth.
	   His mother sells vodka and other imported goods inside the
Russian Embassy _ a walled complex topped with a colossal
rectangular tower that dominates the seaside landscape of Havana's
Miramar district. She speaks Spanish, but is more comfortable in
her native tongue.
	   ``The `official' language at home is Russian,'' Alba says.
``When the three of us are talking, we speak in Russian.''
	   They also do other things foreign to most Cubans. They celebrate
with a costume party on New Year's Eve, eat hot soup in the summer
and drink tea instead of coffee.
	   Over tea at his friends' house, Alba looks across the table at
the wife he met studying in the Soviet Union. ``Are you happy, or
are you married?'' he quips.
	   ``No,'' he says before she can answer, giggling and grinning.
``We're happy.''
	   ``I am happy,'' she says in accented Spanish. ``The country
doesn't matter. It's my family.''

Vikings beat Buccaneers 31-7; Seahawks defeat Eagles 38-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, adding later games. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Randy Moss, passed over by 19 teams in last
spring's draft, caught two long touchdown passes to lead the
Minnesota Vikings to a surprisingly easy 31-7 victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
	   Moss became the first rookie in team history with two TDs in his
first game. Brad Johnson matched a career high with four TD passes
to help give the Vikings the early edge over the Buccaneers in the
pursuit of Green Bay in the NFC Central.
	   The Bucs' defense was off-balance all afternoon, and the running
game generated only 68 yards with Pro Bowl backs Warrick Dunn and
Mike Alstott.
 &UR; Seahawks 38, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Ricky Watters, returning to Veterans Stadium
with the Seattle Seahawks, wasn't even the focal point in their
victory over the Eagles.
	   Joey Galloway had a career-high 142 yards receiving and scored
two touchdowns as the Seahawks handed Philadelphia its first
shutout in a home opener since 1941. Fans who packed the stadium to
boo Watters, who left the Eagles as a free agent, quickly lost
interest.
	   After proclaiming that the Eagles had the worst preseason he'd
ever seen, coach Ray Rhodes suffered his worst loss as
Philadelphia's coach.
	   Warren Moon, the Seahawks' 41-year-old quarterback, passed for
204 yards and three touchdowns. Watters, who led Philadelphia to
the playoffs twice, rushed 16 times for 67 yards.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Bears 23 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mark Brunell went 8-for-9 in an 87-yard game-winning
drive Sunday as Jacksonville rallied to beat the Bears.
	   Brunell threw for 73 yards on the drive, hitting Jimmy Smith
with a 4-yard TD pass with 29 seconds left.
	   It was the third straight victory on opening day for
Jacksonville, touted in the preseason as a Super Bowl contender. It
was just the third time in 15 years Chicago has lost an opener,
though the Bears came close to an upset thanks to Curtis Enis.
	   The fifth overall pick in the draft, who sat out most of
training camp during a holdout, rushed for 77 yards on 12 carries
and set up two late scores.
 &UR; Giants 31, Redskins 24 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, All-Pro Michael Strahan scored
on a 24-yard interception return as New York's opportunistic
defense scored or set up three third-quarter touchdowns over
error-prone Washington.
	   The Redskins, second to the NFC East champion Giants last
season, were picked by many experts to dethrone New York after
spending dlrs 57 million to shore up the middle of their defense
with tackles Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson.
 &UR; Oilers 23, Bengals 14 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Al Del Greco made his first three field-goal
attempts, while Dave Krieg took over for an injured Steve McNair
and steadied Tennessee against Cincinnati.
	   It was a costly game for the Oilers, who lost five players to
injury. The most prominent was McNair, who hurt his elbow late in a
ragged first half and didn't return.
	   Krieg, who hadn't played much in two years, led the Oilers to a
second-half touchdown and put Del Greco in position to kick two
field goals. Krieg completed seven of 13 passes for 129 yards
without an interception.
	   Del Greco hit from 38, 31 and 48 yards before hitting the right
upright on a 47-yard attempt in the closing minutes, ending his
streak of consecutive field goals at 12.
 &UR; Falcons 19, Panthers 14 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Chris Chandler threw for 268 yards
and two touchdowns for Atlanta as he overcame a Carolina defense
that had six sacks and kept him on the run much of the game.
	   Atlanta was 7-3 last season when Chandler, who has been bothered
by concussions, finished games he started. The Falcons were 0-6
when he wasn't around at the end.
	   He completed 17 of 32 passes against Carolina, helping the
Falcons win their road opener for the first time since 1986.
	   Atlanta converted one interception and two Carolina punting
miscues into 12 points, dooming the Panthers to their fourth
consecutive home loss.
 &UR; Steelers 20, Ravens 13 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Kordell Stewart scored Pittsburgh's first
touchdown after the Ravens botched a punt, and the Steelers took
advantage of Baltimore's shoddy kicking game.
	   Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh left for good midway in the
second quarter after hyperextending the ring finger on his right
hand. The injury apparently happened when he hit the ground after
being hit by Carnell Lake.
	   Backup Eric Zeier threw a 64-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine
Lewis with 2:48 left to bring Baltimore to 20-13. But a 68-yard
punt by Josh Miller left the Ravens at their 4 with 27 seconds
left.
	   Matt Stover missed three field goals, two of them because of
poor snaps. Long snapper Harper Le Bel, a replacement for the
injured Brian Kinchen, lowlighted a miserable day by sending a
one-hopper to punter Kyle Richardson in the third quarter.
	   Richardson was tackled for a 31-yard loss, and Stewart scored
from the 1 for a 13-3 lead. Stewart threw a 20-yard TD pass to
Charles Johnson on Pittsburgh's next possession to make it 20-3
with 10 minutes left.

 &UR; Saints 24, Rams 17 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Mike Ditka's second season started out a lot
better than the first, despite losing quarterback Billy Joe Hobert.
	   New Orleans turned two first-half turnovers into touchdowns and
had only one turnover, contrasting with a mistake-filled
performance from St. Louis. Lamar Smith caught one touchdown pass
and threw for another on an option play.
	   The Saints opened in St. Louis for the second straight year.
Ditka lost 38-24 to Dick Vermeil last year in the coaching comeback
game for both men. New Orleans led the rematch 24-0 with 4:45 left
in the first half and ended a four-game losing streak against the
Rams.
	   But Hobert ruptured his right Achilles' tendon dropping back to
pass on the artificial turf with 14:20 remaining. Hobert, who is
probably out for the season, was 11-for-23 for 170 yards and one
touchdown before being replaced by Danny Wuerffel.
 &UR; Packers 38, Lions 19 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the first matchup of reigning MVPs
in NFL history, Brett Favre's Packers beat Barry Sanders' Detroit
Lions.
	   Sanders' streak of 14 consecutive regular-season 100-yard
rushing games came to an end as he gained 70 yards on 17 carries.
Favre was a workmanlike 23-for-31 for 193 yards and a touchdown
before hooking up with Antonio Freeman for an 84-yard TD pass with
1:53 left.
	   Detroit's Terry Fair returned a kickoff 101 yards for a
touchdown at the end of the third quarter, and Roell Preston
promptly replied with a 100-yard TD return to restore Green Bay's
12-point lead, 31-19.
	   Fair returned six kickoffs for 244 yards and Preston returned
four for 163. The Packers have won 28 straight games at Lambeau
Field.

	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Danielle Ammaccapane shot an even-par 72
Sunday to hold off Emilee Klein by one stroke and win the dlrs
600,000 LPGA Safeway Golf Championship.
	   Klein, who began the round three shots behind Ammaccapane, tied
her with a birdie 4 on the 501-yard (458-meter) 10th hole that left
both players at 11-under par. Ammaccapane then birdied Nos. 12 and
13 on the 6,307-yard (5,765-meter) Columbia-Edgewater Country Club
course to take the lead for good.
	   Ammaccapane finished with a 12-under 204 total to win her second
tournament of the year and the dlrs 90,000 first prize. She won the
Mercury Titleholders Championship in May.
	   Klein, who shot a final-round 70, failed in her bid to win her
first title since the 1996 British Women's Open.
	   Ammaccapane's younger sister, Dina, finished with a 66 and was
third at 207.
	   Kris Tschetter, who had Sunday's best round with a 65 that
included an eagle, and Erika Wicoff, who closed with a 70, were
another stroke back.
	   The fourth-place finish was a career-best for Wicoff, a
second-year pro who missed the cut 13 times in 22 events this
season.
	   Ammaccapane nearly let the lead slip away when her tee shot on
18 went left into cedar trees and she had to chip out. She bogeyed,
but Klein struggled to make par.

One big party: China's Communist Party attracts the young

<TEXT>
	   TIANJIN, China (AP) _ From China's elite universities to
villages of mud-brick houses, young people are struggling to join
the Communist Party.
	   It's not for socialist ideology. China is fast embracing
capitalism, and its youth are at the forefront.
	   Some say they're joining out of patriotism.
	   But to many Chinese, party membership is simply the road to
getting rich. Although some private businessmen in big cities
prosper without party ties, businessmen elsewhere in the country
can profit hugely from a party connection.
	   Business people join the party ``to get easier access to loans,
licenses and other essential resources or to gain a little
influence in local policy implementation,'' said Bruce Dickson, a
political scientist at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C., who studies the party's recruitment.
	   Communist Party officials may simply want to help an upstanding
businessmen, aiding him with permits and licenses in places where
the party and the government are almost synonymous.
	   In other cases, party leaders may simply be looking for a
partner in crime. Corruption is rampant among members, even by the
party's own reckoning. Members wine and dine on the public tab in
smoky karaoke rooms. In some cases, according to accounts in
state-controlled newspapers, millions of dollars have been
embezzled.
	   In July, for instance, Zhu Shengwen, the vice mayor of Harbin, a
city of 9 million people in northeastern China, was expelled from
the party on charges he traded power for money by taking bribes. He
claimed the charges were fabricated.
	   Many young people insist they are joining the party out of pure
motives.
	   Six students at prestigious Nankai University in Tianjin, near
Beijing, who recently were interviewed in a group about their
reasons for joining the party, denied that corruption is a problem
or that some join for personal gain. The party's code of conduct
calls for exemplary living, serving others and fighting for
communism _ not capitalism.
	   The Communist Party in its revolutionary years pulled China out
of the grip of Western powers and severe poverty and ``has led our
country to prosperity,'' said Wang Qingpeng, a philosophy student.
	   Zeng Canxia, who is in environmental studies at Nankai and who
joined the party in high school, said the party provides the
``staunch leadership core'' needed to build China into a modern,
developed country.
	   ``If a person wants to do something for the country, it's hard
to accomplish anything of value relying only on oneself,'' she
said. ``One must throw oneself into a big and powerful group.''
	   Students like these increasingly are being recruited and passing
the party's strict review process. Newspapers reported groups of
hundreds of students around China took the oath of membership on
July 1, the anniversary of the party's founding in 1921.
	   At Beijing University, the country's top school, only 4 percent
of undergraduates were party members in 1990, just after the
crackdown on democracy demonstrations that were led by the school's
students. Now 13 percent are members.
	   Dickson, the George Washington University professor, said that
the number of people who join the party for nationalistic reasons
seems to be shrinking and that most join for material motives.
	   In some jobs, party membership is necessary for career
advancement.
	   A newspaper editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
was told higher jobs were out of the question unless he signed up.
	   Entrepreneurs often join to improve their connections with local
officials or are recruited because they have skills the party
wants.
	   The 58 million-member party also co-opts leaders in the
villages. About 70 percent to 80 percent of all candidates in
village elections are party members, and many non-members who win
are quickly recruited, according to officials of the Ministry of
Civil Affairs.
	   Under party rules, members have a right to debate and make
suggestions on policies within party channels. But these debates
are kept concealed from the public.
	   ``I think the reason young people want to join the Chinese
Communist Party is the same reason that their elders did. So far it
is the main means for asserting one's political views,'' said Merle
Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University.
	   Outsiders risk being treated as subversives if they make
political opinions public, she said.
	   Chinese Communists speak carefully about their party. When they
join, they vow to carry out its decisions, observe its discipline,
guard its secrets.
	   The students at Nankai University insisted the only personal
gain they expected was character development and the opportunity to
play a part in something bigger.
	   Xiong Zhanbo, a mathematics major, said as a party member he
would help the village where he grew up become prosperous and
``realize the value of my own life, and give all my energy to the
building of the country.''

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ For block after block, the visitor doesn't glimpse
a single structure built in the last 40 years. Suddenly, a gleaming
high-rise jars the senses.
	   Havana is an architecturally eclectic capital, from the
Cathedral in Baroque stone to the Capitolio in neo-classical
marble, from the houses along the seaside Malecon avenue in
colonial plastered brick to the Melia Cohiba Hotel in ultra-modern
tinted glass.
	   Still, modern buildings are rare. From 1959, when Fidel Castro
marched into the capital, to the mid-1990s, the old part of Havana
was left alone as socialist planners concentrated on building huge
apartment complexes and factories on the city's outskirts.
	   Havana's tallest building, the Focsa apartments, was nearly
completed in 1959. Its facade remains raw and unfinished today, a
spectacular eyesore rising above graceful two-story houses from the
early part of the century.
	   The sea of colonial-era buildings is so unspoiled _ although
often not maintained _ that the United Nations has declared Havana
a part of ``human heritage.'' And rather than destroy the old, Cuba
has launched what for the cash-hungry island is a large-scale
restoration effort.
	   But after 40 years of decay worsened by the salty humidity of
the seaside city, a quarter of the buildings in Old Havana have
suffered caved-in floors and many collapse each year.
	   For Havana, it is a race against time.

Chernomyrdin: Russia still wants help from West
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of two major parliamentary factions
said they remained adamantly opposed to President Boris Yeltsin's
choice for prime minister.
	   Russia needs a government ``trusted by the people, including
both houses of parliament,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said
in a television interview Sunday night.
	   Both he and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the social democratic
Yabloko party, said Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, had not earned that trust.
	   Yeltsin planned to meet Monday with parliamentary and other
leaders in an attempt to forge an agreement on forming a new
government.
	   Yeltsin proposed the meeting on Friday, prompting lawmakers to
postpone a second vote on confirming Chernomyrdin. The
Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament, has
already rejected Chernomyrdin once.
	   The meeting was to include eight members of each house of
parliament, along with Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
leaders of Russia's two largest trade unions.
	   The Duma is expected to vote on Chernomyrdin later in the day.
	   Russia is in the midst of one of its most serious economic and
political crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The economy has been in freefall, with the government devaluing
the ruble and effectively defaulting on foreign loans. Ever since
Yeltsin fired the previous Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, the country has been groping its way through the crisis
without a government.
	   Chernomyrdin, also speaking on national television Sunday, said
he hoped the Duma would approve his nomination. He compared Russia
to a ship driven toward cliffs by stormy weather, and said the crew
should stop arguing and follow its captain.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said on the
popular television program ``Itogi.''
	   He said Russia needed to at least double its gold and foreign
currency reserves, ``hopefully through the (assistance) of the
global financial system,'' he said.
	   It was his latest effort to reassure Western governments and
Russian reformers that he hopes to avoid retrenchment into
Soviet-style economic isolation, which some people have predicted.
	   Chernomyrdin also sent a message Sunday to the finance ministers
of Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help
of the international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Russian news agencies reported.
	   The letter was a response to Britain's decision to call an
emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.

Graf knocked out by Schnyder

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf's comeback collapsed at the U.S.
Open on Sunday night as she lost to a Swiss teen-ager in the fourth
round for her earliest elimination from the tournament since 1984.
	   Graf, the five-time U.S. Open champion who is trying to come
back from reconstructive knee surgery, was undermined by 33
unforced errors in her 6-3, 6-4 loss to Patty Schnyder.
	   Schnyder, who was 3 years old when Graf turned pro in 1982, used
her strong forehand to overpower the former top-ranked player who
once dominated opponents with her forehand.
	   Though Graf was seeded eighth and Schnyder 11th, the result was
not that much of an upset. Graf is ranked just 26th in the world
while returning from the knee surgery, and Schnyder is ranked 10th.
	   The match ended after 59 minutes when Graf hit a service return
long. Graf marched quickly off court, while Schynder celebrated and
then signed autographs.

	   Schnyder, 19, who has won five tournaments this year, broke
Graf's serve early in the first set and took advantage of 14
unforced errors by Graf in the first seven games. Graf, who began
the match with tape around her right wrist, removed the tape after
falling behind 5-2.
	   Schnyder took a 2-1 lead in the second set with another service
break. Graf immediately broke back, and the set was tied 4-4 until
Schnyder broke again in the ninth game. She then held serve for the
victory.
	   Graf, who has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and
held the No. 1 ranking for a record 374 weeks, has been trying to
work back into top form after left knee surgery last year.
	   She skipped the U.S. Open following the surgery last year, but
had not been eliminated this early since losing in the first round
as a 15-year-old in 1984.
	   While Graf was defeated, several other top women's seeds
advanced to the quarterfinals.

NEW YORK: the quarterfinals.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 6 Monica Seles advanced toward
a battle in the women's quarterfinals, despite struggling in
fourth-round matches. Also winning was No. 3 Jana Novotna.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill and Geoff Grant came within a few points of
glory Sunday, but within a span of 14 minutes both were losers _
joining most of the tournament's other American men in defeat.
	   As the U.S. Open completed its first week, only two American men
_ former champions Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi _ remained on
court. A tournament once dominated by its host nation has turned
into a showcase for global tennis.
	   The number of Americans in the men's main draw, which does not
include wild cards and qualifiers, has declined steadily over the
last two decades. In 1981, there were 74 U.S. men in the main draw.
This year there were 10.
	   The men lost another seeded player when No. 5 Richard Krajicek
withdrew in the second set of his match against Thomas Johansson
with tendinitis in his left knee. The winners included No. 7 Alex
Corretja, No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13 Tim Henman.
	   Gambill, expected to make his Davis Cup debut for the United
States later this month, lost 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to
French Open champion Carlos Moya in a three-hour match in which
both players tossed rackets in frustration.
	   Gambill took a 4-3 lead in the final set and was up 40-15 on his
serve. But Moya, nursing a right ankle injury, rallied to win the
game and get back on serve.
	   After his shot sailed long to give Moya the game, Gambill stood
forlornly at the net _ bent at the waist, staring down at the
court.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old blond from Spokane, Washington, faced a
match point two games later after a shot by Moya clipped the net
and bounced high over Gambill's racket. Gambill threw his racket in
disgust, then saved the match point with a lob.
	   Gambill made several errors in the tiebreaker, netting a
forehand on Moya's third match point and walking slowly to the net
in defeat as Moya raised his arms to the crowd.
	   Moya, the 10th seed, had rallied from a two-set deficit to
defeat Michael Chang in a marathon match that lasted until 1:33
a.m. Saturday.
	   While Gambill was walking off court, Grant was running out of
steam two courts away. Grant, ranked 189th in the world, lost 7-5,
6-7 (5-7), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5 to Oliver Gross in a match that lasted 3
hours, 38 minutes and left both players cramping at the end.
	   The 28-year-old from Boston retired from tennis in 1994 and was
a part-time model. He resumed his career at the 1995 U.S. Open.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf's comeback collapsed at the U.S.
Open on Sunday night as she lost to a Swiss teen-ager in the fourth
round for her earliest elimination from the tournament since 1984.
	   Graf, the five-time U.S. Open champion who is trying to come
back from reconstructive knee surgery, was undermined by 33
unforced errors in her 6-3, 6-4 loss to Patty Schnyder.
	   Schnyder, who was 3 years old when Graf turned pro in 1982, used
her strong forehand to overpower the former top-ranked player who
once dominated opponents with her forehand.
	   Though Graf was seeded eighth and Schnyder 11th, the result was
not that much of an upset. Graf is ranked just 26th in the world
while returning from the knee surgery, and Schnyder is ranked 10th.
	   The match ended after 59 minutes when Graf hit a service return
long. Graf marched quickly off court, while Schynder celebrated and
then signed autographs.
	   Schnyder, 19, who has won five tournaments this year, broke
Graf's serve early in the first set and took advantage of 14
unforced errors by Graf in the first seven games. Graf, who began
the match with tape around her right wrist, removed the tape after
falling behind 5-2.
	   Schnyder took a 2-1 lead in the second set with another service
break. Graf immediately broke back, and the set was tied 4-4 until
Schnyder broke again in the ninth game. She then held serve for the
victory.
	   Graf, who has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and
held the No. 1 ranking for a record 374 weeks, has been trying to
work back into top form after left knee surgery last year.
	   She skipped the U.S. Open following the surgery last year, but
had not been eliminated this early since losing in the first round
as a 15-year-old in 1984.
	   While Graf was defeated, several other top women's seeds
advanced to the quarterfinals.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 6 Monica Seles advanced toward
a battle in the women's quarterfinals, despite struggling in
fourth-round matches. Also winning was No. 3 Jana Novotna.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill and Geoff Grant came within a few points of
glory Sunday, but within a span of 14 minutes both were losers _
joining most of the tournament's other American men in defeat.
	   As the U.S. Open completed its first week, only two American men
_ former champions Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi _ remained on
court. A tournament once dominated by its host nation has turned
into a showcase for global tennis.
	   The number of Americans in the men's main draw, which does not
include wild cards and qualifiers, has declined steadily over the
last two decades. In 1981, there were 74 U.S. men in the main draw.
This year there were 10.
	   The men lost another seeded player when No. 5 Richard Krajicek
withdrew in the second set of his match against Thomas Johansson
with tendinitis in his left knee. The winners included No. 7 Alex
Corretja, No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13 Tim Henman.
	   Gambill, expected to make his Davis Cup debut for the United
States later this month, lost 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to
French Open champion Carlos Moya in a three-hour match in which
both players tossed rackets in frustration.
	   Gambill took a 4-3 lead in the final set and was up 40-15 on his
serve. But Moya, nursing a right ankle injury, rallied to win the
game and get back on serve.
	   After his shot sailed long to give Moya the game, Gambill stood
forlornly at the net _ bent at the waist, staring down at the
court.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old blond from Spokane, Washington, faced a
match point two games later after a shot by Moya clipped the net
and bounced high over Gambill's racket. Gambill threw his racket in
disgust, then saved the match point with a lob.
	   Gambill made several errors in the tiebreaker, netting a
forehand on Moya's third match point and walking slowly to the net
in defeat as Moya raised his arms to the crowd.
	   Moya, the 10th seed, had rallied from a two-set deficit to
defeat Michael Chang in a marathon match that lasted until 1:33
a.m. Saturday.
	   While Gambill was walking off court, Grant was running out of
steam two courts away. Grant, ranked 189th in the world, lost 7-5,
6-7 (5-7), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5 to Oliver Gross in a match that lasted 3
hours, 38 minutes and left both players cramping at the end.
	   The 28-year-old from Boston retired from tennis in 1994 and was
a part-time model. He resumed his career at the 1995 U.S. Open.

Black ink as far as the eye can see
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It's big and getting bigger. For the first
time since the 1920s, it's not an era of federal budget deficits
people are talking about but _ wonder of wonders _ and era of
federal surpluses.
	   In the blink of an eye, seas of red ink are giving way to oceans
of black. Not only is the budget forecast to be in surplus this
year _ a feat last accomplished 29 years ago _ it's expected to
stay in the black for years to come. The Congressional Budget
Office predicts an eye-popping dlrs 1.6 trillion in surpluses over
the next 11 years.
	   Even though there have been eight years with a budget surplus
since 1930, Coolidge, who served from 1923 to 29, was the last
president to show a surplus each year he was in office.
	   But just how sure of a thing are estimates of surpluses to come,
especially now that the stock market has plunged from its lofty
heights? On that question hang all of Congress' hopes and dreams.
	   Private economists generally view the assumptions underlying the
estimates as reasonable, unlike previous periods when politicians
cooked up rosy economic scenarios to produce mythical surpluses.
	   ``The CBO projections are not overly optimistic,'' said Stanley
Collender, a budget expert at Fleishman-Hillard Inc. ``They are
based on what most people would consider very moderate
assumptions.''
	   But still, Collender notes: ``A lot of things can upset the
apple cart. Any forecast beyond next year is a mathematical
exercise with more questions than answers.''
	   First and foremost among the things that could go wrong is a
recession. The CBO has no recession in its outlook over the next 10
years. The current economic expansion _ already in its eighth year
_ will be the longest peacetime recovery in history if it lasts
until December.
	   But the Asian economic crisis, which has slowed U.S. growth
dramatically and given the stock market a case of the nervous
willies, highlights how unforeseen events can cause problems.
	   A mild recession could increase the deficit by dlrs 100 billion
in a single year. And a forecasting error as tiny as just 0.1
percentage point slower growth each year over the next decade would
trim dlrs 184 billion off projected surpluses, the CBO estimates.
	   ``With an economy operating at 4.5 percent unemployment and 2
percent inflation, we are living in economic heaven. That won't
last,'' said Robert Reischauer, former head of the CBO.
	   The extraordinarily good economy, in fact, is the reason the
surpluses are happening earlier _ and bigger _ than expected.
	   In last year's balanced budget agreement, the target to gain the
first surplus was set at 2002. At the beginning of this year, in
fact, the CBO forecast a small deficit for this budget year, which
ends Sept. 30.
	   But in March, higher-than-expected tax collections caused the
CBO to switch to projecting small surpluses, beginning this year.
Then in July, as tax money continued to flood in, the 1998 surplus
was increased to dlrs 63 billion _ the first since 1969 and the
highest in history.
	   The higher revenues are coming courtesy of a surging stock
market that has made capital gains tax collections soar.
	   But, analysts wonder what happens to the higher revenue
estimates now that the market has begun to drop.
	   The budget is also benefiting from defense spending cuts and
from the baby bust that occurred during the 1930s Depression. That
means fewer people are retiring at present, meaning less of a drain
on Social Security.
	   But that situation will reverse in 2011, when the post World War
II generation begins retiring. Without additional contributions to
Social Security, officials expect the system to go bust in 2032.
	   In addition, the conservative Republican Party, which controls
Congress, wants to push through a tax cut.
	   Indeed, it is political realities more than economic
uncertainties that leave many doubtful the tide of black ink will
actually ever come to pass.
	   ``The political system will probably not be able to resist the
temptation to spend the surpluses,'' Reischauer said.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels freed a retired Exxon
executive in central mountains on his 64th birthday Sunday, more
than five months after he was kidnapped at his ranch near Bogota.
	   Donald Lee Cary was turned over to the International Red Cross
by guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in
hills outside the town of Medina, 40 miles (65 kilometers)
southeast of the capital.
	   ``It's a great gift,'' a relieved Cary said. He said he thought
he had fractured a rib in a fall, but could walk all right and was
otherwise fit.
	   A government official who helped facilitate the release said he
had no information on how much, if any ransom, was paid. Colombia
has the world's highest kidnapping rate and foreigners fetch the
highest ransoms.
	   Cary, who is married to a Colombian, was born and raised in
Texas and has lived in this country for 19 years, said his wife,
Lucia. She answered the phone at the couple's Bogota apartment and
said her husband had lived in various places in Texas but could not
name them.
	   Cary, who was kidnapped on March 21, said just after his release
that he spent most of his captivity walking through rugged
mountains and was kept at about six different rebel camps.
	   ``There was a lot of walking, a lot of walking. Very difficult.
A lot of walking in difficult, dangerous places, crossing rivers,
all of that,'' Cary told the Radionet network.
	   Ransom kidnappings are a key revenue source for the FARC,
Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group, and foreigners can pay
hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure the release of an
abducted relative.

U.S. officials push Milosevic to provide Kosovo access
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with new Dole and Shattuck quotes, Yugoslav TV
reaction to flight ban. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. officials demanded that
Yugoslavia's president allow greater access in Kosovo for human
rights organizations and forensic experts after hearing
``chilling'' accounts of atrocities.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole were set to personally deliver their
message to Slobodan Milosevic on Monday in Belgrade after a weekend
fact-finding tour of the besieged province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's
main republic.
	   The West has tried for months to get Milosevic to halt his
forces' offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and
an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes in a
crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But the efforts have taken on new urgency with colder weather
arriving and as many as 50,000 people living in the open, left
homeless from the fighting.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, warned Sunday that the situation is ``rapidly developing
into a humanitarian catastrophe of tremendous proportions.''
	   ``What we have seen is tremendous suffering, suffering that will
only escalate dramatically once winter sets in a month from now,''
he said after the tour of southwestern Kosovo.
	   ``We also heard testimony from eyewitnesses to some of the
crimes and atrocities,'' he told reporters in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina. ``These accounts were chilling.''
	   Shattuck emphasized that Washington wants forensic investigators
to ferret out the truth behind alleged atrocities on both sides,
not just against Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   He made clear the credibility of Serb claims will suffer if they
don't allow outsiders in to verify massacres such as one they
alleged in late August, when they said 22 Serb civilians were
killed and cremated by the rebels. Forensics doctors, he said, have
been ready and waiting for months but haven't been granted Yugoslav
visas.
	   ``To throw around these kinds of allegations and not allow
independent forensics investigations is absurd,'' the U.S. official
said.
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   Dole said the Yugoslav president must be ready for a cease-fire
or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   As evidence that Milosevic is still under domestic pressure not
to ``lose'' Kosovo, which Serbs consider the cradle of their
history, an opposition leader lambasted him Sunday for his
``secretive'' talks with the ethnic Albanians. Zoran Djindjic, head
of the Democratic Party, said the proposed deal is a step toward
full independence.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers gave
final approval Sunday to a long-proposed ban on flights by the
Yugoslav national carrier JAT to the 15 EU member countries because
of the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``This decision ... can hardly be interpreted as anything else
but open support to terrorism in Kosovo,'' Yugoslav state
television said Sunday night.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stock prices rebound in early
</HEADLINE>
trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Monday
in Tokyo after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan indicated
the U.S. central bank may cut interest rates to prevent recession.
	   The dollar bought 133.16 yen in early trading, down 2.25 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
133.57 yen on Friday.
	   The dollar continued a trend set Friday in New York, where the
U.S. currency dropped against major currencies after an
unemployment report offered little evidence of an overheating U.S.
economy.
	   In a speech at the University of California, Berkeley, on
Friday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the U.S. central
bank is prepared to cut interest rates if necessary to keep the
economy from slipping into recession.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   Meanwhile, share prices opened lower but quickly reversed
course, led by a rise in prices of stock future contracts.
	   ``There was a round of heavy buying in futures,'' said Yoshio
Watanabe, a manager of the derivatives section of Toyo Securities.
	   Watanabe said the trading pattern was similar to one seen last
week and which traders attributed to hedge fund activity.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 214.23 points,
or 1.53 percent, to 14,257.14 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei lost 218.33 points, or 1.53 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was up 4.78 points, or 0.44 percent,
to 1,099.25. The TOPIX closed down 19.30 points, or 1.73 percent,
on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.055 percent from Friday's finish of 1.070 percent,
driving its price up to 112.72 yen from 112.61 yen.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Hideki Irabu lost for the fifth time in seven
starts Sunday as Robin Ventura homered to lead the Chicago White
Sox to a 6-5 victory over the New York Yankees, now 0-2 since
winning their 100th game.
	   Ventura hit his 17th home run leading off the third to give the
White Sox their fifth win in six games.
	   Bernie Williams drove in three runs, hitting a two-run homer,
his 24th with one out in the eighth to bring New York within 6-5.
	   James Baldwin (10-5) won for the eighth time in his last 10
decisions. He allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings.
	   Bob Howry got four outs for his fifth save.
	   Irabu (11-8) gave up six runs and eight hits with two walks over
2 1-3 innings. In his last four starts, he has allowed 25 earned
runs over 14 innings for a 16.10 ERA. The right-hander has failed
to pitch past the fourth inning in three of his last four starts.
	   The Yankees, who with their 100th win Friday set an AL record
for fewest games to reach the century mark, have lost two straight
and 10 of 18.
	   New York needs to go 17-5 the rest of the way to break the 1906
Chicago Cubs' record for wins in a season.
 &UR; Blue Jays 8, Red Sox 7 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Craig Grebeck hit a go-ahead triple in the eighth as
Toronto completed a four-game sweep that pulled it within five
games of Boston in the AL wild-card race.
	   Jose Canseco homered for the third consecutive game, reaching 40
homers for the third time in his career and the first time since
1991. It also gave him 1,200 career RBIs.
	   Benito Santiago, in his first plate appearances for Toronto
since an automobile accident on Jan. 4, was 1-for-2 with a
bases-loaded walk. He was activated Friday.
	   The Blue Jays have won 10 straight for the first time since
1987.
	   Boston, which does not play the Blue Jays again this season,
lost for the eighth time in 11 games.
	   Both Toronto manager Tim Johnson and Boston's Jimy Williams was
ejected.
	   Mo Vaughn and Mike Stanley each homered for the Red Sox.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Indians 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley drove in the go-ahead run as the
Tigers overcame a career-high 10 strikeouts from Jaret Wright and
avoided a four-game sweep.
	   Detroit, 2-4 since Larry Parrish replaced manager Buddy Bell on
Tuesday, won for just the seventh time in 34 games.
	   Bryce Florie (7-9) won for the first time in four starts since
Aug. 16, allowing both runs and seven hits in six innings. He
stranded runners in scoring position in the third, fourth and fifth
innings.
	   Todd Jones pitched a perfect ninth for his 23rd save.
	   Wright (11-9) allowed three runs and five hits _ all doubles _
in six innings. His previous strikeout best was eight, but he
surpassed that by fanning Joe Randa and Joe Siddall to get out of a
two-on, one-out jam in the sixth.
 &UR; Athletics 9, Devil Rays 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Jason Giambi and Ed Sprague homered and
Oakland turned three errors into five unearned runs.
	   Tom Candiotti (11-15) won for the third time in four starts,
allowing one run and five hits in seven innings. Since his record
dipped to 5-13 on July 26, Candiotti is 6-2 with a 3.29 ERA in
eight starts.
	   Julio Santana (5-3) lost for the first time in 10 starts since
July 13 at Boston, giving up six runs _ just three earned _ and
five hits in 3 1-3 innings. He had been 3-0 with six no-decisions
in his previous nine starts.
	   Oakland shortstops Aaron Ledesma and Dave Silvestri made costly
errors, as did center fielder Randy Winn.
	   Fred McGriff hit an RBI double in the first, but Matt Stairs
singled in a run in the bottom half.
	   Sprague's 20th homer put Oakland ahead for good leading off the
second.

Graf knocked out by Schnyder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Graf, Schnyder quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf's comeback collapsed at the U.S.
Open against a Swiss teen-ager who was just 3 when the dominant
women's player of the last decade played her first professional
match.
	   The 6-3, 6-4 loss to Patty Schnyder on Sunday night sent the
11th-seeded Swiss player into the quarterfinals and five-time
champion Graf out of the tournament earlier than at any point since
her first appearance in 1984.
	   Graf, who is trying to come back from reconstructive knee
surgery, committed 33 unforced errors, including many off her
once-fearsome forehand.
	   ``Obviously, I made a lot of mistakes, easy mistakes,'' Graf
said. ``I just never got a rhythm. I couldn't get any depth to my
shots.''
	   Though Graf was seeded eighth, the result was not that much of
an upset. Graf is ranked just 26th in the world while returning
from the knee surgery, and Schnyder is ranked 10th. Graf was seeded
higher at the discretion of tournament officials.
	   The match ended after 59 minutes when Graf hit a service return
long. Graf marched quickly off court, while Schnyder celebrated and
then signed autographs.
	   ``She's the greatest player in the last 10 years. Sometimes it's
difficult because you think of that,'' Schnyder said. ``But you
just try to play against her like all other opponents.''
	   Schnyder, 19, who has won five tournaments this year, broke
Graf's serve twice for a 3-0 lead and took advantage of 14 unforced
errors by Graf in the first seven games. Graf, who began the match
with tape around her right wrist, removed the tape after falling
behind 5-2.
	   Schnyder took a 2-1 lead in the second set with another service
break. Graf immediately broke back, and the set was tied 4-4 until
Schnyder broke again in the ninth game. She then saved two break
points and served out the victory on her second match point.
	   ``She made a lot of mistakes. I think she was not happy with her
game,'' Schnyder said. ``I think it's the biggest win I have. To
beat Steffi before such a big crowd and go through to the
quarterfinals is just great.''
	   Graf, who has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and
held the No. 1 ranking for a record 374 weeks, has been trying to
work back into top form after left knee surgery last year.
	   She skipped the U.S. Open following the surgery last year, but
had not been eliminated this early since losing in the first round
as a 15-year-old in 1984.
	   Graf said she hopes to return to the U.S. Open next year, and
said coming back has turned into the roller-coaster she expected.
	   ``At times, it has been difficult to accept that it is going to
take a certain time,'' she said. ``There have been good and bad
moments _ I knew that they would come.''

Ruling party, opposition closer to compromise on bank bill, report
</HEADLINE>
says

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign Japanese lawmakers are moving
toward a compromise on key banking legislation, a top official of
the ruling party said he's willing to consider tougher rules for
using public funds to bail out failing lenders, a news report said
Monday.
	   Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general,
said he was open to opposition party demands for greater bank
disclosure as a condition for using public money, the Asahi
newspaper reported.
	   ``If we're using public funds, we must make the rules strict. If
there's something we think is right in what the opposition parties
say, we want to make new rules,'' Mori was quoted as saying.
	   An LDP spokesman refused to comment.
	   Mori also indicated his party is willing to spend more than the
currently budgeted 13 trillion yen (dlrs 100 billion) to bail out
large banks, the report said.
	   New legislation for cleaning up the banking industry's bad loan
problem is at the center of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's efforts
to revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   But the use of public funds has been a point of contention
between the LDP and opposition parties, who share control of the
upper house of Japan's bicameral parliament and must compromise for
bills to pass.
	   The LDP has proposed using public money to engineer a ``soft
landing,'' forcing banks to clean up their books once and for all
without letting large banks fail.
	   For its part, the opposition has softened initial resistance to
the use of taxpayers' money.
	   A key opposition party, the New Peace Party, now says it will
support the LDP if it requires banks receiving public money to
fully disclose their financial problems and hold executives
responsible for any misdeeds.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf's comeback collapsed at the U.S.
Open against a Swiss teen-ager who was just 3 when the dominant
women's player of the last decade played her first professional
match.
	   The 6-3, 6-4 loss to Patty Schnyder on Sunday night sent the
11th-seeded Swiss player into the quarterfinals and five-time
champion Graf out of the tournament earlier than at any point since
her first appearance in 1984.
	   Graf, who is trying to come back from reconstructive knee
surgery, committed 33 unforced errors, including many off her
once-fearsome forehand.
	   ``Obviously, I made a lot of mistakes, easy mistakes,'' Graf
said. ``I just never got a rhythm. I couldn't get any depth to my
shots.''
	   Though Graf was seeded eighth, the result was not that much of
an upset. Graf is ranked just 26th in the world while returning
from the knee surgery, and Schnyder is ranked 10th. Graf was seeded
higher at the discretion of tournament officials.
	   The match ended after 59 minutes when Graf hit a service return
long. Graf marched quickly off court, while Schnyder celebrated and
then signed autographs.
	   ``She's the greatest player in the last 10 years. Sometimes it's
difficult because you think of that,'' Schnyder said. ``But you

	   Schnyder, 19, who has won five tournaments this year, broke
Graf's serve for a 3-0 lead and took advantage of 14 unforced
errors by Graf in the first seven games. Graf, who began the match
with tape around her right wrist, removed the tape after falling

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Liz Smith scored in the 42nd minute and Canada
beat Mexico 1-0 win to earn a berth in the 1999 Women's World Cup.
	   The berth is only the second for Canada, which finished 10th in
the 12-team tournament in 1995. Canada becomes the 10th team to
qualify for next year's event, which will be held in the United
States.
	   Canada, which beat Mexico 6-0 in their only other meeting in
1994, controlled the pace of the game Sunday night but could only
manage the one goal. Smith brought the record Centennial Stadium
crowd of 4,971 to its feet after heading a cross from Shannon
Rosenow past goalkeeper Linnea Quinones.
	   Mexico twice came close to tying the game. At the 68-minute
mark, leading scorer Maribel Dominguez fired a shot past goalkeeper
Nicole Wright, but defender Isabelle Morneau booted the ball away,
forcing a corner kick.
	   Then with nine minutes remaining, after Wright was forced to
make a nice deflection of a free kick, Mexico's Regina Oceguera had
a header go off the post.
	   The loss Sunday didn't eliminate Mexico from World Cup
contention. Mexico will meet Argentina in a home-and-home series,
with the winner securing a tournament berth.
	   In the bronze medal game Sunday, Costa Rica defeated Guatemala
4-0.

Angry Congolese businessmen side with rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Victor Ngezayo believed doing business in
Congo would become fair and easy after rebel leader Laurent Kabila
took control of this vast and naturally Rich African nation.
	   He was wrong.
	   In 1997, Kabila signed a deal with Canadian-based Banro
Resources Corp. of Toronto, represented by Ngezayo, which invested
an initial dlrs 340 million in gold mining in eastern Congo.
	   Less than a year later, Kabila scrapped the contract and awarded
the consession to a newly formed Congolese company. Banro is now
suing the Congolese government for dlrs 1 million in damages.
	   ``We couldn't do business under Kabila,'' Ngezayo said in his
lakeside villa where he is waiting an end to a month-old
anti-Kabila rebellion. ``That man didn't respect any laws or any
international conventions.''
	   Rebels and businessmen blame corrupt leaders, lack of democratic
institutions and repeated failures of both longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko and Kabila to ensure a strong business environment and a
broadbased, elected government for the nation of 47 million.
	   One of the richest African countries in gold, diamonds, cobalt
and copper, Congo is limping along at subsistence level. Jobs are
scarce, state-run economic institutions have crumbled and political
upheavals have added to insecurity.
	   An average monthly teacher's salary in Goma is dlrs 15 _ but
nobody has been paid in years and teachers are charging parents for
education.
	   Even as Kabila was ousting Mobutu, international diamond, gold,
copper and cobalt companies rushed to secure deals with the new
leader.
	   Arkansas-based American Mineral Fields, for example, flew Kabila
in its own jet across the country until he finally agreed to give
the company exclusive rights to the copper and cobalt tailings
projects. Tailings, which are waste material from mine operations,
can be refined into finished products.
	   Last year, AMF filed a dlrs 3 billion law suit against its
competitor, South African-based Anglo American, alleging the mining
company offered cash payments to Kabila's government in return for
scrapping its deal with the U.S. company. Anglo has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Disillusioned and angry, Ngezayo has returned to his native
Goma, where he contacted the rebels fighting to oust Kabila and
install a new, democratic government.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of mismanagement,
corruption and nepotism _ everything he promised to eradicate after
he toppled Mobutu in May 1997.
	   On Saturday, the rebels controlling a quarter of the country
sent a delegation to meet with Kabila to negotiate a cease-fire and
the withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo at Zimbabwe's Victoria
Falls.
	   Ngezayo and other Congolese dealers are now waiting to see what
the second rebellion in two years can change.
	   ``Everything's paralyzed. I can't do any business. I can't
travel. I can't reach my employees. And if this persists, it will
be bad for business,'' Ngezayo said. ``Nobody wants to invest in a
war zone.''
	   Apart from gold mining, he also lost control of a chain of
hotels he owned in the government-controlled Congo. Three thousand
of his employees are unpaid, he said.
	   ``This country can function only with right political leaders,''
he said. ``You can't do business violating legal procedures. You
need responsible and accountable authorities.''
	   ``Instead of privatizing, Kabila was nationalizing. He must have
missed the train,'' Ngezayo's colleague, Simba, said.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the rebel leader, accused Kabila of
ruining the little that was left of Congo's economy after it was
pillaged during Mobutu's 32 years in power.
	   ``Mobutu used to take 10 percent of commissions on international
business deals. Kabila is taking 30 percent,'' he said.

Ousted leader's relative arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An adopted brother of Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister has been taken away by police to an
unknown place, the politician said.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired as finance minister and deputy
prime minister last week, said his adopted brother Sukma Dermawan
was detained by police Sunday.
	   ``Four police personnel came and took him away. No communication
so far,'' Anwar said.
	   Police on Monday confirmed the arrest of Sukma, who is a
businessman, but would not say why he was being detained.
	   ``If I am the problem to them then take me, do not harass my
family, my staff or my supporters,'' Anwar said.
	   Despite the latest attempt to intimidate him, Anwar announced
Sunday that he would begin a nationwide campaign this week for
political reform in Malaysia.
	   Anwar had planned to begin the tour Saturday, but postponed it
for security reasons. His supporters said he feared arrest if he
tried to campaign against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Anwar believes his arrest is imminent. Police say they first
want to complete their investigations into charges of sexual
misconduct, abuse of power and leaking state secrets.
	   The allegations against Anwar were made public last week when
police filed affidavits in court.
	   Anwar says the charges are false and part of a ``larger
political conspiracy'' against him to undermine his challenge to
Mahathir.
	   He told his supporters he would begin his nationwide campaign in
his hometown in the northern state of Penang on Wednesday.
	   On Monday, supporters continued their vigil at Anwar's private
residence, which has turned into a hub of political activity since
he was fired.
	   Each day hundreds of activists from human rights groups,
opposition parties and even from the governing United Malays
National Organization visit him to hold meetings.
	   Analysts say that Anwar may face an uphill task garnering
support against Mahathir, who controls the party that has dominated
Malaysian politics since the country gained independence from
Britain in 1957.

Dollar tumbles in Tokyo, stock prices soar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-morning stock, bond and dollar rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped to a four-month low against
the yen Monday after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan hinted
at an interest rate cut to prevent a U.S. recession. Tokyo stocks
soared.
	   The dollar bought 132.46 yen in early trading _ it's lowest
since May 12. The greenback was down 2.95 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and below its late New York level of 133.57 yen on Friday.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average jumped 387.76 points, or 2.76 percent, to 14,430.67 at the
end of morning trading. On Friday, the Nikkei lost 218.33 points,
or 1.53 percent.
	   The U.S. currency remained under selling pressure after Eisuke
Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, told reporters the correction of the yen's excessive
weakness had only just begun.
	   That continued a trend set Friday in New York, where the dollar
dropped after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the U.S.
central bank is prepared to act to keep the U.S. economy from
slipping into recession because of global economic problems.
	   ``There's a feeling in the market that Greenspan is suggesting
the possibility of interest rate cuts,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at the Tokyo branch of
ABN-Amro Bank.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   Japanese stocks surged on reports a compromise may be in the
works between ruling party and opposition lawmakers over banking
reform.
	   A Liberal Democratic Party official was quoted Monday as saying
his party was willing to accept opposition demands for greater
disclosure from banks in a bail out using public funds.
	   A key opposition group, the New Peace Party, has signaled it
will back LDP bills if such disclosure is required.
	   Debate in parliament over the bank bail out bills will continue
Monday. The LDP wants to use public funds to prevent large banks
from failing as it forces the banking sector to finally write off
its massive bad debts.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 18.54 points, or 1.69 percent,
to 1,113.01. The TOPIX closed down 19.30 points, or 1.73 percent,
on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.030 percent from Friday's finish of 1.070 percent,
driving its price up to 112.90 yen from 112.61 yen.

Crew 4, MetroStars 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLEY GILLESPIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Stern John scored his league-leading 20th
goal and the Columbus Crew beat the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
4-3 Sunday.
	   The win puts the Crew (14-12) close to securing home field
advantage in the first round of the Major League Soccer playoffs.
	   John scored in the 35th minute off an indirect kick from 19
yards (17 meters) out. Andy Williams passed the ball to John who
blasted a low shot past MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola to put the
Crew up 2-0. Williams has had an assist in his last seven games, an
MLS record.
	   Giovanni Savarese scored his second goal of the game to make it
4-3 in the 77th minute off an indirect kick just outside the
penalty box. Marcelo Vega lofted a pass to Savarese who fought off
a defender and headed the ball into the net.
	   Columbus' first score was an own goal by MetroStars defender
Mike Duhaney. The Crew scored on the last play of the first half
off a penalty kick by Brian McBride.
	   Eduardo Hurtado made it 2-1 in the 42nd minute from 15 yards (14
meters) out.
	   The MetroStars (14-15), who have lost seven straight road games,
played most of the second half a man short when Mark Semioli was
ejected in the 51st minute. They played the last seven minutes two
men down after Arley Palacios received a red card.
	   Giovanni Savarese, who entered the game in the second half,
scored his first goal in the 54th minute off an assist by Miles
Joseph to make it 3-2.
	   Rob Smith put the Crew up 4-2 in the 67th minute when he
dribbled around a defender and scored on a shot from 21 yards (19
meters) out.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Victor Ngezayo believed doing business in
Congo would become fair and easy after rebel leader Laurent Kabila
took control of this vast and naturally Rich African nation.
	   He was wrong.
	   In 1997, Kabila signed a deal with Canadian-based Banro
Resources Corp. of Toronto, represented by Ngezayo, which invested
an initial dlrs 340 million in gold mining in eastern Congo.
	   Less than a year later, Kabila scrapped the contract and awarded
the concession to a newly formed Congolese company. Banro is now
suing the Congolese government for dlrs 1 million in damages.

UNDATED: six starts.

 &UR; Giants 6, Dodgers 2 &QC;  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Los Angeles, Mark Gardner pitched eight strong innings to win
his fourth straight decision, and Ellis Burks and Jeff Kent drove
in two runs each for San Francisco.
	   With the win, the Giants moved within three games of the Chicago
Cubs in the NL wild-card race, and avoided being swept in a
three-game series at Dodger Stadium for the first time since Sept.
25-27, 1989.
	   The loss snapped a season-high four-game Los Angeles winning
streak.
	   Gardner (12-5) allowed five hits and two runs before being
replaced by Robb Nen at the start of the ninth.
	   The Giants took a 3-0 lead off Brian Bohanon (6-9) in the second
when Burks hit his 21st homer following a leadoff walk to Kent, and
Rey Sanchez added a two-out, RBI single.
	   Kent hit a two-run double in the fifth to extend San Francisco's
lead to 5-2.
 &UR; Astros 10, Diamondbacks 1 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Sean Berry hit a two-run homer and drove in four
runs and Mike Hampton pitched seven shutout innings for Houston.
	   Since the All-Star break, Berry is batting .468 (44-for-94) with
seven home runs and 21 RBIs.
	   Hampton (11-6) gave up seven hits, struck out five and walked
three before he was relieved by Mike Magnante in the eighth.
	   Omar Daal (7-10), in by far his worst performance as a
Diamondback, was rocked for a season-high seven runs and 12 hits in
four-plus innings. He was lifted after giving up two singles and a
double without an out in the fifth.
	   Tony Batista was 3-for-4, including a double, but the
Diamondbacks stranded 11 runners.
	   The Astros, winners of 14 of their last 18 games, had 17 hits,
six of them for extra bases.

	   Squads of military police raced to the house and set up a
security cordon. It was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt in
the attack, which comes amid intensifying tensions between Hun Sen
and the opposition over recent parliamentary elections.
	   Hun Sen was attending talks mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk
with opposition representatives in the northern city of Siem Reap
when the attack occurred. A bodyguard, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was returning to Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen's father was in the house at the time of the attack, the
bodyguard said. Hun Sen himself seldom stays there, preferring his
fortress-like compound, known as the Tiger's Lair, outside the
capital.

National government moves in as Sydney water crisis continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos expected &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The federal government Monday stepped
in to try to minimize the negative impact of Sydney's water
contamination crisis, as senior officials reportedly warned that
the tap water in Australia's largest city won't be safe to drink
for up to six months.
	   Residents and visitors to Sydney have been told not to drink or
otherwise ingest tap water unless it has been boiled for at least
one minute because of contamination by the dangerous microscopic
organisms giardia and cryptosporidium.
	   Testing has shown contamination at wildly fluctuating levels,
and officially the boil water warnings will stay in place for most
of Sydney's 3.7 million residents until Sept. 19.
	   But The Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday that sources
within the utility Sydney Water conceded that water from Sydney's
main water source, the Warrangamba Dam, will remain suspect until
March next year.
	   Prime Minister John Howard, who said Monday the First Family
were drinking boiled or bottled water at their Sydney Harbour home,
offered the New South Wales state government any scientific or
other assistance federal agencies could provide to solve the
crisis.
	   ``It's embarrassing but equally it's a public health development
that could overcome any major city in the world,'' Howard told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson called an emergency meeting of
industry leaders to formulate a strategy to combat the negative
impact on Sydney's international image.
	   ``This is the worst thing that has happened to Sydney's
reputation in living memory,'' Thomson said. ``It has to be fixed
soon. Otherwise there will be real damage inflicted in the long
term.''
	   In a front page editorial Monday, The Sydney Morning Herald said
a safe supply of drinking water for the city can no longer be taken
for granted.
	   ``Two years before Sydney plays host to the world at the 2000
Olympics, there (is) confusion and loss of confidence in this most
basic amenity,'' the newspaper said.
	   ``People from other countries, considering whether to visit
Sydney for the Olympics, must be wondering what kind of a city they
are thinking of coming to.''
	   Outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium in the water were
reported in late July and again last week.
	   The Health Department has reported the level of cryptosporidium
found in water samples was 12 times higher than the levels reported
in an outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993, the worst such outbreak ever
recorded in the United States. The Milwaukee contamination
contributed to the deaths of about 100 people, many with immune
systems already weakened by AIDS or cancer.
	   Other testing periodically turns up minimal levels or no
parasites.
	   There has been no statistical increase in illness during the
Sydney outbreaks.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.

Malaysia names new Central Bank governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The head of Malaysia's powerful
Economic Planning Unit was named the new governor of the country's
central bank Monday, a news report said.
	   Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman will take over from acting Bank Negara
Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who has filled the role since former
Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak, resigned
two weeks ago in opposition to rigid currency controls. Zeti will
stay on as deputy governor.
	   The sweeping curbs, announced last week by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, effectively isolate Malaysia's embattled economy
from the global free-market system. The measures include a fixed
exchange rate and ban trading of Malaysian stocks overseas.
	   Ali, a close confidant of Mahathir, has been chief of the
Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's Department since the
early 1990s and helped formulate Malaysia's wide-ranging
privatization program. His appointment will likely be viewed as
another step toward Mahathir's dominance over the country's
economic and political leadership.
	   Mahathir named himself acting finance minister last week after
he fired Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was also deputy prime
minister. Mahathir blamed Bank Negara's tight monetary policies,
which were backed by Anwar, for pushing the country into its worst
recession in 13 years.
	   Already, benchmark interest rates have fallen to 8 percent from
over 11 percent, a trend that analysts say is likely to continue.

	   The bodyguard said no one was hurt.
	   Mok Chito, one of Phnom Penh's police chiefs, said that two men
were seen riding a motorcycle against traffic in front of the house
and throwing the grenades over the four-meter (12-foot) high gates.
	   They were not apprehended. The house is normally guarded by a
few military police. Reinforcements quickly arrived in the wake of
the attack and sealed off the block and a nearby park.
	   Five more truckloads of military police were seen heading toward
a different park opposite the National Assembly, where a protest
against Hun Sen by thousands of people alleging he won the
elections by fraud entered its third week.

	   The trucks patrolled the area.
	   A third grenade that failed to explode was found about five
meters (15 feet) outside Hun Sen's residence. Ordnance-clearing
experts with metal detectors were sweeping the area for more
explosives.
	   Grenades have frequently been used to wreak carnage in
Cambodia's turbulent politics.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by opposition leader Sam Rainsy at the park opposite the National
Assembly. At least 16 people were killed and more than 100 hurt.
	   The attack was widely blamed on Hun Sen. He denied
responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting
alleged election fraud. One person died.

Graf knocked out by Schnyder, Rios also loses

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Larsson defeating Rios in new 5th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf's comeback collapsed at the U.S.
Open against a Swiss teen-ager who was just 3 when the dominant
women's player of the last decade played her first professional
match.
	   The 6-3, 6-4 loss to Patty Schnyder on Sunday night sent the
11th-seeded Swiss player into the quarterfinals and five-time
champion Graf out of the tournament earlier than at any point since
her first appearance in 1984.
	   Graf, who is trying to regain her form after knee surgery,
committed 33 unforced errors, including many off her once-fearsome
forehand.
	   ``Obviously, I made a lot of mistakes, easy mistakes,'' Graf
said. ``I just never got a rhythm. I couldn't get any depth to my
shots.''
	   Also losing was men's No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, who twice this
year replaced Pete Sampras as the world's top-ranked player for
short periods. Rios lost 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 to Magnus
Larsson, who served his 17th ace on match point.

Report: Murdoch and Manchester United to strike deal this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's satellite television company
BSkyB plans to make a formal offer for soccer giant Manchester
United by the middle of this week, a newspaper owned by the media
magnate reported Monday.
	   The Times reported that negotiations were continuing and that
some of the Premier League soccer club's directors were arguing
that the reported 575 million pound (dlrs 950 million) bid was too
low.
	   According to the Sunday Telegraph, Murdoch has already
negotiated a deal with United chairman Martin Edwards. Edwards, the
paper said, is selling his 14 percent stake in the club for 80
million pounds (dlrs 132 million).
	   BSkyB released a brief statement Sunday confirming negotiations
were taking place between Murdoch and Manchester United, saying the
discussions ``may or may not lead to an offer being made.''
	   The soccer club released a similar statement Sunday, echoing
that talks may or may not lead to an offer.
	   ``Any decision taken by Manchester United will take into account
the interests of shareholders, the club's fans, players and
staff,'' the statement said.
	   Manchester United director Maurice Watkins said a formal
statement would be issued Monday.
	   Monday's Times article reported that talks between BSkyB chief
executive Mark Booth and Edwards have been going on for five months
and that the television company would pay 225 pence (dlrs 3.70) a
share, compared with Friday's closing price of 159 (dlrs 2.60)
pence.
	   Meanwhile, The Financial Times reported Monday that leisure
group Enic, which has extensive interests in European football, was
poised to make a rival bid, encouraged by political concerns over a
deal with Murdoch.
	   Enic has not yet held talks with United, but plans to approach
the club this week, the newspaper said. The group would look to
U.S. entertainment giant Time Warner for financial backing, the
newspaper added.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks said Sunday that a deal with
Murdoch could be subjected to an investigation by the Office of
Fair Trading because of the ``profound'' implications of Murdoch
buying United, one of the world's most famous and wealthiest clubs.
	   ``There are clear implications here that make me feel that this
is not something that can just be treated as if it were just a
normal takeover of one publicly quoted company by another,'' Banks
said.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain with very few live games being shown on regular
terrestrial stations. Sky also has exclusive rights to cover
England's games such as last Saturday's European Championship
qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   The sale of England's richest club, which was floated on the
stock market in 1991, to BSkyB could give the broadcasting company
a stranglehold on the television and marketing rights to Premier
League football so that the only way of seeing the team play would
be through pay-per-view TV.
	   Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty, who has been an
outspoken critic of the way the club has been run while remaining a
fan of the team, said the supporters would never forgive chairman
and chief executive Edwards if he did sell out to Murdoch.
	   ``I don't think (Murdoch) will stop there, I think he might try
to get hold of another couple of top clubs yet,'' he said.
``Everything will be geared toward television, there will be no
fans sitting in the stands.''
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.
