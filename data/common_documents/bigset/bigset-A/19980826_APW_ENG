Telstra posts net profit of 3 billion Australian dollars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Telecommunications giant Telstra
Corp. Ltd. on Wednesday posted an Australian record annual net
profit of 3 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.74 billion) for
1997-98.
	   Telstra's net earnings were up 85 percent from the 1.62 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 939 million) posted in the previous
year and exceeded its prospectus forecasts.
	   Sales revenue for the year rose to 16.8 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 9.74 billion).
	   ``Currently Telstra is relatively insulated from the Asian
economic downturn, with no significant exposure,'' Telstra said in
a statement.
	   ``If the Asian problems reduce growth in the Australian economy
this would have an impact on Telstra's operations, although still a
lesser impact than on the Australian economy in general,'' it said.
	   Telstra's net profit is the highest recorded by a listed
Australian company, topping National Australia Bank Ltd.'s 2.22
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.28 billion) in the fiscal
year ended Sep. 30, 1997.

Foreigners, Thais married to foreigners, may get more land rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's ruling coalition is gearing
up for a parliamentary battle over granting greater land leasing
rights to foreigners and allowing Thais married to foreigners to
own land.
	   The controversial proposals, contained in the Ministry of
Finance's fifth letter of intent to the International Monetary
Fund, have been approved by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, a government press release said Wednesday.
	   The IMF is supervising a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the
troubled Thai economy.
	   Under the Ministry of Finance proposals, the maximum period of
time foreigners would be allowed to lease land in Thailand would be
increased from 30 years to 50 years with an option to renew for
another 50 years.
	   Also, Thais married to foreigners would be entitled to own land,
something prohibited under current law and a sore point among many
Thai-foreign couples.
	   Land rights are a complex and serious issue in Thailand. Many
Thais feel they have been cheated out of rightful ownership of land
by local officials and wealthy families in their areas.
	   Protests over land rights are common.
	   Thailand's opposition is expected to fight against the Ministry
of Finance proposals in Parliament. The ministry has promised the
IMF that the proposals will be passed into law by October.
	   ``We need to do it because we have plenty of unsold property and
the sector's problems are seriously affecting our economy,'' Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi was quoted as saying in
Wednesday's The Nation newspaper.
	   A real estate glut caused many developers to default on loans,
undermining the stability of the financial system and helping to
trigger Thailand's economic crisis.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Broken glass and blood covered a
Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town after a bomb explosion
inside killed one person and injured 24.
	   A man claiming responsibility for Tuesday's blast said it was
revenge for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
according to Marianne Merten, a journalist at the station. A
spokesman for the group, Mogammat Achmat, in comments to South
African Broadcasting Corp., denied his group was involved.
	   Police refused to comment on the call.
	   In Washington, the State Department said the group was
anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. It was unknown to the department's
counter-terrorism office until it staged a demonstration at the
vacant Israeli diplomatic office in Cape Town in July 1997,
officials said. The marchers shouted angry slogans aimed at Israel.
	   Some members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S.
policies on Iraq and Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Cape Town in March.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside Planet Hollywood as it was packed with
diners. He confirmed one woman was killed. Her nationality and
those of the injured were not immediately known.
	   The bar, covered in blood, bore the main brunt of the blast. The
walls cracked and the windows shattered.
	   Police said part of the ceiling lifted off the restaurant and
then fell back into place.
	   A glass booth holding a mannequin of movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger was shattered at the entrance.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
Hollywood-theme restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   Roger Sedres, a local photographer, said he heard the explosion
as he drove past the restaurant, then saw the wounded come
streaming out.
	   Rescue workers brought out a woman who was motionless, her legs
mangled.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing rushed to the scene.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, the franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   However, there was speculation that an attack on a target
identified with the United States could be a sequel to the bombings
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people on Aug. 7 _ or an answer to America's retaliatory
cruise-missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   A spokesman for Planet Hollywood, which is based in Orlando,
Florida, said the company was attempting to gather information from
local authorities.
	   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to all the injured and their
families,'' said Matt Hallman, director of national public
relations.

Report: Seamen suffer increasing abuse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Seafarers throughout the world are
facing increasing abuse from their officers and ship owners,
according to a new report released Wednesday.
	   The Australian parliamentary committee's report, called ``Ship
Safe,'' says these problems are being ``buttressed by a climate of
fear, intimidation and economic desperation.''
	   The report also notes the incidence of piracy throughout the
world is increasing sharply, adding that 51 seamen died at the
hands of pirates last year.
	   The committee said the Asian economic crisis is already
tightening its stranglehold on ship owners.
	   Paul Neville, the conservative politician who headed the
committee, said he and his colleagues had been appalled by the
callous treatment of some seafarers.
	   The report notes two particularly bad examples:
	   In one, an Indonesian seaman, Santoso Budi, who was beaten with
an iron bar, died from his injuries after he jumped off the MV
Glory Cape, a Panamanian flagged vessel that was sailing off the
West Australian coast near Port Hedland in November 1995.
	   Several crew mates, who jumped with him to escape a similar
fate, were rescued after they had spent five hours in the water.
	   The crew later mounted a civil case against the ship's owners,
only to find they had disappeared behind a thick corporate veil
and, in legal terms, no longer existed.
	   In the second case, a seaman's hand was crushed for five minutes
by a hot iron.
	   ``The captain refused an offer to airlift the seafarer to
medical treatment,'' the report says.
	   The captain also refused a request by port authorities to berth
ahead of schedule so that the man could be treated.
	   The injured seaman later had four fingers amputated.
	   The report noted fierce competition in the world's shipping
industry, saying charter rates are already at an all-time low and
the Asian crisis possibly signaling that they will fall even
further.
	   ``Along with other commercial constraints, low charter rates and
freight rates add to pressure for ship owners to cut costs,'' the
report said.
	   Other abuses noted in submissions to the committee include:
	   _Six out of every 10 New Zealand seamen work more than 12 hours
a day.
	   _Forty-three percent of Indonesian seamen are forced to pay a
fee to get their jobs, a clear contravention of International Labor
Organization rules.
	   _Two-thirds of all seamen on Russian flagged vessels are being
denied back-pay that they have earned.
	   _Almost 40 percent of South American and Caribbean seaman
suffered physical abuse. So did almost 28 percent of seafarers on
Rumanian flagged ships and 23 percent of seamen on German flagged
vessels.
	   _The levels of mental abuse were highest on North American and
Russian vessels, at 35 and 36 percent respectively.
	   _British seafarers suffer the highest number of accidents on
ships at sea, with 22 percent reporting at least one accident in
the previous year, twice the international average.
	   _More than 40 percent of Filipino and Indonesian seafarers
suffered racial abuse.
	   These abuses were recorded in a survey of seafarers' living
conditions, conducted for the International Transport Workers
Federation.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens struck out 18 and won his 11th
straight decision as he pitched Toronto to 3-0 victory over Kansas
City on Tuesday night.
	   Clemens, who has struck out 20 in a nine-inning game twice and
shares the record with Chicago Cubs rookie Kerry Wood, had 14
strikeouts in the first seven innings.
	   It was the 89th double-digit strikeout game of Clemens' career.
He allowed three hits and walked none while improving his record to
16-6.
	   Clemens, who hasn't lost since May 29, matched San Diego's Kevin
Brown for the major-league high winning streak this season. It was
Clemens' second shutout of the season _ both accomplished in his
last two starts _ and 43rd of his career.
	   The Blue Jays took a 1-0 lead in the first when Kansas City
starter Chris Haney (5-6) walked Jose Cruz Jr. with the bases
loaded. Craig Grebeck hit a two-run single in the seventh to make
it 3-0.
 &UR; Red Sox 3, Athletics 2 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Darren Lewis hit a tie-breaking home run leading off
the seventh inning and Nomar Garciaparra went 4-for-4 as Boston
beat Oakland.
	   Garciaparra, who went 0-for-5 in his previous game Sunday,
singled in his first three at-bats before doubling in the seventh
to equal his career-high hit game, accomplished four times during
his 1997 AL Rookie of the Year season.
	   The win was Boston's eighth in nine games against the Athletics
this season. Mike Blowers had a solo homer for Oakland, which
suffered only its second loss in eight games.
 &UR; Indians 10, Mariners 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez was 4-for-4 with his 31st homer and
five RBIs as Cleveland defeated Seattle.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL with 44 homers, was 1-for-4
with a single and a walk, failing to homer for the first time in
three games.
	   Ramirez singled, doubled twice and hit a 432-foot (132-meter)
homer, missing only a triple in his bid to become the first
Cleveland player in 20 years to hit for the cycle.
	   The Indians won for the sixth time in nine games and scored
seven runs with two outs.
 &UR; Twins 4, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Frankie Rodriguez, starting because
Minnesota traded Mike Morgan earlier in the day, pitched 7 2-3
shutout innings to lead the Twins over Tampa Bay.
	   Rodriguez (4-2), who had been scheduled for long relief since
beating the Yankees last week, allowed five hits, struck out eight
and walked two. He was pressed into action after Morgan was sent to
the Chicago Cubs for cash and a player to be named.
	   Pat Meares hit a solo homer in the fifth off Rolando Arrojo
(11-11), and David Ortiz and Marty Cordova hit solo shots in the
sixth.
 &UR; White Sox 6, Orioles 4 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Frank Thomas and Albert Belle homered in the same
game for the seventh time this season, and Chicago beat Baltimore
to stop a six-game losing streak.
	   Mike Mussina (12-7) lost for only the second time in 10 starts
since the All-Star break as the Orioles dropped nine games behind
Boston in the AL wild-card race.
	   Baltimore, which has the best record in baseball since the break
at 31-12, lost for the fifth time in its last 13 games.

Rios knocked out in opening round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: INSERTS new 8th graf with Ivanisevic upset. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil won a South
American showdown, upsetting Marcelos Rios of Chile 6-3, 7-6 (7-4)
in the opening round of the Hamlet Cup.
	   Rios, the tournament's top seed, lost his second match in as
many days. He lost his ranking as the top-ranked player in the
world on Monday.
	   Rios has lost three of his last four matches since parting with
Larry Stefanki, his coach.
	   Rios was ranked No. 1 for six weeks earlier this year.
	   Kuerten said he was looking forward to playing Rios.
	   ``People asked me if I was disappointed that I drew him in the
first round,'' Kuerten said Tuesday, ``but I really wanted him. The
talent on this level is very high and you should want to play the
great players. That's why we're out here.''
	   Rios said he was ``bothered by an allergy and my entire body is
weak. Maybe I need a rest to get ready for the U.S. Open.''
	   In another upset, Hicham Arazi of Morocco beat seventh-seeded
Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   The tournament's No. 2 seed, Patrick Rafter of Australia,
flirted with defeat as well Tuesday. Rafter, one of the hottest
players on the ATP Tour over the last 10 weeks, broke Javier
Sanchez's serve in the final game of a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over
the Spaniard.
	   Rafter, who returned from a weekend break in Bermuda after his
career-best 11-match winning streak was snapped by Guillaume Raoux
last week, used a strong backhand to overtake Sanchez, who is
ranked 101st, for the decisive point.
	   The Australian, the third-ranked player in the world, returned
serve with his backhand and the ball hit the top of the net and
flew past Sanchez. It was the second such point in the set and
third in the match that he won in like manner.
	   Rafter, 25, is 22-3 with three tournament titles over the last
10 weeks, with five matches won over top 10 opponents, including
Pete Sampras.
	   Rafter, who had seven aces to four for Sanchez, has a 41-16
match record this year with four championships.
	   ``I hit the ball well in the first set but was very flat in the
second,'' Rafter said. ``I felt there was no use pushing myself, so
I went through the motions determined that I could get a second win
in the third set.
	   ``That's what happened. This is the quickest court I have played
on all summer, but I'll get adjusted to it once I get match sharp.
I hadn't played a match since New Haven and just got away from
tennis while in Bermuda.
	   ``My mistake was letting Sanchez back into the match. He got
stronger as we went along. There was one point in the match when I
wondered if I could get back, but make no mistake about it ... the
energy is back. I want to go all the way here and be even better in
the U.S. Open.''
	   Felix Mantilla, another Spaniard who is seeded eighth,
eliminated countryman Sergi Bruguera 6-4, 6-4 and Felix Dewulf of
Belgium outlasted doubles standout Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4
(7-6 (8-6). Woodforde smashed his racket in frustration.
	   ``I wasn't proud of that,'' he said. ``Losing this match ticked
me off. Not once did I come close to breaking serve. Smashing the
racket isn't going to make me win, good tennis will. I want to stay
in singles until 2000 and be in the Olympics since they are in our
country.''

Prosecutors links politicians to kidnappings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) _ A prosecutor in the central Mexican
state of Morelos has asked the legislature in a neighboring state
to lift the immunity of three elected officials suspected in three
kidnappings in 1996.
	   State attorney general Arturo Estrada Carrillo said Tuesday that
a judge had issued arrest warrants against the three officials from
Guerrero state, but they can't be served because of the immunity.
	   The politicians were identified as Mario Navarrete Gutierrez, a
Guerrero state legislator, of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party; Humberto Zapata Anorve, mayor of the
municipality of Ometepec, of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party; and Andres Manzano Anorve, mayor of
Cuajunicuilapa, of the Democratic Revolution Party.
	   The three politicians are accused of being part of a kidnapping
band called ``Los Militares,'' or ``The Soldiers,'' that included
police and government officials, Estrada Carrillo said.
	   Morelos is one of the states most plagued by kidnappings and
officials have been accused of protecting some kidnap rings. In
January, the former chief of the state anti-kidnapping unit,
Armando Martinez Salgado, was arrested after he was caught in
Guerrero trying to dump the body of a suspected kidnapper who died
in custody. Revelations of misconduct following his arrest
eventually led to the resignation of Gov. Jorge Carrillo Olea.

Protesters defy Cambodian authorities, refuse to relocate

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leaders said
Wednesday their followers were willing to brave bullets and
grenades as thousands defied government demands to move their
protest against alleged election fraud away from parliament.
	   More than 5,000 demonstrators entered the third day of a sit-in
in a park across the street from the National Assembly, demanding
that Cambodian leader Hun Sen step down from power.
	   The park was the scene of a grenade attack against an opposition
protest last year that killed 16 people and wounded more than a
hundred.
	   The decision not to move followed a United Nations-brokered
midnight meeting between Interior Ministry officials and opposition
leaders. The meeting apparently averted a police crackdown against
the protesters planned for the early hours of Wednesday morning.
	   Interior Ministry official Prum Sokha said after the meeting
that the round-the-clock vigil against election fraud, which has
been called ``illegal'' by the government, could continue but at a
more discreet site.
	   He suggested the Olympic Stadium, in a western Phnom Penh
suburb.
	   But Tuesday morning, opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy visited the protesters in their tent city across
from the National Assembly to ask if they were willing to move.
	   ``No!'' the crowd boomed back.
	   Ranariddh, sitting beside Rainsy on a woven mat under a
blue-tarp tent, said, ``We have to respect the will of the
people.''
	   The two opposition leaders said the protest will continue until
allegations of widespread irregularities in last month's
parliamentary elections are addressed.
	   They said demonstrators are willing to brave bullets and
grenades to fight for democracy.
	   Their defiance heightened concerns of renewed bloodshed.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of the grenade attack in
March of last year. The perpetrators have never been caught, but
Sam Rainsy has accused Hun Sen of orchestrating the attack. Hun Sen
fervently denies the charges.
	   On Tuesday, Sam Rainsy's party requested the U.N. send on-site
monitors for him and other opposition politicians, saying they had
received reports that elements within the government were planning
to kill him.
	   In July 1997, Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a
violent coup. As many as 100 of the prince's loyalists were killed
in the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections, held July 26, to win back
legitimacy and aid lost after his violent takeover.
	   Hun Sen's ruling party won 64 of the 122 seats in the National
Assembly in the polls, short of the two-thirds majority needed to
form a government. Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
party together won 58 seats.
	   Opposition parties have accused Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party of perpetuating widespread fraud in the balloting and
counting process.
	   They have threatened to block the formation of a new government
and repeated calls Wednesday for a new election.
	   Ranariddh also said his party would not form a coalition with
the Hun Sen's party unless Hun Sen is forced to step down.
	   Meanwhile, Ranariddh and Rainsy said that they have named the
park in front of the parliament ``Democracy Square'' to commemorate
those who died there last year.
	   ``We dedicate the site to the souls of the heroes who sacrificed
their lives for independence, justice and democracy in Cambodia,''
Ranariddh said, drawing loud cheers.

Cuban exiles charge crackdown on alleged assassins helps Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ The most influential Cuban exile group
says the U.S. indictment of seven Cuban-Americans for plotting to
kill Fidel Castro _ as the CIA itself once did _ is part of a
global trend to rehabilitate the dictator.
	   Tuesday's indictment, which included charges against a director
of the Cuban American National Foundation, comes as Castro is being
wooed by neighbors amid mounting global opposition to Washington's
policy of isolating the communist island.
	   Despite numerous plots to kill Castro since he took over Cuba in
1959, the indictment was believed to be a first.
	   Among those charged was Jose Antonio Llama, a Miami businessman
and director of the foundation, which Castro has long accused of
trying to kill him.
	   The FBI had questioned foundation president Francisco ``Pepe''
Hernandez because he owned one of two assault rifles found with the
suspected assassins. Hernandez was not indicted.
	   The charges handed up Tuesday say Llama obtained Hernandez's gun
and admitted owning the 46-foot (14-meter) yacht La Esperanza,
which allegedly was to sail a team of would-be assassins to
Venezuela's Margarita Island to shoot Castro during a regional
summit last November.
	   The U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory,
refused to discuss the indictments Tuesday, and in an unusual move
referred all queries to Washington D.C.
	   Castro, once feared in the Caribbean, has recently been a
welcome guest of countries throughout the region. Last weekend he
attended a Caribbean summit for the first time, projecting benign
authority and lecturing against U.S. domination. Security was
especially tight amid rumors of assassination plots involving Cuban
exiles.
	   Opposition to Washington's 37-year boycott of Cuba now stretches
from Europe to the Caribbean, whose leaders say that Castro should
be engaged instead of shunned.
	   The Cuban foundation suggested the indictment would help
Castro's effort to discredit it.
	   One Cuba watcher, University of Florida Prof. Damian Fernandez,
predicted many, ``including congressmen,'' would indeed distance
themselves from the foundation.
	   It is the latest in a series of blows to what is one of the best
organized and powerful U.S. lobbies.
	   The foundation's powerful chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, died last
November.
	   The organization was also weakened by militant Luis Carriles
Posada's recent claim to the New York Times that Mas and his group
financially supported hotel bombings in Havana. The foundation
denied it and Posada retracted the claim.
	   The episode began with an Oct. 27 distress call to the U.S.
Coast Guard from La Esperanza, in international waters off Puerto
Rico. Officers boarded the boat and became suspicious when one
passenger said they were returning to Miami and another spoke of
going on a fishing trip to St. Lucia, according to an initial
complaint.
	   The officers uncovered two sniper rifles, 70 rounds of
ammunition and other equipment including night-vision goggles,
radios and Global Positioning Units, customs spokeswoman Awilda
Pereira said.
	   One passenger, Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, blurted out that he
alone had smuggled the weapons aboard to kill Castro on Margarita
Island, the complaint said.
	   Alfonso was indicted Tuesday with the three other passengers _
Angel Hernandez Rojo, 65, Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco
Secundino Cordova, 51. Also indicted were Jose Rodriguez, 59, and
Alfredo Domingo Otero, 68.
	   The Miami-based Cuban foundation on Tuesday protested Llama's
innocence and reiterated that ``violence is not the answer to the
Cuban crisis.'' It alleged the indictment carried ``politically
motivated allegations ... wholly without merit.''
	   ``Not coincidentally,'' the statement said, without elaborating,
``all this occurs in the midst of an unprecedented and
well-financed assault on U.S.-Cuba policy in Washington.''
	   The indictments stood in dramatic contrast to one-time U.S.
policy. In the mid-1970s, a Senate committee documented eight
instances of U.S. agencies attempting to assassinate Castro.
	   An executive order since banned government-sponsored
assassinations in foreign countries.

<TEXT>
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds and Ellis Burks homered as the
Giants overcame Mike Piazza's three-run homer in the first.
	   San Francisco won its fourth straight and pulled within a game
of New York in the NL wild-card race as the Mets, starting a
nine-game West Coast trip, lost their third consecutive game.
	   Russ Ortiz (2-3), whose two major league wins are over the Mets,
gave up six hits in seven innings and struck out eight and walked
one. Rick Reed (15-8) was the loser.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Expos 3
	   In Los Angeles, Dave Mlicki (7-6) allowed two runs and seven
hits in 6 1-3 innings, and Eric Karros's sacrifice fly broke a 1-1
tie in the sixth.
	   Jeff Shaw got his 38th save as the Dodgers stopped a three-game
losing streak. Montreal has lost six straight and 13 of 15.
	   Mike Thurman (2-3) allowed four hits and three runs in 5 2-3
innings.
 &UR; Pirates 9, Diamondbacks 6
	   In Phoenix, Freddy Garcia hit a three-run homer and Sean

straight, its best streak since an 11-gamer from Sept. 12-22, 1996.
The win was the 400th for Pirates manager Gene Lamont.
	   Lawrence, a 27-year-old left-hander brought up from the minors
on Monday, allowed two runs and four hits in five innings. Rich
Loiselle pitched the ninth for his 16th save. Clint Sodowsky (2-5)
was the loser.

Myanmar's main pagoda closed amid rumors of protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The most sacred pagoda in Myanmar was
closed Wednesday morning amid rumors opposition groups were
planning a lightning protest at the site.
	   Shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, a dazzling,
bell-shaped, gold-encrusted Buddhist shrine, were told by the
pagodas's board of trustees at about 9 a.m. to shut down.
	   Shopkeepers said, however, that they heard a group of
pro-democracy protesters was coming to the pagoda.
	   The first street protest against military rule in nearly two
year erupted Monday in Yangon as about 200 students spilled into
the streets near Yangon University.
	   They were supporting a demand by the opposition National League
for Democracy that the military government convene the parliament
elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military refused to honor the result. The NLD said recently it
would convene parliament on its own, prompting the military to warn
that its leaders would be arrested and the party declared illegal.
	   The NLD, led by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi,
has not retracted its statement saying it will convene parliament.
	   Suu Kyi spent Wednesday recovering from kidney problems,
dizziness, low blood pressure and urinary tract problems she
suffered while staging a protest against the military's
restrictions on her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues spent 13 days living in a van on a
bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital. They were
stopped there by the authorities for the fourth time in two months
while attempting to reach the city of Bassein to meet NLD members.
	   She ended her protest Monday after her party pleaded with her to
conserve her health.
	   The military government said she visited the site of the student
protest, which had already been broken up by police, on her way
back home.
	   No one was arrested during the protest. Rumors have been
circulating in Yangon and Bangkok that more demonstrations will
take place in Myanmar's capital.
	   The shop keepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda sell items for worship
in their stalls which line the long stairways to the pagoda's upper
platform.
	   The said the pagoda's trustees told them the shrine was being
closed for a major cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said that the pagoda had never been closed for a
cleaning, which is done each day by volunteers while it remains
open.
	   It has even remained open during major renovation work and
visits by leaders of the military government, who are extremely
security conscious.

China's Jiang orders massive mobilization on Yangtze floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Under a ``do-or-die'' order from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, 178,000 soldiers and police guarded
flood-weakened dikes Wednesday as the Yangtze River roared toward
key industrial centers and rich farmland.
	   Soldiers, flashlights in hand, combed levees overnight looking
for cracks opened by 60 days or more of record high waters. Near
Yueyang, a city of 5 million, surging waters undermined dikes,
collapsing their earthen walls, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   While the Yangtze swelled for the seventh time this summer, the
government appealed for tents, quilts and warm clothing for a
million people made homeless by flooding in the northeast.
	   With the first frost of the bitterly cold winter two weeks away,
those living in makeshift lean-tos are already shivering through
chilly nights, the China Daily reported.
	   In a further sign of the government's reluctance to release bad
news, its top spokesman, Zhao Qizheng, refused Tuesday to divulge
the death toll. But he did not expect deaths to exceed 4,000 _
nearly double the three-week-old official figure of more than
2,000.
	   Flooding along the Yangtze and in the northeast has been
described as the worst in at least 44 years. The disaster has laid
bare the environmental ravages of ill-conceived communist central
planning and more recent decades of breakneck economic growth.
	   In its wake, the government has belatedly banned logging on the
severely deforested hills along the upper Yangtze and suggested
buying back farmland on flood plains.
	   Unnamed Ministry of Water Resources officials complained that
funding for flood control has lagged behind other infrastructure
investment throughout the 1990s, the China Daily said. The lack of
money means many of dikes were badly built.
	   Government officials have also used the calamity to renew
campaigns against corruption and bureaucratic mismanagement. Five
officials from inundated Lindian county in the northeast were
disciplined for leaving the disaster scene to play mah-jongg for
more than four hours, the state-run Legal Daily reported.
	   The Yangtze's seventh flood crest moved through Shashi city and
began swelling waters 180 kilometers (100 miles) downstream in
Yueyang.
	   President Jiang, head of the Communist Party commission that
oversees the military, instructed Gen. Zhang Wannian to put all
forces along the Yangtze on alert late Tuesday. State media
described the command as a ``do-or-die order for the troops to
safeguard the dikes.''
	   Jiang demanded particular vigilance near Honghu Lake. Its dikes
were the weakest on the whole river, and a collapse would threaten
the lives and property of 8 million people living on the rich flood
plain near the industrial city of Wuhan, the People's Daily
reported.
	   China Central Television showed soldiers patrolling the dikes
during the night, while others slept on mats nearby. Piles of
sandbags stood nearby to plug leaks.
	   Near Yueyang, just upstream from Honghu, soldiers and farmers
poured stones and gravel into the breached dike; another 2,000 tons
of stones and dirt and 500,000 sacks were shipped into the area
just in case, Xinhua said.
	   In the northeast, as flood waters receded, officials turned to
rebuilding. Next week's start of the school year has been delayed
for 70,000 students in Inner Mongolia until classrooms can be
prepared, the China Daily said.
	   The rail line between Harbin, a provincial capital, and
Manzhouli on the Russian border was repaired Wednesday two weeks
after being washed away, Xinhua said.
	   To house the homeless, factories were clearing out warehouses
and the government was hoping to get flood-free villages to take in
flooded-out fellow farmers, the China Daily reported.
	   More than 320 doctors have been sent to northeast flood areas to
treat the sick and prevent the outbreak of epidemics, the newspaper
said.

Irish president to visit Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese will be
in Australia next week on her first state visit since her election
last November.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said he was honored she had chosen
Australia as her destination.
	   ``The visit provides an excellent opportunity to celebrate the
longstanding relationship between our two countries,'' Howard said.
	   McAleese will visit Perth, Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra
and Brisbane between Aug. 31 and Sept. 10.
	   Howard said Irish emigration had helped shape Australian
society.
	   ``About one in three Australians can claim Irish ancestry,'' he
said.
	   ``The Irish influence on Australian society is profound and can
be found in areas as diverse as politics, religion, education,
sport, the judiciary and the arts.
	   ``These strong historical ties have laid a solid foundation for
our modern relationship,'' he said.

markets, said SatLink Asia was developed to meet the increasing
demands of multinationals and large regional corporates for
reliable telecommunications services in Asia.
	   ``SatLink offers them connectivity into remote areas where
infrastructure is poor or service is unavailable.
	   ``By providing a reliable, resilient and highly secure solution,
SatLink Asia is a real and attractive alternative to current
communications available in the region.''

Unions, church, industry unite against populist One Nation party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's top union, church,
welfare and industry groups on Wednesday issued a combined
statement condemning Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One
Nation party as a threat to the economy.
	   One Nation policies ``threaten both our internal cohesion and
our international reputation,'' it said. ``They should be
decisively repudiated by all Australians.''
	   Signed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Australian
Council of Social Service, leaders of the Roman Catholic, Anglican
and Jewish religions, as well as the Business Council of Australia,
it called One Nation policies shallow.
	   One Nation seeks to freeze Asian immigration, abolish welfare
programs intended to help Aborigines, raise tariffs and use
subsidies to preserve declining rural industries and jobs, and
repeal Australia's stringent new gun control laws.
	   ``The statements, attitudes, and polices of the One Nation Party
-- including their opposition to an enhanced national immigration
program -- simply do not recognize the economic realities of our
nation,'' the statement said.
	   ``They threaten Australian jobs by undercutting the growth that
flows from an open economy.''
	   The statement described Asia as ``fundamentally important'' to
the economic health of Australia and warned against adopting
policies that would sour relationships with Asian countries.
	   ``We Australians should be proud of the way in which over time
migrants have transformed, strengthened, and enriched our nation
economically, socially, and culturally,'' it said.
	   Hanson, an independent federal member of Parliament from
Queensland, founded the One Nation party last year. It went on to
win 23 percent of the vote and 11 parliamentary seats in
Queensland's state election in June, but is out of government in
the state since the Labor Party won a majority of seats.
	   One Nation is drawing rural conservatives away from the National
Party, the junior member of Prime Minister John Howard's governing
conservative coalition, as Howard prepares to call a national
election.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _Indian and Bangladeshi border guards
exchanged gunfire in a northern region in a dispute over repairing
a wall in a neutral zone, killing two persons and injuring 25
others, an official said Wednesday.
	   The five-hour shootout Tuesday at Dinajpur, a town 275
kilometers (170 miles) north of the capital Dhaka, left one
Bangladesh guard dead and a 7-year-old Bangladesh girl, said Azizur
Rahman, a local government administrator.
	   Construction is banned in the neutral no-man zone separating the
countries.
	   Bangladesh soldiers and civilians objected when some 1,000
Indian workers backed by heavily armed soldiers began repairing a
wall near the Hill Railroad station, Rahman said.
	   Twenty-five people were hospitalized in critical condition, said
Imar Ahmed, a doctor.
	   It was not immediately clear if any Indian soldiers or civilians
were killed or injured. The Indian government did not immediately
comment on the firing.

Dollar little changed, Tokyo stock prices drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar recouped earlier losses against the
yen Wednesday and Tokyo stocks fell on concerns political wrangling
will delay a long-awaited clean up of Japan's bad-loan-plagued
banking system.
	   The dollar bought 144.69 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.07 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
144.21 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
dropped 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent, to close at 14,866.03. On
Tuesday, the average finished up 84.57 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   Debate on a series of bills aimed at forcing banks to deal with
their bad loan problems came to a halt Wednesday after opposition
parties boycotted a key committee meeting.
	   Opposition lawmakers and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are
at loggerheads over how to end the nation's banking woes. While the
LDP supports the use of public money to clean up the system,
opposition parties have branded it a bailout at taxpayers' expense.
	   ``There seems to be no clear vision over how to clear up the
banking mess,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Concerns about the fate of the banking bills also dragged down
Tokyo stock prices.
	   ``Fear that steps to stabilize the banking system will be
delayed is hurting the market's mood,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,147.21.
The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.110 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.125 percent,
driving its price up to 112.36 yen from 112.26 yen.

Korea's jobless rate hits 32-year high of 7.6 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's soaring unemployment
rate hit a 32-year high of 7.6 percent in July, with 1.65 million
people out of work, the government said Wednesday.
	   The unemployment rate will continue to rise, reaching 8 percent
by year's end, analysts predicted. That would mean more than 2
million people out of jobs, a level which could create serious
social instability.
	   ``The jobless rate is rising very rapidly _ and very
dangerously,'' said Oh Su-won, a researcher at Dongwon Securities
and Investment Co.
	   The Office of National Statistics said July's jobless rate of
7.6 percent was up from 7 percent in June, 6.9 percent in May and
6.7 percent in April.
	   The July jobless rate was the highest since 1966 when it was 8.4
percent.
	   Thousands of South Korean companies have collapsed since the
country called in the International Monetary Fund in December to
bail out its battered economy.
	   Analysts said the economy is expected to continue to shrink at
least until the first half of next year.
	   Finance and Economy Minister Lee Kyu-sung predicted in a report
to the National Assembly Tuesday that South Korea's economy would
contract by up to 6 percent this year, one percentage point lower
than he had previously forecast.

Thai police capture hostage taker in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As crowds of stunned office workers
looked on, Thai police Wednesday captured a man who took a hostage
at gunpoint on Bangkok's main commercial avenue demanding he be
flown to neighboring Myanmar.
	   The man, who has yet to be identified, held police at bay for
half an hour as he inched along shop fronts with his left arm
locked around his male hostage's neck and pointing a hand gun at
police.
	   As he extended his arm to point the gun at another approaching
policeman, the hostage quickly raised his fists and knocked the
man's arm down, causing the gun to fire as it flew out of the
perpetrator's hand.
	   Police then jumped the man and subdued him.
	   ``I was scared for my life,'' said Col. Padej Talavong, who
negotiated with the man for 30 minutes and was the first to grab
him.
	   Padej said the hostage taker had so far given them three
different names. He had only a fake identification card on him,
police said.
	   They believed he was a Chinese national by the name of Wung
Ming, possibly a member of a criminal gang, and appeared to be
drunk or drugged.
	   ``This is a big problem for Thailand _ foreign gangsters
operating in Bangkok,'' Padej said.
	   He said the man never said why he wanted to go to Myanmar.
Escaped drug suspects have in the past fled to Thailand's western
neighbor.
	   Police identified the victim as Kaew Sae-Lee, and said he was
also a Chinese national who had Thai residency and lived in the
northern city of Chiang Rai.
	   They said they suspected he is a former gangster and may be
involved in possible criminal activities with the hostage taker.

Chernomyrdin tries to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors on Wednesday after they saw their investments
plunge in value under a drastic plan to restructure Russia's
enormous debts.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on restructuring the
country's dlrs 40 billion, short-term debt market, a day after
terms of the plan were revealed. The terms announced late Tuesday
confirmed creditors' fears that they would sustain heavy losses.
	   Investors whose bonds have matured will have the option of
trading them either for long-term, dollar-denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   Even as he pledged to try to limit the damage to investors,
Chernomyrdin was careful to dissociate himself from the
restructuring decision.
	   ``I would like people to understand us correctly: This decision
was predetermined. In actual fact, our task was only to formulate
it, and we could not do otherwise,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Our top priority now, my personal task, is to soften its
negative influence on stock markets and investors.''
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the restructuring _
receiving just 17 cents for every dollar they invested, according
to some analysts _ will discourage many from returning any time
soon.
	   Russia will feel the loss of foreign investment keenly. Some
analysts predict the country will be shut out of international
commercial borrowing for several years.
	   Chernomyrdin said he was ``extremely dissatisfied'' with the
Central Bank's activity over the past two days and announced he
would discuss his concern with bank chairman Sergei Dubinin.
	   The ruble plummeted 9.2 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years _ in spite of heavy
intervention by the Central Bank. The currency closed at 7.86 to
the dollar, or 12.72 cents, down from 7.14 or 14.01 cents on
Monday.
	   ``Financial and banking policy is an issue I'm attending to
every minute,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to ITAR-Tass. ``I'm
going to talk seriously with Sergei Dubinin today about the
inactivity of the main financial institution in the serious
economic situation.''
	   Chernomyrdin told the news agency that he would take urgent
action to get in the fall harvest, prepare the nation for winter,
pay teachers, military personnel doctors and other state-financed
workers, and aid various regions of the country that have suffered
from fires and flooding this year.
	   He said all these issues would be on the agenda of his meetings
with regional leaders, including Krasnoyarsk Governor and
presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed, later in the day.
	   ``There is nothing more important than these questions,''
Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying. ``I'm counting on the
professionalism, decency and responsibility of those who work in
the government and in the regions.''

Sydney wakes up to another water contamination scare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Olympic organizers, ``Third World''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For the second time in a month, Sydney
residents Wednesday awoke to warnings that the tap water in the
city that will host the 2000 Olympics is unfit to drink.
	   In a city that considers itself one of the world's most modern,
water fountains in school playgrounds were shut down and signs put
up in office blocks warning people not to drink the water unless it
had been boiled for at least one minute.
	   The warning has incensed residents, who were told after a
similar scare in July that problems in the water system had been
fixed.
	   ``It's a bloody horror at the moment that you can't drink the
water,'' said Michael Knight, president of the Sydney Games
organizing committee.
	   ``It ought to be fixed ... you don't fix it for the Olympics,
you fix it for the people of Sydney,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   State opposition leader Peter Collins said the scare is a
serious threat to the city's international standing.
	   ``It's outrageous that the people of Sydney are expected to pay
top dollar for Third World water,'' he said.
	   The New South Wales state Health Department said tests conducted
on Monday found high levels of the dangerous microscopic parasites
giardia and cryptosporidium have reappeared in the city's water
system. It issued a health warning to the vast majority of Sydney's
3.7 million residents.
	   Only boiled water should be used for drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing foods and making ice, the department said.
Schoolchildren should take bottled water to school.
	   The warning follows one in late July that lasted a week.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems, including the very young and the elderly.
	   Testing showed the levels of cryptosporidium were higher this
time than the previous scare, Health Department Director-General
Mick Reid said Wednesday.
	   He said heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent
weeks may be responsible for the contamination.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee, Wis., in
1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others were
sickened.
	   No cases of illness have been reported as a result of either
outbreak in Sydney.
	   Water treatment experts from Chicago and Britain were being
flown in to assist in an inquiry into the cause of the outbreak.
	   After the first outbreak, the plant was cleaned up and the
city's water system flushed with clean water. An Australian dollars
35 million (U.S. dlrs 21 million) upgrade of the city's water
supply was announced.

U.S. economist recommends radical steps for healing Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A prominent American economist said Wednesday
that the IMF's economic reforms aren't working in Asia and that the
region should try to stimulate its battered economies by printing
more money to cause inflation.
	   ``The time has come to do something radical,'' said Paul
Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics
professor who gained some renown by predicting Asia's demise before
its bubble burst and the crisis began a year ago.
	   In a speech to a conference of business executives, Krugman said
the International Monetary Fund bailout program, which includes
large aid packages and painful economic reforms, has not worked in
countries such as Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
	   He said a severe recession is now spreading across the entire
region and ``what Asia needs is inflation with increased
liquidity.'' He recommended putting more money into circulation,
especially in Japan, to encourage inflation and lower interest
rates. Krugman said the value of the yen should be allowed to fall
even further against the U.S. dollar.
	   Currently, he said, Japan's monetary policy is trying to prevent
the yen from falling further, regardless of whether or not that
helps the nation's economy.
	   Krugman said his remedies would boost consumer spending and
growth.
	   ``Japan is in a liquidity trap: People want to save more than
investors want to invest,'' he said. ``Inflation is the way out.''
	   But the economist also conceded that under this scenario
investors would probably try to pull their money out of declining
Asian currencies. For that reason, he said, governments would have
to stop them with temporary exchange restrictions.
	   Krugman said he supported IMF reforms aimed at reducing
widespread corruption, cronyism and financial malpractice in East
Asian countries, but that that isn't enough.
	   ``It's not going to pay off unless there's also an expansion in
demand to allow these economies to make use of that newfound
efficiency,'' he said.
	   Krugman said he hopes he's wrong about his prognosis of the IMF
reforms. ``But if I'm right, in terms of the Asian crisis, you
ain't seen nothing yet.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia no closer to ending
political turmoil a month after parliamentary elections, opposition
leaders said Wednesday their followers were willing to brave
bullets and grenades to protest against strongman Hun Sen.
	   Some 5,000 people remained in a park across from the National
Assembly in the third day of a sit-in, protesting alleged electoral
fraud and demanding that Hun Sen _ the declared victor of the July
26 polls _ step down.
	   The leaders of the losing opposition parties, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, rejected government pressure to move the
protest but agreed to work more closely with police to address
concerns about hygiene and pickpockets among the crowd.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said their followers were committed to
overturning what they called widespread electoral fraud and were
prepared face violence from the government.
	   On Tuesday, Sam Rainsy's party asked the United Nations to send
on-site monitors to the park, claiming he had received reports that
elements within the government planned to kill him.
	   The park was the scene of a grenade attack last year against a
protest led by Sam Rainsy that killed 16 people and wounded more
than 100. Hun Sen has been widely blamed for the attack, but denies
responsibility.
	   A U.N.-brokered midnight meeting between Interior Ministry
officials and the opposition leaders apparently averted a police
crackdown planned for early Wednesday morning.
	   Interior Ministry official Prum Sokha said afterwards that the
round-the-clock vigil, called ``illegal'' by the government, could
continue but at a more discreet site. He suggested the city's
largest sports stadium.
	   The leaders refused to move, but said in a written statement
that they would work with authorities to keep down pick-pocketing,
ensure toilets are available and clean up the park.
	   ``The people will not move,'' they said. ``It is a public place,
it is the site of the National Assembly that is meant to represent
the people's will, and it is a place where the people have left
their blood in the struggle for freedom.''
	   Their defiance heightened concerns of renewed violence if Hun
Sen's patience wears out with the political stalemate that has only
deepened since last month's elections.
	   Though international observers gave a credible bill of health to
the day of the elections and the first day of vote-counting, the
opposition has alleged hundreds of cases of fraud in the 10 days it
took to finish the count. They also said widespread violence and
intimidation before the vote poisoned the outcome.
	   They have challenged the formula under which Hun Sen's party,
with 41 percent of the popular vote, garnered 64 of the assembly's
122 seats, a slight majority giving him first right to form a
government but short of the two-thirds needed to rule alone.
	   The opposition leaders threaten to boycott the assembly,
preventing a government from forming, and have rejected Hun Sen's
offers to put together a coalition until their concerns are
addressed.
	   The parties still have a month before the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time Sept. 24, but the lack of any
visible progress in resolving the dispute is making ordinary people
in the capital nervous of violence.
	   Hun Sen toppled Ranariddh as his co-prime minister last year in
a bloody coup and called the elections in an effort to win back
lost international legitimacy and aid.
	   The prince had won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.

Economically struggling Indonesia welcomes latest loan from IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian currency will
strengthen in the wake of the International Monetary Fund's
approval of a dlrs 1 billion disbursement, a Cabinet minister said
Wednesday.
	   The Washington-based IMF approved the disbursement late Tuesday
for Indonesia, which is struggling to revive an economy mired in
its worst slump in decades. The lending agency has now approved a
total of dlrs 6 billion in loans.
	   The economic turmoil has stripped the rupiah by as much as 80
percent of its value since the Asian currency crisis erupted last
year. In recent days, however, it has gained some ground against
the dollar.
	   Senior economics minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita welcomed the
IMF aid but warned that if the rupiah's movement is too volatile,
it will give rise to speculation.
	   ``We hope this will allow the rupiah to keep strengthening, but
not too drastically,'' he said.
	   The rupiah was trading around 11,000 to the dollar on Wednesday,
up sharply from 15,000 in June. Before the crisis began, the dollar
was worth about 2,500 rupiah.
	   The IMF suspended a dlrs 43 billion rescue package amid
political turmoil that led to the ouster in May of former
autocratic President Suharto.
	   It resumed funding, and IMF head Michel Camdessus said Tuesday
that the agency's executive board approved an extended fund
facility for Indonesia totaling dlrs 6.2 billion.
	   Camdessus said the next loan disbursements are scheduled for
Sept. 25, Oct. 25 and Nov. 25.

Thailand's petroleum authority launches fuel oil exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Petroleum Authority of Thailand
will begin exporting fuel oil for the first time in early 1999 due
to falling domestic demand and new emission standards forcing a
switch to natural gas.
	   Company Vice President Toemchai Bunnag said the authority
expects to offer almost 100,000 tons a month on the Singapore
market from next year as the state Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand switches to natural gas.
	   Bunnag said that though new emission standards are still only on
the drawing board, the electricity authority will reduce monthly
consumption of fuel oil by as much as 300,000 tons in the second
half of this year. The cuts could double over the next two years.
	   Bunnag said the petroleum authority did not need to export fuel
oil this year as major refiners had cut back by some 20 percent
from full-capacity output levels.
	   Bunnag added that a drop in domestic electricity consumption by
some 7 percent due to Thailand's deepening recession added to the
need to find new markets for the fuel oil.

Olympic ticket prices launched

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers have hiked
the prices of premium seating so more Australians can afford to
attend the 2000 games.
	   Organizers announced the domestic ticket prices for all sports
Wednesday, with a range from 10 to 1,382 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5.80 to 798). While the top price tickets are much more
expensive than four years ago in Atlanta, there are also
significantly cheaper tickets available for the Sydney games.
	   The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
said 75 percent of the 9.6 million tickets would be made available
to Australians, with 70 percent costing less than 60 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 34.80) and 80 percent less than 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58).
	   Five million tickets will be on sale through a mail order offer
to start in mid-1999. The balance will be divided between children
and disadvantaged groups, media and international fans, athletes
and officials.
	   The International Olympic Committee gave SOCOG the green light
to launch its ticket program last week after initial concern over
the high prices SOCOG planned to charge.
	   The top price tickets of Aust dlrs 1,382 (U.S. 798) are up from
the U.S. dlrs 637 charged by the Atlanta Olympic organizers in
1996. But SOCOG's aim of getting more Australians to the games
while raising about U.S. 350 million relies on having enough cheap
tickets.
	   Whereas Atlanta's cheapest seat to the opening or closing
ceremonies was U.S. dlrs 212, in Sydney there will be 10,000
tickets available to the opening and 5,000 to the closing at U.S.
dlrs 61.
	   ``The tickets are priced at a level which will ensure those who
want to experience the Olympic Games can afford to do so,'' said
SOCOG president Michael Knight.
	   Track and field, swimming, artistic gymnastics and men's
basketball all have a peak price of U.S. dlrs 263. But tickets for
some gymnastics will be available for U.S. dlrs 5.80, the track and
swimming heats from U.S. dlrs 20 and the basketball preliminaries
from U.S. dlrs 26.
	   About 750,000 tickets will be allocated to fans outside
Australia through foreign National Olympic Committees. SOCOG is not
authorized to sell tickets overseas.
	   About 1.5 million tickets will be made available directly to
children and the disadvantaged for less than U.S. dlrs 11, for 18
sports including baseball, softball, soccer and cycling.
	   ``While these tickets might not be the best in the house they'll
deliver a very memorable Olympic Games,'' said Knight.
	   But Gary Moore, director of the Council of Social Services of
New South Wales, said Olympic organizers could do more to
specifically target disadvantaged groups _ including Aborigines,
senior citizens, people with disabilities and non-English speaking
backgrounds - and broaden the range of sports offering cheap
tickets.
	   ``Ninety-five dollars is a huge hurdle for people in the bottom
20 per cent of incomes. And with basketball a favorite sport of
many disadvantaged young people, there are no cheap tickets to the
finals,'' Moore said.
	   Knight defended the procedure as fair.
	   ``These games are not just for the mega-rich, they are for the
average Australian as well,'' Knight said. ``We don't want to
pretend today that everyone will get everything they want out of
the Sydney Games. But we've done everything possible.''
	   In general SOCOG has priced its tickets below and above the
range in Atlanta, with a couple of notable exceptions in the pool.
	   Water polo final tickets are up from U.S. dlrs 32 to U.S. 147
dollars, despite poor attendances when the sport was played as part
of the world swimming championships in Perth earlier this year.
Barely a hundred people watched Australia contest the final rounds
in Perth, with many leaving after a swim program despite holding
free tickets to the water polo.
	   And SOCOG has valued tickets for the much-lampooned synchronized
swimming at U.S. dlrs 234, up more than 300 percent from the U.S.
dlr 48 premium price in Atlanta.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Thousands of residents of the eastern
city of Calcutta joined nuns of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity in prayers Wednesday on what would have been the 88th
birthday of the nun who dedicated her life to serving the poor.
	   ``On this sacred day, we rededicate ourselves to the services of
the poorest of the poor and toward the path shown by our beloved
mother,'' said Sister Nirmala, who succeeded Mother Teresa last
year as head of the charity.
	   ``Mother Teresa is no more. But we feel she is everywhere,''
said Sister Mary Thomas, one of the participants.
	   Hundreds of children lined up for mass at the orphanage and
other institutions that Mother Teresa founded in Calcutta.
	   As part of the birthday celebrations Wednesday, the Missionaries
of Charity will open a new home for disabled children called
Dayadan, or Gift of Kindness.
	   Meanwhile, a proposal by a group of citizens to install a statue
of Mother Teresa in a public park was put off after the local
municipal officials withdrew permission.
	   The residents formed a committee to raise money to pay for the
statue. The Missionaries of Charity objected, saying no money could
be raised in the name of Mother Teresa. Municipal officials then
refused permission to set up the statue. The citizens group has
filed a lawsuit against the local government and the case is still
being heard.

Seoul to propose rescheduling of 2002 World Cup soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean soccer official
suggested on Wednesday that the 2002 World Cup be rescheduled to
start in May to avoid the rainy season in South Korea and Japan.
	   Park Seh-jik, chairman of South Korea's World Cup organizing
committee, said he will discuss the idea with co-host Japan before
proposing it to FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
	   ``I think there is no reason Japan would object to the idea,
because the two countries are in the same seasonal belt,'' Park
told reporters.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts to the 2002 World Cup,
soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia.
	   The quadrennial, month-long World Cup traditionally has started
around June 10, after the professional soccer season in Europe and
South America ends in April.
	   But the period overlaps the rainy season in both Japan and South
Korea.
	   Chung Mong-joon, head of South Korea's Football Association,
suggested in July that the 2002 World Cup be rescheduled for
September to avoid the rainy season in this part of the world.
	   But that idea met strong objection from key FIFA member
countries in Europe and South America because of their pro league
schedules.
	   Park said starting the tournament in late May would avoid the
rainy season, the pro league season in Europe and South America and
the 2002 Asian Games to be held in Pusan, South Korea, in
September.
	   ``It is just like catching three birds with one stone,'' he
added.
	   This year's World Cup in France ran from June 10 to July 12.

Communists join Nepal's minority government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ With an eye on next year's elections and
with a coalition government a near certainty, Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala on Wednesday welcomed a communist group into his
minority government, giving him a comfortable lead in parliament.
	   Koirala's centrist Nepali Congress has 87 members in the
205-seat House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament.
With the additional 40 members from the Communist Party of Nepal,
Koirala has the comfortable majority required to pass bills.
	   The move had been expected after the budget was approved by
parliament Tuesday with the support of the communists. As a reward,
Koirala added 13 communist ministers to his Cabinet.
	   His decision apparently was linked with next year's general
elections. Koirala hopes to fight the balloting jointly with the
communists.
	   Koirala assumed power in April after no two parties could agree
on forming a coalition government. Nepal's last election in 1994
had left a hung parliament with no political parties securing a
simple majority required to form a government. Successive
governments have fallen one after the other.

Seven hostages freed in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seven villagers who had been abducted in southern
Russia returned home Wednesday, a day after they were seized, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   They were among 10 people taken hostage by armed assailants in
the North Ossetia region of the Caucasus. One hostage was killed
and two managed to escape Tuesday.
	   The circumstances of the hostages' release were unclear,
Interfax said. It may have been the result of a massive search that
police launched shortly after the abduction.
	   Since the end of the war in nearby Chechnya in 1996, the
Caucasus republics of North Ossetia, Ingushetia and and Dagestan
have been plagued by kidnappings, some for money and some
apparently in retribution for other abductions.

Myanmar exiles tell of torture at hands of military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK108 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT HORN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The soldiers came in the middle of the
night, Ye Teiza said. At least a dozen of them, surrounding his
home in Myanmar's capital and pounding on the door.
	   ``My heart was racing,'' he said. ``I knew I was going to be
arrested.''
	   Ye Teiza was a member of a student union campaigning for
democracy and an end to decades of military rule in Myanmar, also
known as Burma.
	   Like 18 foreign activists caught handing out pro-democracy
leaflets in Yangon last month, Ye Teiza said he was taken into the
custody of military intelligence.
	   Most of the American, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino and
Australian activists said they were treated humanely. Sentenced to
five years in jail, they were immediately deported to their home
countries.
	   In interviews with The Associated Press and in a
soon-to-be-published book, Ye Teiza and eight other former
political prisoners in Myanmar tell far different tales of their
own treatment. They detailed their accounts of physical and
psychological torture suffered at the hands of the nation's
military government.
	   The book, called ``Tortured Voices: Personal Accounts of Burma's
Interrogation Centers,'' will be published by the All Burma
Students Democratic Front, an anti-government exile group. It
covers their arrests in the early 1990s. Reports from human rights
groups say conditions haven't improved since then.
	   The military government denies people are mistreated while under
arrest.
	   ``Myanmar is a land of strong Buddhist belief, and such inhumane
acts are nonexistent,'' said a government spokesman, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity. He called the book
anti-government propaganda.
	   Nonetheless, the government gunned down 3,000 pro-democracy
demonstrators who were calling for an end to military rule in a
nationwide protest in 1988.
	   Ye Teiza, who lives now in Bangkok, and his colleagues say they
were brutalized and subjected to torture until they named other
democracy activists and signed false confessions. Then, they say,
they were given sham trials and sentenced to long prison terms.
	   Prisoners said they were kept in dungeon-like cells. At the
hands of successive squads of interrogators, they were beaten
daily, threatened with death, rape, subjected to electric shocks,
and deprived of sleep, food, water and using a toilet for days at a
time.
	   During questioning they were always blindfolded, the writers
said. Some were kept in stocks, while others had iron rods rolled
over their shins. They were forced to kneel on sharp stones until
they bled, or stand on their toes for hours with pins beneath their
heels.
	   People arrested by the regime, the authors said, enter the
centers with bags pulled over their heads. Sightless, they were
terrified by a continuous wailing of people in excruciating pain.
	   Naing Kyaw, an arrested student, wrote that with every question
he was hit, no matter how he answered. The interrogators never let
prisoners slip into unconsciousness, something many of them longed
for.
	   Ye Teiza said an officer told him: ``We can kill you without any
problem.'' He eventually managed to flee Burma in 1997.
	   Asking for water was asking for abuse. Many had it poured over
the hoods they were forced to wear, causing the fabric's fibers to
swell, nearly suffocating them. Fear of rape was frequent among
female prisoners.
	   Eventually, the prisoners were tried and charged, like the 18
foreigners, with disturbing the peace and tranquility of the state.
All said they were denied lawyers and sent to Insein Prison in
Yangon.
	   Those who thought that meant the abuse was over were wrong.
Prisoners are frequently returned to interrogation centers from the
jail for more torture.
	   The regime's tactics have been effective. Most people are too
fearful to risk rising up against it.
	   The government has failed to break the will of a small vanguard
of democracy activists. On Monday, 200 students spilled into the
streets of Yangon and demonstrated for an end to military rule, the
first public protest in almost two years.
	   They fled down side streets as soldiers arrived.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of rumbling explosions echoed
through Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, one day after Congolese
President Laurent Kabila returned to the capital.
	   Fighting raged through the night in the area of Kingasani and
Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of
downtown, a witness said.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu. She fled the area and reached central Kinshasa
in the morning.
	   Government officials contacted Tuesday morning refused to speak.
	   ``We are holding a war meeting,'' said Information Minister
Didier Mumengi.
	   Shop owners closed their stores in central Kinshasa and
residents say they have been told residents toward the east to stay
at home.
	   Malu said she was told rebel fighters had moved into the
Kinshasa suburbs through the night.
	   Zimbawean soldiers allied with Kabila said Tuesday that they had
stopped the rebel advance toward Kinshasa.
	   Kabila returned to Kinshasa on Tuesday after spending more than
a week holed up in the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi _ his
former rebel stronghold.

Saudi Arabia sets pilgrimage limit for citizens, residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has decided to limit
its citizens to performing the pilgrimage, or hajj, just once every
five years, Al-Riyadh newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   It said the decision also will apply to foreigners living in
Saudi Arabia.
	   The decision _ which was taken by the Interior Ministry and
approved by the kingdom's religious authorities _ aims to reduce
the ever-growing number of pilgrims who perform the annual rite,
the daily said.
	   Overcrowding during the hajj, a ritual required of every
able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, has resulted in stampedes and
fires that have killed hundreds in recent years.
	   A stampede at the hajj last April left more than 150 people
dead, many of them elderly pilgrims from abroad.
	   More than two million Muslim perform the hajj every year, half
of them from abroad. The rest are Saudis and foreigners residing in
the kingdom.
	   Saudi Arabia limits foreign participation to 0.1 percent of each
country's total Muslim population.
	   Fifty years ago, the hajj drew about 10,000 people annually and
was easier to control.

Exchanges in Lebanon after rockets fired into Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALIK MAOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Sporadic exchanges of mortar and
artillery fire erupted Wednesday in south Lebanon between Lebanese
guerrillas and Israeli forces after the guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel, injuring 19 civilians.
	   Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim guerrilla force, used
mortars, machine guns and rockets to attack positions of the
Israeli army and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army (SLA)
militia, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Israeli artillery returned fire on guerrilla positions.
	   An Israeli military official said the army did not seek an
escalation of tensions and was responding to ongoing Hezbollah
attacks rather than acting in reprisal for Tuesday night's rocket
barrage on northern Israeli towns and settlements.
	   Tuesday night's Katyusha bombardment followed the killing of
Hossam al-Amin, a leader of the military wing of the Shiite Amal
militia. An Israeli helicopter ambushed his car, blowing up the
vehicle as it traveled along the coastal highway in south Lebanon.
	   Soon after, Amal and Hezbollah fired two salvos of rockets into
Israel.
	   However, Hezbollah said the rocket attack on northern Israel and
the subsequent exchanges stemmed from a different incident - the
killing of a Lebanese civilian by the Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   An Israeli military official concurred, saying a Lebanese
civilian was killed and five others wounded in an attack on the
south Lebanese village of Maghara.
	   There was controversy in Israel Wednesday over whether the
killing of Amin was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, who is a retired
general, said it was a mistake, because Israeli civilians could
have easily been killed in the Katyusha bombardment.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Army radio.
	   However his Labor party colleague Ephraim Sneh, who is also a
retired general, said the killing was justified. Interviewed on
Israel radio he said ``That is the correct and the most effective
way to fight terrorism, by killing their key figures.''
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over. However civil defense wardens were
instructed to leave the shelters unlocked in case the situation
deteriorates again.

Dutch publisher posts 22 percent net profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch publisher VNU said Wednesday
its first-half profit rose 22 percent to 242 million guilders (dlrs
110 million), lifted mainly by its business information activities
in the United States and Europe.
	   The results were above expectations. Analysts had estimated net
earnings for the first six months of 1998 at 219 million guilders
(dlrs 99.5 million) at most.
	   World Directories, purchased late last year from New York-based
ITT for 4.3 billion guilders (dlrs 1.9 billion), contributed 35
million guilders (dlrs 16 million) to earnings before extraordinary
items, VNU said. The unit boosted operating income by a windfall of
172 million guilders (dlrs 78 million).
	   For the whole of 1998, the company improved its profit forecast,
saying it expects growth in earnings per share before extraordinary
items to be around 30 percent. VNU had said earlier it expected net
earnings to rise by at least 10 percent.
	   VNU said progress in its consumer magazine division was moderate
due to higher paper costs. Operating income for the division was
117 million guilders (dlrs 53 million), up from 109 million
guilders (dlrs 49.5 million) in the first half of last year.

<TEXT>
	   Even before the higher casualty count, China described the
flooding as the worst in 44 years on the Yangtze and in decades in
the northeast.
	   Under a ``do-or-die'' order from President Jiang Zemin, 178,000
soldiers and police guarded flood-weakened dikes Wednesday as the
Yangtze surged again toward some of central China's richest
farmland and key industrial centers.
	   Soldiers, flashlights in hand, combed levees overnight looking
for cracks opened by 60 days or more of record high waters. Near
Yueyang, a city of 5 million, surging waters undermined dikes,
collapsing their earthen walls, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Jiang demanded particular vigilance near Honghu Lake. Its dikes
were the weakest on the whole river, and a collapse would threaten
the lives and property of 8 million people living on the rich flood
plain near the industrial city of Wuhan, the People's Daily
reported.
	   China Central Television showed soldiers patrolling the dikes
during the night, while others slept on mats nearby. Piles of
sandbags stood nearby to plug leaks.
	   In the northeast, the government appealed for tents, quilts and
warm clothing for a million people made homeless by flooding. With
the first frost of the bitterly cold winter two weeks away, those
living in makeshift lean-tos are already shivering through chilly
nights, the China Daily reported.
	   The disaster has laid bare the environmental ravages of
ill-conceived communist central planning and more recent decades of
breakneck economic growth.
	   In its wake, the government has belatedly banned logging on the
severely deforested hills along the upper Yangtze and suggested
buying back farmland on flood plains.
	   Unidentified Ministry of Water Resources officials complained
that funding for flood control has lagged behind other
infrastructure investment throughout the 1990s, the China Daily
said. The lack of money means many dikes were badly built.
	   Government officials have also used the calamity to renew
campaigns against corruption and bureaucratic mismanagement. Five
officials from inundated Lindian county in the northeast were
disciplined for leaving the disaster scene to play mah-jongg for
more than four hours, the state-run Legal Daily reported.

Lufthansa reports surprisingly strong first-half profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German airline Lufthansa AG earned 928
million marks (dlrs 516 million) in the first half of 1998, more
than twice last year's results and far surpassing analysts'
forecasts.
	   Low inflation and a continuing drop in fuel prices gave a boost
to Lufthansa during the period, the company said late Tuesday.
	   Analysts had projected a pretax profit of as much as 654 million
marks, up from 397 million marks in the same period in 1997.
	   Including the extraordinary gain for the sale of the air
carrier's stake in the travel group Hapag-Lloyd, pretax profit
surged to 1.31 billion marks (dlrs 728 million), Lufthansa said.
	   Lufthansa also said that it sees full-year sales growing at the
same rate as in the first half and expects a ``significant'' rise
in 1998 group earnings.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's security minister
said Wednesday the bombing of a Planet Hollywood restaurant here is
apparently a retaliation for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   The number of confirmed injured from the Tuesday evening blast
rose to 27. Despite conflicting media reports that two people died,
police insisted there was only one confirmed death. However, after
initially saying the victim was a woman, police then said he was a
man. They gave no explanation for the confusion.
	   Standard Bank had been holding a going away party for one of its
employees at the eatery in Cape Town's trendy Victoria and Albert
Waterfront when the bomb went off.
	   Fanie Schoeman, a man who worked in the bank's human resources
department, was killed. Seven other people at the party were
injured, two seriously, said Standard Bank spokesman Erik Larson.
	   ``We are devastated by the senseless nature of this act. we
can't understand why anyone would want to kill innocent people,''
said Ernie Ward-Cox, Standard Bank's provincial general manager of
retail bankinh.
	   A man claiming responsibility for the blast in a call said it
was revenge for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
according to Marianne Merten, a journalist at the station. A
spokesman for the group, Mogammat Achmat, in comments to South
African Broadcasting Corp., denied his group was involved.
	   Police refused to comment on the call. But Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the bombing was probably linked to
U.S. cruise-missile attacks on targets in Sudan in Afghanistan,
South African Broadcasting Corp. radio reported. The U.S. attacks
were themselves retaliation for the bombings earlier this month of
the U.S. embassies in Lenya and Tanzania.
	   Mufamadi said South African officials would work with agents of
the American FBI in investigating the attack.
	   President Nelson Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said
anyone who wants to attack Americans should do so on American soil
and pointed out that South Africa had not launched attacks on
anyone, SABC reported.
	   In Washington, the State Department said Muslims Against Global
Oppression was anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. It was unknown to the
department's counter-terrorism office until it staged a
demonstration at the vacant Israeli diplomatic office in Cape Town
in July 1997, officials said.
	   Some members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S.
policies on Iraq and Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Cape Town in March.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the bomb
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside Planet Hollywood as it was packed with
diners.
	   The bar, covered in blood, bore the main brunt of the blast,
which cracked walls, shattered windows and lifted part of the
ceiling off the restaurant. It then fell back into place.
	   A glass booth holding a mannequin of movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger was
	   shattered at the entrance.
	   The restaurant was ringed with barbed wire on Wednesday morning
as a small crowd of onlookers gathered to watch.
	   A small crater in a corner of the bar marked the apparent spot
where the bomb went off. Shattered chairs and pieces of plaster
littered the floor. Menus were scattered among the rubble.
	   Outside, a bag of bloody bandages and medical supplies lay on
the pavement and blood stains covered a bench where normally
tourists would sit.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, the franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   A spokesman for Planet Hollywood, which is based in Orlando,
Florida, said the company was attempting to gather information from
local authorities.
	   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to all the injured and their
families,'' said Matt Hallman, director of national public
relations.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell Wednesday on concerns political
wrangling will further delay clean up of Japan's bad-loan-plagued
banking system. The U.S. dollar recouped earlier losses against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 206.90 points, or
1.37 percent, to close at 14,866.03. On Tuesday, the average
finished up 84.57 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   On the currency market, the dollar bought 144.67 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 0.09 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
above its late New York rate of 144.21 yen overnight.
	   Parliament began debate Tuesday on a series of bills aimed at
speeding up the write-off of bad loans, which have dogged the
nation's banks since the collapse of the land market in the early
1990s.
	   But progress stalled Wednesday when opposition parties boycotted
a key parliamentary committee meeting after a tiff over procedures.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   The opposition has focused its criticisms on plans by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to use government funds to help Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co. take over the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd.
	   Traders worry a political spat could hold up reforms, possibly
for months.
	   ``If the opposition can block the proposals, in the worst case
scenario it could lead to another general election,'' said Stephen
Wood, a senior salesman in the foreign institutional sales
department at the Tokyo office of ING Baring Securities.
	   Bank shares led the overall market lower. LTCB was the most
heavily traded issue, falling 5 yen to 52 yen. Sumitomo Trust
dropped 29 yen to 364 yen.
	   An estimated 412 million shares traded on the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 360 million shares Tuesday.
Declining issues overwhelmed gainers 9-to-2.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,147.21.
The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, the day before.
	   Concerns about the fate of the banking bills also helped the
dollar regain earlier losses against the yen.
	   The dollar, which dropped as low as 144.18 yen in morning
trading, rallied to as high as 144.85 yen as the bills got tied up
in the Diet, Japan's parliament. The opposition has countered with
its own proposals, which would allow ailing banks to fail.
	   ``There seems to be no clear vision over how to clear up the
banking mess,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.115 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.125 percent,
driving its price up to 112.32 yen from 112.26 yen.

Reports: Poisoning victims in Japan were insured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two men sickened by arsenic near the site of a
subsequent mass poisoning in western Japan fell ill after visiting
the home of a beneficiary of their life insurance policies, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The pair were covered by policies worth a combined 100 million
yen (dlrs 690,000), news reports said Wednesday. One newspaper said
the beneficiary helped them buy the policies as well.
	   The two men _ whose names have not been released _ were
reportedly poisoned near the site of fatal curried rice poisonings
last month in Wakayama, a small coastal city 453 kilometers (283
miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Four people _ including two children _ died and dozens were
sickened at the community festival. The poisonings were major news
in Japan and forced the cancellation of similar annual festivals.
	   Police, who declined to comment on Wednesday's news reports,
have made little progress so far in finding the killer.
	   One of the two earlier poisoning victims, a 45-year-old man, had
accidental health coverage dating from 1993 which totaled 70
million yen (dlrs 483,792) in addition to 15,000 yen (dlrs 104) a
day in case of hospitalization, Kyodo News agency reported, citing
unidentified police sources.
	   The other man, 35, had 30 million yen (dlrs 207,339) in
accidental death insurance since 1995 along with 15,000 yen (dlrs
104) a day for hospitalization, Kyodo said.
	   The two men had policies from about 10 domestic and foreign
insurance companies, the Asahi newspaper reported, adding that
their mutual acquaintance was named as a beneficiary. The Mainichi
newspaper said the insurance was bought with the help of the
acquaintance.
	   None of the Japanese media reports named any of the three men
involved.
	   The two men were treated separately at a hospital for nausea
after visiting the acquaintance's home, Japanese media have
reported. Police suspect they became ill after consuming something
at the house.

Chernomyrdin tries to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble continuing to plunge, fresh quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors on Wednesday after investments plunged in value
under a drastic plan to restructure Russia's enormous debts, but
markets continued to fall.
	   The ruble dove again as Central Bank support for the Russian
currency faltered. Trading at the interbank exchange was suspended
for a second day in a row after the ruble weakened by more than 5
percent, trading at 8.26 rubles to the dollar in contrast to 7.86
rubles on Tuesday.
	   In another sign of panic, the Central Bank canceled sales of
dollars Wednesday to banks and other institutions. It was the first
time the Central Bank had canceled sales during the current crisis,
indicating the government was giving up efforts to stem the fall of
the ruble.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on restructuring the
country's dlrs 40 billion, short-term debt market, a day after
terms of the plan were revealed. The terms announced late Tuesday
confirmed creditors' fears that they would sustain heavy losses.
	   Investors whose bonds have matured will have the option of
trading them either for long-term, dollar-denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   Even as he pledged to try to limit the damage to investors,
Chernomyrdin was careful to dissociate himself from the
restructuring decision.
	   ``I would like people to understand us correctly: This decision
was predetermined. In actual fact, our task was only to formulate
it, and we could not do otherwise,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Our top priority now, my personal task, is to soften its
negative influence on stock markets and investors.''
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the restructuring _
receiving just 17 cents for every dollar they invested, according
to some analysts _ will discourage many from returning any time
soon.
	   Russia will feel the loss of foreign investment keenly. Some
analysts predict the country will be shut out of international
commercial borrowing for several years.
	   Muscovites lined up outside some banks to try to withdraw their
deposits. About 80 people were outside a branch of the SBS-Agro
bank on central Pushkin Square on Wednesday morning, umbrellas
staving off a steady drizzle as they waited for the doors to open.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman who identified
herself only as Julia. ``I'd like to be able to buy something with
my rubles, which have already become worthless.''

Battle rages near Kinshasa

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from state-controlled radio; foreign

CORRECTS time element. Edits throughout to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on the city's eastern outskirts.
	   The artillery and small arms battle came one day after President
Laurent Kabila returned to the capital reinforced by allied forces
from Angola and Zimbabwe.
	   Fighting raged through the night and continued into the morning
in the area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu. She fled the area and reached central Kinshasa
in the morning.
	   Government officials contacted Wednesday morning refused to
comment.
	   ``We are holding a war meeting,'' said Information Minister
Didier Mumengi.
	   Shop owners closed their stores in central Kinshasa and
residents in the city's eastern suburbs said they were told to stay
at home.
	   Malu said she was told rebel fighters had moved into the
Kinshasa suburbs during the night.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio said Congolese forces
were trying to flush out rebel fighters hiding in the Mikonga
forest on Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   ``Go about your business like normal and quit all speculation,''
the radio told the public. ``Since this morning we've had a
searching mission by the Congolese forces to destroy a reserve of
rebels who infiltrated the area.''
	   The foreign ministry called for a meeting Wednesday with
ambassadors.
	   Zimbawean soldiers allied with Kabila said Tuesday that they had
stopped the rebel advance toward Kinshasa, located in western
Congo.
	   Kabila returned to Kinshasa after spending more than a week
holed up in the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi _ his former
rebel stronghold.
	   After recent success fighting rebels in the west, government
forces along with Angolan and Zimbabwean allies said they were
planning to move east to the heart of rebel-held territory.
	   Kabila, speaking on state-run radio, called for support from the
Congolese.
	   ``With hands or spears or by any means the people must crush the
enemy in our territory,'' he said.
	   Allied warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe bombed rebel
positions, Information Minister Didier Mumengi said. He gave no
details.
	   Rebel leaders said Angolan and Zimbabwean aircraft had bombed
the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town of Kasangulu, about
30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   The planes had bombed civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city, rebel leader Bizima Karaha said. That city was
captured by insurgents forces just days ago.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene if the Zimbabweans and Angolans do
not withdraw.
	   Uganda has also sent troops and tanks to support the insurgents.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.
	   The Vatican's missionary news service reported Tuesday that a
priest, three nuns, a seminary student and 32 refugees were killed
in the attack on the Catholic mission in eastern Congo.
	   All the dead were Congolese. The mission is in a remote parish
in the east.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected local residents of
giving food to a pro-government militia, the news service said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Where is Abu Nidal? American news reports
say the famous terrorist is detained in Egypt. Egypt denies it. A
onetime guerrilla colleague, confronted with the question, replies
with one of his own: Which Abu Nidal?
	   The comment says much about Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of
struggle'' _ whom the United States once labeled the world's most
dangerous terrorist. Over the years Abu Nidal has been reported to
have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally
changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   Rumors have been circulating in the Middle East for about two
weeks that the onetime Palestinian guerrilla was arrested by
Egyptian police while coming from Libya and is either jailed or
hospitalized with leukemia.
	   On Wednesday, Egyptian security officials denied the latest
reports, carried by American newspapers and broadcast networks. The
officials spoke on condition their names not be used, remaining as
anonymous as the sources claiming Abu Nidal is in Egypt. American
officials said they could not confirm the reported arrest.
	   The reports persist because of Abu Nidal's fame. His group was
once listed by U.S. State Department as ``the most dangerous
terrorist organization.'' He has been blamed for killing 300 people
in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Palestinian officials have told The Associated Press that Abu
Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _ is either jailed or
hospitalized in Egypt.
	   The latest American reports quoted U.S. or Arab officials, and
one from ABC News quoted unnamed Egyptian authorities. But no one
has offered definite proof that Abu Nidal is indeed in custody in
Egypt.
	   One high-ranking Palestinian, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that Abu Nidal was seized by the
Egyptians about five weeks ago coming from Libya.
	   He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the Palestinian
guerrilla to leave for medical reasons of if Abu Nidal's own people
were trying to smuggle him out through Egypt to another country.
	   Abu Nidal is near death and, though he is being treated in a
hospital, he is in effect in detention, the official contended.
	   He and others theorize Egypt is denying the arrest because it
does not know what to do with the 61-year-old guerrilla and fears
revealing his arrest could make Egypt the target of anger by other
terrorists.
	   Born in Jaffa in then-Palestine in 1937, Abu Nidal's main
targets have been Israelis. But he also was blamed for killing some
of Yasser Arafat's chief aides after he split with the PLO leader,
claiming Arafat was not keeping up the struggle against Israel.
	   Over the years Abu Nidal is said to have operated out of Iraq,
Syria and Libya.
	   The terrorist leader is not wanted in the United States, though
he has been blamed for blowing up two American airliners: a Pan Am
jet on the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in 1974 in the
air over the Aegean Sea. The combined death toll was 120.
	   His most famous attacks were the twin assaults on ticket
counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna airports
on Dec. 27, 1985. Eighteen people were killed and 120 wounded.
	   It was a Palestinian in Lebanon who asked the question about
``which Abu Nidal,'' raising the theory that the famous terrorist
actually is dead and that some followers have used his famous nom
de guerre. The Palestinian, once close to Abu Nidal's group, spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Over the years, the chain-smoking Abu Nidal has been reported to
be dead of cancer or a heart attack. After reports of his death in
the mid-1980s, he was quoted in one interview as saying:
	   ``I'm neither a ghost nor a phantom. I am Abu Nidal of flesh and
blood ... this evil spirit which moves around only at night ...
causing these people constant nightmares.''

Indonesian armed forces chief questions human rights group on data
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief on
Wednesday questioned recently released data on human rights abuses
in the northernmost province of Aceh.
	   A government-sponsored panel said Monday that 781 people had
been killed during military campaigns against Islamic separatist
rebels over the last decade in Aceh.
	   The National Human Rights Commission, which has uncovered mass
graves of alleged victims of the military, also said 3,000 women
had been widowed.
	   In keeping with Indonesia's move toward democracy, Gen. Wiranto
has apologized for military abuses in Aceh and has pulled out some
troops from the province. But he said the commission figures of the
number of alleged widows and killed did not match.
	   ``That means that each (slain) man had three or four wives. I
doubt that,'' he said.
	   ``Any findings by any team should first be confirmed or follow
consultations with other agencies, including the armed forces,''
Wiranto said.
	   He added that the military has its own fact-finding team but did
not offer an estimate of how many people have died in Aceh.
	   Human rights workers have dug up 17 skeletons as well as bones
from dozens of other people in mass graves in Aceh. Most of the
victims were believed killed in the late 1980s or early 1990s.
	   The inquiry by the national human rights commission is the
latest sign of a new openness since former President Suharto
resigned in May after nationwide riots and student protests. His
successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reform.
	   The Indonesia Observer newspaper quoted Justice Minister Muladi
as saying he would press Habibie to compensate victims of the
violence in Aceh.
	   However, Muladi admitted that Indonesia does not have any
regulation on compensating victims of human rights abuses committed
by the government and military.

 &UR; China summer flooding kills 3,004, vice premier says
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; EDITS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River roaring toward key
industrial centers and rich farmland, the government announced
Wednesday that a summer of devastating floods has killed 3,004
people.
	   The announcement sharply revises the government's last official
death toll of 2,000, released nearly three weeks ago.
	   Vice Premier Wen Jiabao told the national legislature that as of
Saturday, 1,320 of the 3,004 deaths nationwide took place along the
Yangtze. Some areas along the river _ China's longest _ have been
inundated for 60 days or more, and soggy dikes are now perilously
weakened.
	   In a report carried by the state-run Xinhua News Agency, Wen
said nationwide 5 million houses have been destroyed and 21 million
hectares (52 million acres) of land swamped. Economic losses have
surpassed 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2 billion).
	   Nationwide more than 233 million people _ a fifth of the
population _ have been affected to varying degrees by the flooding,
Wen told the standing committee of the National People's Congress.
	   Even before announcing the higher casualty count, China
described the flooding as the worst in 44 years on the Yangtze and
in decades in the northeast.
	   Under a ``do-or-die'' order from President Jiang Zemin, 178,000
soldiers and police guarded shaky dikes Wednesday to battle the
Yangtze's seventh flood crest this summer, state media reported.
	   Soldiers, flashlights in hand, combed levees overnight looking
for cracks opened by 60 days or more of record high waters. Near
Yueyang, a city of 5 million, surging waters undermined dikes,
collapsing their earthen walls, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   The flood peak moved through Shashi city and began swelling
waters 180 kilometers (100 miles) downstream in Yueyang.
	   Jiang demanded particular vigilance near Honghu Lake. Its dikes
were the weakest on the whole river, and a collapse would threaten
the lives and property of 8 million people living on the rich flood
plain near the industrial city of Wuhan, the People's Daily
reported.
	   China Central Television showed soldiers patrolling the dikes
during the night, while others slept on mats nearby. Piles of
sandbags stood nearby to plug leaks.
	   Near Yueyang, just upstream from Honghu, soldiers and farmers
poured stones and gravel into the breached dike. An additional
2,000 tons of stones and dirt and 500,000 sacks were shipped into
the area just in case, Xinhua said.
	   In the northeast, the government appealed for tents, quilts and
warm clothing for a million people made homeless by flooding. With
the first frost of the bitterly cold winter two weeks away, those
living in makeshift lean-tos are already shivering through chilly
nights, the China Daily reported.
	   To house the homeless, factories were clearing out warehouses
and the government was hoping to get flood-free villages to take in
flooded-out fellow farmers, the China Daily reported.
	   More than 320 doctors have been sent to northeast flood areas to
treat the sick and prevent the outbreak of epidemics, the newspaper
said.
	   The disaster has laid bare the environmental ravages of
ill-conceived communist central planning and more recent decades of
breakneck economic growth.
	   In its wake, the government has belatedly banned logging on the
severely deforested hills along the upper Yangtze and suggested
buying back farmland on flood plains.
	   Unidentified Ministry of Water Resources officials complained
that funding for flood control has lagged behind other
infrastructure investment throughout the 1990s, the China Daily
said. The lack of money means many dikes were badly built.
	   Government officials have also used the calamity to renew
campaigns against corruption and bureaucratic mismanagement. Five
officials from inundated Lindian county in the northeast were
disciplined for leaving the disaster scene to play mah-jongg for
more than four hours, the state-run Legal Daily reported.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Where is Abu Nidal? American news reports
say the famous terrorist is detained in Egypt. Egypt denies it. A
onetime guerrilla colleague, confronted with the question, replies
with one of his own: Which Abu Nidal?
	   The comment says much about Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of
struggle'' _ whom the United States once labeled the world's most
dangerous terrorist. Over the years Abu Nidal has been reported to
have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally
changed his looks through plastic surgery.

World War II tank shell kills Ukrainian villager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A villager was killed and another was badly
wounded as they tried to take apart a World War II tank shell found
in northeastern Ukraine, officials said Wednesday.
	   The incident occurred Tuesday near the village of Malynovka in
the Kharkiv region, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   World War II shells and bombs are frequently found in Ukraine,
which was the site of heavy battles between Soviet and invading
German armies in World War II. Dozens have been discovered in
recent months following rainfalls, floods and repair works.
	   Emergency officials complain that Ukrainians often ignore their
warnings and try to dismantle the weapons.
	   Last month, a World War II artillery shell exploded in central
Ukraine in a similar incident, killing two and injuring one
villager.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia no closer to ending
political turmoil a month after parliamentary elections, opposition
leaders said Wednesday their followers were willing to brave
bullets and grenades to protest against strongman Hun Sen.
	   Some 5,000 people remained in a park across from the National
Assembly in the third day of a sit-in, protesting alleged electoral
fraud and demanding that Hun Sen _ the declared victor of the July
26 polls _ step down.
	   The leaders of the losing opposition parties, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, rejected government pressure to move the
protest but agreed to work more closely with police to address
concerns about hygiene and pickpockets among the crowd.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said their followers were committed to
overturning what they called widespread electoral fraud and were
prepared face violence from the government.
	   On Tuesday, Sam Rainsy's party asked the United Nations to send
on-site monitors to the park, claiming he had received reports that
elements within the government planned to kill him.
	   The park was the scene of a grenade attack last year against a
protest led by Sam Rainsy that killed 16 people and wounded more
than 100. Hun Sen has been widely blamed for the attack, but denies
responsibility.
	   A U.N.-brokered midnight meeting between Interior Ministry
officials and the opposition leaders apparently averted a police
crackdown planned for early Wednesday morning.
	   Interior Ministry official Prum Sokha said afterwards that the
round-the-clock vigil, called ``illegal'' by the government, could
continue but at a more discreet site. He suggested the city's
largest sports stadium.
	   The leaders refused to move, but said in a written statement
that they would work with authorities to keep down pick-pocketing,
ensure toilets are available and clean up the park.
	   The park _ dubbed ``Democracy Square'' by the opposition _ was a
sea of makeshift blue tarpaulin tents separate by little pathways.
Supporters handed out baskets of free food, and even the poor were
making donations of crumpled banknotes to keep up the protest.
	   ``The people will not move,'' they said. ``It is a public place,
it is the site of the National Assembly that is meant to represent
the people's will, and it is a place where the people have left
their blood in the struggle for freedom.''
	   Their defiance heightened concerns of renewed violence if Hun
Sen's patience wears out with the political stalemate that has only
deepened since last month's elections.
	   Though international observers gave a credible bill of health to
the day of the elections and the first day of vote-counting, the
opposition has alleged hundreds of cases of fraud in the 10 days it
took to finish the count. They also said widespread violence and
intimidation before the vote poisoned the outcome.
	   They have challenged the formula under which Hun Sen's party,
with 41 percent of the popular vote, garnered 64 of the assembly's
122 seats, a slight majority giving him first right to form a
government but short of the two-thirds needed to rule alone.
	   The opposition leaders threaten to boycott the assembly,
preventing a government from forming, and have rejected Hun Sen's
offers to put together a coalition until their concerns are
addressed.
	   The parties still have a month before the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time Sept. 24, but the lack of any
visible progress in resolving the dispute is making ordinary people
in the capital nervous of violence.
	   Hun Sen toppled Ranariddh as his co-prime minister last year in
a bloody coup and called the elections in an effort to win back
lost international legitimacy and aid.
	   The prince had won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.

Hockey legend Hull: Hitler had some merits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hockey legend Bobby Hull in a newspaper interview
credited Nazis with ``some good ideas'' and grumbled about what he
said was the excessively fast growth of the U.S. black population.
	   ``Hitler for example, had some good ideas,'' Hull said in an
interview published Tuesday in the respected English-language daily
Moscow Times. ``He just went a little bit too far.''
	   The former Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets star also told
the newspaper that selective genetic breeding to produce better
humans could be a good idea and that the Nazi's plan to build a
master race wasn't all bad.
	   He also assailed the Canadian government for being too socialist
and quick to give money to lazy people.
	   When the Times asked if it would be fair to describe him as a
racist, Hull answered curtly: ``I don't give a damn. I'm not
running for any political office.''
	   Hull gave the interview last week while in Russia as special
guest of the annual Spartak Cup pre-season international hockey
tournament. The event this year honored Vyacheslav Fetisov, the
Russian hockey great who announced his retirement from the Stanley
Cup-champion Detroit Red Wings several weeks ago.
	   Hull amassed more than 1,000 points and scored 610 goals during
16 NHL seasons, twice winning the Hart Trophy as the league's most
valuable player.
	   Hull also touched on his relationship with his son, Brett, who
recently signed a free-agent contract with the Dallas Stars. It's
been said the relationship has been strained for years. But Hull
said they were close.
	   ``He is a very loyal kid,'' Hull reportedly said of Brett.
``Maybe he is not as strong mentally as I was and can't always
follow through on his decisions.''
	   It was Hull's first visit to the former Soviet Union since 1976,
when the Jets, then in the World Hockey Association, played in the
Izvestia Cup tournament. He also played for the WHA version of Team
Canada when it visited Russia in 1974.
	   Hull told the Times that the ``biggest disappointment of his
life'' was not being allowed to play in the 1972 Canada-Soviet
series, which only used the National Hockey League players.
	   Shortly before that, Hull was the first hockey star to snub the
powerful NHL and sign a multimillion dollar deal with the Winnipeg
Jets of the rival World Hockey Association.
	   ``I wanted to play more than anything else. But those big NHL
heads decided to pay me back'' for signing with the WHA, he said.
	   Hull, who grew up on a farm near Belleville, Canada and still
breeds cattle, toured a collective farm in Russia and visited St.
Petersburg.
	   ``I played the way I live _ straightforward,'' Hull said in the
interview. ``I have no regrets about anything I did in life.''
	   However, if he had to do it all again, he reportedly laughed and
said, ``Maybe I'd drink a bit more.''

South Korea's foreign minister to visit Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's foreign and trade
minister will visit Tokyo Sept. 3-4 to prepare for President Kim
Dae-jung's scheduled state visit to Japan this fall, ministry
officials said Wednesday.
	   Hong Soon-young will meet with his Japanese counterpart,
Masahiko Komura, to set the agenda and other details for Kim's
visit, scheduled in October, they said.
	   Hong also will meet Rep. Goko Sato, who heads a special
committee on international fisheries in Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, the officials said.
	   Adoption of a new fisheries treaty is one of the most pressing
pending issues between Japan and South Korea. The existing treaty
expires in January.
	   The two countries have to set new fishing areas to comply with
the 1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows a
country exclusive fishing rights within 200 nautical miles (230
miles or 370 kilometers) of its shores.
	   Japan and South Korea are less than 400 nautical miles (460
miles or 740 kilometers) apart, so there are overlapping areas, and
the two sides so far have been unable to come up with a compromise.
	   Hong was named the foreign and trade minister early this month,
replacing Park Chung-soo, who resigned to take responsibility for a
diplomatic row with Russia.

Premier implicates former administration in illegal snooping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Prime Minister Viktor Orban has charged
that he, his close associates and their families were targeted by
illegal spying while the Socialists were in power, state radio
reported Wednesday.
	   ``Illegal, covert data gathering, targeting party leaders and
their family members, took place under the watch of the previous
government,'' Orban told his party's national steering committee
meeting Tuesday evening.
	   While he named no names, Tamas Deutsch, a deputy head of Orban's
party, claimed Wednesday files available to him ``indicate the use
of covert means, and the terminology used reflects the work of
professionals.''
	   Socialist party leaders, who were ousted by Orban's
Young-Democrats-Civic Party in May elections, have rejected the
allegations and demanded proof.
	   ``The national security agencies could not have done this,''
Istvan Nikolits, the former minister-without-portfolio overseeing
the intelligence services, told state radio. ``Not only is it
against the law, but there were internal checks that would have
caught something like this.''
	   Orban has ordered a full-scale investigation.
	   ``Politics has its hazards, but this is going too far,'' said
Deutsch.
	   He said Orban called him to his office last week and showed him
a file on Deutsch, his family, friends and business activities.
	   ``Even my mother figured in the file,'' an indignant Deutsch
said.
	   The charges came following last week's series of articles in the
biggest Hungarian daily, ``Nepszabadsag,'' implicating two
Orban-appointees in questionable business dealings.

Indonesian military says Suharto son-in-law faces more questioning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators will pursue a case
against a son-in-law of ex-President Suharto who was fired from the
military for abducting political activists, an official said
Wednesday.
	   The decision to further question former Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto means he could still face a court-martial amid criticism
that his dismissal was too soft a sanction.
	   Prabowo was a chief of Indonesia's special forces, which have
been implicated in abductions and torture of Suharto's opponents
since last year. Suharto quit in May amid riots and student
protests against his autocratic rule.
	   Evidence against Prabowo could emerge in the upcoming trials of
10 lower-ranking soldiers arrested in connection with the
kidnappings.
	   ``We've ordered our fact-finding team to search for more
evidence because Prabowo admitted that he had kidnapped nine
activists who have reappeared,'' said Maj. Gen Syamsu Djalal, a
military investigator.
	   More than two dozen activists were allegedly kidnapped. At least
14 are still missing and feared dead. Those that were freed said
they were abducted, tortured and questioned about their political
activities.
	   Aside from Prabowo, two other high-ranking officers implicated
in the kidnappings will lose all chance of promotion.
	   Munir, head of the Committee for Disappeared People and the
Victims of Violence, said the military should put all three
officers on trial as well as account for the missing activists. He
said he suspected other commanders should be investigated in the
case.
	   Newspapers have also pressed for a more thorough explanation of
who was behind the abductions.
	   ``It is expected that in due course, a legal process will not
only unveil the role played by the three officers but also the main
actor behind the abduction,'' the daily Suara Pembaruan said in an
editorial.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said civil authorities would stay out of
the Prabowo case.
	   ``It's an internal problem of the armed forces that we should
give them an opportunity to resolve,'' he said.

French arson suspect released on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGOUMENITSA, Greece (AP) _ A French man arrested on suspicion of
starting a forest fire during Greece's worst outbreak of wildfires
was released from prison on bail, an Igoumenitsa court spokesman
said Wednesday.
	   Alain de Fremont, 49, was imprisoned Aug. 10 on the Ionian
island of Corfu pending trial on arson charges after being arrested
as he allegedly tried to light a fire with gasoline near the
village of Sivota in northwestern Greece.
	   De Fremont, who denied the charges, was released from prison
after paying 10 million drachmas (dlrs 32,600) bail set by the
Igoumenitsa court on Tuesday, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   No trial date has yet been set.
	   De Fremont's arrest came as dozens of forest and brush fires
burned around the country and three prefectures were in a state of
emergency.
	   Although such blazes are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers, this year in July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were
reported compared with 2,800 for the entire summer season last
year.
	   Arson has been suspected in some of the blazes. In the past,
property owners have been accused of burning land to get around
laws that prohibit construction on wooded areas.

between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas, the Israeli army
spokesman said.
	   The shelling erupted after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night, injuring 19 civilians.

Where is Abu Nidal? Not in Egypt, say security authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Where is Abu Nidal? American news reports
say the famous terrorist is detained in Egypt. Egypt denies it. A
onetime guerrilla colleague, confronted with the question, replies
with one of his own: Which Abu Nidal?
	   The comment says much about Abu Nidal, whom the United States
once labeled the world's most dangerous terrorist. Over the years
Abu Nidal, whose nickname is Arabic for ``father of struggle,'' has
been reported to have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to
have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   Rumors have been circulating in the Middle East for about two
weeks that the onetime Palestinian guerrilla was arrested by
Egyptian police while coming from Libya and is either jailed or
hospitalized with leukemia.
	   On Wednesday, Egyptian security officials denied the latest
reports, carried by American newspapers and broadcast networks. The
officials spoke on condition their names not be used, remaining as
anonymous as the sources claiming Abu Nidal is in Egypt. American
officials said they could not confirm the reported arrest.
	   The reports persist because of Abu Nidal's fame. His group was
once listed by U.S. State Department as ``the most dangerous
terrorist organization.'' He has been blamed for killing 300 people
in 20 countries since 1973.
	   Palestinian officials have told The Associated Press that Abu
Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _ is either jailed or
hospitalized in Egypt.
	   The latest American reports quoted U.S. or Arab officials, and
one from ABC News quoted unnamed Egyptian authorities. But no one
has offered definite proof that Abu Nidal is indeed in custody in
Egypt.
	   One high-ranking Palestinian, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that Abu Nidal was seized by the
Egyptians about five weeks ago coming from Libya.
	   He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the Palestinian
guerrilla to leave for medical reasons of if Abu Nidal's own people
were trying to smuggle him out through Egypt to another country.
	   Abu Nidal is near death and, though he is being treated in a
hospital, he is in effect in detention, the official contended.
	   He and others theorize Egypt is denying the arrest because it
does not know what to do with the 61-year-old guerrilla and fears
revealing his arrest could make Egypt the target of anger by other
terrorists.
	   Born in Jaffa in then-Palestine in 1937, Abu Nidal's main
targets have been Israelis. But he also was blamed for killing some
of Yasser Arafat's chief aides after he split with the PLO leader,
claiming Arafat was not keeping up the struggle against Israel.
	   Over the years Abu Nidal is said to have operated out of Iraq,
Syria and Libya.
	   The terrorist leader is not wanted in the United States, though
he has been blamed for blowing up two American airliners: a Pan Am
jet on the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in 1974 in the
air over the Aegean Sea. The combined death toll was 120.
	   His most famous attacks were the twin assaults on ticket
counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna airports
on Dec. 27, 1985. Eighteen people were killed and 120 wounded.
	   It was a Palestinian in Lebanon who asked the question about
``which Abu Nidal,'' raising the theory that the famous terrorist
actually is dead and that some followers have used his famous nom
de guerre. The Palestinian, once close to Abu Nidal's group, spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Over the years, the chain-smoking Abu Nidal has been reported to
have died of cancer or a heart attack. After reports of his death
in the mid-1980s, he was quoted in one interview as saying:
	   ``I'm neither a ghost nor a phantom. I am Abu Nidal of flesh and
blood ... this evil spirit which moves around only at night ...
causing these people constant nightmares.''

Report: Spanish police believe ETA leaders have moved to Belgium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police believe the leadership of
the armed Basque separatist group ETA has moved from France to
Belgium in search of a safer haven, a newspaper reported here
Wednesday.
	   Without citing its sources, the daily El Mundo said authorities
believe three ETA members had set up headquarters in Belgium. It
named the three alleged members as Inaki Gracia Arregi, Mikel
Albisu Iriarte and Eusebio Arzalluz.
	   The paper said the switch had annoyed the Spanish government
given the souring in relations with Belgium in recent weeks
following the release of a suspected ETA member by that country's
judiciary.
	   But a Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman shot down the El Mundo
report as ``pure speculation'' and said authorities ``had no
indication that the ETA leaders were in Belgium.''
	   The spokesman, customarily not identified, said authorities
still believed ETA's leadership to be in France.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in a three-decade
campaign for independence from Spain.
	   Police believe its members have long used France as a safe haven
from which to plot operations in Spain. With increased bilateral
ties in recent years, however, French police have begun cracking
down on suspected ETA members, extraditing many back to Spain.
	   In 1996, Spain temporarily suspended judicial cooperation with
Belgium when Brussels freed a Basque couple suspected of sheltering
ETA gunmen.
	   The separatists are believed to have some support among
nationalist groups demanding independence for Belgium's northern
Flanders region.

Singapore government, Netscape launch electronic commerce venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's government-owned trade network
linked up with a U.S.-based Netscape Communications Corporations on
Wednesday in a deal that will boost electronic commerce in the
region through the Internet.
	   The agreement will combine Singapore Network Service's existing
customer base of 20,000 users in industries and government
organizations with Netscape's software and expertise in Internet
commerce.
	   ``SNS is recognized as a premier electronic commerce provider in
Asia, with an impressive user base in Singapore and the region,''
Netscape President Jim Barksdale said in a press conference.
	   He said that SNS's qualities ``complement perfectly with
Netscape's pioneering vision, technology and worldwide expertise.''
	   ``The combined strengths of SNS and Netscape make this a
world-class partnership,'' said Barksdale.
	   In the lecture before the signing ceremony, Barksdale spoke
about the fast emerging ``net economy'' expected to connect through
the Internet more than 1.3 million companies around the world by
2000.
	   By 2002, Forrester Research estimates the e-commerce market
value to hit dlrs 300 billion. In Singapore alone trading on the
Internet is expected to grow from the current dlrs 5 million to
dlrs 1 billion by 2001.
	   Barksdale said the net economy presents a ``unique opportunity
for Asia to jumpstart an economic recovery'' by streamlining their
operations with Internet-based technologies and building on-line
businesses to penetrate into new international markets.
	   Cyber technology has already permeated every walk of life in
this affluent island nation of 3.1 million. The Singapore
government is now the first to mobilize the whole nation into the
net economy.
	   SNS' managing director Pearleen Chan said the agreement will
give Singapore a chance to be a ``major player in the net economy
that is so rapidly evolving worldwide.''

Explosive device damages Hyundai car dealership in Athens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with police saying explosive
device was hand grenade, CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An explosion early Tuesday damaged a
central Athens branch of the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai
but caused no injuries, police said.
	   The blast, caused by what police later identified as a hand
grenade, occurred at around 12:45 a.m. (2145 GMT) outside the
entrance of a Hyundai branch in the central Athens district of Nea
Halkidona, authorities said.
	   Damage to the building was not severe. There was no immediate
claim of responsibility.
	   The South Korean company has been facing problems at home, with
employees staging a month-long strike to protest the company's plan
to lay off workers.
	   The attack came less than 24 hours after two gas canister bombs
exploded in central Athens, one outside a Commercial Bank branch
and one outside the capital's town planning headquarters.
	   Both blasts caused damage but no injuries.
	   A little-known group called Autonomous Cells of Revolutionary
Action claimed responsibility for those attacks in a telephone call
to a local radio station. The group has claimed five attacks so far
this year, including the April bombing of a branch office of
Britain's Barcleys bank.
	   The group said it was protesting the January arrest of Nikos
Maziotis, who was charged with heading a leftist firebombing ring.
	   Similar devices have been used to torch more than 150 cars and
offices since January. They belonged to officials, politicians,
Jewish and anti-Semitic groups, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy groups little known to
authorities.

Chief of Iran's civil aviation dies in plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The head of Iran's Civil Aviation
Organization died Wednesday when the small plane he was in crashed
in heavy fog, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   It said Ali Shahcheraghi, 42, died when the single-engine plane
crashed after taking off from the northern city of Rasht, where it
had stopped to refuel. He had been responsible for Iran's civil
aviation since 1993.
	   The pilot also died in the crash, the agency said.
	   IRNA said Shahcheraghi was en route from Tehran to the
northwestern city of Ardebil to meet with Transport Minister
Mahmoud Hojati.
	   The agency gave no other details.
	   Rasht is 230 kilometers (140 miles) northwest of Tehran.

Libya to announce decision on Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya was to announce a decision Wednesday
on whether to accept a U.S.-British proposal to try two Libyan
suspects in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger jet.
	   State-run Libyan television said ``a detailed statement'' was
being prepared after a meeting Tuesday involving government
officials, lawyers and other experts. The broadcast was monitored
in the Egyptian capital Cairo.
	   The Libyans are to respond to a joint American and British
proposal that the Libyan suspects be tried by a panel of three
Scottish judges under Scottish law in The Hague, the Netherlands.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, believed to be about 45, and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah,
about 41, cannot be extradited from the Netherlands. And it says
that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters late Tuesday
the offer from the United States and Britain was a ``definite
improvement'' over their previous stance, which was that any trial
must be held on their territories.
	   ``The offer is more flexible than earlier ones and fulfills one
of Libya's demand for a trial in a third country,'' Moussa said.
	   He added: ``We hope the offer will lead to a lifting of the
embargo.''
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Libya had demanded that an international panel try the Libyans
in a neutral country.
	   In Britain, Alistair Duff, a Scottish counsel for the Libyans,
told The Guardian newspaper that the fact that three judges, rather
than an international panel, would try the case was ``not
insurmountable.''
	   He added, however, that some issues remained unresolved: ``Where
are the suspects going to be held in custody? Are they going to be
guaranteed safe passage to and, in the event of acquittal, from,
the trial?''
	   A further problem could involve Libya's demand that U.N.
sanctions be lifted once the suspects are turned over.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday considered a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands for
trial.
	   But the resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of 170 the passengers and
crew.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere last year said Libyan
officials gave cooperation in his investigation that ``satisfied
most of the French demands.''
	   Libya's official JANA news agency reported Tuesday that Gadhafi
had received a telephone call from South African President Nelson
Mandela during which the Lockerbie case was discussed. It gave no
other details.
	   Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday said President Hosni Mubarak
also had called Gadhafi on the case, but gave no details.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab League who has
long worked for a compromise in the Lockerbie affair, said Tuesday
he expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   He spoke to reporters after meeting Tuesday with British
Ambassador David Blatherwick, who outlined the Western proposal.
	   The 22-member league is headquartered in Cairo.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A prominent American economist said Wednesday
that the IMF's economic reforms aren't working in Asia and that the
region should try to stimulate its battered economies by printing
more money to cause inflation.
	   ``The time has come to do something radical,'' said Paul
Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics
professor who gained some renown by predicting Asia's demise before
its bubble burst and the crisis began a year ago.
	   In a speech to a conference of business executives, Krugman said
the International Monetary Fund bailout program, which includes
large aid packages and painful economic reforms, has not worked in
countries such as Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
	   He said a severe recession is now spreading across the entire
region and ``what Asia needs is inflation with increased
liquidity.'' He recommended putting more money into circulation,
especially in Japan, to encourage inflation and lower interest
rates. Krugman said the value of the yen should be allowed to fall
even further against the U.S. dollar.
	   Currently, he said, Japan's monetary policy is trying to prevent
the yen from falling further, regardless of whether or not that
helps the nation's economy.
	   Krugman said his remedies would boost consumer spending and
growth.
	   ``Japan is in a liquidity trap: People want to save more than
investors want to invest,'' he said. ``Inflation is the way out.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's government-owned trade network
linked up with a U.S.-based Netscape Communications Corporations on
Wednesday in a deal that will boost electronic commerce in the
region through the Internet.
	   The agreement will combine Singapore Network Service's existing
customer base of 20,000 users in industries and government
organizations with Netscape's software and expertise in Internet
commerce.
	   ``SNS is recognized as a premier electronic commerce provider in
Asia, with an impressive user base in Singapore and the region,''
Netscape President Jim Barksdale said in a press conference.
	   He said that SNS's qualities ``complement perfectly with
Netscape's pioneering vision, technology and worldwide expertise.''
	   ``The combined strengths of SNS and Netscape make this a
world-class partnership,'' said Barksdale.
	   In the lecture before the signing ceremony, Barksdale spoke
about the fast emerging ``net economy'' expected to connect through
the Internet more than 1.3 million companies around the world by
2000.
	   By 2002, Forrester Research estimates the e-commerce market
value to hit dlrs 300 billion. In Singapore alone trading on the
Internet is expected to grow from the current dlrs 5 million to
dlrs 1 billion by 2001.
	   Barksdale said the net economy presents a ``unique opportunity
for Asia to jumpstart an economic recovery'' by streamlining their
operations with Internet-based technologies and building on-line
businesses to penetrate into new international markets.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Petroleum Authority of Thailand
will begin exporting fuel oil for the first time in early 1999 due
to falling domestic demand and new emission standards forcing a
switch to natural gas.
	   Company Vice President Toemchai Bunnag said the authority
expects to offer almost 100,000 tons a month on the Singapore
market from next year as the state Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand switches to natural gas.
	   Bunnag said that though new emission standards are still only on
the drawing board, the electricity authority will reduce monthly
consumption of fuel oil by as much as 300,000 tons in the second
half of this year. The cuts could double over the next two years.
	   Bunnag said the petroleum authority did not need to export fuel
oil this year as major refiners had cut back by some 20 percent
from full-capacity output levels.
	   Bunnag added that a drop in domestic electricity consumption by
some 7 percent due to Thailand's deepening recession added to the
need to find new markets for the fuel oil.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's soaring unemployment
rate hit a 32-year high of 7.6 percent in July, with 1.65 million
people out of work, the government said Wednesday.
	   The unemployment rate will continue to rise, reaching 8 percent
by year's end, analysts predicted. That would mean more than 2
million people out of jobs, a level which could create serious
social instability.
	   ``The jobless rate is rising very rapidly _ and very
dangerously,'' said Oh Su-won, a researcher at Dongwon Securities
and Investment Co.
	   The Office of National Statistics said July's jobless rate of
7.6 percent was up from 7 percent in June, 6.9 percent in May and
6.7 percent in April.
	   The July jobless rate was the highest since 1966 when it was 8.4
percent.
	   Thousands of South Korean companies have collapsed since the
country called in the International Monetary Fund in December to
bail out its battered economy.
	   Analysts said the economy is expected to continue to shrink at
least until the first half of next year.
	   Finance and Economy Minister Lee Kyu-sung predicted in a report
to the National Assembly Tuesday that South Korea's economy would
contract by up to 6 percent this year, one percentage point lower
than he had previously forecast.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British communications giant BT said
Wednesday it will expand its telecommunications services in Asia
with SatLink Asia, a cross-border service now available in
Australia and five other markets.
	   SatLink Asia is the first pan-Asian satellite service offered by
BT, and will extend the company's coverage across the region.
	   Ian McKenzie, chief operating officer, BT global strategic
markets, said SatLink Asia was developed to meet the increasing
demands of multinationals and large regional corporations for
reliable telecommunications services in Asia.
	   ``SatLink offers them connectivity into remote areas where
infrastructure is poor or service is unavailable.
	   ``By providing a reliable, resilient and highly secure solution,
SatLink Asia is a real and attractive alternative to current
communications available in the region.''

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Telecommunications giant Telstra
Corp. Ltd. on Wednesday posted an Australian record annual net
profit of 3 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.74 billion) for
1997/98.
	   Telstra's net earnings were up 85 percent from the 1.62 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 939 million) posted in the previous
year and exceeded its prospectus forecasts.
	   Sales revenue for the year rose to 16.8 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 9.74 billion).
	   ``Currently Telstra is relatively insulated from the Asian
economic downturn, with no significant exposure,'' Telstra said in
a statement.
	   ``If the Asian problems reduce growth in the Australian economy
this would have an impact on Telstra's operations, although still a
lesser impact than on the Australian economy in general,'' it said.
	   Telstra's net profit is the highest recorded by a listed
Australian company, topping National Australia Bank Ltd.'s 2.22
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.28 billion) in the fiscal
year ended Sep. 30, 1997.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales in Japan of Microsoft's new Windows 98
operating system topped 500,000 in the first month, more than
triple the software giant's own forecasts, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   More than 250,000 copies of the Japanese-language version were
sold in the first two days after it hit store shelves here July 25,
the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source in
the company.
	   A spokesman for Microsoft in Japan refused to confirm the sales
figures.
	   But spokesman Akira Iwase did say that ``sales have been much
better than we expected.''
	   Japanese consumers' appetite for the new operating system
surprised Microsoft, which had projected it would take three months
to sell 500,000 copies, the newspaper reported.
	   The strong demand for Windows 98 has helped boost Japan's
sagging computer market, with sales of personal computers rising by
as much as 30 percent since the new system was released, the report
said.

Israeli-backed militia member killed in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALIK MAOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A member of an Israeli-backed
Lebanese militia was killed Wednesday in sporadic exchanges of fire
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas, the Israeli army
spokesman said.
	   The shelling erupted after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night, injuring 19 civilians.
	   Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim guerrilla force, used
mortars, machine guns and rockets to attack positions of the
Israeli army and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army (SPA)
militia, the spokesman said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Israeli artillery returned fire on guerrilla positions.
	   An Israeli military official said the army did not seek an
escalation of tensions and was responding to ongoing Hezbollah
attacks rather than acting in reprisal for Tuesday night's rocket
barrage on northern Israeli towns and settlements.
	   The Katyusha bombardment followed the killing of Hossam al-Amin,
a leader of the military wing of the Shiite Amal militia. An
Israeli helicopter ambushed his car, blowing up the vehicle as it
traveled along the coastal highway in south Lebanon.
	   Soon after, Amal and Hezbollah fired two salvos of rockets into
Israel.
	   However, Hezbollah said the rocket attack on northern Israel and
the subsequent exchanges stemmed from a different incident - the
killing of a Lebanese civilian by the Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   An Israeli military official concurred, saying a Lebanese
civilian was killed and five others wounded in an attack on the
south Lebanese village of Maghara.
	   There was controversy in Israel on Wednesday over the wisdom of
killing al-Amin. Legislator Ori Orr, who is a retired general, said
it was a mistake, because Israeli civilians could have easily been
killed in the Katyusha bombardment.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Army radio.
	   However his Labor party colleague Ephraim Sneh, who is also a
retired general, said the killing was justified. Interviewed on
Israel radio he said ``That is the correct and the most effective
way to fight terrorism, by killing their key figures.''
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in bomb
shelters, emerged Wednesday morning when the army declared the
alert over. However civil defense wardens were instructed to leave
the shelters unlocked in case the situation deteriorates.

Indonesia says East Timor rebel leader will not get special
</HEADLINE>
treatment
 &UR; Eds: One name only for Muladi is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The jailed rebel leader of the restive
Indonesian territory of East Timor will not receive lenient
treatment despite international calls for his freedom, the
government said Wednesday.
	   Guerrilla chief Xanana Gusmao was arrested in 1992 for fighting
against Indonesian control of East Timor. Under former President
Suharto, Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later.
	   ``There will be no special treatment for Xanana because he was
convicted of a crime,'' Justice Minister Muladi said. ``So the
government will not provide him a special treatment, like house
arrest.''
	   Muladi, however, said a resolution of Gusmao's case must be part
of an agreement over East Timor.
	   In line with democratic reforms, President B.J. Habibie has
released dozens of political prisoners who were jailed while his
autocratic predecessor, Suharto, was still in power. Suharto quit
in May after riots and student protests.
	   The government has indicated that Gusmao, who is serving a
20-year sentence in Jakarta's Cipinang prison, will not be freed
until a peace settlement had been reached over disputed East Timor.
	   Habibie has offered a measure of autonomy for East Timor and
wants to maintain Indonesian authority. Gusmao and other East
Timorese activists have demanded a vote on independence for the
territory of 800,000 people.
	   Indonesia has refused calls from international human rights
groups and foreign leaders, including European lawmakers and South
African President Nelson Mandela, to free Gusmao.

Report: Spanish police believe ETA leaders have moved to Belgium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police believe the leadership of
the armed Basque separatist group ETA has moved from France to
Belgium in search of a safer haven, a Spanish newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Without citing its sources, the daily El Mundo said authorities
believe three ETA members had set up headquarters in Belgium. It
named the three alleged members as Inaki Gracia Arregi, Mikel
Albisu Iriarte and Eusebio Arzalluz.
	   The paper said the switch had annoyed the Spanish government
given the souring in relations with Belgium in recent weeks
following the release of a suspected ETA member by that country's
judiciary.
	   But a Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman shot down the El Mundo
report as ``pure speculation'' and said authorities ``had no
indication that the ETA leaders were in Belgium.''
	   The spokesman, who spoke on customary anonymity, said
authorities still believed ETA's leadership to be in France.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in a three-decade
campaign for independence from Spain.
	   Police believe its members have long used France as a safe haven
from which to plot operations in Spain. With increased bilateral
ties in recent years, however, French police have begun cracking
down on suspected ETA members, extraditing many back to Spain.
	   In 1996, Spain temporarily suspended judicial cooperation with
Belgium when Brussels freed a Basque couple suspected of sheltering
ETA gunmen.
	   The separatists are believed to have some support among
nationalist groups demanding independence for Belgium's northern
Flanders region.

Dutch publisher posts 22 percent net profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch publisher VNU said Wednesday
its first-half profit rose 22 percent to 242 million guilders (dlrs
110 million), lifted mainly by its business information activities
in the United States and Europe.
	   The results were above expectations. Analysts had estimated net
earnings for the first six months of 1998 at 219 million guilders
(dlrs 99.5 million) at most.
	   World Directories, purchased late last year from New York-based
ITT for 4.3 billion guilders (dlrs 1.9 billion), contributed 35
million guilders (dlrs 16 million) to earnings before extraordinary
items, VNU said. The unit boosted operating income by a windfall of
172 million guilders (dlrs 78 million).
	   For the whole of 1998, the company improved its profit forecast,
saying it expects growth in earnings per share before extraordinary
items to be around 30 percent. VNU had said earlier it expected net
earnings to rise by at least 10 percent.
	   VNU said progress in its consumer magazine division was moderate
due to higher paper costs. Operating income for the division was
117 million guilders (dlrs 53 million), up from 109 million
guilders (dlrs 49.5 million) in the first half of last year.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Singapore received a
telephoned bomb threat Wednesday morning, a spokeswoman said. No
bomb was found and the embassy resumed operations in an hour.
	   The spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
threat was received by the embassy switchboard operator just after
11 a.m.
	   ``After assuring the safety of the public, the embassy took
appropriate steps in accordance with worldwide procedures to also
assure the safety of its personnel and property,'' she said.
	   Another spokesman said no bomb was found and the embassy was
back to normal in an hour.
	   ``We believe it was a hoax,'' said Jamal Singh, Director of
Operations at the Singapore Police Force, who also confirmed that
no bomb was discovered.
	   Singh said the embassy informed the police about the threat and
officers were sent.
	   ``But the embassy managed to solve the situation without our
assistance,'' he said.
	   Opened in 1997, the high-security embassy is popularly referred
to as the ``Fort on the Hill.''

Indian court orders probe into deaths due to adulterated mustard

oil &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A court in India has ordered the federal
government to immediately investigate about two dozen deaths in the
capital from dropsy caused by adulterated mustard oil, a local news
agency reported.
	   Two justices of the Delhi High Court also ordered the government
to ban shops from selling oil in open containers, a practice widely
followed in poor neighborhoods, United News of India news agency
reported.
	   The court was hearing a public interest lawsuit following the 22
deaths in the capital in recent weeks.
	   Officials have found large stocks of mustard oil to be
contaminated with the seeds of an ornamental plant, which is
virtually indistinguishable from the black mustard seeds.
	   Persons consuming the adulterated oil have complained of
swelling of the feet, vomiting, diarrhea and difficulty in
breathing. Untreated cases usually result in death.
	   Mustard oil is widely used in northern India for cooking and for
massage.

Chinese dissident jailed 7 years on fraud charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese court had insufficient evidence in
convicting and sentencing a labor rights activist to seven years in
prison for fraud, a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   A court in Mianyang city in Sichuan province sentenced Li Bifeng
on Monday, and Li appealed to a higher court, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
	   Although Li was put on trial for fraud stemming from a business
dispute, overseas human rights groups believe he was punished for
informing them about a massive labor protest in Sichuan province
last year.
	   Li's lawyer argued the dissident was innocent and had no
connection to the dispute, New York-based Human Rights in China
said in a statement. The court did not have sufficient material
evidence or witnesses to back the conviction, it said.
	   Li, 34, was jailed in March and charged with fraud on July 9,
less than a week after U.S. President Bill Clinton ended his China
visit on July 3.
	   Police detained more than 20 dissidents after the visit, most
for trying to form an opposition political party. The clampdown is
one of the most sustained actions against the persecuted dissident
community.
	   In a separate development, police in Shanghai questioned the
wife of a jailed computer engineer for an hour Tuesday and
threatened her with arrest if she persisted in campaigning for her
husband's release, the Hong Kong rights group said Wednesday.
	   Lin Hai, the 30-year-old founder and manager of a computer
software company in Shanghai, was detained in March for sending
30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to a U.S.-based Internet democracy
magazine. He faces trial on charges of ``inciting the overthrow of
state power.''
	   Police asked Lin's wife, Xu Hong, about her contacts with
overseas news media and a letter she wrote to Premier Zhu Rongji on
her husband's case, the rights group said.
	   Police warned Xu that if she continued to contact overseas news
organizations the next time they saw her might be in a detention
center, the group said.
	   Lin's case underscores renewed determination by Communist Party
leaders to fend off challenges to their rule that increasingly are
made on the hard to police Internet.
	   Last month, exiled democracy campaigners in the United States
said Chinese police arrested the publishers of Tunnel, a weekly
on-line magazine of dissident writings. The exiles said a virus
engineered by police wiped out their web site and other
pro-democracy on-line publications.

Floods wash away bridge; export consignments pile up in port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Surging flood waters in Bangladesh
washed away a bridge over an irrigation canal, snapping links
between the capital and 19 southern districts, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Most of the 120-foot (36-meter) bridge over the canal on the
Daultadia-Khulna Highway was washed away Tuesday, said an official
at the Communication Ministry.
	   Engineers were trying to restore road links, he said on
condition of anonymity. The area is 136 kilometers (85 miles)
southwest of capital Dhaka.
	   Floods have already damaged large sections of two main highways
linking Dhaka with the southern port city of Chittagong and the
eastern city of Sylhet, stranding thousands of trucks carrying food
and essential supplies.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in Dhaka said the rise
in water level in the Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins had
caused further deterioration in the flood condition.
	   Health Ministry officials reported 12 more deaths Tuesday,
raising the death toll to 580 since July 15.

	   CONG, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish and British prime ministers,
Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair, meet Wednesday at a remote western
Irish castle here to discuss their joint initiative to crack down
on dissident paramilitary groups opposed to the Northern Ireland
peace accord.
	   ``We are doing everything we can in a sensible and measured way
to make sure we bear down on those elements who are still committed
to using acts of terrorism,'' Blair told reporters before heading
to Cong for the meeting in a luxury hotel.
	   Blair announced the proposed new measures during a visit Tuesday
to the boarded-up, gutted downtown of Omagh, the town in Northern
Ireland where a car bomb set off by Irish Republican Army
dissidents killed 28 people and wounded 330 others on Aug.15.
	   He said Parliament would be recalled Sept. 2 to approve
legislation making it easier to secure convictions against
suspected members of violent paramilitary groups accused of
organizing attacks in defiance of April's peace accord.
	   The proposals _ which Blair announced after shaking hands and
saying ``I'm so sorry'' to hundreds of appreciative residents in
drizzling rain _ closely mirror proposed laws that the Irish
government intends to enact at its own emergency parliamentary
session before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives Sept. 3 to tour
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Ahern said the recall of both parliaments on the same dates
``symbolizes effectively the shared determination of the two
governments to deal decisively with any groups who persist in
violence in defiance of the clear will of the people of the
island.''

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The bombing of a crowded Planet
Hollywood restaurant probably came in retaliation for the U.S.
attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan but was likely the work of a local
group, government officials said Wednesday.
	   The blast Tuesday evening killed one person and wounded 27 in
Cape Town's waterfront, a popular tourist destination.
	   A leader of Muslims Against Global Oppression denied his group
was responsible for the Tuesday evening blast despite a claim of
responsibility by a caller to radio station Cape Talk.
	   ``Anyone can call a radio station and say they are from MAGO,''
Moain Achmad, the group's coordinator, told The Associated Press
Wednesday.
	   He condemned the bombing and speculated it was carried out to
discredit Islam and scare people away from a march his group was
organizing on the U.S. Embassy on Saturday to protest the U.S.
attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Washington, the State Department said Muslims Against Global
Oppression was anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. Some members were
among the 40 or so people who protested U.S. policies on Iraq and
Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape Town in
March.
	   The White House condemned the bombing but said it had no
information it was ``politically motivated.''
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the bombing
was probably linked to the U.S. cruise-missile attacks, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio reported. The U.S. attacks were
themselves retaliation for the bombings earlier this month of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Mufamadi said South African officials would work with the FBI to
investigate.
	   President Nelson Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said
police had ``indications'' a pipe bomb was responsible.
	   ``These pipe bombs ... are a very common phenomenon in the
Western Cape, which might be an indication that we are not dealing
with an international network but a local group,'' he said.
	   A Muslim vigilante organization, People Against Drugs and
Gangsterism, has been widely blamed for pipe bomb attacks in recent
years targeting suspected gangsters and drug dealers in the area.
	   ``As far as President Mandela is concerned, it is immaterial
whether the bombing is retaliation or not. We will still treat it
as an attack against innocent South Africans, against innocent
people,'' Mankahlana said.
	   Though initially saying the person killed was a woman, police
later said it was a man.
	   Standard Bank identified the victim as Fanie Schoeman, an
employee in the human resources department. The bank was holding a
going-away party at the eatery in Cape Town's trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront.
	   Seven other people at the party were injured, two seriously,
said Standard Bank spokesman Erik Larson.
	   Five members of a family from Hampshire, England, were injured.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Iris Giddings, 65, the only member
unharmed, was quoted as saying by Press Association.
	   ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as the
ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us. I was knocked down
and saw my family all lying injured before me. It was one of the
most terrible things I could imagine seeing.''
	   Planet Hollywood's bar, covered in blood, bore the brunt of the
blast, which cracked walls, shattered windows and lifted part of
the ceiling off the restaurant. It then fell back into place.
	   A small crater in a corner of the bar marked the apparent spot
where the bomb went off.
	   A glass booth holding a mannequin of movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger was shattered at the restaurant entrance.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, the franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.

Myanmar's main pagoda closed amid rumors of protest

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pagoda still closed, 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The most sacred pagoda in Myanmar was
closed Wednesday amid rumors that opposition groups were planning a
lightning protest at the site.
	   Shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, a dazzling,
bell-shaped, gold-encrusted Buddhist shrine, were told by the
pagodas's board of trustees at 9 a.m. to shut down for cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said, however, that they heard a group of
pro-democracy protesters was coming to the pagoda. The shrine was
still closed late Wednesday afternoon.
	   The first street protest against military rule in nearly two
years erupted Monday in Yangon as about 200 students spilled into
the streets near Yangon University.
	   They were supporting a demand by the opposition National League
for Democracy that the military regime convene the parliament
elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military refused to honor the result. The NLD said recently it
would convene parliament on its own, prompting the military to warn
that its leaders would be arrested and the party declared illegal.
	   The NLD, led by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi,
has not retracted its statement saying it will convene parliament.
	   Suu Kyi spent Wednesday recovering from kidney problems,
dizziness, low blood pressure and urinary tract problems she
suffered while staging a protest against the military's
restrictions on her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues spent 13 days living in a van on a
bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital. They were
stopped there by the authorities for the fourth time in two months
while attempting to reach the city of Bassein to meet NLD members.
	   She ended her protest Monday after her party pleaded with her to
conserve her health.
	   The military government said she visited the site of the student
protest, which had already been broken up by police, on her way
back home.
	   No one was arrested during the protest. Rumors have been
circulating in Yangon and Bangkok that more demonstrations will
take place in Myanmar's capital.
	   The shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda sell items for worship
in their stalls which line the long stairways to the pagoda's upper
platform.
	   The said the pagoda's trustees told them the shrine was being
closed for a major cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said that the pagoda had never been closed for a
cleaning, which is done each day by volunteers while it remains
open.
	   It has even remained open during major renovation work and
visits by leaders of the military government, who are extremely
security conscious.

Iraqi paper urges Arabs to eject American military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper on Wednesday
called on Arab countries to eject U.S. troops from their land and
waters in response to the missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The call in the daily Babil, published by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's son Odai, came in an editorial criticizing Arabs for not
taking action in response to last week's attacks.
	   Babil noted that the 22-member Arab League, headquartered in
Cairo, Egypt, had condemned the missile strikes, made in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   ``The condemnation of the attack was a good improvement in Arab
stands against outside challenges ... not as in the past, when some
Arabs were reluctant for fear they would anger America,'' the
editorial said.
	   It complained, however, that the league didn't call for action.
	   It said Arabs leaders should ``end American military presence on
Arab lands and waters and put Arab interests ahead of American or
other interests in the region.''
	   U.S. missiles last Thursday hit camps in Afghanistan used by
followers of Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was
behind the embassy bombings. U.S. missiles also hit a factory in
Sudan that the United States contends was making precursors for VX
nerve gas based on an Iraqi formula.
	   Reports from Washington have said the missiles were fired from
U.S. warships in the Red and Arabia seas.
	   The editorial noted that both Libya and Iraq have been ``exposed
to American harm'' in past U.S. attacks.
	   In 1986, U.S. warplanes bombing the Libyan cities of Tripoli and
Benghazi to retaliate for the bombing of a disco in Germany in
which American servicemen were killed. The Americans fired missiles
at Iraq in 1993 to retaliate for its alleged role in a plot to
assassinate former U.S. President George Bush during a visit to
Kuwait.

assistance,'' he added.
	   Opened in 1997, the high-security embassy is popularly referred
to as the ``Fort on the Hill.''
	   U.S. Embassies around the world have been placed on alert since
the August 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.
Washington retaliated on August 20 by bombing targets in
Afghanistan and Pakistan identified as terrorist sites.
	   The Singapore government condemned acts of terrorism last week
but stopped short of condoning the U.S. missile strikes.

Independent daily Nasa Borba stops publishing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Nasa Borba, Serbia's first and most
respected independent daily, stopped publishing Wednesday due to
deep financial problems and an internal rift between the owner and
journalists.
	   The temporary shutdown of Nasa Borba is a huge blow to Serbia's
independent media. It has been the most reliable quality newspaper,
offering analytical articles about Serbia's political and economic
troubles.
	   Nasa Borba (Our Struggle) was established in 1994 after the
government of then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic took over
the Borba daily, which was highly critical of the government. All
the journalists left and formed Nasa Borba.
	   During the Yugoslav wars, Nasa Borba was critical of Milosevic's
nationalist policies and received the Golden Pen international
award for its ethnic tolerance.
	   But the daily with a circulation of about 20,000 recently has
been faced with a steep drop in sales and growing financial
problems. The employees have blamed the owner, a businessman, for
the problems and organized several strikes in the past few months.
	   Dusan Mijic, the owner, shrugged off the accusations in a letter
published on the front page of Nasa Borba's farewell and free copy
Wednesday, arguing that he had not had enough support from the
journalists.
	   He added he was temporarily halting publication to do
``financial and personnel restructuring and freshen up the
editorial team ...''

Philippine economy expected to decline in second quarter: Official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Preliminary data show the Philippine
economy contracted in the second quarter of this year because of
steep drops in agriculture and manufacturing, a top economics
official said Thursday.
	   ``The second quarter figures aren't going to be very good,''
Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla told members of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   The Philippines is due to release its growth data for the second
quarter on Friday. Medalla said he will see the final data late
Thursday.
	   Medalla, Director General of the National Economic and
Development Authority, said the second-quarter growth data will be
marked by steep declines in agricultural and manufacturing
production that were not offset by gains in the services sector.
	   Rep. Joey Salcedo, an economist, said the poor economic
performance in the second quarter could result in as much as a 1.5
percent fall in gross domestic product principally because of
contraction in agriculture and investments.
	   To offset the decline, the industry and service sectors must
grow by at least 5 percent in the second quarter for the GDP to
rise by 2.5 percent, the low side of government estimates.
	   ``This is a tall order,'' he said.
	   ``The recessionary momentum is starting to accelerate in the
Philippines,'' he said. ``Although in fairness, it is nlikely to
hit the dismal proportions being experienced by Thailand and
Indonesia.''
	   The gross national product in the first quarter grew 2.5
percent.
	   Medalla expects an improvement in the economy over the rest of
the year and that there will be GNP growth for 1998 as a whole.
However, comments by Medalla over the extent of the growth were
open to wide interpretation.
	   Medalla said that government's target of GNP growing 2 percent-3
percent this year is still attainable.
	   The International Monetary Fund last week said the Philippines
will be ``lucky'' to post a 1 percent growth this year because of
the sharp drop in agricultural production caused by a severe El
Nino-induced drought.
	   ``There will be modest growth,'' said Medalla, who had
criticized the IMF's ``irresponsible forecast.'' He added that
growth may in fact be a ``little bit lower than modest.''
	   Still, the Philippine economy will at least grow this year,
unlike many of its neighbors in the region, he said.

South Korean government pledges no more intervention in labor
</HEADLINE>
disputes

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Criticized for mediating the end of a
recent strike at Hyundai Motor Co., Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho said
Wednesday the government will stay out of future labor disputes.
	   ``The government mediated the Hyundai Motor situation because a
prolonged strike threatened to worsen the economic crisis,'' Lee
told a news conference.
	   ``In the future, the government will leave labor strikes to be
resolved by the union and management, and there will be no more
direct government intervention or mediation,'' he said.
	   Business leaders accused the government of caving in to
Hyundai's union by forcing the company to accept far fewer layoffs
than it originally planned.
	   That, in turn, will make it harder for other businesses to shed
unnecessary workers because of falling domestic and foreign sales
due to Asia's economic crisis, critics and analysts said
	   The labor minister was one of the key mediators at Hyundai,
where workers halted operations for more than a month to protest
proposed layoffs.
	   The strike ended Monday after the union and management agreed to
reduce the number of workers to be laid off to 277. The company had
planned to fire more than 1,500.
	   Lee claimed that the number of layoffs at Hyundai should include
6,451 employees who took early retirement earlier this year and
about 1,200 others who will go on unpaid leave for 18 months.

Iraqi paper urges Arabs to eject American military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper on Wednesday
called on Arab countries to eject U.S. troops from their land and
waters in response to the missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The call in the daily Babil, published by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's son Odai, came in an editorial criticizing Arabs for not
taking action in response to last week's attacks.
	   Babil noted that the 22-member Arab League, headquartered in
Cairo, Egypt, had condemned the missile strikes, made in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   ``The condemnation of the attack was a good improvement in Arab
stands against outside challenges ... not as in the past, when some
Arabs were reluctant for fear they would anger America,'' the
editorial said.
	   It complained, however, that the league didn't call for action.
	   It said Arabs leaders should ``end American military presence on
Arab lands and waters and put Arab interests ahead of American or
other interests in the region.''
	   U.S. missiles last Thursday hit camps in Afghanistan used by
followers of Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was
behind the embassy bombings. U.S. missiles also hit a factory in
Sudan that the United States contends was making precursors for VX
nerve gas based on an Iraqi formula.
	   Reports from Washington have said the missiles were fired from
U.S. warships in the Red and Arabian seas.

Protesters ask Beijing to stop aid to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Activists marched to the Chinese Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday and demanded Beijing end aid to Indonesia,
where officials have denied reports that ethnic Chinese women were
raped during recent riots.
	   The protesters, led by the Democrats, Hong Kong's major
opposition party, criticized comments Monday by Indonesia's
intelligence chief that his investigation had found no evidence of
widespread rape.
	   ``We are very outraged by the expression made by the chief of
intelligence,'' Lt. Gen. Moetojib, said lawmaker Albert Ho.
	   About 25 protesters, including several Indonesian Chinese, waved
banners saying: ``We demand the Chinese government to exert
pressure on Indonesia to ensure the safety of ethnic Chinese.''
	   A ministry official received the protesters' petition addressed
to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, calling for China to withdraw its
promised U.S. dlrs 373 million in loans and U.S. dlrs 27 million in
flood aid to the country.
	   Beijing has condemned the anti-Chinese violence, but has not
indicated that it will withdraw aid to the country.
	   Women's rights groups alleged at least 168 women and girls,
including many ethnic Chinese, were raped during the May riots, in
which 1,200 people were killed. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas Tuesday said investigations are continuing.
	   Women's groups in Hong Kong are demanding a United Nations
investigation into the rapes, the South China Morning Post
reported.
	   Outraged by the anti-Chinese riots, ethnic Chinese have
protested outside Indonesian diplomatic offices, in China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and the United States.
	   Ethnic Chinese represent only 4 percent of Indonesia's 202
million population, but control an estimated 70 percent of the
economy. They were targeted in the May riots and scapegoated for
the country's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Eight-nation soccer tournament opens in Vietnam

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The World Cup has been over for 1 1/2
months, but you sure couldn't tell that Wednesday in Vietnam when
the soccer-crazy country got in the mood for the eight-nation Tiger
Cup.
	   Even though the gates didn't open until 2 p.m., people with
general-admission tickets began showing up in the morning, packing
an adjacent street, so they could grab prime spots.
	   Two hours before the kickoff of the Singapore-Malaysia match,
entire sections already had filled up.
	   Thousands of other fans milled around outside the stadium,
painting their faces with the gold-star-on-red-background
Vietnamese flag. Their team was playing Laos in the night match,
following an elaborate opening ceremony sandwiched between the two
games.
	   Capitalism at its best and worst was in evidence everywhere.
	   Virtually every nearby home was turned into a makeshift outdoor
cafe. One vendor said she had sold nearly 100 small Vietnamese
flags in the first hour. Parking was going for triple the rate for
a regular match.
	   Despite a heavy police presence, scalpers were operating openly,
seeking 150,000 dong (dlrs 10.70) for a 65,000 dong (dlrs 4.64
ticket).
	   Only 3,000 tickets are being made available for each match to
the general public; the rest have been allocated to government
departments and agencies.
	   Metal detectors used at each entrance to help enforce a ban on
cans and bottles. Young women took cans of Tiger Beer from
insulated packs and poured them into platic bags with a
complimentary straw.
	   During the six-week World Cup _ a tournament for which Vietnam
has never qualified _ the country nearly shut down as people stayed
up to 4 a.m. to watch matches live. Streets that normally would be
bustling on a Saturday night were deserted.

Hong Kong shares close lower as focus shifts to futures market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares ended slightly lower Wednesday
as government intervention shifted to the futures market, prompting
a frantic scramble that sent shares tumbling.
	   With prices lower, investors took advantage to cover short
positions built up before the government began its buying spree,
which has triggered sharp gains in the key stock index over the
past seven sessions.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue-chips _
ended down 55.69 points, or 0.7 percent, at 7,834.40.
	   The market recovered on the back of a flurry of short-covering
activity in the cash market during afternoon trading.
	   Short covering refers to investors buying shares they borrowed
and sold, betting they could buy them back at a lower price and
pocket the difference.
	   Turnover was 9.38 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.02
million). Trading volume during the past three sessions have been
the highest levels seen since March.
	   Kent Rossiter, senior investment advisor at Nikko Securities
Ltd., said the governemnt's sudden withdrawal from the futures
market in the late afternoon led to a quick downward movement of
the Hang Seng Index.
	   Rossiter said the government wanted ``to see how much genuine
support there was from institutional buyers'' when the government
didn't support the market, adding that short-covering activities
set in after the government left, which helped recover earlier
losses.
	   The day's biggest losers were HSBC Holdings which lost 1.00 Hong
Kong dollar to close at 171.50, Cheung Kong Holdings which lost
0.50 to close at 34.00, Shangri-La Asia which lost 0.50 to close at
4.90, and Hong Kong Telecom which lost 0.30 to close at 15.50.
	   The gainers were Bank of East Asia, which gained 0.30 to end at
8.45, Cheung Kong Infrastructure, which gained 0.30 ending at
14.55, and Hang Seng Bank, gaining 0.50 to close at 44.00.
	   Hong Kong flag-carrier Cathay Pacific lost 0.25 to close at
6.25.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An 8-year-old British girl, one of a family of six
caught in the bombing of a Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape
Town, has had a foot amputated, and her parents, brother and
grandfather are hospitalized with shrapnel wounds, her grandmother,
Iris Giddings, said Wednesday.
	   The Giddings, on holiday in South Africa, had taken the children
to Planet Hollywood as a treat on Tuesday evening.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Mrs. Giddings, 65, from Hampshire,
England, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview with the
British news agency Press Association. ``There was a flash and then
everything went dark as the ceilings and walls seem to come down
upon us.''
	   ``I was knocked down and saw my family all lying injured before
me,'' she added. ``It was one of the most terrible things I could
imagine seeing _ there was absolute chaos and my family were all
terribly hurt before me.''
	   Her grandaughter, Laura Giddings, suffered a shattered foot
which was amputated, grandson, Jacob, 3, is in intensive care with
spinal injuries, and her husband, Brian, 65, son Tony, 38, and
daughter-in-law Mandy, 35, all have shrapnel wounds.
	   South Africa's security minister said Wednesday the bombing,
which killed on person and injured 27, was an apparent retaliation
for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Mrs. Giddings said she and her husband had fallen in love with
South Africa and its people on previous trips and this year invited
their son and his family along too on vacation.
	   ``We wanted to show them just what it was like,'' she said. ``On
all our previous visits we have found everybody so welcoming and
obliging and we wanted to show them that.
	   ``We had been to a park outside Cape Town to look at the flowers
and plants which are part of South Africa's tremendous natural
beauty. Then we went to Cape Town for what supposed to be a
pleasant night out.''

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of armed militants advanced
Wednesday on the capital of the restive Russian Caucasus region of
Dagestan to demand that the local government cede power to another
ethnic group.
	   All 500 police in Makhachkala were put on alert and ordered to
shoot to kill if the rebels attacked the capital. The government
called on its own supporters for back-up, and handed out
Kalashnikov assault rifles to volunteer defenders.
	   It was the latest escalation of a long-running conflict between
Dagestan's two largest ethnic groups: the Avars, who occupy most
government posts, and the Dargins. The Avars comprise about 28
percent of the region's 2.1 million population, while the Dargins
account for about 23 percent.
	   Dagestan is home to many ethnic and religious groups.
Representatives of any single ethnic group are legally barred from
occupying the top post in the region for more than one term.
However, Dagestan's local legislature amended the law shortly
before a June election and re-elected Magomedali Magomedov.
	   Sagit-Pasha Makhanov, the mayor of Dagestan's second-largest
city, demanded Tuesday that the government of Magomedov resign and
said he would overthrow it by force if it refused.
	   On Wednesday, Makhanov led several hundred armed supporters from
the city, Khasavyurt, to the outskirts of the republic's capital.
Negotiators from the regional government met them there.
	   All entrances to Makhachkala were sealed by road blocks and
police patrols blocked all the central streets.
	   Dagestan, which borders on the breakaway region of Chechnya, has
suffered frequent bombings, kidnappings and other violence. The
region's Islamic spiritual leader was killed in a car-bombing
earlier this month.

Battle rages near Kinshasa

CLARIFIES that Uganda denies involvement. Picks up 23rd graf

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on the city's eastern outskirts.
	   The sustained artillery and small arms battle came one day after
President Laurent Kabila returned to a capital reinforced by allied
forces from Angola and Zimbabwe. Rebels seeking to topple Kabila
had suffered a series of military setbacks in the days before this
apparent assault on the capital.
	   Fighting raged through the night and continued into the morning
in the area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   A mix of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions continued
to shudder Tuesday morning through Kinshasa.
	   Helicopters buzzed back and forth from the center of town toward
the eastern outskirts.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled to central Kinshasa Wednesday morning
from the area where the battle was raging.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
Kinshasa suburbs during the night.
	   Government officials contacted Wednesday morning refused to
comment, but a military commander told The Associated Press the
fight involved artillery and rocket fire.
	   ``We are holding a war meeting,'' said Information Minister
Didier Mumengi.
	   State-run radio blamed the fighting on Rwanda, which the
government has accused of being behind the rebellion.
	   ``This is more barbarity by that country Rwanda, that little
country you can't even find on the map,'' a Voice of the People
radio report said.
	   Stores throughout Kinshasa remained closed in the morning and
residents in the city's eastern suburbs say they have been told to
stay at home.
	   Roadblocks were erected through key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares.
	   Streets were largely deserted with only a few pedestrians and
fewer vehicles venturing out.
	   State-run radio said Congolese forces were trying to flush out
rebel fighters hiding in the Mikonga forest on Kinshasa's eastern
outskirts.
	   ``Go about your business like normal and quit all speculation,''
the radio told the public. ``Since this morning we've had a
searching mission by the Congolese forces to destroy a reserve of
rebels who infiltrated the area.''
	   The foreign ministry called for a meeting Wednesday with
ambassadors.
	   Zimbawean soldiers allied with Kabila said Tuesday that they had
stopped the rebel advance toward Kinshasa.
	   Kabila returned to Kinshasa after spending more than a week
holed up in the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi _ his former
rebel stronghold.
	   After recent success fighting rebels in the west, government
forces along with Angolan and Zimbabwean allies said they were
planning to move east to the heart of rebel-held territory.
	   Kabila, speaking Tuesday on state-run radio, called for support
from the Congolese.
	   ``With hands or spears or by any means the people must crush the
enemy in our territory,'' he said.
	   Allied warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe bombed rebel
positions, Information Minister Didier Mumengi said. He gave no
details.
	   Rebel leaders said Angolan and Zimbabwean aircraft had bombed
the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town of Kasangulu, about
30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   The planes had bombed civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city, rebel leader Bizima Karaha said. That city was
captured by insurgents forces just days ago.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene if the Zimbabweans and Angolans do
not withdraw.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, though it denies backing the rebels.

Police stop Tibetans from heading to convention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ Fearing violence between two rival
groups of Tibetans, police in a northern Indian state on Wednesday
stopped some 120 Tibetans from heading to a convention, an official
said.
	   Police ordered followers of a 350-year-old monk, Dorje Shugden,
to halt at the metal barriers they set up on a road at the
mountainous town of Dharmsala, where the Dalai Lama runs a
government-in-exile.
	   The group, which had arrived from New Delhi, 300 miles (480
kilometers) to the southeast, was ordered to move into a nearby
town down the mountain until further orders.
	   Local government administrators were holding several meetings
with Tibetan groups about Thursday's convention that is being
organized in a nearby area by the United Chulsom Organization, a
rival of the Shugden group.
	   The Shugden group said it also wanted to take part in the
convention.
	   Both groups said they foresee violence during the convention,
said Arunadha Thakur, a government administrator who held talks
with the Tibetans.
	   The conflict has been brewing for 20 years since the Dalai Lama
began reconsidering his own faith in Dorje Shugden, a 17th century
monk who was murdered in the course of a palace intrigue.
	   The Dalai Lama decided that the wrathful spirit was working
against him, hampering his goal of seeking autonomy for Tibet with
minimal interference from Beijing.
	   The Dalai Lama, who is revered as a god himself by most of the
120,000 Tibetan exiles, then ordered his followers to reject Dorje
Shugden.
	   While most exiles complied with his orders, diehard Dorje
Shugden followers resisted. They consider Dorje Shugden a
``protector deity'' with the power to answer prayers, in much the
same way Catholics view saints.
	   The dispute has divided families and triggered clashes among the
tightly knit community of Tibetan exiles. Police believe the
rivalry was behind the slayings of three Dalai Lama disciples last
year.
	   Dorje Shugden followers say the Dalai Lama is using an issue of
faith to hide his own political failings.
	   Tibetans accord equal weight to history, legend and superstition
in measuring truth.

News channel remains on Amsterdam cable for one more day at least
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Midnight came and went and CNN
International's news coverage remained on the Dutch capital's cable
despite a threat to pull the plug.
	   Amsterdam cable company A2000 had threatened to take CNN off the
air Tuesday at midnight after CNN refused to pay a 725,000 guilder
(dlrs 375,000) fee. But CNN, which considers the charge exorbitant,
was given at least one extra day's grace as the two sides met for
talks aimed at settling the dispute.
	   Matthijs Spits, a spokesman for Turner Broadcasting System
Europe, which is handling the negotiations for CNN, said talks were
under way Wednesday and likely would continue into Thursday. He
declined to comment on what was being discussed.
	   The possible disappearance of CNN in Amsterdam _ which would
make it the only European capital without the popular
round-the-clock news channel _ has caused an uproar.
	   In just over 24 hours, more than 4,000 viewers called a special
telephone line set up by a consumer watchdog agency to register
complaints.
	   The consumer group has asked for a three-month cooling-off
period for CNN while both sides negotiate a deal. CNN maintains the
fee far exceeds what it pays for cable access elsewhere.
	   MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel also have
refused to pay the fee and have been pulled from the cable by
A2000.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In Sudan, rumors of a coup or the
imminent downfall of the Islamic government come almost as often as
the Muslim call to prayer that echoes through Khartoum's dusty
streets five times a day.
	   But nine years after a coup brought to power the Arab world's
only revolutionary Islamic government, Sudan's leaders appear to be
as entrenched as ever. They say their revolution will outlast
mounting American pressure, widespread discontent within the
country and an opposition that offers few alternatives.
	   It's an impressive record in a country, one of Africa's poorest,
that has suffered six coups since independence in 1956.
	   ``Wishful people in politics, even governments in Western Europe
and the United States, they say, `Oh, it won't take more than a few
months and this government will collapse,''' said Hassan Turabi,
the parliament speaker and ideologue of the government.
	   ``They don't understand history,'' he said.
	   Sudan's modern Islamic movement began in the 1960s.
	   It rose within the brown-brick buildings of Khartoum University
along the Blue Nile in the 1960s, eventually playing a
behind-the-scenes role in the coup in 1989.
	   Today, its top leaders serve as parliament speaker and vice
president, run the expansive security services and key ministries,
wield influence in the military and control banks and companies.
	   The opposition, most of it abroad, offers little alternative to
many Sudanese, fractured as it is by trying to meld the agendas of
southern rebels and the banned, traditional parties in the north.
	   ``They know their opponents, they know the political parties and
they know how to manipulate them and defuse their threats,'' said
Abdallahi an-Naim, a Sudanese law professor at Emory University in
Atlanta, Georgia.
	   At first glance, the government's staying power is surprising.
	   Charges that Sudan supports Islamic militants have alienated its
neighbors and angered the United States, which attacked the
country's largest pharmaceutical plant Thursday. Washington said
the strike stopped the production of precursors of chemical
weapons.
	   Already, the United States had added Sudan to its list of states
supporting terrorism, withdrawn its diplomats from Khartoum and
imposed sanctions that ban U.S. investments in the country.
	   At home, discontent runs as long as the Nile River that courses
1,860 miles (2,995 kilometers) through Sudan.
	   Riots over electricity _ once available half the day but now for
as little as two hours _ erupted the night before the U.S. attack,
capping weeks of protests in Khartoum and other cities.
	   Students at Khartoum University, which has long given birth to
bouts of political upheaval, poured into the streets this month in
anger over housing costs that more than doubled to about dlrs 25,
the monthly salary of a civil servant.
	   A law student died in custody _ according to students, his skull
was crushed and his leg was broken _ unleashing several more days
of demonstrations in Khartoum and his hometown of Wad Madani.
	   ``Not only students but most people are against the regime,''
said W.W. Ibrahim, a 25-year-old law student. ``But I can refuse
the government only with my tongue. It's the one with the
weapons.''
	   It's also the one with the organization, a vast and mobilized
network of committed activists that leaves the opposition in awe.
	   On the night of the attack, the government organized a crowd of
hundreds at the U.S. Embassy by 11 p.m. _ about three hours after
the strike _ a time when Khartoum's streets are usually deserted
and transportation is scarce. Its ministers flew that night to
Sudanese cities, organizing protests from southern to northern
Sudan.
	   Repression, too, is rife, and many Sudanese dissidents attribute
the government's success to the fear bred by a police state garbed
in the legitimacy that Islam conveys among religious Sudanese.
	   ``The government uses Islam like it uses a rifle, to protect its
interests,'' said Ghazi Suleiman, a lawyer and leading dissident.
	   But unlike Iraq or Syria, Sudan is not a prison with borders.
	   Sudanese are outspoken and cherish a long-standing tradition of
tolerance and dissent. The fact that the government permits some
opposition, however limited, may be its saving grace.
	   It seems reluctant or unable to step up the pressure further.
Amputations under Islamic law are rare, and arrests are typically
brief and less numerous than in past years, dissidents say.
	   Newspapers criticize a constitution the government devised in
June, and state-run television organizes call-in shows in which
officials are berated for electricity cuts and water shortages.
	   Suleiman himself appeared on a panel discussion soon after he
was released following 25 days of detention in April.
	   But red lines remain, and where they are drawn, many Sudanese
say, is as unpredictable as the electricity. The government,
meanwhile, keeps a close eye on any real threats to its authority.
	   ``They will go all the way to the end,'' said Gassem al-Badri,
president of Ahfad University, a private school for women.
``Whether it's bitter or sweet, God will have to decide.''

German finance minister: Russia must solve its own problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Germany is concerned about the fall of
the Russian ruble, but will not rush to rescue Moscow from its
financial problems, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said
Wednesday.
	   ``It is now up to Russia, its new prime minister, the government
and the Duma to create the conditions for confidence and stability
of the Russian currency,'' he said. ``We must say to the Russian
government: You must create the stability.''
	   Germany has come under criticism in recent days for its failure
to take a more aggressive leadership role in the recent Russian
financial market crisis. German banks are the biggest lenders to
Russia by far.
	   Stanley Fischer, deputy director of the International Monetary
Fund, told a German newspaper Monday that he blamed Chancellor
Helmut Kohl for not being more aggressive in dealing with the
crisis. He suggested Kohl would have been more willing to take an
active role if elections weren't five weeks away.
	   ``Without the Germans, of course, no other European country was
prepared to support Russia financially,'' he said.
	   Kohl called Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday and
``strongly reaffirmed ... that it was crucially vital to press on
with the reform course ... if a long-term solution were to be found
for Russia's problems,'' according to government statement Monday.
	   Noting the German government's familiarity with Russia's
political leaders, Waigel said he and Kohl will continue to use
``our own channels'' to influence the Russian government.

Montenegrin President hints anew at possible secession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALPBACH, Austria (AP) _ Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic
hinted again Wednesday that his republic might eventually secede
from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   He spoke at an international dialogue congress in this Austrian
village _ an annual venue of political, business and cultural
officials discussing current issues.
	   ``We must do away with the failed policy and its makers'' in
Yugoslavia, Djukanovic, as quoted by the Austria Press Agency, said
in his speech on an ``open society and southeastern Europe,'' a
clear reference to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his
government.
	   Dominant Serbia and Montenegro make up what's left of
Yugoslavia. Djukanovic has become Milosevic's chief internal
opponent.
	   On Aug. 3, Djukanovic's reformist government stopped all
contacts with the Milosevic administration, and a minister said a
referendum on secession could be held.
	   The Montenegrin government said they would not communicate with
the Yugoslav government until its premier, Momir Bulatovic, steps
down, and a successor from Montenegro is named.
	   Djukanovic, who beat Bulatovic, his predecessor, in elections
early this year, asked the European Union for economic assistance.

News channel remains on Amsterdam cable for one more day at least
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Midnight came and went and CNN
International's news coverage remained on the Dutch capital's cable
despite a threat to pull the plug.
	   Amsterdam cable company A2000 had threatened to take CNN off the
air Tuesday at midnight after CNN refused to pay a 725,000 guilder
(dlrs 375,000) fee. But CNN, which considers the charge exorbitant,
was given at least one extra day's grace as the two sides met for
talks aimed at settling the dispute.
	   Matthijs Spits, a spokesman for Turner Broadcasting System
Europe, which is handling the negotiations for CNN, said talks were
under way Wednesday and likely would continue into Thursday. He
declined to comment on what was being discussed.
	   The possible disappearance of CNN in Amsterdam _ which would
make it the only European capital without the popular
round-the-clock news channel _ has caused an uproar.
	   In just over 24 hours, more than 4,000 viewers called a special
telephone line set up by a consumer watchdog agency to register
complaints.
	   The consumer group has asked for a three-month cooling-off
period for CNN while both sides negotiate a deal. CNN maintains the
fee far exceeds what it pays for cable access elsewhere.
	   MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel also have
refused to pay the fee and have been pulled from the cable by
A2000.

Libya to announce decision on Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with Foreign, Justice ministries looking
at proposal, Egypt's el-Baz leaves for Libya in 19th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya was to announce a decision Wednesday
on whether to accept a U.S.-British proposal to try two Libyan
suspects in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger jet.
	   State-run Libyan radio said experts from the Foreign and Justice
ministries were meeting Wednesday to prepare the response.
Government officials, lawyers and other experts had met Tuesday on
the proposal, state television said. The broadcasts were monitored
in the Egyptian capital Cairo.
	   The Libyans are to respond to a joint American and British
proposal that the Libyan suspects be tried by a panel of three
Scottish judges under Scottish law in The Hague, the Netherlands.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, believed to be about 45, and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah,
about 41, cannot be extradited from the Netherlands. And it says
that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters late Tuesday
the offer from the United States and Britain was a ``definite
improvement'' over their previous stance, which was that any trial
must be held on their territories.
	   ``The offer is more flexible than earlier ones and fulfills one
of Libya's demand for a trial in a third country,'' Moussa said.
	   He added: ``We hope the offer will lead to a lifting of the
embargo.''
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Libya had demanded that an international panel try the Libyans
in a neutral country.
	   In Britain, Alistair Duff, a Scottish counsel for the Libyans,
was quoted in The Guardian newspaper on Tuesday as saying the fact
that three judges, rather than an international panel, would try
the case was ``not insurmountable.''
	   He added, however, that some issues remained unresolved: ``Where
are the suspects going to be held in custody? Are they going to be
guaranteed safe passage to and, in the event of acquittal, from,
the trial?''
	   A further problem could involve Libya's demand that U.N.
sanctions be lifted once the suspects are turned over.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday considered a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands for
trial.
	   But the resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of 170 the passengers and
crew.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere last year said Libyan
officials gave cooperation in his investigation that ``satisfied
most of the French demands.''
	   Libya's official JANA news agency reported Tuesday that Gadhafi
had received a telephone call from South African President Nelson
Mandela during which the Lockerbie case was discussed. It gave no
other details.
	   Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday said President Hosni Mubarak
also had called Gadhafi on the case, but gave no details.
	   Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's chief political adviser, left for Libya
on Wednesday for consultations with Gadhafi, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency said.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab League who has
long worked for a compromise in the Lockerbie affair, said Tuesday
he expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   He spoke to reporters after meeting Tuesday with British
Ambassador David Blatherwick, who outlined the Western proposal.
	   The 22-member league is headquartered in Cairo.

Police put death toll at 28 in bus bombings; rebels claim
</HEADLINE>
responsibility &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police on Wednesday said 28 people died
in the bombing of two long-distance buses in central Uganda and
said a dormant rebel group claimed responsibility for the blasts.
	   Deputy police spokesman John Kimera said the explosions,
possibly caused by grenades, both occurred around 10 a.m. (0700gmt)
Tuesday on two buses, one headed for the Rwanda capital, Kigali,
and the other headed for Kasese in western Uganda.
	   ``There was very good linkage. The whole thing was
coordinated,'' Kimera said. ``We have arrested four people, and the
investigations are going on.''
	   He said he did not know how many people were injured in the
explosions.
	   Kimera said the private station Radio Simba received a call
Wednesday claiming that the National Army for the Liberation of
Uganda was responsible for the attacks.
	   Initial reports Tuesday spoke of explosions on three buses, the
third headed for the northern town of Gulu.
	   Kimera said an explosion occured in the Gulu-bound bus after all
the passengers but a young boy had gotten out because of a
mechanical problem. He said the boy was injured in the blast, but
not killed, as previously reported.
	   Kimera said he could neither confirm nor deny that the
explosions on the two buses near Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175
miles) southwest of Kampala, were timed to occur on the day
President Yoweri Museveni was supposed to meet members of a
parliamentary committee at his home in Rwakitura, about 30
kilometers (19 miles) from where the explosions occurred.
	   It was not clear whether the buses were in the same place when
the blasts occurred. The Kampala-Mbarara road is the main highway
to Kigali and Kasese.
	   NALU was founded in 1988 and based in what was then eastern
Zaire, now Congo, from where it launched attacks on western Uganda.
It has been dormant in recent years and eclipsed by the Allied
Democratic Forces who also operate from Congo and attack western
Uganda.
	   The government-owned New Vision said Wednesday that Foreign
Minister Eriya Kategaya told parliament 75 people were in police
custody in connection with bomb and grenade attacks carried out in
Uganda since the beginning of the year in which six people died.

Chernomyrdin tries to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Central Bank saying sales canceled to prevent new
hard-currency losses, stock market plummeting, fresh quotes.
Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors on Wednesday after investments plunged in value
under a drastic plan to restructure Russia's enormous debts, but
markets continued to fall.
	   The ruble dove again as Central Bank support for the Russian
currency faltered. Trading at the interbank exchange was suspended
for a second day in a row after the ruble weakened by more than 5
percent, trading at 8.26 rubles to the dollar in contrast to 7.86
rubles on Tuesday.
	   In another sign of panic, the Central Bank canceled sales of
dollars Wednesday to banks and other institutions, saying its
intervention would have led to new losses in hard-currency
reserves. It was the first time the Central Bank had canceled
already agreed sales during the current crisis, indicating the
government was giving up efforts to stem the fall of the ruble.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on restructuring the
country's dlrs 40 billion, short-term debt market, a day after
terms of the plan were revealed. The terms announced late Tuesday
confirmed creditors' fears that they would sustain heavy losses.
	   Investors whose bonds have matured will have the option of
trading them either for long-term, dollar-denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   ``There's nothing good there, everybody thinks the government
won and everybody else lost,'' said Oleg Galkin, a trader at ING
Barings in Moscow.
	   Even as he pledged to try to limit the damage to investors,
Chernomyrdin was careful to dissociate himself from the
restructuring decision.
	   ``I would like people to understand us correctly: This decision
was predetermined. In actual fact, our task was only to formulate
it, and we could not do otherwise,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Our top priority now, my personal task, is to soften its
negative influence on stock markets and investors.''
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the restructuring _ in some
cases receiving just 17 cents for every dollar they invested,
according to some analysts _ will discourage many from returning
any time soon.
	   Russia will feel the loss of foreign investment keenly. Some
analysts predict the country will be shut out of international
commercial borrowing for several years.
	   Stocks plummeted 6.4 percent in early trading Wednesday, with
the Russian Trading System index falling to 82.87 points from 88.38
points Tuesday.
	   Muscovites lined up outside some banks to try to withdraw their
deposits. About 80 people were outside a branch of the SBS-Agro
bank on central Pushkin Square on Wednesday morning, umbrellas
staving off a steady drizzle as they waited for the doors to open.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman who identified
herself only as Julia. ``I'd like to be able to buy something with
my rubles, which have already become worthless.''
	   Chernomyrdin said he was ``extremely dissatisfied'' with the
Central Bank's activity over the past two days and announced he
would discuss his concern with bank chairman Sergei Dubinin.
	   The ruble plummeted 9.2 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years.
	   ``Financial and banking policy is an issue I'm attending to
every minute,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to ITAR-Tass. ``I'm
going to talk seriously with Sergei Dubinin today about the
inactivity of the main financial institution in the serious
economic situation.''
	   Chernomyrdin told the news agency that he would take urgent
action to get in the fall harvest, prepare the nation for winter,
pay teachers, military personnel, doctors and other state-financed
workers, and aid various regions of the country that have suffered
from fires and flooding this year.
	   He said all these issues would be on the agenda of his meetings
with regional leaders, including Krasnoyarsk Governor and
presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed, later in the day.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he was ready to
talk with Chernomyrdin about a coalition government. But he warned
that the Communists would demand a say in the prime minister's
program to cope with the economic crisis.
	   ``So far the talk has been all about how `we should work
together,''' Zyuganov said.
	   ``But it's senseless to work as we've done before. Such work has
brought us to where we are today. I don't believe a single word
from Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin.''

Thai socialites ditching their diamonds for cash in tough times

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's socialites are ditching
their diamonds for cash as the country's economic crisis has
started squeezing the upper classes, a jewelry industry source and
a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   More than a hundred wealthy Thai women have shown up at diamond
dealers in Bangkok in recent weeks looking to sell their jewels and
heirlooms, said one dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   They are returning to dealers because they can't get good prices
from pawn shops, many of which can't afford the diamonds anyway, he
said.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times. Even wealthy Thais have been forced to part with some of
their most cherished possessions at auctions and sales, such as the
``Market of the Formerly Rich,'' run by a Bangkok auto dealer.
	   Dozens of upper-crust Thai women have sold their diamonds to the
American-Thai Buying Jewellery Company, The Nation newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The U.S.-based company is operating in Thailand temporarily,
having set up shop in a trendy Bangkok mall until next month when
it will pull up stakes and move to the next stop on its tour of
economically-troubled Asian nations _ Indonesia.
	   The company, formed four months ago to buy diamonds in Asia, has
already spent dlrs 7.3 million buying jewels in Thailand.
	   The firm is negotiating with the wife of former Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to form a joint venture, the Bangkok Post
reported on Wednesday.
	   Chavalit's mismanagement has been blamed for sparking Thailand's
economic crisis. Nonetheless, he and his wife are still very
wealthy with a declared fortune of 141 million baht (dlrs 3.43
million).
	   His wife, Phankrua, has been called ``the walking jewelry box''
by detractors. She usually takes a stuffed pink elephant studded
with diamonds along with her to public functions for good luck.

	   Kelly hopes to add another kilometer crown amid an Australian
team that has been plagued by internal problems. The men's
kilometer is the first final of the competition Wednesday night.
	   He holds the world record of 1 minute, 0.613 set at altitude at
the 1995 world championships, the first of his world titles.
	   However he missed the Olympic gold when he pulled his left foot
out of the pedal strap as he left the start line in Atlanta and
stopped.
	   Kelly hopes to divert attention from controversy on the
Australian team.
	   According to reports, there have been a few disputes between
coaches and star athletes over training methods that led to three
riders leaving the Australian training camp in the United States
and stay apart from the main group in Germany.
	   The team also has been disrupted by the use of a controversial
treatment to build resistence to illness that is used with
colostrum extracted from cows' milk.
	   Colostrum contains a substance which, in concentrated forms, is
on the banned list. That has disturbed a few of the riders,
especially in the aftermath of the Tour de France and the doping
scandal and the increased checks by both the French police and the
International Cycling Union.
	   Kelly hopes to put all this behind him in a chance to win his
fourth straight title. He lost out on the Olympic gold to Florian
Rousseau, one of the stars of the French team that took six of the
12 titles at last year's world championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Rousseau has moved to the men's sprint event where he looks to
defend his title.
	   France also has two world champions in the individual pursuit,
which also began Wednesday.
	   Defending champion is Philippe Ermenault but teammate Francis
Moreau, a world champion in the sprint event in 1991, is also
entered.
	   Moreau led qualifying with a time of 4 minutes, 19.234 seconds
over the 4,000 meters. Second was Ermenault in 4:21.096.
	   The top four in qualifying advance to the semifinals Wednesday
night.
	   Chris Boardman, who won the evevnt at the 1992 Olympics and two
world championships and holds the world record, was just 12th.
	   He was injured when he fell heavily in the Tour de France when
he was wearing the leader's yellow jersey during the second stage
on the way to Cork, Ireland on July 13.
	   In the women's events, France's Felicia Ballanger, who has won
six world titles over the last three years, led the way in
qualifying in the sprint. Her time of 11.259 seconds over the 200
meters time trial was the best and advanced her, archrival Michelle
Ferris of Australia and Chris Witty of the United States directly
into the round of eight later Wednesday.
	   Ferris's time was 11.341. Witty's best was 11.361.
	   Witty won a silver and a bronze medal in speedskating this year
in Nagano but is now concentrating on the cycling events to try for
the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia in 2000.
	   Another American, Jennie Reed, qualified in fourth in 11.386.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia no closer to ending
political turmoil a month after parliamentary elections, opposition
leaders said Wednesday their followers were willing to brave
bullets and grenades to protest against strongman Hun Sen.
	   Some 5,000 people remained in a park across from the National
Assembly in the third day of a sit-in, protesting alleged electoral
fraud and demanding that Hun Sen _ the declared victor of the July
26 polls _ step down.
	   The leaders of the opposition parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, rejected government demands to move the protest to
a sports stadium but agreed to work more closely with police on
concerns about hygiene and pickpockets among the crowd.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said their followers were committed to
overturning what they called widespread electoral fraud and were
prepared face violence from the government.
	   On Tuesday, Sam Rainsy's party asked the United Nations to send
on-site monitors to the park, claiming he had received reports that
elements within the government planned to kill him.
	   The park was the scene of a grenade attack last year against a
protest led by Sam Rainsy that killed 16 people and wounded more
than 100. Hun Sen has been widely blamed for the attack, but denies
responsibility.
	   A U.N.-brokered midnight meeting between Interior Ministry
officials and the opposition leaders apparently averted a police
crackdown planned for Wednesday morning.
	   More meetings between U.N. and government officials were held
Wednesday, but no progress was reported.
	   ``Both agree that if there is any confrontation, there will be
no benefit, everything will be lost,'' said Interior Ministry
spokesman Khieu Sopheak.
	   The park _ dubbed ``Democracy Square'' by the opposition _ was a
sea of makeshift blue tarpaulin tents separate by little pathways.
Supporters handed out baskets of free food, and even the poor were
making donations of crumpled banknotes to keep up the protest.
	   ``The people will not move,'' they said. ``It is a public place,
it is the site of the National Assembly that is meant to represent
the people's will, and it is a place where the people have left
their blood in the struggle for freedom.''
	   Their defiance heightened concerns of renewed violence if Hun
Sen's patience wears out with the political stalemate that has only
deepened since last month's elections.
	   Though international observers gave a credible bill of health to
the day of the elections and the first day of vote-counting, the
opposition has alleged hundreds of cases of fraud in the 10 days it
took to finish the count. They also said widespread violence and
intimidation before the vote poisoned the outcome.
	   They have challenged the formula under which Hun Sen's party,
with 41 percent of the popular vote, garnered 64 of the assembly's
122 seats, a slight majority giving him first right to form a
government but short of the two-thirds needed to rule alone.
	   The opposition leaders threaten to boycott the assembly,
preventing a government from forming, and have rejected Hun Sen's
offers to put together a coalition until their concerns are
addressed.
	   The parties still have a month before the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time Sept. 24, but the lack of any
visible progress in resolving the dispute is making ordinary people
nervous of violence.
	   Hun Sen toppled Ranariddh as his co-prime minister last year in
a bloody coup and called the elections in an effort to win back
lost international legitimacy and aid.
	   The prince had won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.

Libya to announce decision on Lockerbie trial

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with Foreign, Justice ministries looking
at proposal, Egypt's el-Baz leaves for Libya in 19th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya was to announce a decision Wednesday
on whether to accept a U.S.-British proposal to try two Libyan
suspects in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger jet.
	   State-run Libyan radio said experts from the Foreign and Justice
ministries were meeting Wednesday to prepare the response.
Government officials, lawyers and other experts had met Tuesday on
the proposal, state television said. The broadcasts were monitored
in the Egyptian capital Cairo.
	   The Libyans are to respond to a joint American and British
proposal that the Libyan suspects be tried by a panel of three
Scottish judges under Scottish law in The Hague, the Netherlands.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, believed to be about 45, and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah,
about 41, cannot be extradited from the Netherlands. And it says
that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters late Tuesday
the offer from the United States and Britain was a ``definite
improvement'' over their previous stance, which was that any trial
must be held on their territories.
	   ``The offer is more flexible than earlier ones and fulfills one
of Libya's demand for a trial in a third country,'' Moussa said.
	   He added: ``We hope the offer will lead to a lifting of the
embargo.''
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   Libya had demanded that an international panel try the Libyans
in a neutral country.
	   In Britain, Alistair Duff, a Scottish counsel for the Libyans,
told The Guardian newspaper that the fact that three judges, rather
than an international panel, would try the case was ``not
insurmountable.''
	   He added, however, that some issues remained unresolved: ``Where
are the suspects going to be held in custody? Are they going to be
guaranteed safe passage to and, in the event of acquittal, from,
the trial?''
	   A further problem could involve Libya's demand that U.N.
sanctions be lifted once the suspects are turned over.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday considered a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands for
trial.
	   But the resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of 170 the passengers and
crew.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere last year said Libyan
officials gave cooperation in his investigation that ``satisfied
most of the French demands.''
	   Libya's official JANA news agency reported Tuesday that Gadhafi
had received a telephone call from South African President Nelson
Mandela during which the Lockerbie case was discussed. It gave no
other details.
	   Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday said President Hosni Mubarak
also had called Gadhafi on the case, but gave no details.
	   Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's chief political adviser, left for Libya
on Wednesday for consultations with Gadhafi, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency said.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab League who has
long worked for a compromise in the Lockerbie affair, said Tuesday
he expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   He spoke to reporters after meeting Tuesday with British
Ambassador David Blatherwick, who outlined the Western proposal.
	   The 22-member league is headquartered in Cairo.

Dutch court bans solidarity strike by KLM pilots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch court Wednesday banned KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines pilots from striking in solidarity with their
Northwest Airlines colleagues on the Amsterdam-Minneapolis route.
	   The Association of Dutch Pilots had called on pilots with the
Dutch flag carrier to strike on the route if Northwest pilots
decide to take industrial action on Saturday. KLM and Northwest
have a strategic and operational alliance.
	   Northwest pilots have been in fruitless pay negotiations for two
years, and the U.S. carrier's pilots have threatened to go on
strike as of midnight Saturday if no pay deal is reached.
	   Northwest operates two daily flights between Amsterdam and
Minneapolis and KLM has one daily flight on the route.
	   Although Amsterdam district court banned a KLM solidarity
strike, it also ruled that KLM can't ask its pilots to take over
the two Northwest flight to the U.S. city even though the Dutch
carrier has sold tickets to Dutch passengers for the two flights.
	   The pilots' association said that one of the reasons for the
planned strike had been solidarity with colleagues at Northwest,
but that another reason was fear of job losses in the Netherlands.
	   ``KLM has said that growth will go to the cheapest airline,''
said Paul Griffioen, spokesman for the association.
	   If Northwest gets its way, he said, the U.S. carrier will be the
cheapest and future growth will go to the United States instead of
Amsterdam.

Pope condemns mission massacre in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Wednesday condemned the
massacre at a Roman Catholic mission in the Congo as a criminal act
and prayed that they would be the last victims of the Congolese
war.
	   Speaking at his general audience at St. Peter's Square, the
pontiff said he hoped the ``innocent blood'' of the 37 victims
would help ``heal hearts sick with hate and vengeance'' and bring
peace to the battered Congo.
	   The mission was crowded with refugees when Tutsi rebels
attacked. A priest, three nuns and a seminary student died
alongside 32 refugees; all were Congolese.
	   The rebels, part of a coalition fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila, suspected local people of giving food to a
pro-government militia, according to Fides, the.news service of the
Vatican missionary service.
	   The attack took place in the remote parish of Kasika, 80
kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Uvira in Congo's South Kivu
province, on Sunday.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on the city's eastern outskirts.
	   The sustained artillery and small arms battle came one day after
President Laurent Kabila returned to a capital reinforced by allied
forces from Angola and Zimbabwe. Rebels seeking to topple Kabila
had suffered a series of military setbacks in the days before this
apparent assault on the capital.
	   Fighting raged through the night and continued into the morning
in the area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   A mix of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions continued
to shudder Wednesday morning through Kinshasa.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A member of an Israeli-backed
Lebanese militia was killed Wednesday in sporadic exchanges of fire
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas, the Israeli army
spokesman said.
	   The shelling erupted after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night, injuring 19 civilians.
	   Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim guerrilla force, used
mortars, machine guns and rockets to attack positions of the
Israeli army and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army (SPA)
militia, the spokesman said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Israeli artillery returned fire on guerrilla positions.
	   An Israeli military official said the army did not seek an
escalation of tensions and was responding to ongoing Hezbollah
attacks rather than acting in reprisal for Tuesday night's rocket
barrage on northern Israeli towns and settlements.
	   The Katyusha bombardment followed the killing of Hossam al-Amin,
a leader of the military wing of the Shiite Amal militia. An
Israeli helicopter ambushed his car, blowing up the vehicle as it
traveled along the coastal highway in south Lebanon.
	   Soon after, Amal and Hezbollah fired two salvos of rockets into
Israel.
	   However, Hezbollah said the rocket attack on northern Israel and
the subsequent exchanges stemmed from a different incident - the
killing of a Lebanese civilian by the Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   An Israeli military official concurred, saying a Lebanese
civilian was killed and five others wounded in an attack on the
south Lebanese village of Maghara.
	   There was controversy in Israel on Wednesday over the wisdom of
killing al-Amin. Legislator Ori Orr, who is a retired general, said
it was a mistake, because Israeli civilians could have easily been
killed in the Katyusha bombardment.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Army radio.
	   However his Labor party colleague Ephraim Sneh, who is also a
retired general, said the killing was justified. Interviewed on
Israel radio he said ``That is the correct and the most effective
way to fight terrorism, by killing their key figures.''
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in bomb
shelters, emerged Wednesday morning when the army declared the
alert over. However civil defense wardens were instructed to leave
the shelters unlocked in case the situation deteriorates.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross appealed Tuesday for
donations to help Kenyans recover from a bomb attack on the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.
	   The appeal for dlrs 563,000 is intended to support a Kenya Red
Cross program of medical and social assistance, backed by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cresent Societies,
spokesman John Sparrow said.
	   At least 247 people were killed and more than 5,400 injured by
the explosion. Twelve people were killed in a nearly simultaneous
bombing in Tanzania.
	   ``Many people require surgery and care for which they do not
have the means. Many disabled can no longer practice their
profession,'' said Al Pachino, chief of the federation's Nairobi
delegation.
	   ``Extended families have lost breadwinners. Children have lost
parents. With all the trauma, injury and vulnerability this tragedy
has brought we must ensure that no one falls through the safety net
the country is constructing.''
	   Psychological support, prosthesis and social assistance, tracing
services to monitor needs, vocational training, income-generation
activities and a long-term social welfare program are planned,
Sparrow said.

Most Asian markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Wednesday on
continued uncertainty over Japan's financial reforms and
instability in major regional financial markets.
	   Tokyo stocks closed lower on worries the passage of financial
stabilization bills in Japan's parliament could be a long drawn-out
process.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 206.90 points, or
1.4 percent, to 14,866.03, after an 84.57-point gain Tuesday.
	   Opposition parties boycotted a debate in parliament on bank
reform because of a dispute with the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
	   The opposition is strongly criticizing a government-backed plan
for a rescue merger between the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
and Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co., and want the presidents of the
two banks to testify before parliament.
	   ``If the opposition can block the proposals, in the worst case
scenario it could lead to another general election...(and) a dely
in needed reforms,'' said Stephen Wood, a senior salesman at ING
Baring Securities in Japan.
	   In Seoul, shares closed higher on strong foreign buying, after
concerns over global financial instability subsided with overnight
stock gains in the United States and Europe.
	   The benchmark KOSPI index rose 7.33 points, or 2.4 percent, to
close at 317.56.
	   In Hong Kong, shares ended slightly lower as government
intervention shifted to the futures market, prompting a frantic
scramble that sent shares tumbling.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 55.69 points, or 0.7
percent, at 7,834.40.
	   With prices lower, investors took advantage to cover short
positions built up before the government began its buying spree,
which has triggered sharp gains in the index over the past seven
sessions.
	   Kent Rossiter, senior investment advisor at Nikko Securities
Ltd., said the government's sudden withdrawal from the futures
market in the late afternoon led to a quick downward movement of
the Hang Seng Index.
	   Rossiter said the government wanted ``to see how much genuine
support there was from institutional buyers'' when the government
didn't support the market.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended lower as the heavyweight energy
sector took a dive, signaling that big institutional investors are
clearing out of the market completely. The SET index lost 2.72
points, or 1.2 percent, to end at 227.50.
	   JAKARTA: Sentiment turned sour as most of regional major
equities market failed to recover, driving Indonesian shares prices
to close sharply lower. The JSX composite index closed down 6.216
points, or 1.7 percent, at 360.927.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares were up slightly in dull trading ahead of
the release of second-quarter economic growth figures Thursday. The
benchmark Composite Index ended almost flat at 324.49, up 0.32
points.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower for the fourth straight
session. The PSE Index closed down 23.17 points, or 1.8 percent, at
1,287.02, its lowest closing level in more than six years.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher as institutional
funds looked for bargains and covered short positions. The STI
Index closed 1.6 percent, or 14.53 points higher at 925.85.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices slid lower, pressured by a
falling Japanese stock market and a plunge in the Australian dollar
that undermined investor confidence. The All Ordinaries index of
share prices closed at 2,608.0, down 19.7 points or 0.7 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended at a 21-month low as investors
snubbed market regulators' latest attempt to bring stability to the
beleaguered bourse. The Weighted Price Index closed 94.00 points
lower or 1.4 percent, at 6,814.33.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished slightly lower
with brokers saying local investors were cautious in light of
global economic and market uncertainty. The NZSE-40 was down 0.65
points to close at 1,943.05.

Israeli-backed militia member killed in south Lebanon

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A member of an Israeli-backed
Lebanese militia was killed Wednesday in sporadic exchanges of fire
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas, the Israeli army
spokesman said.
	   The shelling erupted after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night, injuring 19 civilians.
	   The militia man from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA), was killed when Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the SLA, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   The Israelis and the SLA returned fire.
	   An Israeli military official said the army did not seek an
escalation of tensions and was responding to ongoing Hezbollah
attacks rather than acting in reprisal for Tuesday night's rocket
barrage on northern Israeli towns and settlements.
	   Tuesday night's Katyusha barrage followed the killing of Hossam
al-Amin, a leader of the military wing of the Shiite Amal militia.
An Israeli helicopter ambushed his car, blowing up the vehicle as
it traveled along the coastal highway in south Lebanon.
	   Soon after Hezbollah fired two salvos of rockets into Israel.
	   Hezbollah said the rocket attacks were not in retaliation for
the killing of Amin, but in response to the wounding of six
Lebanese civilians Tuesday, when the SLA shelled the village of
Masghara.
	   An Israeli military official said a Lebanese civilians was
killed in the Masghara attack, but this was not mentioned in the
Hezbollah statement.
	   There was controversy in Israel Wednesday over whether the
killing of Amin was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, a retired general
from the opposition Labor Party, said it was a mistake because it
put Israeli civilians at risk.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Israel army radio.
	   However, party colleague Ephraim Sneh, also a retired general,
said the killing was justified. Interviewed on Israel radio he said
that ``the correct and the most effective way to fight terrorism is
by killing their key figures.''
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over. However, civil defense wardens were
instructed to leave the shelters unlocked in case of more attacks.
	   President Ezer Weizman visited the border town of Kiryat
Shemona, where some of the Katyushas fell. He visited a community
center which was hit by one of the rockets and called on a young
couple whose wedding celebration broke up in confusion as the
Katyushas exploded nearby.
	   Weizman invited the couple to spend a weekend in a hotel of
their choice, anywhere in Israel, at his expense.

Spanish teams look to Dutch and Italian masters as league kicks

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's the Dutch against the Italians!
	   Spain's soccer league kicks off this weekend with Real Madrid
hoping Netherlands' World Cup coach Guus Hiddink can help it steal
some of the domestic limelight from a FC Barcelona which is being
heavily remodeled in Dutch fashion under Louis Van Gaal.
	   And while the league's top two teams are betting on the Dutch
attacking stylists, second-ranking Atletico de Madrid and Valencia
have gone for the Italian defense masters, Arrigo Sacchi and
Claudio Ranieri, respectively.
	   The league's first round pits the mighty against the meek with
Real, still dizzy from its record seventh European Champions title
last May, hosting Villareal, a side playing its first game ever in
the premier division.
	   A team with no cups in its cabinet, Villareal was founded in
1923 and hails from the eastern coastal town of Castellon.
Nicknamed by local press as the ``killer cub'', the side finished
fourth in the second division last season and then fought its way
through playoffs for a place in the `primera'.
	   Hiddink, happy with the talent he's found at Madrid including
Yugoslavia's Pedrag Mitjatovic and Croatia's Davor Suker, has
limited Madrid's foreign signings to Robert Jarni, the Croatian
midfielder.
	   Besides aiming for an eighth European cup, Hiddink's chief task
will be to regain the domestic title which Van Gaal's Barcelona
bagged along with three other trophies last season in what was the
Dutchman's first term with the Catalan club.
	   Real Madrid first plays Barcelona at home in the third round on
Sept. 20.
	   But although Van Gaal has had little problem winning titles, he
has still to win the hearts of the Camp Nou home crowd.
	   Barcelona gets rolling Sunday when it hosts modest Racing de
Santander. The game would normally see the team trying to show off
a little but instead it will be gunning for a victory to quickly
wipe away memories of the ground-shaking booing it received last
week when it lost the season-opening Spanish Supercup to Mallorca.
	   What appears to irk `Barca' fans most is Van Gaal's shedding of
home-grown players such as Ivan De La Pena, to Lazio, and Albert
Ferrer, to Chelsea, only to surround himself with compatriots.
	   This year the side has five Dutch regular starters _ including
new purchases Boudewijn Zenden and Philip Cocu _ and Van Gaal is
bent on signing two more, in Frank and Ronald de Boer.
	   He has, however, inspired confidence among Spanish sports
editors, 57 of whom predicted in a recent survey that Barcelona
would retain the league title while only 33 felt Real Madrid was
capable of getting it back.
	   Meanwhile, Italian coaches Sacchi and Ranieri get a chance to
face off Saturday when Atletico travels to Valencia.
	   Valencia will be celebrating its midweek Intertoto victory over
Austria's Salzburg to qualify for a UEFA berth while Atletico fans
will be looking to see if Italian striker Christian Vieri will be
starring along side Brazilian Juninho and new Yugoslav signing
Vladimir Jugovic.
	   Atletico this week said Vieri may leave the team following
disagreements with Sacchi and fellow players. On Tuesday, however,
the club insisted he would be staying.
	   Saturday also sees Betis, who appointed Chilean Vicente
Cantatore as coach just days before the league's start, unveiling
new Brazilian World Cup star Denilson in its game against division
newcomer Alaves.
	   Athletic de Bilbao, last year's runner-up and a side which has
traditionally shunned signing players from outside of northern
Spain's Basque region, starts off against Zaragoza on Sunday.
	   Other first-round matches Sunday are: Real Sociedad-Oviedo;
Espanyol-Tenerife; Salamanca-Mallorca; Celta-Deportivo and
Extremadura-Valladolid.

Battle rages near Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on the city's eastern outskirts.
	   The sustained artillery and small arms battle came one day after
President Laurent Kabila returned to a capital reinforced by allied
forces from Angola and Zimbabwe. Rebels seeking to topple Kabila
had suffered a series of military setbacks in the days before this
apparent assault on the capital.
	   Fighting raged through the night and continued into the morning
in the area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   A mix of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions continued
to shudder Wednesday morning through Kinshasa.
	   Helicopters buzzed back and forth from the center of town toward
the eastern outskirts.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled to central Kinshasa on Wednesday
morning from the area where the battle was raging.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
Kinshasa suburbs during the night.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi tried to calm a nervous
city, saying the situation was under control.
	   He described the fighting as an operation by government forces
to flush out rebel fighters hiding in forests in Kinshasa's eastern
outskirts.
	   ``We ask all the population to be vigilant and denounce anyone
suspected of working with the aggressors,'' he said in an unusual
live broadcast on state radio. ``This will be a long and popular
war. Vigilance. Vigilance.''
	   State-run radio blamed the fighting on Rwanda, which the
government has accused of being behind the rebellion.
	   ``This is more barbarity by that country Rwanda, that little
country you can't even find on the map,'' a Voice of the People
radio report said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Wednesday on
continued uncertainty over Japan's financial reforms and
instability in major regional financial markets. Tokyo stocks
closed lower on worries the passage of financial stabilization
bills in Japan's parliament could be a long drawn-out process. The
Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 206.90 points, or 1.4

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors on Wednesday after investments plunged in value
under a drastic plan to restructure Russia's enormous debts, but
markets continued to fall. The ruble dove again as Central Bank
support for the Russian currency faltered. Trading at the interbank
exchange was suspended for a second day in a row after the ruble
weakened by more than 5 percent, trading at 8.26 rubles to the
dollar in contrast to 7.86 rubles on Tuesday. In another sign of
panic, the Central Bank canceled sales of dollars Wednesday to
banks and other institutions, saying its intervention would have
led to new losses in hard-currency reserves. It was the first time
the Central Bank had canceled already agreed sales during the
current crisis, indicating the government was giving up efforts to
stem the fall of the ruble. President Boris Yeltsin signed the
decree on restructuring the country's dlrs 40 billion, short-term
debt market, a day after terms of the plan were revealed. The terms
announced late Tuesday confirmed creditors' fears that they would
sustain heavy losses. Foreign investors have already been leaving
Russia in droves, and the losses they will sustain under the
restructuring _ in some cases receiving just 17 cents for every
dollar they invested, according to some analysts _ will discourage
many from returning any time soon. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's soaring unemployment
rate hit a 32-year high of 7.6 percent in July, with 1.65 million
people out of work, the government said Wednesday. The unemployment
rate will continue to rise, reaching 8 percent by year's end,
analysts predicted. That would mean more than 2 million people out
of jobs, a level which could create serious social instability.
``The jobless rate is rising very rapidly _ and very dangerously,''
said Oh Su-won, a researcher at Dongwon Securities and Investment
Co. Thousands of South Korean companies have collapsed since the
country called in the International Monetary Fund in December to
bail out its battered economy. Finance and Economy Minister Lee
Kyu-sung predicted in a report to the National Assembly Tuesday
that South Korea's economy would contract by up to 6 percent this
year, one percentage point lower than he had previously forecast.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ PepsiCo Inc. completed its dlrs 3.3 billion
purchase of Tropicana Products Inc., but was unable to persuade the
top executive of the world's largest branded juice company to stay
on the job. Ellen R. Marram, who had led Tropicana for the past
five years, turned down an offer to continue as president and chief
executive of the Florida-based juice concern and will look
elsewhere for a CEO job. Her top lieutenant, Gary Rodkin, who has
led Tropicana's North American business for three years, was named
as president and CEO of Tropicana. The Tropicana purchase from The
Seagram Co. Ltd. was concluded on Tuesday, just a day more than
five weeks after the deal was announced. Montreal-based Seagram
plans to use the cash to help pay for its purchase of the
entertainment concern Polygram NV, which it hopes to conclude this
year. Tropicana opens a new pathway into the store for PepsiCo, the
owner of the biggest U.S. snack food operation, Frito-Lay Inc., and
the second-biggest carbonated soft drink business, Pepsi-Cola Co.
It also helps it keep pace with soft drink rival Coca-Cola Co.,
which owns Minute Maid juices. Marram, who is 51, is credited with
invigorating Tropicana and expanding its business globally with the
1995 purchase of the Dole juice business. (US-TROPICANA SALE)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A prominent U.S. economist said Wednesday that
the IMF's economic reforms aren't working in Asia and that the
region should try to stimulate its battered economies by printing
more money to cause inflation. ``The time has come to do something
radical,'' said Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economics professor who gained some renown by predicting
Asia's demise before its bubble burst and the crisis began a year
ago. In a speech to a conference of business executives, Krugman
said the International Monetary Fund bailout program, which
includes large aid packages and painful economic reforms, has not
worked in countries such as Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. He
said a severe recession is now spreading across the entire region
and ``what Asia needs is inflation with increased liquidity.'' He
recommended putting more money into circulation, especially in
Japan, to encourage inflation and lower interest rates. Krugman
said the value of the yen should be allowed to fall even further
against the U.S. dollar. Krugman said his remedies would boost
consumer spending and growth. But the economist also conceded that
under this scenario investors would probably try to pull their
money out of declining Asian currencies. For that reason, he said,
governments would have to stop them with temporary exchange
restrictions. (ASIAN ECONOMIES)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items

category codes:
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The bombing of a crowded Planet
Hollywood restaurant in South Africa probably came in retaliation
for the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan but was likely the
work of a local South African group, officials said Wednesday. The
blast Tuesday evening killed one person and wounded 27 in Cape
Town's waterfront, a popular tourist destination. A leader of
Muslims Against Global Oppression denied his group was responsible
for the Tuesday evening blast despite a claim of responsibility by
a caller to radio station Cape Talk. Moain Achmad, the group's
coordinator, condemned the bombing and speculated it was carried
out to discredit Islam and scare people away from a weekend march
on the U.S. Embassy his group was organizing to protest the U.S.
missile attacks. The White House condemned the bombing but said it
had no information that it was ``politically motivated.'' South
Africa's Safety and Security Minister said the bombing was probably
linked to the U.S. cruise-missile attacks, South African
Broadcasting Corp. radio reported. (SOUTH AFRICA-EXPLOSION)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Drawing a fresh link to an old American foe,
U.S. intelligence officials say they believe the Sudanese plant
destroyed in last week's missile strike was working with Iraq to
make deadly nerve gas. Under increasing pressure to explain why the
United States attacked the Shifa Pharmaceutical Plant known for
making pain killers and malaria medicine, U.S. officials added the
Iraqi connection to previously cited findings that a chemical in
soil at the plant is unique to Iraq's unique recipe for VX nerve
gas. The assessment is based in part on intelligence interceptions
of phone calls, a U.S. official said Tuesday. U.S. officials now
concede their initial justification for the raid _ evidence linking
the plant to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi multimillionaire accused of
organizing the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa _ is
less concrete than initially claimed. The U.S. intelligence
official, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said there
is no direct financial relationship between the plant and bin
Laden. ``We knew there were fuzzy ties between him and the plant
but strong ties between him and Sudan and strong ties between the
plant and Sudan and strong ties between the plant and Iraq,'' the
intelligence official said. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Congo's capital Wednesday, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on Kinshasa's eastern outskirts. The sustained artillery
and small arms battle came one day after President Laurent Kabila
returned to a capital reinforced by allied forces from Angola and
Zimbabwe. Rebels seeking to topple Kabila had suffered a series of
military setbacks in the days before this apparent assault on the
capital. Fighting raged through the night and continued into the
morning in the eastern suburbs of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, a
witness said. A mix of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions
continued to shudder Wednesday morning through Kinshasa. Government
officials contacted Wednesday morning refused to comment, but a
military commander told The Associated Press the fight involved
artillery and rocket fire. State-run radio blamed the fighting on
Rwanda, which the government has accused of being behind the
rebellion. (CONGO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River roaring toward key
industrial centers and rich farmland, the government announced
Wednesday that a summer of devastating floods has killed 3,004
people. The announcement sharply revises the government's last
official death toll of 2,000, released nearly three weeks ago. Vice
Premier Wen Jiabao told the national legislature that as of
Saturday, 1,320 of the 3,004 deaths nationwide took place along the
Yangtze. Some areas along the river _ China's longest _ have been
inundated for 60 days or more, and soggy dikes are now perilously
weakened. In a report carried by the state-run Xinhua News Agency,
Wen said nationwide 5 million houses have been destroyed and 21
million hectares (52 million acres) of land swamped. Economic
losses have surpassed 165 billion yuan (dlrs 20 billion).
Nationwide more than 233 million people _ a fifth of the population
_ have been affected to varying degrees by the flooding, Wen told
the standing committee of the National People's Congress.
(CHINA-FLOODS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia no closer to ending
political turmoil a month after parliamentary elections, opposition
leaders said Wednesday their followers were willing to brave
bullets and grenades to protest against strongman Hun Sen. Some
5,000 people remained in a park across from the National Assembly
in the third day of a sit-in, protesting alleged electoral fraud
and demanding that Hun Sen _ the declared victor of the July 26
polls _ step down. The leaders of the opposition parties, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, rejected government demands to
move the protest to a sports stadium but agreed to work more
closely with police on concerns about hygiene and pickpockets among
the crowd. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said their followers were
committed to overturning what they called widespread electoral
fraud and were prepared face violence from the government. The park
was the scene of a grenade attack last year against a protest led
by Sam Rainsy that killed 16 people and wounded more than 100. Hun
Sen has been widely blamed for the attack, but denies
responsibility. (CAMBODIA-PROTEST)

Police seize dlrs 100,000 stock of pirated compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in the Russian capital have arrested a
suspected dealer of pirated compact discs and seized 50,000 copies
of unlicensed music discs and software worth dlrs 100,000,
officials said Wednesday.
	   A 23-year old Moscow resident, who was arrested on Tuesday, was
accused of trading in pirated copies of Western music discs and
computer software. The suspect's identity wasn't given.
	   Officials estimated that the suspected trader had inflicted
damage worth dlrs 4 million to western producers of music discs and
software, the Interfax news agency reported. No other details were
immediately available.
	   An estimated 90 percent of all software in Russia is unlicensed
and the government has been able to do little to combat the piracy
despite recent efforts.
	   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who visited Russia last October,
urged Russian authorities to crack down on the problem.
	   In December, the State Customs Committee announced it had seized
more than 650,000 copies of pirated discs in 1997.

Clerides flying to Athens to tackle threatening missile crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Glafcos Clerides was scheduled
to fly to Athens on Wednesday night for talks with the Greek Prime
Minister amid reports of serious differences over the planned
deployment of Russian anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus.
	   While Cypriot and Greek government spokesmen deny any rift,
newspapers and opposition politicians in both states have said
Athens is backing away from full-hearted support for the missiles
in Cyprus.
	   Turkey has said publicly it will take military action to prevent
Cyprus from installing the S-300 missiles, now scheduled for
November. By a mutual defense pact, Greece is bound to come to
Cyprus's aid if it is attacked.
	   ``There is complete confusion over the joint defense agreement
and the issue of the missile deployment,'' the speaker of the
Cypriot parliament, former President Spyros Kyprianou, has said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 in
the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Talk of a rift turned serious on Monday when Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos said a decision about the missile's
deployment was ``a matter for the Cyprus government alone.''
	   Commentators in Nicosia and Athens interpreted the remark as a
clear indication that Greece was getting cold feet about a move
that could lead to war with Turkey, a fellow member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Pangalos
was speaking to ``a specific audience, mainly abroad.''
	   The United States, and to a lesser extent the European Union,
have been applying heavy diplomatic pressure to the Cypriot and
Greek governments to abandon the missile deployment.
	   The U.S. special envoy for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, has visited
Ankara several times in past months in a bid to persuade Turkey to
back off from its position. But all reports say Turkey remains
adamantly opposed to the missile's installation.
	   Clerides, whose talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
were scheduled weeks ago, faces strong pressure at home to hold the
line on the missile issue.
	   The socialist party, EDEK, has threatened to withdraw from the
coalition government and demand the president's resignation if
Clerides backs down. Its spokesmen have reminded Cypriots that
Clerides made the missiles' deployment a main plank of his election
campaign in February.
	   Clerides has offered to cancel the missiles if Turkey accepts
his proposal for demilitarization of the island, or if there is
progress in the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island. Turkey insists its 35,000 troops in north Cyprus are
essential for Turkish Cypriots' security.

Army destroys drug crops in northeastern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) _ Soldiers and police destroyed hemp and
poppy fields in northeast Lebanon on Wednesday as part of an
ongoing crackdown on illegal drugs, security officials said.
	   The units used 17 tractors to plow under hemp and poppy crops _
used to make hashish and opium _ on 40 square kilometers (15 square
miles) of land.
	   The fields were in the remote Akkar and Hermel regions, about 15
kilometers (8 miles) west of the Syrian border.
	   The security officials described the plowing, but did not
estimate the quantity of destroyed drugs. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Army troops and the police's Drug Enforcement Office have
mounted several raids this year in eastern Lebanon, an impoverished
region where trade in illegal drugs thrived amid the chaos of the
1975-90 civil war.
	   The army, backed by Syrian security forces deployed in the
region, has destroyed most hemp fields since the end of the war.

Reports: Poisoning victims in Japan were insured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 1st graf to remove reference to acquaintance as
beneficiary; UPDATES 3rd graf with new figure for combined value of
insurance policies.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two men sickened by arsenic near the site of a
subsequent mass poisoning in western Japan were covered by life
insurance policies from about 10 different companies, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   The men had policies from both Japanese and foreign insurers,
the Asahi newspaper quoted police sources as saying. Police
suspected insurance fraud because individuals and corporations
other than the men and their families were the chief beneficiaries,
the Asahi said.
	   The pair were covered by policies worth a combined 160 million
yen (dlrs 1.1 million), national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   The two men _ whose names have not been released _ were
reportedly poisoned several times over the past three years after
eating meals at the home of an acquaintance.
	   The Mainichi newspaper said the insurance policies were bought
with the help of this mutual friend.
	   The acquaintance's home is located near the site of fatal
curried rice poisonings last month in Wakayama, a small coastal
city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Four people _
including two children _ died and dozens were sickened at the
community festival.
	   The poisonings were major news in Japan and forced the
cancellation of similar annual festivals.
	   Police declined to comment on Wednesday's news reports, have
made little progress so far in finding the killer.
	   None of the Japanese media reports named any of the three men
involved or directly linked the case to the later mass poisoning.
	   The two men were treated separately at a hospital for nausea
after visiting the acquaintance's home, Japanese media have
reported. Police suspect they became ill after consuming something
at the house.

Pope's surgeon dies at 67

 &UR; AP Photos ROM101, 102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The pope's surgeon, Dr. Francesco Crucitti, died
Wednesday of cancer at the age of 67 at Gemelli Polyclinic hospital
in Rome.
	   Crucitti operated on John Paul three times. After hearing of
Crucitti's death, the pontiff visited the surgeon's home Wednesday
and prayed at his casket, the Vatican said.
	   In 1981, Crucitti led the medical team that operated on the
pontiff after he was shot in the abdomen during an assassination
attempt in St. Peter's Square. In 1992, he removed a benign tumor
from the pope's colon. And in 1996, Crucitti removed his inflamed
appendix.
	   Born in the southern city of Reggio Calabria, Crucitti finished
medical school at only 22, and then specialized in general surgery.
He also did research in breast, pancreatic and gastric cancer.
	   Crucitti had been director of the Institute of General Surgery
at the Catholic University in Rome since 1967. His funeral will be
at the university's church on Thursday. The pope's secretary of
state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, will preside, the Vatican said.
	   Crucitti is survived by his wife Alessandra De Lieto and three
children, Antonio, Roberta and Pierfilippo.

Ukrainian government prepares debt restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet is preparing a debt
restructuring plan that would allow investors to swap Treasury
bills denominated in the local currency for dollar bonds, the
Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The plan might be formally signed Wednesday or Thursday, said
ministry spokeswoman Iryna Bezverkha. She declined to disclose
details.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, however, said the proposed dollar
bonds would mature in a period from 18 months to five years and
carry a 12 percent to 14 percent coupon payable semi-annually.
	   Such a proposal would in fact benefit investors, analysts said,
since they stand to lose money if they are to get redemption
payments in the Ukrainian currency, the hryvna, amid a sharp
decline in the currency's exchange rate.
	   Foreign investors currently hold about 18 percent of Ukraine's
outstanding Treasury bills, which totaled some 10.3 billion hryvna
(dlrs 4.6 billion) in mid-August, according to Central Bank and
ITAR-Tass figures. In all, 3.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.7 billion)
are expected to mature by the end of 1998 and the rest in 1999.
	   Ukraine, with dlrs 18 billion in foreign debt, long has been
gripped by a financial crisis caused by high-interest borrowing
abroad, the withdrawal of foreign investors from its shaky
financial markets and inability to collect tax payments.
	   Russia's ruble crisis has prompted fears of a further investor
exodus and put a question mark over the future of trade with
Russia, Ukraine's largest economic partner.
	   It also has pushed the battered hryvna down from 2.1435 to the
U.S. dollar in mid-August to 2.2485 on Tuesday, close to the limit
of the government-set currency fluctuation corridor of 1.8 to 2.25
to the dollar.
	   Most market analysts expect that corridor to be widened in the
near future.
	   The government's decision to restructure the bond debt
apparently has been accelerated by the IMF's delay in discussing a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   An International Monetary Fund mission approved the release of
the loan last month and its board of directors was expected to
discuss it this week.
	   But on Tuesday, the IMF said it would need more time to assess
the effect of Russia's intensifying financial crisis and political
change on Ukraine before it sets a date for the meeting.
	   ``With recent developments in Russia, we are reviewing the
situation in Ukraine,'' an IMF spokeswoman said in Washington.
	   The delay has put heavy pressure on Ukraine's Central Bank,
which had hoped to used the loan to replenish its coffers. The
bank's reserves have decreased by almost half, to dlrs 1.1 billion
so far this year, in efforts to defend the hryvna.

Thailand donates funds to Chinese flood victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will donate dlrs 10,000 to
help victims of devastating floods in China which have killed over
3,000 people, the Southeast Asian country's Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   Despite economic troubles at home, the contribution will be made
to show appreciation for the longstanding friendly relations
between the two nations, the ministry said in a statement.
	   China contributed dlrs 1 billion last year to a dlrs 17.2
billion International Monetary Fund-orchestrated economic rescue
package for Thailand.
	   The Nation newspaper reported that Thailand's Foreign Minister,
Surin Pitsuwan, has also urged the Thai-Chinese business community
to make donations to help China overcome flood damage.

Aide to former South Korean president imprisoned again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A convicted aide to former South
Korean President Kim Young-sam was imprisoned again Wednesday,
seven months after his prison term was suspended for medical
reasons, prosecutors said.
	   Hong In-kil, 55, was put back in prison in Taegu, 240 kilometers
(144 miles) southeast of Seoul after prosecutors said he has
recovered enough to continue to serve his term.
	   His six-year prison sentence was suspended in January because of
multiple illnesses.
	   Last December, the Supreme Court found Hong guilty of taking
dlrs 670,000 in bribes from a bankrupt steel firm in return for
helping it obtain preferential bank loans.
	   Hong was among several close aides to former President Kim
Young-sam, who left office in 1993 after serving a five-year term.
	   Prosecutors also said Wednesday that Hong may also face new
bribery charges.
	   He allegedly received dlrs 2.86 million in 1994-95 from Chang
Soo-hong, chairman of the Chunggu construction group, in exchange
for helping Chang obtain a government license to operate a TV
station.
	   Prosecution officials said Hong admitted receiving money from
Chunggu but claimed that it was a political donation with no
strings attached _ an excuse commonly used by politicians to evade
legal punishment.
	   The Chunggu chairman, Chang, is now on trial on charges of
embezzling company funds and using them to bribe politicians and
government officials.
	   Prosecutors said they were investigating some 10 legislators on
suspicion of receiving bribes from Chang.

Former chairman of Hong Kong company charged for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former chairman of Hong Kong's Allied Group,
which was involved in one of the territory's biggest commercial
crimes, was charged Wednesday for conspiracy to defraud, police
said.
	   Lee Ming-tee, 58, a Malaysian-Chinese, was charged with
``various offenses involving conspiracy to defraud,'' a police
statement said. He was arrested Tuesday night at a mainland border
checkpoint when leaving Hong Kong. A police spokeswoman refused to
give further details.
	   Allied came under investigation in 1992 for shares deals between
January 1990 and May 1992 that regulators said may have breached
the territory's takeover and disclosure rules.
	   The Hong Kong government said in 1993 that the probe into the
property and manufacturing group uncovered evidence that company
executives sidestepped shareholder-protection rules and disguised
share transactions.
	   It said the investigation showed standards of commercial
corporate conduct that gave serious cause for concern, but did not
say at the time what legal action it planned to take.
	   The 100 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.8) probe was the
most expensive commercial crime investigation in Hong Kong, the
Hong Kong Standard said.

Most Asian markets close lower

 &UR; Eds: REMOVES ampersand from Sumitomo Trust and Banking in graf 5;
official company name takes ampersand

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Wednesday on
continued uncertainty over Japan's financial reforms and
instability in major regional financial markets.
	   Tokyo stocks closed lower on worries the passage of financial
stabilization bills in Japan's parliament could be a long drawn-out
process.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 206.90 points, or
1.4 percent, to 14,866.03, after an 84.57-point gain Tuesday.
	   Opposition parties boycotted a debate in parliament on bank
reform because of a dispute with the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
	   The opposition is strongly criticizing a government-backed plan
for a rescue merger between the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., and want the presidents of the
two banks to testify before parliament.
	   ``If the opposition can block the proposals, in the worst case
scenario it could lead to another general election...(and) a dely
in needed reforms,'' said Stephen Wood, a senior salesman at ING
Baring Securities in Japan.
	   In Seoul, shares closed higher on strong foreign buying, after
concerns over global financial instability subsided with overnight
stock gains in the United States and Europe.
	   The benchmark KOSPI index rose 7.33 points, or 2.4 percent, to
close at 317.56.
	   In Hong Kong, shares ended slightly lower as government
intervention shifted to the futures market, prompting a frantic
scramble that sent shares tumbling.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 55.69 points, or 0.7
percent, at 7,834.40.
	   With prices lower, investors took advantage to cover short
positions built up before the government began its buying spree,
which has triggered sharp gains in the index over the past seven
sessions.
	   Kent Rossiter, senior investment advisor at Nikko Securities
Ltd., said the government's sudden withdrawal from the futures
market in the late afternoon led to a quick downward movement of
the Hang Seng Index.
	   Rossiter said the government wanted ``to see how much genuine
support there was from institutional buyers'' when the government
didn't support the market.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended lower as the heavyweight energy
sector took a dive, signaling that big institutional investors are
clearing out of the market completely. The SET index lost 2.72
points, or 1.2 percent, to end at 227.50.
	   JAKARTA: Sentiment turned sour as most of regional major
equities market failed to recover, driving Indonesian shares prices
to close sharply lower. The JSX composite index closed down 6.216
points, or 1.7 percent, at 360.927.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares were up slightly in dull trading ahead of
the release of second-quarter economic growth figures Thursday. The
benchmark Composite Index ended almost flat at 324.49, up 0.32
points.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower for the fourth straight
session. The PSE Index closed down 23.17 points, or 1.8 percent, at
1,287.02, its lowest closing level in more than six years.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher as institutional
funds looked for bargains and covered short positions. The STI
Index closed 1.6 percent, or 14.53 points higher at 925.85.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices slid lower, pressured by a
falling Japanese stock market and a plunge in the Australian dollar
that undermined investor confidence. The All Ordinaries index of
share prices closed at 2,608.0, down 19.7 points or 0.7 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended at a 21-month low as investors
snubbed market regulators' latest attempt to bring stability to the
beleaguered bourse. The Weighted Price Index closed 94.00 points
lower or 1.4 percent, at 6,814.33.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished slightly lower
with brokers saying local investors were cautious in light of
global economic and market uncertainty. The NZSE-40 was down 0.65
points to close at 1,943.05.

Three British athletes face ban for drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English track cyclist Gary Edwards was suspended
from the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday after failing a drug test
and two British weighlifters also faced possible doping bans.
	   The British Cycling Federation said Edwards, 32, had been
suspended from the English team for next month's Commonwealth Games
in Kuala Lumpur after failing an out-of-competition test.
	   ``The suspension follows a finding which warrants further
investigation, not possible in the short period involved before the
games commence,'' the statement said.
	   The random tests were conducted by the UK Sports Council on
hundreds of athletes preparing for the Commonwealth Games.
	   Representatives of the English and Welsh Commonwealth Games
Councils confirmed that two English athletes and one Welsh
competitor had ``adverse findings'' to the doping tests. They did
not disclose the athletes' names.
	   But the Times and Daily Mail newspapers identified the other two
athletes as English weightlifter Paul Supple and Welsh weightlifter
Andrew Goswell.
	   Edwards and Supple, 1996 British 94-kilogram-class weightlifting
champion, were found to have excess levels of testosterone in the
A-samples of their urine specimens, the Times reported.
	   Supple denied using performing enhancing drugs.
	   ``I cannot say anything expect that I have never taken drugs in
my life,'' he was quoted as saying in the Times.
	   The Times reported Goswell's sample allegedly showed traces of
the anabolic steroid Stanozolol _ the same drug Canadian 100-meter
sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for before he was stripped of
100-meter gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
	   Testing of the three B-sample specimens will be undertaken at
the International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in
London. If the tests confirm the A-samples, the athletes face bans
of two or more years.
	   The UK Sports Council conducted the doping tests to avoid a
repeat of drugs scandals which have plagued British teams at major
international championships in the 1990s.
	   In 1990, defending Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion
Dean Willey returned a positive doping test before the Games and
was dropped from the English team. Two Welsh weightlifters tested
positive in Aukland and were sent home.
	   In 1992 a sprinter and two weightlifters were sent home from the
Barcelona Olympics after failing pre-games tests.
	   In 1994 Paul Edwards and Diane Modahl were sent back from the
Commonwealth Games in Canada, although Modahl later won an appeal
and is currently taking legal action against the British Athletics
Federation for compensation.

Planet Hollywood bombing linked to U.S. attacks in Sudan,

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The bombing of a crowded Planet
Hollywood restaurant probably came in retaliation for the U.S.
attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan but was likely the work of a local
group, government officials said Wednesday.
	   FBI agents were headed to the site of the attack in Cape Town's
waterfront, a popular tourist destination. A half-dozen bouquets
were scattered on blood-spattered steps in front of the shattered
restaurant where one man was killed and 27 people were wounded in
the bombing Tuesday evening.
	   A leader of Muslims Against Global Oppression denied his group
was responsible for the Tuesday evening blast despite a claim of
responsibility by a caller to radio station Cape Talk.
	   ``Anyone can call a radio station and say they are from MAGO,''
Moain Achmad, the group's coordinator, told The Associated Press
Wednesday.
	   He condemned the bombing and speculated it was carried out to
discredit Islam and scare people away from a march his group was
organizing on the U.S.
	   Embassy on Saturday to protest the U.S. attacks in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   In Washington, the State Department said Muslims Against Global
Oppression was anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. Some members were
among the 40 or so people who protested U.S. policies on Iraq and
Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape Town in
March.
	   The White House condemned the bombing but said it had no
information it was ``politically motivated.''
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the bombing
was probably linked to the U.S. cruise-missile attacks, South
African Broadcasting Corp. radio reported. The U.S. attacks were
themselves retaliation for the bombings earlier this month of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Two FBI agents who had been investigating the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi were flying down and were expected here
later Wednesday at South Africa's invitation, said National Police
Commissioner George Fivaz.
	   ``These people have expertise about similar attacks all over the
world,'' Fivaz told journalists as he visited the wrecked Planet
Hollywood.
	   President Nelson Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said
police had ``indications'' a pipe bomb was responsible.
	   ``These pipe bombs ... are a very common phenomenon in the
Western Cape, which might be an indication that we are not dealing
with an international network but a local group,'' he said.
	   A Muslim vigilante organization, People Against Drugs and
Gangsterism, has been widely blamed for pipe bomb attacks in recent
years targeting suspected gangsters and drug dealers in the area.
	   ``As far as President Mandela is concerned, it is immaterial
whether the bombing is retaliation or not. We will still treat it
as an attack against innocent South Africans, against innocent
people,'' Mankahlana said.
	   Though initially saying the person killed was a woman, police
later said it was a man.
	   Standard Bank identified the victim as Fanie Schoeman, an
employee in the human resources department. The bank was holding a
going-away party at the eatery in Cape Town's trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront.
	   Seven other people at the party were injured, two seriously,
said Standard Bank spokesman Erik Larson.
	   Five members of a family from Hampshire, England, were injured.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Iris Giddings, 65, the only member
unharmed, was quoted as saying by Press Association.
	   ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as the
ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us. I was knocked down
and saw my family all lying injured before me. It was one of the
most terrible things I could imagine seeing.''
	   Planet Hollywood's bar, covered in blood, bore the brunt of the
blast, which cracked walls, shattered windows and lifted part of
the ceiling off the
	   restaurant. It then fell back into place.
	   A small crater in a corner of the bar marked the apparent spot
where the bomb went off.
	   A glass booth holding a mannequin of movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger was
	   shattered at the restaurant entrance.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, the franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.

Bomb-interrupted talks concluded; Tanzania toll rises to 12
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped
up some unfinished business on Wednesday, meeting with Kenya's
trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car
bombing of the embassy.
	   On Aug. 7, Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kimotho and others
had just ended a news conference in a building adjacent to the
embassy. They were talking when the bomb went off, killing 247
people and wounding more than 5,000 others.
	   On Wednesday, Bushnell and Kimotho met again to finish their
discussion, Bushnell told Kenya Television.
	   The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast, which
damaged the embassy, shattered the glass shell of the 22-story
Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi House.
	   Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent
search and rescue at the blast scene, memorials for those slain,
and the relocation to a temporary embassy.
	   Kimotho, who was hospitalized with a head wound, said he and
Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley in September. His trip is still on, the
embassy said.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment
as an explosion ripped through the American Embassy in Tanzania's
commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   The death toll in the Tanzania blast, initially 10, has risen to
12, hospital officials and family members said Wednesday. That
brought the toll for both bombings to 259.

Attorney general files criminal suit against Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMAD OSMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's attorney general said Wednesday
that the government has filed a lawsuit in criminal court against
the United States for its missile strike last week against a
Khartoum factory.
	   The attorney general, Ali al-Zaki, told The Associated Press
that U.S. President Bill Clinton would be named.
	   ``We have filed a law suit against the United States of America,
which is represented by President Bill Clinton,'' al-Zaki said.
	   He added that ``the normal procedure is that if a person or an
entity fails to show up in court, he will be tried in absentia.''
	   U.S. missiles last Thursday destroyed the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in North Khartoum. A second missile
strike targeted camps in Afghanistan used by Muslim extremist Osama
bin Laden, who the United States has linked to the Aug. 7 bombings
of U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was making a precursor for the deadly VX nerve
gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   The government said 10 people were injured in the missile
attack. Plant officials said the factory sustained dlrs 100 million
in damages.
	   Al-Zaki said the district attorney in the area where the factory
is located had begun ``a criminal investigation to decide the scope
of the damages incurred by the Sudanese people.''

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A member of an Israeli-backed
Lebanese militia was killed Wednesday in sporadic exchanges of fire
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas, an Israeli army
spokesman said.
	   The shelling erupted after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night, injuring 19 civilians.
	   The militia man from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA), was killed when Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the SLA, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   The Israelis and the SLA returned fire.
	   An Israeli military official said the army did not seek an
escalation of tensions and was responding to ongoing Hezbollah
attacks rather than acting in reprisal for Tuesday night's rocket
barrage on northern Israeli towns and settlements.
	   Tuesday night's Katyusha barrage followed the killing of Hossam
al-Amin, a leader of the military wing of the Shiite Amal militia.
An Israeli helicopter ambushed his car, blowing up the vehicle as
it traveled along the coastal highway in south Lebanon.
	   Soon after Hezbollah fired two salvos of rockets into Israel.
	   Hezbollah said the rocket attacks were not in retaliation for
the killing of Amin, but in response to the wounding of six
Lebanese civilians Tuesday, when the SLA shelled the village of
Masghara.
	   An Israeli military official said a Lebanese civilian was killed
in the Masghara attack, but this was not mentioned in the Hezbollah
statement.
	   On Wednesday. some in Israel questioned whether the killing of
Amin was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, a retired general from the
opposition Labor Party, said it was a mistake because it put
Israeli civilians at risk.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Israel army radio.
	   However, party colleague Ephraim Sneh, also a retired general,
said the killing was justified. Interviewed on Israel radio he said
that ``the correct and the most effective way to fight terrorism is
by killing their key figures.''
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over. However, civil defense wardens were
instructed to leave the shelters unlocked in case of more attacks.
	   President Ezer Weizman visited the border town of Kiryat
Shemona, where some of the Katyushas fell. He visited a community
center which was hit by one of the rockets and called on a young
couple whose wedding celebration broke up in confusion as the
Katyushas exploded nearby.
	   Weizman invited the couple to spend a weekend in a hotel of
their choice, anywhere in Israel, at his expense.

Report: Police free kidnapped German citizen, Russian interpreter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police have freed a German citizen and his
Russian interpreter who were kidnapped last month by attackers who
demanded a ransom of 3 million deutschemarks (dlrs 1.7 million), a
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Wolfgang Katcher, a 54-year old resident of Bremen, Germany, and
his 21-year old Russian interpreter were freed following an
investigation by Moscow's organized crime police squad, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   It didn't say how or where the victims were kidnapped and gave
no details of their release, including if any ransom money was
paid.
	   The report said police were now making efforts to track down the
abductors.
	   A spokesman for the Moscow city police refused to comment on the
report and officers of the squad didn't answer phone calls on
Wednesday.
	   Thomas Pfanne, a spokesman for the German Embassy in Moscow,
confirmed the Interfax report but refused to give any further
comment.

Foreign MPs back Myanmar opposition call; embassy protest ended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police on Wednesday removed the
last 16 Myanmar students who had been demonstrating for democracy
outside their country's embassy, breaking up a two-week-long
protest.
	   At the height of the demonstration, more than 100 Myanmar
students and Thai pro-democracy activists had been encamped outside
the embassy. Late last week more than a dozen began a hunger
strike.
	   Police confirmed an announcement from the students that the last
16 Myanmar students had been detained Wednesday. Fourteen others
had been taken away Sunday and Monday.
	   A news release from the All Burma Students' Democratic Front
said three Thai protestors were not held but were forced to leave
the area. It also said that police pulled down all the posters that
had been put up by the protestors.
	   Thai immigration police said the Myanmar protestors would not be
charged with any crime, but instead would be taken to holding
centers near the Myanmar border.
	   The move to clear the demonstrators came after Myanmar diplomats
protested to the Thai Foreign Ministry that the protesters were
interferring with their work.
	   The Thai government has asked the students to move their protest
across the street from the embassy, but the students did not
comply.
	   A group of European and Asian lawmakers meeting here Wednesday
announced their support of the Myanmar opposition's call for the
parliament elected eight years ago to be seated.
	   The International Network of Political Leaders Promoting
Democracy in Burma _ known as PD Burma, for short _ warned
Myanmar's military against using violence to prevent parliament
from convening. Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   The group, holding its annual meeting, has as its objective
promoting freedom of speech, respect for human rights and
democratization in Myanmar.
	   Myanmar's military government held parliamentary elections in
1990, but refused to allow parliament to convene after a landslide
victory by the pro-democracy opposition. Scores of would-be members
of parliament were jailed, forced to resign their positions, or
fled into exile.
	   The main opposition party, the National League for Democracy,
earlier this year demanded the government seat parliament by Aug.
21. After the deadline was not met, it said it would convene the
parliamentary session on its own. The government has warned that
such an action would be illegal.

Slum youths' photos shown alongside World Press Photo exhibit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Photographs taken by youngsters from
Nairobi's sprawling Mathare slum to illustrate their lives and
hopes went on display Wednesday alongside the work of the world's
leading photojournalists at the Nairobi National Musem.
	   The photos are part of the Mathare Youth Sports Association
``Shootback Project'' that is running alongside the World Press
Photo exhibit.
	   ``They have basic, inexpensive 35mm point-and-shoot cameras and
are photographing aspects of their lives that they deem important
and/or problematic, including family, community, environment health
and personal issues,'' said project coordinator Lana Wong.
	   She said 32 youngsters between the ages of 12 and 17 are
participating in the project designed to encourage people to
improve living conditions in slum areas.
	   ``It is not just for fun,'' Wong said. ``I'm trying to give them
a skill they can use to earn a living because most of them have
very poor parents.''
	   World Press Photo project manager Michiel Munnneke said the 1997
competition attracted 36,000 entries from around the world. The
winning 200 photos form the travelling exhibit.
	   He said he was encouraged by the number of participants from
Africa.
	   ``A lot of participants from Africa are from South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Kenya,'' Munneke said. ``We are still trying to get
more (from African countries) to take part.''
	   The exhibit runs from Wednesday through Sept. 14.

More arrested for gang-related money laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police staged about two dozen raids and
arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in connection with
a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
	   The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong
police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old
Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender.''
	   Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in
China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery. The gang
allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets
of 17 relatives of Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles
are restrained under the order.
	   Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the
ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about
200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,740) during the raids.
	   The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police are still being detained for
questioning.
	   Although no official information was ever released on the
kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons
from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
	   Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at
seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
	   In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8
million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan
(U.S. dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese
state media.

Kohl woos eastern German voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl reached out
Wednesday to voters in economically depressed eastern Germany,
pledging to raise their living standard if he is re-elected next
month.
	   Campaigning in Gera in the formerly communist east, Kohl
declared that the region's unemployment was receding because of
economic growth and appealed to voters to trust his leadership.
	   Eastern Germany is key territory for Kohl's campaign as he
battles Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder,
the front runner for the Sept. 27 election.
	   In an interview with the weekly Die Zeit, Kohl said one of his
goals for a fifth term is ``to make more headway toward equalizing
living conditions in Germany.''
	   He also admitted making a serious mistake at the time of
unification that helped kill most of east German industry.
	   ``In 1990, I believed that a large number of west German
companies would help east German firms become competitive,'' he
told the newspaper. ``But many were only interested in shutting
down possible competitors.''
	   Eastern voters flocked to Kohl and his Christian Democrats after
German unification eight years ago. But they have increasingly
turned their backs because Kohl's 1990 campaign promise to turn the
area into ``blooming landscapes'' has largely failed to come true.
	   In elections last April in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt,
support for the Christian Democrats slumped to its lowest since
unification.
	   Kohl, in a speech opening a new government building in Gera,
reminded eastern Germans that his government has extended aid to
the area through 2004.
	   The 68-year-old chancellor also winked at younger,
ecologically-minded voters.
	   He said he would not rule out an alliance between his party and
the Greens in the future _ though not after the upcoming election _
if they tone down their pacifist and environmentalist stands.
	   Kohl contrasted his portly, homespun image with that of
Schroeder, a telegenic pro-business Social Democrats given to
designer suits and cigars.
	   ``I am not on the chic side of German politics,'' he said. ``I'm
an inelegant type of person.''
	   Schroeder revealed more plans for the early days of a Social
Democratic government, saying he would link corporate tax cuts to
companies' willingness to help find jobs for 100,000 young people.
	   ``We have use crowbar tactics if necessary to give young people
perspectives for the future again,'' he was quoted as saying in the
weekly Die Woche.

Taiwanese charities holding off on aid to China amid opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ World Vision of Taiwan has canceled a U.S.
dlrs 100,000 shipment of aid to Chinese flood victims following
opposition from donors, the charity said Wednesday.
	   Donors notified of the shipment last week doubted the aid would
be properly used, said Kuo Su-chen, a World Vision spokeswoman.
Others said Beijing didn't deserve help because of its aggressive
stance towards Taiwan.
	   ``Many donors had the attitude that `China is unfriendly towards
us, and since they don't show much concern for their own people,
why should we pick up the slack,''' said Kuo.
	   China and international humanitarian groups are meeting relief
demands, and the charity will again consider providing assistance
once waters recede and recovery begins, she said.
	   Humanitarian groups here have aided China since at least 1991.
But the murders of Taiwanese tourists in China and Beijing's
threatening military exercises against the island in 1995-96 dried
up much good will among Taiwanese towards China.
	   Beijing claims sovereignty towards Taiwan, and threatens to use
force to reunify it with China.
	   Newspapers here have reported with a touch of cynicism on the
massive Chinese propaganda effort riding piggyback on this year's
campaign against the floods, which have killed over 2,000 people
throughout China and left millions homeless.
	   The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation said it was
still surveying the need for aid. The charity has rebuilt schools
and houses for Chinese flood victims in past years, but a
spokeswoman, who declined to identify herself, said it often has
had to overcome donor opposition to providing aid to China.
	   The Taiwanese Red Cross Society said it plans to send blankets,
medical equipment and other relief supplies to China.
	   Though it is impossible to gauge the level of ambivalence,
opposition to aiding China seems to have peaked this summer.
	   Kuo said World Vision Taiwan received enthusiastic support in
January for donations of 10 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
285,714) for victims of a devastating earthquake in northern China,
and has consistently aided poor children in China's southern
Guangxi province.

Guinea-Bissau's gov't, rebels cement cease-fire; airport to reopen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Peace talks between the Guinea-Bissau
government and rebels made progress Wednesday as both sides renewed
a month-old cease-fire and agreed to allow aid flights into the
capital of the West African country, news reports said.
	   The measures were the first serious signs of a thaw in relations
since sporadic negotiations began after a truce was agreed a month
ago, Ivory Coast Foreign Minister Amara Essy told the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   Essy led the delegation for the Economic Community of West
African States, ECOWAS, which is brokering the talks along with the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or CPLP.
	   The two days of negotiations, which ended Wednesday, were held
in the West African archipelago Cape Verde. The next round is
scheduled for Sept. 12 in the Ivory Coast, Lusa reported.
	   Fighting in the former Portuguese colony erupted June 7 when a
breakaway military faction led by former armed forces chief Brig.
Ansumane Mane seized a Bissau military base and the international
airport.
	   The rebels accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and demanded that he step down, but their revolt was halted by
troops from neighboring Senegal who aided Vieira.
	   The rebellion triggered a wave of hundreds of thousands of
refugees in this tiny coastal nation of one million people. It is
not known how many people were killed in the fighting.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped
up some unfinished business on Wednesday, meeting with Kenya's
trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car
bombing of the embassy.
	   On Aug. 7, Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho and others
had just ended a news conference in a building adjacent to the
embassy. They were talking when the bomb went off, killing 247
people and wounding more than 5,000 others.
	   On Wednesday, Bushnell and Kamotho met again to finish their
discussion, Bushnell told Kenya Television.
	   The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast, which
damaged the embassy, shattered the glass shell of the 22-story
Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi House.
	   Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent
search and rescue at the blast scene, memorials for those slain,
and the relocation to a temporary embassy.
	   Kamotho, who was hospitalized with a head wound, said he and
Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley in September. His trip is still on, the
embassy said.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment
as an explosion ripped through the American Embassy in Tanzania's
commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   The death toll in the Tanzania blast, initially 10, has risen to
12 after two of the injured died, hospital officials and family
members said Wednesday. That brought the toll for both bombings to
259.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers have hiked
the prices of premium seating so more Australians can afford the
cheaper tickets for the 2000 games.
	   Organizers announced the domestic ticket prices for all sports
Wednesday, with a range from 10 to 1,382 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5.80 to 798). While the top price tickets are much more
expensive than four years ago in Atlanta, there are also
significantly cheaper tickets available for the Sydney games.
	   The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
said 75 percent of the 9.6 million tickets would be made available
to Australians, with 70 percent costing less than 60 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 34.80) and 80 percent less than 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58).
	   Five million tickets will be on sale through a mail order offer
to start in mid-1999. The balance will be divided between children
and disadvantaged groups, media and international fans, athletes
and officials.
	   The International Olympic Committee gave SOCOG the green light
to launch its ticket program last week after initial concern over
the high prices SOCOG planned to charge.
	   The top price tickets of Aust dlrs 1,382 (U.S. 798) are up from
the U.S. dlrs 637 charged by the Atlanta Olympic organizers in
1996. But SOCOG's aim of getting more Australians to the games
while raising about U.S. 350 million relies on having enough cheap
tickets.
	   Whereas Atlanta's cheapest seat to the opening or closing
ceremonies was U.S. dlrs 212, in Sydney there will be 10,000
tickets available to the opening and 5,000 to the closing at U.S.
dlrs 61.
	   ``The tickets are priced at a level which will ensure those who
want to experience the Olympic Games can afford to do so,'' said
SOCOG president Michael Knight.
	   Track and field, swimming, artistic gymnastics and men's
basketball all have a peak price of U.S. dlrs 263. But tickets for
some gymnastics will be available for U.S. dlrs 5.80, the track and
swimming heats from U.S. dlrs 20 and the basketball preliminaries
from U.S. dlrs 26.
	   About 750,000 tickets will be allocated to fans outside
Australia through foreign National Olympic Committees. SOCOG is not
authorized to sell tickets overseas.
	   SOCOG spokesman John O'Neill said the NOC's would have to pay
the same as Australian mail-order buyers for their tickets. He said
people living outside Australia would not be able to buy tickets
through Australian travel agents.
	   About 1.5 million tickets will be made available directly to
children and the disadvantaged for less than U.S. dlrs 11, for 18
sports including baseball, softball, soccer and cycling.
	   ``While these tickets might not be the best in the house they'll
deliver a very memorable Olympic Games,'' said Knight.
	   But Gary Moore, director of the Council of Social Services of
New South Wales, said Olympic organizers could do more to
specifically target disadvantaged groups _ including Aborigines,
senior citizens, people with disabilities and non-English speaking
backgrounds - and broaden the range of sports offering cheap
tickets.
	   ``Ninety-five dollars is a huge hurdle for people in the bottom
20 percent of incomes. And with basketball a favorite sport of many
disadvantaged young people, there are no cheap tickets to the
finals,'' Moore said.
	   Knight defended the procedure as fair.
	   ``These games are not just for the mega-rich, they are for the
average Australian as well,'' Knight said. ``We don't want to
pretend today that everyone will get everything they want out of
the Sydney Games. But we've done everything possible.''
	   In general SOCOG has priced its tickets below and above the
range in Atlanta, with a couple of notable exceptions in the pool.
	   Water polo final tickets are up from U.S. dlrs 32 to U.S. 147
dollars, despite poor attendances when the sport was played as part
of the world swimming championships in Perth earlier this year.
Barely a hundred people watched Australia contest the final rounds
in Perth, with many leaving after a swim program despite holding
free tickets to the water polo.
	   And SOCOG has valued tickets for the much-lampooned synchronized
swimming at U.S. dlrs 234, up more than 300 percent from the U.S.
dlr 48 premium price in Atlanta.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ In Sudan, rumors of a coup or the
imminent downfall of the Islamic government come almost as often as
the Muslim call to prayer that echoes through Khartoum's dusty
streets five times a day.
	   But nine years after a coup brought to power the Arab world's
only revolutionary Islamic government, Sudan's leaders appear to be
as entrenched as ever. They say their revolution will outlast
mounting American pressure, widespread discontent within the
country and an opposition that offers few alternatives.
	   It's an impressive record in a country, one of Africa's poorest,
that has suffered six coups since independence in 1956.
	   ``Wishful people in politics, even governments in Western Europe
and the United States, they say, `Oh, it won't take more than a few
months and this government will collapse,''' said Hassan Turabi,
the parliament speaker and ideologue of the government.
	   ``They don't understand history,'' he said.
	   Sudan's modern Islamic movement began in the 1960s.
	   It rose within the brown-brick buildings of Khartoum University
along the Blue Nile in the 1960s, eventually playing a
behind-the-scenes role in the coup in 1989.
	   Today, its top leaders serve as parliament speaker and vice
president, run the expansive security services and key ministries,
wield influence in the military and control banks and companies.
	   The opposition, most of it abroad, offers little alternative to
many Sudanese, fractured as it is by trying to meld the agendas of
southern rebels and the banned, traditional parties in the north.
	   ``They know their opponents, they know the political parties and
they know how to manipulate them and defuse their threats,'' said
Abdallahi an-Naim, a Sudanese law professor at Emory University in
Atlanta, Georgia.
	   At first glance, the government's staying power is surprising.
	   Charges that Sudan supports Islamic militants have alienated its
neighbors and angered the United States, which attacked the
country's largest pharmaceutical plant Thursday. Washington said
the strike stopped the production of precursors of chemical
weapons.
	   Already, the United States had added Sudan to its list of states
supporting terrorism, withdrawn its diplomats from Khartoum and
imposed sanctions that ban U.S. investments in the country.
	   At home, discontent runs as long as the Nile River that courses
1,860 miles (2,995 kilometers) through Sudan.
	   Riots over electricity _ once available half the day but now for
as little as two hours _ erupted the night before the U.S. attack,
capping weeks of protests in Khartoum and other cities.
	   Students at Khartoum University, which has long given birth to
bouts of political upheaval, poured into the streets this month in
anger over housing costs that more than doubled to about dlrs 25
for the academic year, the monthly salary of a civil servant.

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Half of Germans said in a poll released
Wednesday that there are too many foreigners in Germany, and 10
percent said they could see themselves voting for a far-right
party.
	   The Forsa poll, conducted for Die Woche newspaper, found
far-right sympathy strongest among Germans under 30 at 13 percent.
The difference between east and west was slight _ 10 percent in
western Germany and 11 percent in the east.
	   The poll found 52 percent of Germans felt there were too many
foreigners in Germany; among those supporting the far-right the
figure was 84 percent.
	   The weekly poll of 1,006 eligible voters gave no margin of
error.
	   Campaigning mainly on anti-foreigner slogans, far-right parties
have been gaining support, especially in economically struggling
eastern Germany.
	   The German People's Union won almost 13 percent of the vote in
state elections in Saxony-Anhalt in April. Its strongest support
came from men 18 to 25, one in three of whom voted far-right.
	   Parliament's outgoing commissioner for foreigners, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, said immigration policy should not be avoided
before Sept. 27 national elections, but politicians should be
sensitive as to how they address the issue.
	   ``To take up existing fears and prejudices in an enlightening
way is one thing,'' she said in presenting her final report
Wednesday. ``But to promote them as a campaign tactic is something
completely different.''

Hong Kong talk show host says he was attacked for outspokenness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A leading talk show host attacked last week
with meat cleavers said Wednesday his assailants wanted to kill him
because of his outspokenness and he might have to quit.
	   In an exclusive interview with state-owned Radio Hong Kong,
Albert Cheng said his attackers might have intended to murder him
as a warning to other outspoken journalists.
	   Two people attacked Cheng last week outside of Commercial Radio
just before his popular daily morning talk show, inflicting six
serious chop wounds which may leave him crippled. Cheng underwent
six hours of surgery, and is now recovering in stable condition.
	   ``If it was (only) a warning, they didn't have to chop me so
many times,'' he said, speaking from his private hospital room,
guarded by uniformed and plainclothes police.
	   If a journalist ``receives a phone call, `Hey, look at what
Albert Cheng received, and you don't want to be Albert Cheng, and
you may not be as lucky as him.' What will he think in the first
instance?'' said Cheng.
	   The police organized crime unit is investigating the case, but
no motive has been identified. Police and a radio station jointly
posted a reward of 4 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 512,820)
for information leading to the arrest of men.
	   Police officials have said they listened to recent tapes of
Cheng's morning show, Teacup in a Storm.
	   Known for his outrageous attacks on everyone from government
officials and business tycoons to crime bosses and entertainers,
Cheng said he had ``some idea'' who may be behind the attacks, but
said, ``I offend 3,000 people a year, so I say why guess.''
	   Cheng said he would have to discuss with his family whether he
would continue to work as a commentator.
	   Many people have asked ``when you (would) stop talking. (I said)
when my life is being threatened, or my own personal safety being
threatened. Now this has really happened,'' Cheng said.
	   Co-host Lam Yuk-wah continues hosting the morning show, and
apparently has not scaled back on his fiery attacks.

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of armed militants advanced
Wednesday on the capital of the restive Russian Caucasus region of
Dagestan to demand that the local government cede power to another
ethnic group.
	   All 500 police in Makhachkala, a city on the Caspian Sea, were
put on alert and ordered to shoot to kill if the rebels attacked
the capital. The government called on its own supporters for
back-up, and handed out Kalashnikov assault rifles to volunteer
defenders on the streets.
	   It was the latest escalation of a long-running conflict between
Dagestan's two largest ethnic groups: the Dargins, who occupy most
government posts, and more numerous Avars who grumble they have too
little power.
	   The Avars comprise about 28 percent of the region's 2.1 million
population, while the Dargins account for about 23 percent.
	   Dagestan is home to more than 50 ethnic and religious groups.
Representatives of any single ethnic group are legally barred from
occupying the top post in the region for more than one term.
However, Dagestan's local legislature amended the law shortly
before a June election and re-elected Magomedali Magomedov, a
Dargin, as the republic's leader.
	   Sagit-Pasha Umakhanov, the mayor of Dagestan's second-largest
city, demanded Tuesday that the government of Magomedov resign and
said he would overthrow it by force if it refused.
	   On Wednesday, Umakhanov led several hundred armed supporters
from the city, Khasavyurt, to the republic's capital. Dagestan's
premier Khidri Shikhsaidov met them in the village of Kizylyurt, on
a highway some 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Makhachkala.
	   The protesters agreed to halt in exchange for the government's
promise of a compromise, but remained in Kizylyurt ready to resume
their march.
	   All entrances to Makhachkala were sealed by road blocks and
police patrols blocked all the central streets.
	   Dagestan, which borders on the breakaway region of Chechnya, has
suffered frequent bombings, kidnappings, ethnic and religious
strife and other violence. The region's Islamic spiritual leader
was killed in a car-bombing earlier this month.

South African share prices plummet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African equity share
prices fell a massive 8.7 percent in pre-noon trading on Wednesday
but started rallying later in the day.
	   Most brokers pointed to the fall-out from Russia's decision to
reschedule its debt as the principal cause of the huge losses, Dow
Jones Newswires reported.
	   The drop slid back to a 7.8 percent fall by 2 p.m. local time
(1200 GMT), still one of the worst falls on record at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
	   Brokers were watching the U.S. Standard &AMP; Poors futures index in
New York and anticipating heavy falls in U.S. shares.
	   Offshore investors were beating a path out of the South African
market, fearing the financial turmoil in Russia and problems in
Japan would send emerging markets into a dive, Dow Jones said.
	   The stock price tumble was magnified by soaring local bond
yields, with the benchmark seven-year government bond soaring from
17.94 percent to 18.7 percent late Tuesday.

Credit Suisse investment banking unit's net profit falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Credit Suisse bank
group said Wednesday its investment banking unit's unaudited net
profit fell to dlrs 500 million as of Aug. 25, from dlrs 754
million June 30, in connection with Russia's debt restructuring.
	   The bank blamed ``market difficulties globally, but notably in
Russia,'' where Credit Suisse First Boston has ``significant
activities.''
	   The latest estimate for CSFB's profit reflects a market
adjustment of the investment bank's position, based on Russia's new
debt rescheduling program, the group said.
	   Credit Suisse will provide more information on its Russian
activities next month, when it releases its first-half results.
	   ``While the outlook for the remainder of 1998 remains dependent
on market conditions, the half-year results Sept. 9, will
demonstrate the continued progress Credit Suisse Group is making
towards achieving its medium-term profitability targets,'' Credit
Suisse said.
	   Late Tuesday, Russia announced terms for restructuring dlrs 40
billion in outstanding treasury debt.

Battle rages near Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The sound of explosions rumbled through
Kinshasa on Wednesday morning, as government forces battled rebel
fighters on the capital city's eastern outskirts.
	   State-controlled radio and doctors from Kinshasa's General
Hospital said hundreds of fighters had been wounded or killed.
	   The sustained artillery and small arms battle came one day after
President Laurent Kabila returned to a capital reinforced by allied
forces from Angola and Zimbabwe. Rebels seeking to topple Kabila
had suffered a series of military setbacks in the days before this
apparent assault on Kinshasa.
	   Fighting raged through the night and continued into the morning
in the area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   A mix of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions shuddered
through Kinshasa.
	   Green army helicopters, with gunmen leaning out of the doors,
buzzed back and forth just above the city's rooftops.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled to central Kinshasa on Wednesday
morning from the area where the battle was raging.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
Kinshasa suburbs during the night.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi tried to calm a nervous
city, saying the situation was under control.
	   He described the fighting as an operation by government forces
to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like monkeys'' in the forests
around Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   ``Since this morning our Congolese forces have pursuing the
bandits,'' Mumengi said in an unusual live broadcast on Voice of
the People radio. ``Today more than any other day we need to
redouble our efforts against this aggression.''
	   Mumengi called on the population to turn over suspected rebel
collaborators.
	   ``This will be a long and popular war. Vigilance. Vigilance,''
he said.
	   State-run radio blamed the fighting on Rwanda, which the
government has accused of being behind the rebellion.
	   ``This is more barbarity by that country Rwanda, that little
country you can't even find on the map,'' a Voice of the People
radio report said.
	   Stores throughout Kinshasa remained closed in the morning and
residents in the city's eastern suburbs were ordered by the
military to stay at home.
	   Roadblocks were erected through key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares.
	   Streets were largely deserted with only a few pedestrians and
fewer vehicles venturing out.
	   The foreign ministry called for a meeting Wednesday with
ambassadors. The United States closed its embassy more than a week
ago and many foreign embassies have sent all but essential staff
home.
	   After stunning successes in the first weeks of Congo's civil
war, an advance by rebel forces toward Kinshasa had apparently been
halted by Zimbabwean troops defending the city's southern
outskirts.
	   The scale of Wednesday's assault was not immediately clear, but
fighting which began after midnight continued into the afternoon.
	   Troops with bullet and shrapnel wounds were pouring into
Kinshasa's General Hospital, said one doctor who asked not to be
identified.
	   Kabila, speaking Tuesday on state-run radio, called for support
from the Congolese.
	   ``With hands or spears or by any means the people must crush the
enemy in our territory,'' he said.
	   Allied warplanes and troops from Angola and Zimbabwe have been
deploying in Kinshasa and western Congo since late last week.
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene if the Zimbabweans and Angolans do
not withdraw.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, though it denies backing the rebels.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.
	   The Vatican's missionary news service reported Tuesday that a
priest, three nuns, a seminary student and 32 refugees were killed
in an attack on a remote Catholic mission in eastern Congo.
	   All the dead were Congolese.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected local residents of
giving food to a pro-government militia, the news service said.

Kohl's party in eastern Germany seeks to oust former treasurer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) _ State party leaders from Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats moved Wednesday to expel their
former treasurer from the party because of suspicion he tried to
hire a hit man to kill a creditor.
	   Party leaders in eastern Saxony-Anhalt asked a panel to approve
the expulsion of Manfred Wulfert, who already stepped down as state
treasurer. The panel's decision is expected next month.
	   Prosecutors ended their investigation of Wulfert this week,
saying they couldn't find enough evidence of a crime. But they said
they still suspect him of trying to hire a Russian mobster in an
unsuccessful plot to kill a Bremen man because of private business
debts.
	   Even though the case was dropped, party officials voted late
Tuesday to seek Wulfert's expulsion. State party leader Karl-Heinz
Daehre said Wulfert had damaged the party and infringed on its
requirement to set a good example.
	   Daehre said no further personnel changes were planned. Some
party members had called for Daehre's resignation after the party's
poor showing in state elections in April.

Malaysian lawmaker's prison term triggers outcry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sentencing of a opposition
lawmaker to three years in prison for criticizing the judiciary
will erode Malaysian democracy and freedom of speech, critics said
Wednesday.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, on Tuesday became
the first sitting Malaysian lawmaker to be sentenced to prison.
	   Cyrus Das, president of the Malaysian Bar Council, said the
Federal Court's decision to uphold the sentence against Lim on
charges of sedition would hinder elected officials from carrying
out their duties.
	   ``The judgment of the Federal Court ... will have a restrictive
and dampening effect generally on freedom of speech,'' he said.
	   Chandra Muzaffar, president of the Malaysian-based International
Movement for a Just World, said the ruling ``shames Malaysian
democracy.''
	   ``What is the meaning of the rule of law when it is not informed
by a sense of justice and fairness?,''he said,
	   Syed Husin Ali, president of the opposition Malaysian People's
Party, said the harsh jail term imposed on Lim is calculated to
``create fear among the people from criticizing any government
party leader.''
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and printing false
news in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The True
Story.'' In the pamphlet, he criticized the government's decision
not to press statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik,
a former chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim.
	   Lim's original sentence, which called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs
3,570) fine, was later dismissed and replaced with a jail term by
the Court of Appeal in April.
	   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Federal Court, Malaysia's
highest court, upheld a sentence of two, concurrent 18-month prison
terms.
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in
Parliament, said on Wednesday that Lim would remain an MP for 14
more days, during which he could file a petition seeking a pardon
from King Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   If forced to serve his full prison term, Lim will lose his seat
in Parliament. Under Malaysian law, an MP must relinquish his seat
if he serves more than 12 months in prison.

Judge refuses to free German suspected of beating French policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOUAI, France (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday refused to free
a German soccer fan suspected of beating a French policeman during
the World Cup.
	   The court ruling means that Karl-Heinz Elscher will remain in
custody while an investigation into the attack on Daniel Nivel, who
fell into a coma for six weeks after the beating, continues.
	   Elscher was arrested following the attack on Nivel, who was hit
on the head with an iron bar shortly after a June 21 World Cup
match between Germany and Yugoslavia in the northern town of Lens.
	   French authorities placed Elscher in custody on June 23 but
released him about a month later. He was again incarcerated on Aug.
5.
	   French judicial authorities are investigating whether to press
charges against Elscher for ``attempted homicide'' of a member of
the French police force.
	   Doctors say that Nivel's condition has improved since he emerged
from from a coma earlier this month but that he still has
difficulties understanding.
	   As well as Elschner, four other suspects are in custody in
Germany, facing charges of attempted murder, causing serious bodily
harm, and disturbing the peace.

Chernomyrdin tries to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble falling against German mark, Communists
continuing to call for Yeltsin's resignation. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors on Wednesday after bonds plunged in value under
a drastic plan to restructure Russia's enormous debts, but markets
continued to fall.
	   The ruble dove again as Central Bank support for the Russian
currency faltered. Trading at the interbank exchange was suspended
for a second day in a row after the ruble weakened by 5 percent,
trading at 8.26 rubles to the dollar or 12.1 cents, in contrast to
7.86 rubles or 12.7 cents on Tuesday.
	   In another sign of panic, the Central Bank canceled sales of
dollars Wednesday to banks and other institutions, saying its
intervention would have led to new losses in hard-currency
reserves. It was the first time the Central Bank had canceled
already agreed sales during the current crisis, indicating the
government was giving up efforts to stem the fall of the ruble.
	   The ruble plummeted likewise against the German mark, reaching
7.6 to the mark over Tuesday's 4.49. Traders said banks had
apparently fled to the mark because dollars were unavailable.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on restructuring the
country's dlrs 40 billion, short-term debt market, a day after
terms of the plan were revealed. The terms announced late Tuesday
confirmed bond-holders' fears that they would sustain heavy losses.
	   Investors whose bonds have matured will have the option of
trading them either for long-term, dollar-denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   ``There's nothing good there, everybody thinks the government
won and everybody else lost,'' said Oleg Galkin, a trader at ING
Barings in Moscow.
	   Even as he pledged to try to limit the damage to investors,
Chernomyrdin was careful to dissociate himself from the
restructuring decision.
	   ``I would like people to understand us correctly: This decision
was predetermined. In actual fact, our task was only to formulate
it, and we could not do otherwise,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Our top priority now, my personal task, is to soften its
negative influence on stock markets and investors.''
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the restructuring _ in some
cases receiving just 17 cents for every dollar they invested,
according to some analysts _ will discourage many from returning
any time soon.
	   Russia will feel the loss of foreign investment keenly. Some
analysts predict the country will be shut out of international
commercial borrowing for several years.
	   Stocks plummeted 6.4 percent in early trading Wednesday, with
the Russian Trading System index falling to 82.87 points from 88.38
points Tuesday.
	   Muscovites lined up outside some banks to try to withdraw their
deposits. About 80 people were outside a branch of the SBS-Agro
bank on central Pushkin Square on Wednesday morning, umbrellas
staving off a steady drizzle as they waited for the doors to open.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman who identified
herself only as Julia. ``I'd like to be able to buy something with
my rubles, which have already become worthless.''
	   Chernomyrdin said he was ``extremely dissatisfied'' with the
Central Bank's activity over the past two days and announced he
would discuss his concern with bank chairman Sergei Dubinin.
	   The ruble plummeted 9.2 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years.
	   ``Financial and banking policy is an issue I'm attending to
every minute,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to ITAR-Tass. ``I'm
going to talk seriously with Sergei Dubinin today about the
inactivity of the main financial institution in the serious
economic situation.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he was ready to
talk with Chernomyrdin about a coalition government. But he warned
that the Communists would demand a say in the prime minister's
program to cope with the economic crisis.
	   ``So far the talk has been all about how `we should work
together,''' Zyuganov said.
	   ``But it's senseless to work as we've done before. Such work has
brought us to where we are today. I don't believe a single word
from Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin.''
	   Both he and parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleznyov, who is also
a Communist, reiterated their longtime demand for Yeltsin to
resign. Seleznyov also offered his own cure for Russia's crisis:
the government should print money and renationalize the nation's
small and medium-size commercial banks.
	   Seleznyov said it was high time for Russia to ``part with
monetarism,'' ITAR-Tass said.

Attorney general files criminal suit against Clinton

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's attorney general said Wednesday
that the government has filed a lawsuit in criminal court against
the United States for its missile strike last week against a
Khartoum factory.
	   The attorney general, Ali al-Zaki, told The Associated Press
that U.S. President Bill Clinton is named in the suit.
	   ``We have filed a law suit against the United States of America,
which is represented by President Bill Clinton,'' al-Zaki said.
	   He added that ``the normal procedure is that if a person or an
entity fails to show up in court, he will be tried in absentia.''
	   Al-Zaki did not give details of the lawsuit. Earlier this week,
Sudan's president, Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, accused Clinton of
being a ``war criminal'' for ordering the missile strike.
	   ``The American president has violated international law, and he
meant to destroy a civilian establishment and to kill innocent
people. ... He is a war criminal of the first degree,'' el-Bashir
said on Monday.
	   U.S. missiles last Thursday destroyed the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in North Khartoum. A second missile
strike targeted camps in Afghanistan used by Muslim extremist Osama
bin Laden, who the United States has linked to the Aug. 7 bombings
of U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   Sudan insists the factory was making medicines, but the United
States charges it was making a precursor for the deadly VX nerve
gas, possibly with assistance from Iraq.
	   The government said 10 people were injured in the missile
attack. Plant officials said the factory sustained dlrs 100 million
in damages.
	   Al-Zaki said the district attorney in the area where the factory
is located had begun ``a criminal investigation to decide the scope
of the damages incurred by the Sudanese people.''
	   In the latest government-orchestrated demonstration, several
thousand members of the Sudanese medical and health services union
marched Wednesday to U.N. headquarters in Khartoum, chanting that
Clinton was ``a liar and a coward.''
	   A petition addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
that ``you (Annan) and the whole world bear the responsibility for
the negative impact of such acts of aggression.''
	   Dr. Mustafa Idris, a member of the union's board, told reporters
that destruction of the factory was ``a big loss for us, the
Sudanese people.''
	   He said Sudan lacked the foreign exchange to import the
antibiotics and tuberculosis medicine that El-Shifa had produced.

Couples pack Spanish town square to break smooching record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCALA DE HENARES, Spain (AP) _ On the firing of a gun, an
estimated 1,600 couples packed the central square of this Spanish
town and locked lips in a concerted effort to kiss their way into
the Guinness Book of Records.
	   With participants including the town's mayor and his wife, the
couples smooched for at least 10 seconds Tuesday in a bid to outdo
the U.S. University of Maine's record for gathering together 1,420
kissing couples on Feb. 14 _St Valentine's Day _ 1996.
	   An Alcala de Henares city hall spokesman said the exact number
of couples would be known Wednesday and the documents forwarded for
confirmation to the Guinness Book of Records.
	   The record would be an added claim to fame for Alcala de
Henares, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Madrid, which
already boasts being the birthplace of 17th century author Miguel
Cervantes, Spain's most famous novelist.

Muralitharan takes on England at the Oval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After a summer-long pace-blitz against South
Africa, England's cricketers face one last trial before the Ashes
campaign _ against the spin of Muttiah Muralitharan in a one-off
test against Sri Lanka Thursday.
	   The Oval pitch is expected to provide conditions the champion
off-spinner will revel in.
	   England skipper Alec Stewart wanted a bouncy pitch to beat Sri
Lanka but after the first look, England recalled off-spinner Robert
Croft and dropped left-arm fast bowler Alan Mullally.
	   Apart from a tinge of green, there was nothing to suggest pace
would hold sway during the five-day match. Sri Lanka is also
reportedly planning to play a second spinner alongside
Muralitharan.
	   Off-cutter Kumara Dharmasena is in Sri Lanka's frame to bowl in
tandem with Muralitharan, Sri Lanka's most successful spinner ever.
	   Muralitharan, who was once no-balled by an umpire seven times
for ``throwing'' during a test against Australia at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, is now only 13 wickets short of a 200 total.
	   He has already mesmerized the England batsmen during the
triangular limited-overs series final, taking 5-32 to bowl his
country to victory over the hosts.
	   His major international rival, Surrey's Pakistan off-spinner
Saqlain Mushtaq, has taken 40 of his 63 wickets in four games at
the Oval this year.
	   The conditios are renewing Sri Lanka's optimism for a win in
only its fourth test on English soil in its 16-year test history.
	   ``I wouldn't call it a spinner's wicket but I am convinced it
will help the spinners at some stage,'' Sri Lankan skipper Arjuna
Ranatunga said Wednesday.
	   ``(Muralitharan) could be a threat on any surface. He is the
best off-spinner in the world,'' he said.
	   Muralitharan is the leading spinner this year with 52 wickets
(avge 19.96) in seven tests. The leading wicket-taker is South
African paceman Allan Donald, who has 66 wickets, including 33
against England in five tests this summer.
	   Ranatunga, who made his test debut against England in Sri
Lanka's inaugural test in February 1982, said he would rather go
into the test as ``underdogs'' than ``lick the lips'' after the
deceiving appearance of the pitch.
	   England vice-captain Nasser Hussain has been ruled out of the
test with a groin injury, while Steve James, who made his test
debut at Lord's, has been called up as a cover up for Mike
Atherton.
	   Atherton, England's leading run-getter in England's 2-1 success
against South Africa, is suffering from a back spasm. He has played
in England's last 63 tests.
	   Graeme Hick, will bat at No.3 in place of Hussain while John
Crawley will bat in the middle order at No.6.
	   Teams:
	   England (from): Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Graeme Hick, Alec
Stewart (captain), Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley, Ben Hollioake,
Robert Croft, Ian Salisbury, Darren Gough, Dominic Cork, Angus
Fraser, Steve James.
	   Sri Lanka (from): Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu, Mahela
Jayawardene, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Hashan
Tillakaratne, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Kumara Dharmasena or Chandika
Hathurusingha, Suresh Perera, Pramodaya Wickramasinghe and Muttiah
Muralitharan.

Guinea-Bissau government, rebels renew cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government and rebels
renewed a month-old cease-fire Wednesday and agreed to let aid
flights into the capital, both signs of progress in talks to bring
peace to the West African country.
	   The measures were the first serious signs of a thaw in sporadic
negotiations since last month's truce, Ivory Coast Foreign Minister
Amara Essy told the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Essy led the delegation for the Economic Community of West
African States, ECOWAS, which is brokering the talks with the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.
	   The two days of negotiations, which ended Wednesday, were held
in the West African archipelago Cape Verde. The next round is
scheduled for Sept. 12 in the Ivory Coast, Lusa reported.
	   Fighting in the former Portuguese colony erupted June 7 when a
breakaway military faction led by former armed forces chief Brig.
Ansumane Mane seized a Bissau military base and the international
airport.
	   The rebels accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and demanded that he step down, but their revolt was halted by
troops from neighboring Senegal who aided Vieira.
	   The rebellion triggered a wave of hundreds of thousands of
refugees in this coastal nation of one million people. It is not
known how many people were killed in the fighting.

Doctors: woman forced to give birth in car because of closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers at a roadblock held up
a Palestinian woman in labor who then gave birth in a car and
arrived at a hospital with her newborn gasping for air, doctors
said Wednesday.
	   The child died minutes after arrival at Alia Hospital in Hebron
on Tuesday evening, said deputy director Abdel Rahim Namoura.
	   Namoura said the cause of death could not be determined until an
autopsy was performed. However, Namoura said the child's chances
for survival would have been much higher had the mother,
24-year-old Fadwa Adam, made it to the hospital on time.
	   The Israeli army said it was looking into the allegations.
	   The case was the second in four days in which Israeli troops
were accused of indirectly causing the death of a Palestinian
child.
	   Israeli troops have been enforcing a closure on the West Bank
town of Hebron since last Thursday when a Jewish settler was killed
in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   Under the closure, no one can enter or leave the city of 130,000
Palestinians.
	   Bassem Khatib, the deputy police chief in Hebron, said Mrs. Adam
from the village of Betula west of Hebron was trying to reach Alia
Hospital on Tuesday evening after she went into labor.
	   Adam and her husband drove toward Hebron, but were stopped at an
Israeli army checkpoint west of the city, Khatib said. Soldiers
turned back the couple. In order to reach the hospital, the Adams
had to take a longer unpaved backroad, Khatib said.
	   Mrs. Adam gave birth in the car and her baby was gasping for air
when she finally reached Alia Hospital at 8:30 p.m., Khatib said.
	   In a related development, the army said it was looking into the
death of a 3-month-old Palestinian boy in Hebron on Saturday. The
child's parents said the boy died because Israeli troops enforcing
a curfew in the center of town refused to let them seek medical
treatment for their son.
	   The army said it questioned soldiers in the city and did not
find evidence of a child dying at one of the checkpoints. The
Hebron area commander visited the family and offered humanitarian
aid.
	   The army said soldiers have instructions to allow those
requiring medical care to pass checkpoints without delay.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Wednesday laid to rest one a soldier shot
to death in Afghanistan after U.S. missile strikes there in
retaliation for a pair of embassy bombings.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro presided over the funeral of Lt.
Col. Carmine Calo, promising to award him the ``highest military
honors.''
	   Calo, 42, was serving in a U.N. force in Afghanistan when he was
shot to death last Saturday in Kabul. A French civilian with the
United Nations was wounded in the attack.
	   They were shot the day after a U.S. cruise missile attacks on a
suspected terrorist base in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant
in Sudan.
	   The Afghan strike was aimed at a base run by Osama bin Laden,
the Muslim fanatic U.S. officials say is behind the Aug. 7 bombings
of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The government is reducing the cost of
international telephone calls by up to 55 percent in a bid to
compete with private ``call-back'' services.
	   A director-general at the Post, Telecommunications and Telephone
Ministry, Abdel-Monem Youssef, said the reductions of 35 percent
during daylight hours and an additional price cut of 10 to 20
percent at night will take effect Oct. 1.
	   In remarks published in Beirut newspapers Wednesday, Youssef
said the decision will drive the call-back services out of
business.
	   The call-back services connect customers with the U.S. telephone
system to place calls at a lower rate than the PTT Ministry.
	   But even with the planned reductions, the call-back operators
remain tough competition. The government will be charging 2,100
Lebanese pounds (dlrs 1.4) a minute for a call to North America in
October. The call-backs charge 85 U.S. cents a minute for calls to
the United States and one dollar a minute for calls to Canada.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany has given Jordan grants and loans
totaling 68.5 million Deutsch Marks (dlrs 40.3 million), the German
Embassy announced Wednesday.
	   The finance was made over in four agreements signed by the
Jordanian Minister of Planning, Nabil Ammari, and the German
Ambassador to Jordan, Peter Mende.
	   Nearly 60 million Deutsch Marks (dlrs 35 million) is earmarked
for various water projects in Jordan, an embassy spokesman told The
Associated Press.
	   The remaining 9 million Deutsch Marks (dlrs 5.3 million) is to
be spent on the computerization of data at various ministries.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The profits of one of Jordan's main
pharmaceutical firms surged by 37.5 percent to 4.4 million dinars
(dlrs 6.2 million) in the first half of 1998 in comparison to the
same period last year.
	   The managing director of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Company said the sharp rise in profits was due to the company's
greater penetration of markets in Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, United
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and North Africa.
	   Al-Said Ashoury said this year was the first in which his
company had managed to sell its products in Kuwait since the 1990
Gulf War. After the war, the Kuwaiti government blocked trade with
Jordan owing to its perceived support for Iraq's invasion of the
emirate. But trade revived following a visit early this year to
Kuwait by then Jordanian Planning Minister Rima Khalaf.
	   The company's total sales from January to June 1998 amounted to
18 million dinars (dlrs 25.3 million), compared with 12 million
dinars (dlrs 16.9 million) in the first half of 1997.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordan Tourism Transport Company turned
a net profit of 171,000 dinars (dlrs 240,000) during the first half
year of 1998, the managing director of the government-run company,
Adnan Mufti, said Wednesday.
	   The company made a loss of 358,000 dinars (dlrs 504,000) in the
first six months of 1997.
	   Mufti said the turnaround was due to increased traffic of
Jordanians and Palestinians taking the company's Jet buses between
Jordan and Israel.
	   ``Basically the profit was earned from operations of the
company's land fleet (Jet buses) transporting citizens between
Amman and Jerusalem,'' he said.
	   He said that the Jet buses assigned to foreign tourists made
losses amounting to 272,000 dinars (dlrs 383,000) during the past
six months.
	   ``The number of foreign tourists declined by 23 percent this
year, due to political uncertainty in the region _ mainly the
blocked peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and the
crisis between Iraq and the United States,'' Mufti said.

Ahern, Blair say stronger laws necessary to smash IRA dissidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with premiers' comments; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CONG, Ireland (AP) _ The prime minsters of Ireland and Britain
pledged Wednesday to defeat the Irish Republican Army dissidents
trying to wreck Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   Standing shoulder to shoulder outside a western Ireland castle
hotel, Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair defended their governments'
joint plans to restrict suspects' right to silence and give police
testimony greater authority in anti-terrorist courts.
	   The two men said those and other proposed laws will be enacted
next week in emergency parliamentary sessions in Dublin and London.
	   Their meeting at Ashford Castle came 11 days after a car bomb
killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 in Omagh in the
deadliest atrocity in 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
	   Ahern said he understood that senior IRA dissidents _ who
announced last week they had ``suspended'' their violence, a step
short of a formal cease-fire _ had met secretly in rural County
Clare.
	   ``Needless to say, I hope that we will shortly hear from them
that there will be a complete cessation of all their evil acts,''
Ahern said, adding: ``They have been involved in the most
horrendous deeds, and I think nothing short of a clear statement
will be any use to the Irish government.''
	   Blair said a security crackdown should not jeopardize the slow
process of reconciliation being attempted between Protestant and
Catholic politicians in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``I think the people know that, yes, we have to make the
political progress necessary to secure the future,'' he said. ``But
we also do have to protect people from this small group of
extremists that, as Omagh has indicated, will not stop at anything
in order to wreck the prospects of peace for everyone else.
	   ``So I think provided we do it in a measured, careful, targeted
way, these measures _ tough though they are _ are justified.''
	   Blair visited the bomb-shattered center of Omagh for the first
time Tuesday and immediately announced plans to tighten the United
Kingdom's anti-terrorist laws. The ideas closely mirrored plans
already announced Aug. 19 by Ahern, who visited the town Saturday.
	   Blair met delegations from several Northern Ireland parties _
among them the IRA-allied Sinn Fein, which alone among the parties
opposes the British and Irish plans _ on Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning.
	   Then he traveled to Ashford Castle, the former home of the
Guinness brewing barons, 160 miles (250 kms) to the southwest amid
the hills, bogland and lakes of Connemara.
	   Fifty-three people wounded in the Omagh bomb remained in
Northern Ireland hospitals Wednesday, three in critical condition.

Malaysian lawmaker's prison term triggers outcry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in lead that prison sentence is 18 months, sted three
years. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sentencing of a opposition
lawmaker to 18 months in prison for criticizing the judiciary will
erode Malaysian democracy and freedom of speech, critics said
Wednesday.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, on Tuesday became
the first sitting Malaysian lawmaker to be sentenced to prison.
	   Cyrus Das, president of the Malaysian Bar Council, said the
Federal Court's decision to uphold the sentence against Lim on
charges of sedition would hinder elected officials from carrying
out their duties.
	   ``The judgment of the Federal Court ... will have a restrictive
and dampening effect generally on freedom of speech,'' he said.
	   Chandra Muzaffar, president of the Malaysian-based International
Movement for a Just World, said the ruling ``shames Malaysian
democracy.''
	   ``What is the meaning of the rule of law when it is not informed
by a sense of justice and fairness?,''he said.
	   Syed Husin Ali, president of the opposition Malaysian People's
Party, said the harsh prison term imposed on Lim is calculated to
``create fear among the people from criticizing any government
party leader.''
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and printing false
news in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The True
Story.'' In the pamphlet, he criticized the government's decision
not to press statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik,
a former chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim.
	   Lim's original sentence, which called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs
3,570) fine, was later dismissed and replaced with a prison term by
the Court of Appeal in April.
	   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Federal Court, Malaysia's
highest court, upheld a sentence of two, concurrent 18-month prison
terms.
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in
Parliament, said on Wednesday that Lim would remain an MP for 14
more days, during which he could file a petition seeking a pardon
from King Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   If forced to serve his full prison term, Lim will lose his seat
in Parliament. Under Malaysian law, an MP must relinquish his seat
if he serves more than 12 months in prison.

Myanmar's main pagoda closed amid rumors of protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government report of calm in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The most sacred pagoda in Myanmar was
closed Wednesday amid rumors that opposition groups were planning a
lightning protest at the site.
	   Shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, a dazzling,
bell-shaped, gold-encrusted Buddhist shrine, were told by the
pagoda's board of trustees at 9 a.m. to shut down for cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said, however, that they heard a group of
pro-democracy protesters was coming to the pagoda. The shrine was
still closed late Wednesday afternoon.
	   No protests were observed by evening. A government spokesman,
replying by fax to a query from The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, said the capital and other parts of the country ``remain
calm and peaceful.''
	   The first street protest against military rule in nearly two
years erupted Monday in Yangon as about 200 students spilled into
the streets near Yangon University.
	   They were supporting a demand by the opposition National League
for Democracy that the military regime convene the parliament
elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military refused to honor the result. The NLD said recently it
would convene parliament on its own, prompting the military to warn
that its leaders would be arrested and the party declared illegal.
	   The NLD, led by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi,
has not retracted its statement saying it will convene parliament.
	   Suu Kyi spent Wednesday recovering from kidney problems,
dizziness, low blood pressure and urinary tract problems she
suffered while staging a protest against the military's
restrictions on her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues spent 13 days living in a van on a
bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital. They were
stopped there by the authorities for the fourth time in two months
while attempting to reach the city of Bassein to meet NLD members.
	   She ended her protest Monday after her party pleaded with her to
conserve her health. The military government said she visited the
site of the student protest, which had already been broken up by
police, on her way back home.
	   No one was arrested during the protest. Rumors have been
circulating in Yangon and Bangkok that more demonstrations will
take place in Myanmar's capital.
	   The shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda sell items for worship
in their stalls which line the long stairways to the pagoda's upper
platform.
	   The said the pagoda's trustees told them the shrine was being
closed for a major cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said that the pagoda had never been closed for a
cleaning, which is done each day by volunteers while it remains
open.
	   It has even remained open during major renovation work and
visits by leaders of the military government, who are extremely
security conscious.

Religious meeting to open amid ecumenical tensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ As religious leaders from 50 countries
prepare to preach peace and understanding, a Romanian Catholic
bishop Wednesday insisted that justice must come before ecumenical
harmony.
	   Eastern Rite Catholic Bishop Gheorghe Gutiu was referring to
thousands of churches and other property seized by the Communists
in 1948. They have been a contentious issue between his church and
the Orthodox Church, which now holds the property, since 1989 when
communism ended.
	   Jewish, Islamic, Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox and other
religious leaders will attend a two-day meeting to open Sunday.
	   ``We want peace among all religions, but first there has to be
justice,'' said bishop Gutiu, from the Transylvanian city of Cluj,
some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   Almost 90 percent of Romanians adhere to the Orthodox faith
whose center is in Istanbul. The second largest church in Romania
is the Eastern Rite Catholics, which claims 300,000 followers.
	   Meanwhile, the Romanian Orthodox Church was preparing to outline
its conditions for a visit by Pope John Paul II next May, which
would be the first by the pontiff to an Orthodox country.
	   The Orthodox want Catholics to drop the issue of property
restitution through the courts and to stop calling the Orthodox
``Communist collaborators.''
	   Eastern Rite Catholics, whose supreme authority is the pope,
live in the northwestern region of Transylvania. Their faith was
outlawed under communism, and in 1948, some 2,400 churches were
seized and given to the Orthodox Church.
	   Since then, tensions have grown. Greek Catholics see property
restoration as a matter of justice, while the Orthodox Church
believes that each community should decide which faith the church
belongs to.
	   A few churches and cathedrals have been returned to the
Catholics. ``The Orthodox are wary,'' said Dan Ciachir, a religious
affairs journalist.
	   The inter-denominational meeting called ``God, Humankind and
Peoples,'' is organized by church groups and President Emil
Constantinescu.

Bishop's statement on crosses criticized, defied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's chief rabbi said Wednesday that
any number of crosses _ one or 1,000 _ near the Auschwitz death
camp harmed the memory of Jewish victims.
	   Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz was reacting to Tuesday's
statement by Polish bishops who called for a tall papal cross by
the camp to remain in place, but for other smaller crosses recently
put there to be removed.
	   Defying the bishops' call for people to stop planting crosses at
the site, Catholic activists put up two more crosses Wednesday.
	   More than 100 crosses have gone up in a field bordering
Auschwitz in recent weeks to protest Jewish demands to remove the
larger cross, which has stood on the site for almost a decade.
	   The larger cross was used during a 1979 Mass celebrated by Pope
John Paul II at Birkenau, the sister camp of Auschwitz. It
commemorates 152 Poles killed by Nazis on the site in 1941.
	   Joskowicz said the presence of the cross prohibits Jews from
praying at Auschwitz for the 1.5 million victims, mostly Jews,
killed at the camp. He asked the bishops to make prayer possible.
	   ``We Jews suffered there the most so I think it would be bad if
in this sacred place we could not pray for our nation, our
relatives, our friends and for all who suffered there,'' Joskowicz
said.
	   Tuesday's statement by the Council of the Episcopate, the
highest body of Poland's Catholic church, was intended to calm the
growing controversy over the crosses with Jewish groups around the
world.
	   It mixed appeals for tolerance with insistence that the cross
was a fitting symbol to commemorate Polish victims of the Nazis.
The papal cross should stay, the bishops said, but the other
crosses should be moved.
	   The bishops lack any legal power over the land where the crosses
stand, but their statement was considered a powerful signal from
the church and likely to be heeded by all but the wildly
anti-Semitic ultra-conservative Catholics.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp told more than 100,000 worshipers Wednesday
at Jasna Gora, the nation's holiest shrine, that no one should use
the cross to provoke anger.
	   ``It would be wrong if we used it as a tool for irritating,
because irritation provokes anger, provokes revenge,'' Glemp said
in a Mass celebrating the shrine's Black Madonna.
	   But Glemp, the church's leading figure, also expressed regret
that Jews who ``once lived in Poland in prosperity and could
develop better than the others, having experienced the terrible
torture, cannot find today words of understanding and compromise.''
	   Joskowicz, whose parents died at Auschwitz, sounded unwilling to
compromise.
	   ``There is no difference to us whether one cross or a thousand
crosses are standing there,'' he said, suggesting that flags of all
nations who suffered at the camp should be the only symbol
commemorating the victims.

Diplomats: Yemen to limit distribution of its passports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Under pressure from the United States, Yemen
is moving to limit the distribution of its passports to Arabs who
are not Yemeni nationals, Arab diplomats said Wednesday.
	   They said Yemen has detained 20 Arabs who are not Yemenis but
hold the country's passport following reports that a suspect in the
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa was carrying a Yemeni
passport.
	   It was not known if those detained were being questioned about
the Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Those in detention include Algerian, Egyptian and Palestinian
nationals, the diplomats said. They spoke on condition their names
not be used.
	   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry has instructed Yemen embassies
abroad not to renew Yemeni passports of people who are not Yemen
nationals, a ministry official said. He, too, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The government has come under pressure from the United States to
hand over files of Arabs who have been given Yemeni passports. The
Arab diplomats also said the United States had urged Yemen to strip
non-nationals of their Yemeni travel documents.
	   The Yemen government in the past frequently issued passports to
non-nationals, especially Palestinians and some Arabs who had
fought against the Russians in Afghanistan.
	   No estimates are available on the number of such passport
holders.
	   The Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 257
people and wounded more than 5,500.
	   Khalid Salim, one of the three men in police custody in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi, reportedly was traveling on a Yemeni
passport.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped
up some unfinished business on Wednesday, meeting with Kenya's
trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car
bombing of the embassy.
	   Meanwhile, the combined death toll in the double bombing of the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania rose to 259 after two more
victims died in the Tanzanian commercial capital, Dar es Salaam.
	   The Aug. 7 bombing occurred as Bushnell and Kenya's Trade
Minister Joseph Kamotho were talking after a news conference in a
building adjacent to the embassy. The attack killed 247 people and
wounding more than 5,400 others.
	   On Wednesday, Bushnell and Kamotho met to finish their
discussion, Bushnell told Kenya Television Network.
	   The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast, which
damaged the embassy, shattered the glass shell of the 22-story
Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi Cooperative
House.
	   Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent
search and rescue at the blast scene, memorials for those slain,
and the relocation to a temporary embassy.
	   Kamotho, who was hospitalized with a head wound, said he and
Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley in September. His trip is still on, the
embassy said.
	   In Tanzania, where the blast occurred almost simultaneously with
the one in Nairobi, relatives and hospital officials said two more
people died from injuries they suffered in the explosion.
	   A doctor at the private Aga Khan hospital confirmed that
Aimosaria Mzee, 42, who was applying for a visa at the time of the
blast, died Sunday of complications from a head wound. He had
already been released from hospital, the doctor said.
	   Relatives of a 51-year-old woman, whose name was not immediately
known, said she died Sunday after suffering internal injuries. She
was to be buried Thursday, according to relatives outside her Dar
es Salaam home.

Taxi drivers under fire after rash of tourist rip-offs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Athens' biggest taxi union has called on
the government to show no mercy to cab drivers arrested for
cheating foreign visitors.
	   The call came as four taxi drivers were charged Wednesday with
overcharging three people, including a foreigner who was about to
pay double the rate for a ride from Athens airport to the
Acropolis.
	   ``They should chop off their heads,'' said Thimios Lyberopoulos,
the head of Athens' taxi drivers association.
	   Lyberopoulos made the comment after complaining that local
authorities were too lenient with a taxi driver who last week
charged an Australian tourist 25 times the normal fare for a ride
from the airport.
	   Local authorities Tuesday suspended his license for two weeks
and fined him 60,000 drachmas (dlrs 195).
	   Toaxi drivers, especially those who work at the airport.
	   Lyberopoulos said nearly two dozen had been arrested for
overpricing this year, and called on the government to implement
planned legislation that will impose stiff penalties on cheaters.
He said his union did not have the power to discipline its members.
	   Athens's 17,000 or so taxis are among the cheapest in the
European Union and complement the often disorganized mass transit
system.

Leaked memo documents Japan's bid to scuttle whale sanctuary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POHNPEI, Micronesia (AP) _ Japan launched a major diplomatic
offensive to defeat a South Pacific whale sanctuary by arguing that
whales would devastate the region's fish stocks, a leaked
diplomatic cable showed Wednesday.
	   The 29th South Pacific Forum in the Federated States of
Micronesia on Tuesday endorsed proposals for the sanctuary, but
only after rejecting a last-minute bid by Palau to give Japan the
right to veto the sanctuary.
	   Palau's move infuriated Forum delegates who suspected the veto
plan was inspired by Japan, a major aid donor.
	   This was confirmed by the release of a cable that Japan sent to
the South Pacific Forum Secretariat to be passed on to Forum
members.
	   The cable said that the sanctuary would cause ``excessive and
unnecessary protection'' for whales and would ``heavily damage
(the) balance of marine ecosystem and could be destructive for
fisheries activities in the region.''
	   The cable said whales consume larger amounts of marine living
resources than fisheries production, threatening food supplies for
humans.
	   The cable claimed whales consumed 107 million metric tons of
marine resources in the southern hemisphere, compared with only 2.7
million tons taken by humans.
	   Australian officials were scathing about Japan's claim, saying
whales largely eat krill and not the tuna and other major fish
resources harvested commercially in the South Pacific.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer denounced Palau's
proposal, saying it was not appropriate for the Forum in the 1990s
to be giving control of its affairs to outside powers.
	   Other delegates said the proposal was inviting a return to
colonialism, and could for example mean allowing the region's tough
anti-nuclear stance to be vetoed by France, another dialogue
partner.
	   The support of the Forum will greatly strengthen Australia and
New Zealand's plan to have the sanctuary endorsed by the
International Whaling Commission.
	   The South Pacific sanctuary would then be linked with
sanctuaries in the Southern and Indian Oceans and another planned
for the South Atlantic, turning the entire southern hemisphere into
a sanctuary for whales.

Nairobi boy injured in bombings has eye surgery in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Kenyan boy, Stanley Matuma, 14, whose eyes were
severely injured by flying glass in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi has undergone surgery in London, but it is too
early to say if he will see again, Moorfields Eye Hospital said
Wednesday.
	   In a statement, the hospital said surgeon Zdenek Gregor
performed a four-hour operation Tuesday night on Stanley's left eye
to reattach the damaged retina.
	   ``The operation went well with no complications,'' the statement
said. ``It will be a matter of weeks and months before we are able
to know what vision, if any, Stanley will regain.''
	   Stanley, 14, will also have surgery on his right eye, possibly a
cornea transplant.
	   He is keen basketball player and has told nurses he hopes to
take up the sport again if his sight is saved.
	   Gregor, who is making no charge, has close links with the
Nairobi hospital where Stanley was treated initially.
	   The embassy bombing killed 247 people and injured more than
5,000. Ten people died in a nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.

Doctors: Palestinian forced to give birth in car, baby dies
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers at a roadblock held up
a Palestinian woman in labor who then gave birth in a car and
arrived at a hospital with her newborn gasping for air before
dying, doctors said Wednesday.
	   The child died minutes after arrival Tuesday evening at Alia
Hospital in Hebron, said deputy director Abdel Rahim Namoura.
	   Namoura said the cause of death could not be determined until an
autopsy was performed. However, Namoura said the child's chances
for survival would have been much higher had the mother,
24-year-old Fadwa Adam, made it to the hospital on time.
	   The Israeli army said it was looking into the allegations.
	   The case was the second in four days in which Israeli troops
were accused of indirectly causing the death of a Palestinian
child.
	   Israeli troops have been enforcing a closure on the West Bank
town of Hebron since last Thursday, when a Jewish settler was
killed in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   Under the closure, no one can enter or leave the divided city,
where 450 Jewish settlers live among 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Bassem Khatib, the deputy police chief in Hebron, said Mrs.
Adam, from the village of Betula west of Hebron, was trying to
reach Alia Hospital after she went into labor.
	   Adam and her husband were stopped at an Israeli army checkpoint
west of Hebron, Khatib said. Soldiers turned the couple back. In
order to reach the hospital, they had to take a longer unpaved back
road, Khatib said.
	   Mrs. Adam gave birth in the car and her baby was gasping for air
when she finally reached Alia Hospital, Khatib said.
	   In a related development, the army said it was looking into the
death Saturday of a 3-month-old Palestinian boy in Hebron. The
child's parents said the boy died because Israeli troops enforcing
a curfew in the center of town refused to let them seek medical
treatment for him.
	   The army said it questioned soldiers and did not find evidence
of a child dying at one of the checkpoints.
	   The army said soldiers have instructions to allow those
requiring medical care to pass checkpoints without delay.

Hong Kong protesters ask Beijing to stop aid to Indonesia

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Activists marched to the Chinese Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday and demanded Beijing end aid to Indonesia,
where officials have denied reports that ethnic Chinese women were
raped during recent riots.
	   The protesters, led by the Democrats, Hong Kong's major
opposition party, criticized comments Monday by Indonesia's
intelligence chief that his investigation had found no evidence of
widespread rape.
	   ``We are very outraged by the expression made by the chief of
intelligence,'' Lt. Gen. Moetojib, said lawmaker Albert Ho.
	   About 25 protesters, including several Indonesian Chinese, waved
banners saying: ``We demand the Chinese government to exert
pressure on Indonesia to ensure the safety of ethnic Chinese.''
	   In a more quiet show of protest, over 50 people gathered outside
the Indonesian Consulate Wednesday night for a candlelight vigil.
Many of those present were Christian groups praying for the victims
of the May riots.
	   A ministry official received the protesters' petition addressed
to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, calling for China to withdraw its
promised U.S. dlrs 373 million in loans and U.S. dlrs 27 million in
flood aid to the country.
	   Beijing has condemned the anti-Chinese violence, but has not
indicated that it will withdraw aid to the country.
	   Women's rights groups alleged at least 168 women and girls,
including many ethnic Chinese, were raped during the May riots, in
which 1,200 people were killed. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas Tuesday said investigations are continuing.
	   Women's groups in Hong Kong are demanding a United Nations
investigation into the rapes, the South China Morning Post
reported.
	   Outraged by the anti-Chinese riots, ethnic Chinese have
protested outside Indonesian diplomatic offices, in China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and the United States.
	   Ethnic Chinese represent only 4 percent of Indonesia's 202
million population, but control an estimated 70 percent of the
economy. They were targeted in the May riots and scapegoated for
the country's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Seoul to propose rescheduling of 2002 World Cup soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS FIFA reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean soccer official
suggested on Wednesday that the 2002 World Cup be rescheduled to
start in May to avoid the rainy season in South Korea and Japan.
	   Park Seh-jik, chairman of South Korea's World Cup organizing
committee, said he will discuss the idea with co-host Japan before
proposing it to FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
	   ``I think there is no reason Japan would object to the idea,
because the two countries are in the same seasonal belt,'' Park
told reporters.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts to the 2002 World Cup,
soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia.
	   The quadrennial, month-long World Cup traditionally has started
around June 10, after the professional soccer season in Europe and
South America ends in April.
	   But the period overlaps the rainy season in both Japan and South
Korea.
	   Chung Mong-joon, head of South Korea's Football Association,
suggested in July that the 2002 World Cup be rescheduled for
September to avoid the rainy season in this part of the world.
	   But that idea met strong objection from key FIFA member
countries in Europe and South America because of their pro league
schedules.
	   Park said starting the tournament in late May would avoid the
rainy season, the pro league season in Europe and South America and
the 2002 Asian Games to be held in Pusan, South Korea, in
September.
	   ``It is just like catching three birds with one stone,'' he
added.
	   This year's World Cup in France ran from June 10 to July 12.
	   In Zurich, FIFA said it would have no official comment on the
proposal but could discuss it at the World Cup planning committee
meeting on Sept. 15.
	   FIFA has said previously that it does not contemplate changing
the dates, mainly because it would affect all the national
championships in Europe.
	   A FIFA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday that the South Korean proposal appeared to be ``simply
not feasible.''
	   The official said it would be ``somewhat unpleasant'' if the
World Cup were held in rainy conditions. But he said it would take
exceptionally bad weather to seriously disrupt the tournament.
	   ``At the end of the day, football is still an outdoor sport and
that is what we have to live with,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The deadly bombing of a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant probably came in retaliation for the
U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan and was likely the work of a
local group, government officials said Wednesday.
	   FBI agents headed to the site of Tuesday evening's bombing that
killed one man and wounded 27.
	   Meanwhile, 11 Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders hung bouquets
of red and white roses onto coils of barbed wire that security
forces had erected around the wrecked restaurant. A half-dozen
bouquets had been scattered on the restaurant's bloodied steps
earlier.
	   ``None of our religions condones this barbarism,'' intoned a
black-robed Mohammed Moerat, a Muslim religious leader, outside the
restaurant on the popular Victoria and Albert Waterfront. ``Such
despicable actions can only serve to turn all people of good will
against the perpetrators.''
	   A leader of Muslims Against Global Oppression denied his group
was responsible for the Tuesday evening blast despite a claim of
responsibility by a caller to radio station Cape Talk.
	   ``Anyone can call a radio station and say they are from MAGO,''
Moain Achmad, the group's coordinator, told The Associated Press
Wednesday.
	   He condemned the bombing and speculated it was carried out to
discredit Islam and scare people away from a march his group was
organizing on the U.S. Embassy on Saturday to protest the U.S.
attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In Washington, the State Department said Muslims Against Global
Oppression was anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. Some members were
among the 40 or so people who protested U.S. policies on Iraq and
Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape Town in
March.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the bombing
``must be seen against the backdrop'' of the U.S. cruise-missile
attacks. The U.S. attacks were themselves retaliation for the
bombings earlier this month of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam.
	   He added that South Africa had recently increased security at
U.S. offices and diplomatic installations and that the restaurant
may have been hit because it was a ``soft target.''
	   Two FBI agents who had been investigating the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi were flying down and were expected here
later Wednesday at South Africa's invitation, said National Police
Commissioner George Fivaz.
	   Police hoped that video footage taken by the restaurant's
security cameras before the explosion could lead to an early
arrest.
	   President Nelson Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said
police had ``indications'' a pipe bomb was responsible.
	   ``These pipe bombs ... are a very common phenomenon in the
Western Cape, which might be an indication that we are not dealing
with an international network but a local group,'' he said.
	   A Muslim vigilante organization, People Against Drugs and
Gangsterism, has been widely blamed for pipe bomb attacks in recent
years targeting suspected gangsters and drug dealers in the area.
	   ``As far as President Mandela is concerned, it is immaterial
whether the bombing is retaliation or not. We will still treat it
as an attack against innocent South Africans, against innocent
people,'' Mankahlana said.
	   Standard Bank identified the victim as Fanie Schoeman, an
employee in the human resources department. The bank was holding a
going-away party at the restaurant.
	   Seven other people at the party were injured, two seriously,
said Standard Bank spokesman Erik Larson.
	   Five members of a family from Hampshire, England, were injured.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Iris Giddings, 65, the only member
unharmed, was quoted as saying by Press Association.
	   ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as the
ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us. I was knocked down
and saw my family all lying injured before me. It was one of the
most terrible things I could imagine seeing.''
	   Doctors amputated a foot from Mrs. Giddings' 8-year-old
granddaughter Laura. Laura's 3-year-old brother Jacob is in
intensive care with spine injuries.
	   Planet Hollywood's bar, covered in blood, bore the brunt of the
blast, which cracked walls, shattered windows and lifted part of
the ceiling, which fell back into place. A glass booth holding a
mannequin of movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger was shattered at the
entrance to the South African-owned restaurant.

Bhutto's party files corruption case against Pakistani premier

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, (AP) _ Pakistani opposition leader Benazir
Bhutto accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of corruption and tax
evasion and said Wednesday her party had lodged a complaint before
a special corruption investigator.
	   There was no immediate response from Sharif, though he has in
the past denied similar charges.
	   ``We have all the evidence against Nawaz Sharif,'' Bhutto told
reporters. ``If a judicial inquiry is done into this case, he
(Sharif) would be disqualified (from holding a national assembly
seat) and barred from politics for 10 years,'' she said.
	   Bhutto, twice elected prime minister, was fired by former
president Farooq Leghari in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule. She denies the allegations and says Sharif unleashed
propaganda against her and manufactured corruption charges to wreck
her political career and remove moderate leadership from Pakistan.
	   Ms. Bhutto won a small victory Wednesday in one case against her
when a court in the eastern city of Lahore ordered her bank
accounts unfrozen. The government had frozen the accounts saying
the money was ill-gotten, but Bhutto argued she needed funds to
fight numerous court cases.
	   Sharif, a leading industrialist, has been accused of abusing his
office as prime minister in 1990-93 to get billion rupees worth of
loans from public sector banks. He built an industrial empire of 20
factories by 1993 from just nine in 1990, said the complaint filed
by Masood Kausar, a senator of Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party.
Three senior bureaucrats have also been named in the case.
	   Sharif paid income tax of 897 rupees (dlrs 15) in fiscal 1992-93
despite his business empire by ``dishonestly and fraudulently
submitting tax returns which omitted his true income,'' the
complaint said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Where is Abu Nidal? American news reports
say the notorious terrorist is detained in Egypt. Egypt denies it.
A onetime guerrilla colleague, confronted with the question,
replies with one of his own: Which Abu Nidal?
	   The comment says much about Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of
struggle'' _ whom the United States once labeled the world's most
dangerous terrorist. Over the years Abu Nidal has been reported to
have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally
changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   Rumors have been circulating in the Middle East for about two
weeks that the onetime Palestinian guerrilla was arrested by
Egyptian police while coming from Libya and is either jailed or
hospitalized with leukemia.
	   On Wednesday, Egyptian security officials denied the latest
reports, carried by American newspapers and broadcast networks. The
officials spoke on condition their names not be used, remaining as
anonymous as the sources claiming Abu Nidal is in Egypt.
	   Later, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denied Abu Nidal was in his
country when asked by reporters about the foreign news reports.
American officials said in Washington they could not confirm the
reported arrest.

Woodhall to face new opponent in WBC title fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HERTFORD, England (AP) _ Richie Woodhall will make his first WBC
super-middleweight title defense against compatriot Glenn Catley on
Sept. 5 following the withdrawal of Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello.
	   Catley, the current British middleweight champion, was a
surprise replacement when the Italian pulled out of the fight
Tuesday after tearing his calf muscle in training.
	   The fight in Telford, England, will be Woodhall's first defense
since taking the title in March from South Africa's Thulane ``Sugar
Boy'' Malinga.
	   Catley, who was scheduled to fight on the undercard of the
Woodhall-Nardiello bout, will be stepping up in weight to take on
the former underfeated European champion.
	   Promoter Frank Warren said Catley had wanted a world title shot
in the middleweight or super-middleweight divisions for some time.
	   ``This is a great opportunity for him.''

Palestinian, Israeli negotiators quietly leave Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian and Israeli negotiators quietly
ended talks Wednesday aimed at breaking an 18-month deadlock in the
Middle East peace process without commenting on the result.
	   According to Norwegian and U.S. officials, the negotiators and
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross slipped out of Oslo on Wednesday
morning.
	   ``They made no statement and did not want to,'' said Ingvard
Havnen, spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Minister, which hosted
the talks. He said Norwegian mediators had also refused comment.
	   The Palestinians and Israelis were in Oslo to mark the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo Accords, a peace agreement that was
finalized in August 1993 after months of secret talks brokered by
Norway.
	   The peace process has been stalled since the right-wing Likud
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in
Israeli in May 1996. Netanyahu took over from Shimon Peres, of the
Labor Party.
	   During the anniversary gathering, delegations led by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and Meir Sheetrit, a top member of the
Likud coalition government, met in private to discuss such
obstacles to the peace process as Israeli withdrawals from occupied
territory.
	   Arafat left on Tuesday morning, in keeping with his original
schedule.
	   On Tuesday, Ross, the U.S. envoy, said some progress had been
made in narrowing the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians,
but refused to discuss details. He left Oslo on Wednesday morning,
according to Michael T. Scanlin, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Oslo.
	   ``Ambassador Ross did not wish to comment on any aspect of the
discussions they had in Oslo,'' said Scanlin.
	   Terje Roed-Larsen, one of the Norwegians behind the backdoor
talks that led to the 1993 peace agreement, said Tuesday that the
parties might continue talks, but not necessarily in Oslo.

Insurance company's poll says Germans' angst levels declining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ If Germans seem more relaxed this year,
there's a reason: Angst levels are going down.
	   The R-and-V insurance company's annual anxiety poll, released
Wednesday, showed the average angst rate among Germans declined
slightly this year after two years of record highs.
	   Since 1991, the company has surveyed more than 3,500 people
annually, asking them to rate their level of fear _ 1 being lowest,
7 the highest _ in each of 15 categories, including unemployment,
political extremism, and serious illness.
	   The average angst rate for 1998 was 4.09, compared with 4.19
last year and 4.13 in 1996, the company said.
	   The biggest fear this year, as in 1997, was unemployment, with
an average angst level of 5.06.

Where is Abu Nidal? Not in Egypt, say security authorities

 &UR; Eds: SUBS lede to change ``famous'' to ``notorious''; ADDS new
denial by foreign minister.
 &UR; By G.G. LaBELLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Where is Abu Nidal? American news reports
say the notorious terrorist is detained in Egypt. Egypt denies it.
A onetime guerrilla colleague, confronted with the question,
replies with one of his own: Which Abu Nidal?
	   The comment says much about Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of
struggle'' _ whom the United States once labeled the world's most
dangerous terrorist. Over the years Abu Nidal has been reported to
have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally
changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   Rumors have been circulating in the Middle East for about two
weeks that the onetime Palestinian guerrilla was arrested by
Egyptian police while coming from Libya and is either jailed or
hospitalized with leukemia.
	   On Wednesday, Egyptian security officials denied the latest
reports, carried by American newspapers and broadcast networks. The
officials spoke on condition their names not be used, remaining as
anonymous as the sources claiming Abu Nidal is in Egypt.
	   Later, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denied Abu Nidal was in his
country when asked by reporters about the foreign news reports.
American officials said in Washington they could not confirm the
reported arrest.

Credit Suisse investment banking unit's net profit falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Credit Suisse bank
group said Wednesday its investment banking unit's unaudited net
profit fell to dlrs 500 million as of Aug. 25, from dlrs 754
million June 30, in connection with Russia's debt restructuring.
	   The bank blamed ``market difficulties globally, but notably in
Russia,'' where Credit Suisse First Boston has ``significant
activities.''
	   The latest estimate for CSFB's profit reflects a market
adjustment of the investment bank's position, based on Russia's new
debt rescheduling program, the group said.
	   Credit Suisse will provide more information on its Russian
activities next month, when it releases its first-half results.
	   ``While the outlook for the remainder of 1998 remains dependent
on market conditions, the half-year results Sept. 9, will
demonstrate the continued progress Credit Suisse Group is making
towards achieving its medium-term profitability targets,'' Credit
Suisse said.
	   Late Tuesday, Russia announced terms for restructuring dlrs 40
billion in outstanding treasury debt.

Report: Parents of slain boy sue killer, parents for compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The parents of an elementary school student
beheaded by a 14-year-old boy in western Japan last year have sued
the killer and his parents for damages, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   The parents of Jun Hase filed the lawsuit with Kobe District
court, seeking 104 million yen (dlrs 722,000) from the killer, now
16, and his parents, Kyodo News agency and national broadcaster NHK
reported.
	   ``We want to make clear the responsibility for the incident, and
atonement for it, and to clarify its background,'' Kyodo quoted the
father of the slain boy as saying in a statement.
	   The decapitation and arrest of such a young killer stunned
Japan. Hase's mutilated, severed head was found outside the front
gate of a school in May 1997 with a note stuffed in its mouth
calling police ``fools.''
	   The lawsuit argues that the teen-aged killer was old enough to
know what he was doing. His parents, the lawsuit said, were
negligent in allowing already known abnormal behavior by their son
to continue and worsen, Kyodo reported.
	   The lawsuit was the first private legal action against the
killer or his parents.
	   Kobe District Court officials were not available for comment
late Wednesday.
	   The killer was convicted in October 1997 of the beheading of
11-year-old Hase, another killing and three other assaults and sent
to a juvenile medical facility.
	   The judge in the case said the boy, who has not been identified
under Japanese juvenile law, suffered from severe mental disorders
and required psychiatric treatment.
	   The boy also bludgeoned a girl to death with an iron hammer in
the months before the Hase beheading. He reportedly claimed it was
an ``experiment.'' The court said the boy also attacked three other
girls.
	   Under Japanese law, the boy was too young to be tried in a
regular criminal trial or go to adult jail. A medical juvenile
prison can keep convicts until they turn 26.

Luzhkov: Chernomyrdin to blame for crisis, but likely to keep the
</HEADLINE>
job &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov blamed the current
financial crisis on policies carried out by Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin during his previous term in office, but said
parliament would likely approve his reinstatement.
	   The Moscow mayor also rushed to confirm his own reputation as an
experienced manager, stating that he has signed a package of orders
aimed at supporting Moscow's banks and finding cash to ensure that
city residents would be able to get back their bank deposits.
	   ``I think that Moscow should survive in this situation,''
Luzhkov said, as he began a visit to the Ukrainian port of
Sevastopol, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Luzhkov is one of the presidential hopefuls for the next
election in 2000. He is hugely popular in Moscow, but it remains
unclear how much influence he can muster in provinces, which often
resent Moscow's wealth.
	   To compensate, Luzhkov frequently plays to Russians' nationalist
feelings. He has made Sevastopol _ a former Soviet naval base which
is now part of Ukraine _ one of the issues, claiming that the city
must remain part of Russia.
	   He visited Sevastopol on Wednesday to speak at a ceremonial
opening of a school for Russian children, which the Moscow
government has financed. Acting Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev was
also expected to visit Sevastopol later on Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The financial crisis has caused a shortage of dollars at several
Moscow banks, forcing them to limit cash withdrawals. Some banks
are allowing withdrawals only in rubles, even from accounts
established in U.S. dollars.
	   Six Moscow banks set up a pool with guarantees from their main
shareholder, the Moscow city government, one of the participating
banks said. The Central Bank's Moscow department said the pool
should guarantee a reliable payment system, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Luzhkov also called for the nation's government and the Central
Bank to pour large resources of cash into other banks in order to
stabilize the ruble.
	   Luzhkov blamed the crisis on Chernomyrdin, who served more than
five years as prime minister until President Boris Yeltsin replaced
him with Sergei Kiriyenko this spring.
	   ``One should look for the sources of this (crisis) not in the
actions of the Kiriyenko Cabinet, but in the ways the state's
economic problems were tackled in the previous six years, in the
ways the previous _ Chernomyrdin's _ government functioned,'' he
said.

Romanian stock exchange suffers biggest slump since opening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian Stock Exchange plunged 11
percent Wednesday for almost a 20-percent drop in two days, falling
to the lowest point in its 30-month existence amid fears about the
shaky Romanian economy.
	   The general manager of the stock exchange, Stere Farmache, said
he could offer no explanation for the one-day decline, but noted
that over the last 2 1-2 months foreign investers have withdrawn
significant amounts of money from the Romanian market.
	   There were no figures available for the amount of capital pulled
out, which is due in part to months of political infighting and red
tape.
	   Farmache claimed the Romanian troubles were not directly linked
to the recent Russian economic crash. A Romanian currency dealer
who declined to be named said investors got scared after seeing
what happened in Russia and Asia.
	   The national currency, the leu, has depreciated by 0.9 percent
since Monday. There are 8,905 lei to one U.S dollar.
	   The leu has declined as a result of repatriation of foreign
companies profits and dollar demand from importers.
	   ``This trend of leu depreciation cannot be stopped in the next
months,'' said the head of the Romanian Foreign Trade Bank, Vlad
Soare, on Tuesday.
	   Some dlrs 3.6 billion of foreign money has poured into Romania
since 1989, when communism ended, a small amount compared to other
communist countries.
	   The stock exchange fell by 8.66 percent on Tuesday and another
11 percent on Wednesday. At a drop of 12 percent, the stock
exchange suspends its activities for half an hour.
	   The index of the top ten companies on the market went down to
348.41 points, the lowest value since the exchange reopened after
the end of communism in 1996.

Doctors: Palestinian forced to give birth in car, baby dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers at a roadblock held up
a Palestinian woman in labor who then gave birth in a car and
arrived at a hospital with her newborn gasping for air before
dying, doctors said Wednesday.
	   The child died minutes after arrival Tuesday evening at Alia
Hospital in Hebron, said deputy director Abdel Rahim Namoura.
	   Namoura said the cause of death could not be determined until an
autopsy was performed. However, Namoura said the child's chances
for survival would have been much higher had the mother,
24-year-old Fadwa Adam, made it to the hospital on time.
	   The Israeli army said the Hebron brigade commander ordered
soldiers at area checkpoints to be questioned. The army said a
preliminary investigation showed that no Palestinian woman in labor
was held up Tuesday by troops.

Pakistan's MQM pulls out of Sindh provincial government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The minority Pakistan Muslim League
government in southern Sindh province is likely to fall after a
powerful ally party announced Wednesday it was switching to the
opposition.
	   The move had been expected after Mohajir Qaumi Party politicians
in the Sindh Cabinet resigned Tuesday, saying the government had
proven incapable of controlling violence in Karachi, Pakistan's
economic hub and the provincial capital.
	   ``We do not have any option other than to quit the (Sindh
province) government,'' Aftab Sheikh, a senator of ethnic Mohajir
Qaumi Movement, told reporters. ``Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
not implemented a single point of its agreement with us.''
	   Sharif's PML enjoys majority in the center, but in Sindh it had
formed a coalition government of which the MQM was a major partner.
	   The MQM dominates the port city of Karachi and a few other urban
centers of Sindh province, which traditionally is considered a
stronghold of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples'
Party.
	   Political analysts say it would be very difficult for Sharif's
party to maintain its majority in the Sindh assembly now as it has
only 18 seats of its own in a house of 109 members. No vote of
confidence has been scheduled, so the party was not in imminent
danger of falling.
	   But political analysts said the provincial assembly could be
dissolved and the federal government take over administration in
the province, a measure provided for in emergencies under Pakistani
law.
	   The PPP is the single largest party with 37 seats in Sindh. The
MQM with 28, the PML with its 18 and several other smaller parties
had banded together to keep the PPP from power.
	   Earlier this month, the MQM withdrew from the federal governing
coalition.
	   The MQM, which represents Muslims who migrated from India when
Indian and Pakistan were formed after independence from Britain in
1947, is engaged in a bloody conflict with a splinter faction and
hundreds of people have died during past few years in tit-for-tat
killings between the two sides.
	   Sharif says violence in Karachi hampers business and wrecks the
investment climate in the country.
	   But a PPP leader Nisar Khoro said governor's rule would be
unjustified. ``We are the largest party in the Sindh province and
should be asked to form a government under democratic norms... we
can easily do this by forging alliance with the smaller parties and
minority groups,'' he said.
	   The Sharif government, hard pressed by international economic
sanctions for nuclear tests in May, faces difficult times on both
international and domestic fronts that include mounting border
tensions with arch-foe India.
	   Analysts say it would plunge deeper into trouble after MQM's
parting of ways. Earlier, another key ally _ the Awami National
Party _ in the North West Frontier Province also quit the Sharif
government.

Mark James named new Ryder Cup captain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ England's Mark James, who once said he
never would take the job, on Wednesday was selected as Europe's new
Ryder Cup captain.
	   The 44-year-veteran of seven Ryder Cup teams, a controversial
figure early in his career, had been widely expected to replace
Seve Ballesteros and lead Europe's 1999 effort against the United
States in golf's most prestigious team competition.
	   James had been Ballesteros right-hand man when the European team
upset the favored Americans by a point at Valderrama, Spain one
year ago.
	   ``I think I can handle the job,'' said James at the BMW
International Open where the announcement was made. ``I have the
experience to get the best out of the team and cope with whatever
comes along.''
	   James, who is chairman of the tour's player committee, is
regarded as highly popular with other players on the European
circuit.
	   While James had been the leading candidate since Ballesteros
resigned after the European triumph last September, the names of
several more renown golfers had also popped up.
	   Ian Woosnam, a former Masters winner, had been angered that he
hadn't been asked by the Ryder Cup selection committee.
	   ``I would like to have been captain,'' the Welshman was quoted
as saying in the Tuesday edition of Britain's Daily Mail. ``I think
somebody should have asked me if I was interested.''
	   Ballesteros had originally suggested Germany's Bernhard Langer
as his replacement, but the two-time Masters champions preferred to
try to earn a berth on the next two Ryder Cup teams.
	   ``But I would like to be captain sometime in the future if they
offer it to me,'' said Langer.
	   The next Ryder Cup will be held Sept. 24-26, 1999 at The Country
Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, setting forth a competition that
has heated up and grown in prestige in recent years.
	   James also said Ken Barnes and Sam Torrance, regarded as another
candidate for the job, would be his assistants in Massachusetts.
	   James, who has captured 23 titles, was mired in controversy
during his first Ryder Cup in 1979, being disciplined for missing
meetings and refusing to don team uniforms.
	   James said most of the stories passed down about his rebellious
early days weren't true, but admitted he once said he would never
take the job.
	   ``I think I said, you would have to be mental to want the job,''
said James, laughing. ``But that shows you what 20 years on the
tour can do.''
	   James said he doesn't expect the 1999 Ryder Cup team to differ
much from the group that won in Valderrama.
	   ``I think we're at a stage now on the European tour where we
have the best of the last generation and the best of the new,'' he
said.
	   The United States dominated the competition until 1979 when a
British team was expanded to include all Europeans. Since then the
two sides have split 11 competitions, with the Europeans sweeping
most recent matchups.
	   James earlier in the week also drew the support of former
European captain Bernard Gallacher, who led the team to victory in
New York in 1995.
	   ``If he is confirmed as captain he would be an excellent
choice,'' Gallacher said. ``He is the right man for the job.''

Russia builds new train for transporting nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is building a new cargo train for
transporting nuclear waste, in an attempt to cope with the large
volumes of radioactive materials that need to be taken out of
temporary storage, officials said Wednesday.
	   Russia now has only one special train for transporting nuclear
waste, said Nuclear Power Ministry spokesman Yuri Bespalko.
	   ``That train was obviously unable to cope with the volume of
shipments,'' he said.
	   Norway is financing the dlrs 2 million construction, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Deputy Nuclear Power
Minister Nikolai Yegorov. The train is expected to be completed by
next year, it added.
	   Russia's methods of storing nuclear waste have been under
international scrutiny, especially since a retired naval officer
spoke out two years ago against the dangers posed by the careless
handling of the waste.
	   Capt. Alexander Nikitin has been charged with treason for his
aid to a Norwegian environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, in
compiling the report that focused on the potential hazards caused
by improper storage of radioactive waste by Russia's Northern
Fleet.
	   The United States plans to finance the dismantling of two
nuclear submarines decommissioned from Russia's Northern Fleet,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Yegorov has said that more than 150 discharged submarines are
holding in excess of 80 metric tons (88 tons) of spent nuclear fuel
in Russia's north, and the government does not have the estimated
dlrs 1.5 billion necessary to scrap the subs or improve radiation
safety.
	   Russia has agreed to dismantle 100 of its aging submarines by
2000, but the deadline is seen as wildly unrealistic, given the
country's financial problems.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The most sacred pagoda in Myanmar was
closed Wednesday amid rumors that opposition groups were planning a
lightning protest at the site, but demonstrators never showed.
	   Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of a speech by pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi at the temple. The Aug. 26, 1988 address
was Suu Kyi's first and marked her emergence as a political figure.
	   Shopkeepers at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, a dazzling,
bell-shaped, gold-encrusted Buddhist shrine, were told by the
pagoda's board of trustees at 9 a.m. Wednesday to shut down for
cleaning.
	   Shopkeepers said, however, that they heard a group of
pro-democracy protesters was coming to the pagoda. The shrine was
still closed late Wednesday afternoon.
	   A government spokesman, replying by fax to a query from The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, said Wednesday evening that
the capital and other parts of the country ``remain calm and
peaceful.''
	   The first street protest against military rule in nearly two
years erupted Monday in Yangon as about 200 students spilled into
the streets near Yangon University.
	   They were supporting a demand by Suu Kyi's opposition National
League for Democracy that the military regime convene the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military refused to honor the result. The NLD said recently it
would convene parliament on its own, prompting the military to warn
that its leaders would be arrested and the party declared illegal.
	   The NLD has not retracted its statement saying it will convene
parliament.
	   Suu Kyi spent Wednesday recovering from kidney problems,
dizziness, low blood pressure and urinary tract problems she
suffered while staging a protest against the military's
restrictions on her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues spent 13 days living in a van on a
bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital. They were
stopped there by the authorities for the fourth time in two months
while attempting to reach the city of Bassein to meet NLD members.
	   She ended her protest Monday after her party pleaded with her to
conserve her health. The military government said she visited the
site of the student protest, which had already been broken up by
police, on her way back home.
	   No one was arrested during the protest. Rumors have been
circulating in Yangon and Bangkok that more demonstrations will
take place in Myanmar's capital.
	   Suu Kyi's speech 10 years ago at the Shwedagon Pagoda boosted
the confidence of the pro-democracy demonstrators after the fall of
the country's military dictator, Ne Win. They were defeated when a
new military clique violently suppressed their protests.

Chirac touts EU strength, proposes Middle East meeting in Paris
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday touted what
he called the increasing clout of the European Union and suggested
a meeting in Paris to prepare for a proposed summit on the troubled
Middle East peace process.
	   In his annual foreign policy speech, Chirac also called for an
international convention on fighting terrorist financing.
	   He also gently chided the United States for its reluctance to
back efforts to create an international criminal court and an
anti-personnel mine treaty, as well as Washington's embargo
policies. But he also urged greater U.S.-EU cooperation.
	   With a European Union and its euro currency that takes effect
next year, France wants to ``encourage the irresistible movement
toward a multi-polar world, where Europe will naturally find its
place,'' Chirac told a gathering of the country's ambassadors.
	   The euro ``will permit Europe to be America's equal in the
decisive domaine of currency,'' he said.
	   After speaking of close cooperation with Germany, Chirac spoke
of cross-Atlantic ties.
	   He spoke of differences with Washington, which he said
``translate, among some, into a temptation toward isolationism and
unilateralism.
	   ``I know how much President Clinton deplores that situation and
I salute his resolute international commitment,'' he said.
	   He called for intensified U.S.-French cooperation, including in
the Middle East peace process. Noting he has joined with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in proposing a peace summit, Chirac
suggested a meeting in Paris of government officials from Arab
countries, Europe, Russia and the United States.
	   U.S.-French relations have chafed in the past over Chirac's
efforts to pursue diplomacy independent of Washington.
	   In the wake of the latest terror bombings against the United
States, Chirac called for an international ``convention against the
financing of terrorism.'' Washington has been seeking to cut off
financial sources for terrorists linked to the bombings.
	   Chirac said the Franco-U.S. dialogue has also ``again become
positive'' on Iran, with Washington now calling for improved
relations with Tehran.
	   In Kosovo, Chirac said the so-called Contact Group of nations,
which includes Russian, must ``quickly define the contours'' of
possible NATO military intervention, aimed at pressing for peace
talks in the troubled Yugoslav province.
	   He also urged that a NATO summit in Washington next April
``should affirm more clearly the European identity'' within the
U.S.-led defense alliance.
	   Chirac also noted the financial crises in Asia and Russia and
called for ``urgent reinforcement of the world financial system
around the International Monetary Fund.''
	   He added that IMF aid to Russia ``will only succeed if the
indispensable internal reforms wanted by President (Boris) Yeltsin
are resolutely put to work by the new government'' of Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

Slovak election campaign starts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's election campaign started
officially on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
ruling party holding the upper hand for next month's parliamentary
vote.
	   The main contenders in the Sept. 25-26 election are Meciar's
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and two opposition parties, the
Slovak Democratic Coalition and the Party of Civic Understanding.
	   Recent polls have showed the Slovak Democratic Coalition gaining
on Meciar's party, running almost even. But opposition leaders,
marking the formal launch of a campaign that has been under way
unofficially for weeks, are already accusing the authoritarian
ruler of trying to steal the elections through his use of state-run
media and other official organs.
	   The Democratic Coalition is offering a free vacation in
Switzerland to whomever comes up with the craziest idea on how
Meciar will try to stop the opposition. The contest pokes fun at
the governing party for a campaign billboard which turned out to be
trying to pass off green Swiss scenery for Slovakia.
	   European and American officials have criticized Meciar for
undemocratic behavior.
	   Earlier this month, Meciar's party attempted to prevent the
opposition coalition from registering as a political party, but the
move was overruled by the Supreme Court.
	   A campaign spokesman for Meciar's party dismissed suggestions
that it will say and do whatever is needed to win.
	   ``Our election campaign will be peaceful, and not harmful
against other political parties,'' said Ivan Mjartan. ``The
opposition is the aggressive one, always pointing at something
because of their desire for power.''
	   Nonetheless, the ruling party has prepared thousands of leaflets
with caricatures of opposition politicians and crude jokes about
them.
	   ``The decision on whether to use them depends on what the
opposition does toward us,'' Mjartan said.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, chairman of the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
started his party's official campaign with a news conference and a
rally in the city of Zvolen. Meciar's party planned no special
events Wednesday.

Couples pack Spanish town to break mass kissing record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCALA DE HENARES, Spain (AP) _ On the firing of a gun, an
estimated 1,600 couples packed the central square of a Spanish town
and locked lips in a concerted effort to kiss their way to a world
record.
	   The couples in Alcala de Henares smooched for at least 10
seconds Tuesday in a bid to outdo the U.S. University of Maine's
record for gathering together 1,420 kissing couples on Feb. 14,
1996 _ Valentine's Day.
	   An city hall spokesman said the exact number of couples _ who
included the mayor and his wife _ would be determined Wednesday. He
said documentation would be sent for confirmation to the Guinness
Book of Records.
	   The record would be an added claim to fame for Alcala de
Henares, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Madrid, the
birthplace of 17th-century novelist Miguel Cervantes, author of Don
Quixote.

Doping report cautions on use of creatine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Legal muscle-builders, not banned substances, are a
problem in Italian soccer and steps should be taken to curb their
use, a report turned in Wednesday says.
	   After hearing 33 witnesses, mostly Serie A players and trainers,
Ugo Longo wrapped up his two-week inquiry for the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) anti-doping commission without finding evidence of
illegal drug use.
	   ``Everyone I spoke to asked that we delve into the real problem:
the use of substances that are not prohibited,'' said Longo, whose
50-page report was given to CONI president Mario Pescante. ``Our
investigation has not found evidence of (doping) in soccer.''
	   Several players told Longo that the non-prescription
muscle-builder creatine, an amino acid powder, is administered by
their Serie A club doctors.
	   ``Among the illustrious pharmacologists that I contacted, no one
said this substance is good for you,'' Longo said. ``Everyone knows
that certain dosages ... can improve athletes' performances while
putting their health at risk.''
	   He has suggested creatine be banned or restricted.
	   Prosecutors in Torino and Bologna are carrying out their own,
separate inquiries. The Torino prosecutor, Raffaele Guariniello,
met with the head of the Italian soccer players association
Wednesday.
	   The union chief, Sergio Campana, told reporters that players
erred by ``having had full confidence in the doctors. ... Soccer
players in general blindly trust their club doctors. They have the
right to know what it is they are taking and what the effects are _
and this probably does not happen.''
	   The investigations were sparked when AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman
expressed his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular development of
some players.

More arrested for gang-related Hong Kong money laundering

 &UR; EDS: ADDS report quoting police officer in grafs 3-4, illegal
immigrants among those arrested in graf 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police staged about two dozen raids and
arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in connection with
a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
	   The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong
police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old
Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender.''
	   Hong Kong police were alerted when an unidentified man
approached them saying his cousin _ who had sneaked into Hong Kong
from China _ was being held for ransom by the gang, Radio Hong Kong
said.
	   The report quoted Chief Inspector Lam Nam-wing as saying 85
officers were mobilized early Wednesday to search 23 addresses and
two safety deposit boxes.
	   Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in
China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery. The gang
allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets
of 17 relatives of Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles
are restrained under the order.
	   Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the
ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about
200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,740) during the raids.
	   The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police _ some of them illegal
immigrants _ are still being detained for questioning.
	   Although no official information was ever released on the
kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons
from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
	   Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at
seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
	   In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8
million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan
(U.S. dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese
state media.

Lithuanian President pledges Ignalina shutdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania's president said Wednesday
he is committed to closing the Ignalina nuclear power plant,
regarded by nuclear watchdog groups as one of the world's most
dangerous.
	   The Soviet-built plant uses graphite-cooled reactors like those
at the Chernobyl plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Neighboring countries, fearing a similar accident at Ignalina,
have urged Lithuania to close the plant. But Lithuania relies
heavily on the plant, which supplies about 80 percent of the
country's electricity.
	   ``Like it or not, we will have to shut our reactors down,''
President Valdas Adamkus said in an interview. ``The only question
is what alternatives we will turn to.''
	   The plant would be phased out over the next 15 years, said
Adamkus, who was elected in January after returning to his native
country from the United States where he had been a top official at
the Environmental Protection Agency.
	   He left open the possibility that Lithuania could continue to
rely on nuclear power, using Western-built reactors.
	   Although there is no containment building around the Ignalina
plant, safety at the plant is improving and it poses no immediate
threat, Adamkus said.
	   ``Operations at Ignalina have improved, and I believe
Lithuanians are not now exposed to any emergencies, nor is Ignalina
a threat to any of our neighbors,'' he said.
	   Sweden, among the countries most concerned about Ignalina, has
given millions of dollars to Lithuania for plant imporvements.
	   A previous Lithuanian government promised to close one of
Ignalina's two reactors by 2005 and the other within another 10
years, but the current government has stopped short of firm
promises.
	   Adamkus said the closure was virtually a foregone conclusion,
saying the plant reactors, built in 1983 and 1987, were designed to
be operational for around 25 years.

Hamas leader calls for boycott of U.S. products, day of fasting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The founder of the Islamic militant
group Hamas urged Arab and Muslim states Wednesday to boycott
American products and called for a one-day fast to protest last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin spoke at a rally attended by 300 supporters
in Gaza City. The crowd chanted ``God is great'' and ``Death to
Israel and America'' and burned Israeli and U.S. flags.
	   Yassin said his group has begun collecting money to rebuild the
Sudanese factory destroyed in the U.S. attack.
	   The air strikes targeted sites linked to Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden who is suspected of having masterminded the bombings of
two U.S. embassies in East Africa earlier this month.
	   Yassin told his followers it was time for the Arab world to take
action. ``We call upon all the Arab and Islamic countries to start
an economic embargo against U.S. products,'' Yassin said. ``I call
on every Muslim to fast tomorrow in a sign of solidarity with the
people in Sudan.''
	   Yassin reiterated that his group would remain focused on its
struggle against Israel. ``We are not willing to open fire on
America,'' Yassin said. ``Our battle is with the Israeli entity.
When we fight Israel, we are fighting America.''
	   Hamas, which opposes the peace process with Israel, has carried
out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.

Chernomyrdin tries to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chernomyrdin heading to meet with IMF
chief, parliament proposing power-sharing agreement, other details,
quotes, TRIMS previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to
reassure investors Wednesday following a drastic plan to
restructure Russia's enormous debts, but the ruble and stock
markets continued to fall.
	   In an apparent bid to secure support of the International
Monetary Fund, Chernomyrdin rushed to Ukraine late in the day for a
meeting with visiting IMF head Michel Camdessus, Russian news
reports said.
	   Political tension was also high, as President Boris Yeltsin's
parliament foes urged him to surrender some of his power to the
Communist-dominated lower house as condition of Chernomyrdin's
approval.
	   The ruble dove again as Central Bank support for the Russian
currency faltered. Trading at the interbank exchange was suspended
for a second day in a row after the ruble weakened by 5 percent,
trading at 8.26 rubles to the dollar or 12.1 cents, in contrast to
7.86 rubles or 12.7 cents on Tuesday.
	   In another sign of panic, the Central Bank halted further sales
of dollars Wednesday to banks and other institutions _ the first
such action since Russia launched its free-market reforms in 1992.
	   The move indicated that the Central Bank might finally give up
its desperate efforts to stem the fall of the ruble to save its
dwindling hard currency reserves.
	   The ruble plummeted likewise against the German mark, reaching
7.6 to the mark over Tuesday's 4.49 _ a drop of about 37 percent.
Traders said banks had apparently fled to the mark because dollars
were unavailable.
	   Chernomyrdin said he was ``extremely dissatisfied'' with the
Central Bank's activity over the past two days and announced he
would discuss his concern with bank chairman Sergei Dubinin.
	   The ruble plummeted 9.2 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years.
	   Yeltsin signed the decree on restructuring the country's dlrs 40
billion, short-term debt market. The terms announced late Tuesday
confirmed bond-holders' fears that they would sustain heavy losses.
	   Investors whose bonds have matured will have the option of
trading them either for long-term, dollar-denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   ``There's nothing good there. Everybody thinks the government
won and everybody else lost,'' said Oleg Galkin, a trader at ING
Barings in Moscow.
	   Even as he pledged to try to limit the damage to investors,
Chernomyrdin tried to dissociate himself from the restructuring
decision, saying it was predetermined by the previous Cabinet.
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the restructuring _ in some
cases receiving just 17 cents for every dollar they invested,
according to some analysts _ will discourage many from returning
any time soon.
	   The Russian government will feel the loss of foreign investment
keenly. Some analysts predict the country will be shut out of
international commercial borrowing for several years.
	   Stocks plummeted 6.4 percent in early trading Wednesday, with
the Russian Trading System index falling to 82.87 points from 88.38
points Tuesday.
	   Muscovites lined up outside some banks to try to withdraw their
deposits. About 80 people were outside a central branch of SBS-Agro
bank _ widely rumored to be on the brink of collapse _ umbrellas
staving off a steady drizzle as they waited for the doors to open.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman who identified
herself only as Julia. ``I'd like to be able to buy something with
my rubles, which have already become worthless.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov renewed his call for
Yeltsin's ouster and warned his faction and its allies would only
vote to approve Chernomyrdin if he gives the opposition a say in
his program.
	   ``So far the talk has been all about how `we should work
together,''' Zyuganov said. ``I don't believe a single word from
Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin.''
	   Lawmakers in the lower house, the State Duma, proposed a
power-sharing agreement with the government that would curb
Yeltsin's powers and give parliament a say in Cabinet appointments.
	   Russia's former deputy premier Boris Nemtsov, who resigned

Mosquitoes living underground choose man over birds for food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some mosquitoes that previously fed on birds have
now acquired a taste for human blood after decades of living in the
London subway system, scientists say.
	   A population of mosquitoes moved into the London Underground
tunnels when they were dug 100 years ago, and since have slowly
been evolving into a new species, said Kate Byrne, a population
geneticist at London University's Queen Mary and Westfield College.
	   Unable to find any birds to feed on, the mosquitoes began
preying on rats, mice and humans. Now, mammalian blood is their
preferred diet, she said Wednesday.
	   Scientists say this underground population behaves so
differently from its above-ground relatives that attempts to mate
the two failed _ even though both are from the species Culex
pipiens.
	   ``They look to be completely distinct from each other,'' Ms.
Byrne said.
	   While scientists stop short of calling the underground bugs a
new species, they say the behavioral differences are stark. The
bugs feed, mate and reproduce differently.
	   Researchers hope the two groups can be studied to answer bigger
scientific questions about why and how species make behavioral
switches.
	   Britons first noticed flesh-biting mosquitoes in the subway
system during World War II. People seeking protection from Adolf
Hitler's bombing raids emerged from the subway, known as the
``Tube,'' complaining about bites.
	   Now, after further study by Ms. Byrne and her colleague Richard
Nichols, scientists are learning more about these underground bugs.
	   In addition to being genetically different from their
above-ground counterparts, the mosquitoes also have characteristics
unique to the different subway lines and even look different.
	   That has been attributed to draughts created by trains
dispersing the insects along, but not between, the different lines.

May, Rivera team up to give Hanshin the win over top-ranked
</HEADLINE>
Yokohama

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Hanshin Tigers bested the Central
League-leading Yokohama BayStars 6-2 Wednesday as the Tigers'
starting pitcher Darrel May and closer Ben Rivera defused the
BayStars' offensive lineup.
	   May, formerly of the Anaheim Angels, gave up two runs in seven
innings. Hanshin reliever Minoru Kasai and Rivera, formerly of the
Philadelphia Phillies, then held the BayStar's in check for the
final two innings.
	   Elsewhere in the Central League, home runs by former Los Angeles
Dodger Eric Anthony and Dwayne Hosey, formerly of the Boston Red
Sox, helped the Yakult Swallows defeat the Hiroshima Carp 5-1.
	   That saddled Hiroshima starting pitcher Nathan Minchey, also
formerly of the Red Sox, with the loss.
	   The Yomiuri Giants walked away with a 3-1 victory over the
Chunichi Dragons at Nagoya Dome. An RBI single from Yomiuri's
Hideki Matsui tied up the game 1-1 before teammate Kazuhiro
Kiyohara drove in the go-ahead run which secured the victory over
the Dragons.
	   Separately, Chunichi said Wednesday they have dropped
right-handed pitcher Kevin Jarvis, formerly of the Detroit Tigers,
Kyodo News reported. The 29-year-old Kentucky native had signed a
one-year contract in January with the Dragons.
	   In the Pacific League, the top-ranked Nippon Ham Fighters
triumphed over the Chiba Lotte Marines 6-5, handing the win to
starting pitcher Erik Shullstrom, formerly of the Minnesota Twins.
A single hit in the ninth inning by the Fighters' Atsushi Kataoka
drove in the winning run.
	   A home run belted out by Tuffy Rhodes, a former Red Sox player,
was not enough to prevent the Kintetsu Buffaloes from losing 6-4 to
the Seibu Lions. Seibu closer Tetsuya Shiozaki was the winning
pitcher. The Lion's Ken Suzuki connected for a decisive grand slam
in the eighth inning.
	   Meanwhile, the Orix BlueWave overpowered Pacific League rivals
the Daiei Hawks in a 7-5 game in Fukuoka. Ichiro Suzuki doubled in
a pair of runs to break a 5-5 tie in the eighth inning.

Hamas leader calls for boycott of U.S. products, day of fasting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The founder of the Islamic militant
group Hamas urged Arab and Muslim states Wednesday to boycott
American products and called for a one-day fast to protest last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin spoke at a rally attended by 300 supporters
in Gaza City. The crowd chanted ``God is great'' and ``Death to
Israel and America'' and burned Israeli and U.S. flags.
	   Yassin said his group has begun collecting money to rebuild the
Sudanese factory destroyed in the U.S. attack.
	   The air strikes targeted sites linked to Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden who is suspected of having masterminded the bombings of
two U.S. embassies in East Africa earlier this month.
	   Yassin told his followers it was time for the Arab world to take
action. ``We call upon all the Arab and Islamic countries to start
an economic embargo against U.S. products,'' Yassin said. ``I call
on every Muslim to fast tomorrow in a sign of solidarity with the
people in Sudan.''
	   Yassin reiterated that his group would remain focused on its
struggle against Israel. ``We are not willing to open fire on
America,'' Yassin said. ``Our battle is with the Israeli entity.
When we fight Israel, we are fighting America.''
	   Hamas, which opposes the peace process with Israel, has carried
out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.

Britain appeals to Sierra Leone for clemency for 16 people
</HEADLINE>
sentenced to death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Wednesday expressed dismay at the death
sentences imposed in Sierra Leone on 16 civilians, including five
journalists, convicted of collaborating in a military coup which
British mercenaries helped to end.
	   Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said he plans to appeal
personally to Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to show
clemency, adding that Britain is trying to organize a joint plea by
the 15-nation European Union.
	   ``I am very concerned to learn that the death sentence has been
passed on the first 16 people to have been found guilty of
treason,'' Lloyd said in a statement.
	   ``We are urgently contacting our EU partners with a view to
encouraging a joint EU response to the sentences,'' he added. ``We
welcome the UN monitoring of the trials, and continue to make clear
to the government of Sierra Leone the need for them to pay due heed
to human rights, due process and international norms.''
	   A judge handed down the sentences Tuesday after a jury convicted
the 16 people of collaborating with the military regime which
ousted Kabbah in May last year.
	   The junta was toppled in February by a Nigerian-led West African
force.
	   The coup in the former British colony became politically
controversial in Britain this year because Sandline International,
a British mercenary company which supplied the West African force,
said the Foreign Office had given it permission for this despite a
UN embargo on supplying arms to either side.
	   The Foreign Office denied this. However, several lawmakers said
Wednesday that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is
well-placed to intervene over the death sentences because of its
close links with Kabbah.
	   ``During the period when the handling of this business in Sierra
Leone by the Foreign Office was under such severe scrutiny, the
constant refrain from government ministers was, `OK, things may not
have been well handled here, but in essence, the good guys won',''
said Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal
Democrats, an opposition party.
	   ``Well, it will take something of the shine off the proposition
that the good guys won if one of the actions of the good guys is to
execute journalists,'' Campbell added in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview.
	   Ann Clwyd, a legislator in the governing Labor Party, said the
sentences were appalling.
	   ``Given that we have considerable clout with this new government
in Sierra Leone, I think we should make very strong representations
not to carry out the death penalty,'' said Ms. Clwyd. ``Obviously,
since we played a part in restoring that government to power, we
should exercise our influence.''
	   Those sentenced to death by hanging include a radio journalist
who recently gave birth to a son in prison.

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Hurrying to the hospital for the delivery
of their fourth child, a Naples couple found out they had been in a
little too much of a rush _ they'd left the baby behind.
	   Unbeknownst to his parents, Luigi Nappello was born on the
pavement outside his home Monday as the couple scrambled to the car
for the trip to the hospital.
	   Concetta Romano and husband Antonio Nappello discovered their
oversight only when doctors got her into the operating room _ and
found nothing to deliver.
	   Nappello sped back home with police escort, and found his new
son waiting for him on the pavement.
	   Baby and mother remained at the hospital Wednesday, nurse Maria
Grazia Giuliano said.
	   Both were in good condition; doctors were still marveling.
	   ``We've seen lots of deliveries outside of the ordinary: on the
steps of the hospital, in the car during the trip, at the moment
when the mothers crossed the door of the delivery room _ but this
has never happened,'' hospital director Luigi De Paolo told Italy's
Ansa news service.

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - Shane Kelly looks for his fourth
consecutive kilometer time trial title at the World Cycling
Championships which began Wednesday with qualifications in the
women's sprint and the men's individual pursuit.
	   Kelly hopes to add another kilometer crown amid an Australian
team that has been plagued by internal problems. The men's
kilometer is the first final of the competition Wednesday night.
	   He holds the world record of 1 minute, 0.613 set at altitude at
the 1995 world championships, the first of his world titles.
	   However he missed the Olympic gold when he pulled his left foot
out of the pedal strap as he left the start line in Atlanta and
stopped.
	   Kelly hopes to divert attention from controversy on the
Australian team.
	   According to reports, there have been a few disputes between
coaches and star athletes over training methods that led to three
riders leaving the Australian training camp in the United States
and stay apart from the main group in Germany.
	   The team also has been disrupted by the use of a controversial
treatment to build resistence to illness that is used with
colostrum extracted from cows' milk.
	   Colostrum contains a substance which, in concentrated forms, is
on the banned list. That has disturbed a few of the riders,
especially in the aftermath of the Tour de France and the doping
scandal and the increased checks by both the French police and the
International Cycling Union.
	   Kelly hopes to put all this behind him in a chance to win his
fourth straight title. He lost out on the Olympic gold to Florian
Rousseau, one of the stars of the French team that took six of the
12 titles at last year's world championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Rousseau has moved to the men's sprint event where he looks to
defend his title.
	   France also has two world champions in the individual pursuit,
which also began Wednesday.
	   Defending champion is Philippe Ermenault but teammate Francis
Moreau, a world champion in the sprint event in 1991, is also
entered.
	   Moreau led qualifying with a time of 4 minutes, 19.234 seconds
over the 4,000 meters. Second was Ermenault in 4:21.096.
	   The top four in qualifying advance to the semifinals Wednesday
night.
	   Chris Boardman, who won the evevnt at the 1992 Olympics and two
world championships and holds the world record, was just 12th.
	   He was injured when he fell heavily in the Tour de France when
he was wearing the leader's yellow jersey during the second stage
on the way to Cork, Ireland on July 13.
	   In the women's events, France's Felicia Ballanger, who has won
six world titles over the last three years, led the way in
qualifying in the sprint. Her time of 11.259 seconds over the 200
meters time trial was the best and advanced her, archrival Michelle
Ferris of Australia and Chris Witty of the United States directly
into the round of eight later Wednesday.
	   Ferris's time was 11.341. Witty's best was 11.361.
	   Witty won a silver and a bronze medal in speedskating this year
in Nagano but is now concentrating on the cycling events to try for
the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia in 2000.
	   Another American, Jennie Reed, qualified in fourth in 11.386.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African equity share
prices fell a massive 8.7 percent in pre-noon trading on Wednesday
but started rallying later in the day.
	   Most brokers pointed to the fall-out from Russia's decision to
reschedule its debt as the principal cause of the huge losses, Dow
Jones Newswires reported.
	   The drop slid back to a 7.8 percent fall by 2 p.m. local time
(1200 GMT), still one of the worst falls on record at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
	   Brokers were watching the U.S. Standard and Poors futures index
in New York and anticipating heavy falls in U.S. shares.
	   Offshore investors were beating a path out of the South African
market, fearing the financial turmoil in Russia and problems in
Japan would send emerging markets into a dive, Dow Jones said.
	   The stock price tumble was magnified by soaring local bond
yields, with the benchmark seven-year government bond soaring from
17.94 percent to 18.7 percent late Tuesday.

Japanese bank ex-chairman denies ordering racketeer payoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former chairman of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank charged
with getting the bank to extend payoffs to a corporate racketeer
denied giving orders for such illegal payments in court Wednesday,
a news report said.
	   Tadashi Okuda, 66, denied having stated in a deposition made
during investigations that he gave instructions to extend 11.8
billion yen (dlrs 81.9 million) in loans to a racketeer, Kyodo News
reported.
	   ``There was nothing of that sort. The content of the deposition
was a product of the public prosecutors' imagination,'' Okuda was
quoted by Kyodo as telling the Tokyo District Court.
	   Court officials could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo is one of a handful of top companies implicated
in a widening crackdown on so-called ``sokaiya'' racketeers who
threaten to disrupt shareholders' meetings with embarrassing
company secrets unless they are paid off.
	   Okuda, who was indicted July last year with other DKB officials
more than a month after resigning as chairman, said loans were
decided by a specific banking official.
	   ``I have utmost respect for the authority of the official and
would never interfere,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Okuda, who was DKB president from April 1992 to April 1996
before taking over the bank chairmanship, stepped down June 13 last
year after the payoff scandal came to light.

Swiss government rejects move to legalize abortion up to 14 weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government on Wednesday
rejected a recommendation to legalize abortion within the first 14
weeks of pregnancy, but said the country's 56-year-old abortion law
is in need of change.
	   A committee of the national parliament's lower house had
proposed the change to Swiss law, under which abortion is illegal
unless the mother's life is in danger.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said a revised law must take into
account appropriate protection for the unborn child, and said the
proposed 14-week limit didn't satisfy that requirement.
	   The ruling coalition cabinet had to consider its obligation to
ensure that protection as well as respecting women's right to
choose, he said.
	   But Koller added that existing legislation is outdated, with a
growing gap between the law and reality. There have been no
convictions for illegal abortion in more than a decade, he said.
	   Other options remaining open include the possibility of allowing
abortion on legal or social grounds, the cabinet said.
	   Under such a system, a woman would have to undergo
state-approved counseling before deciding to have an abortion.
	   A 1977 referendum that would have allowed abortion within the
first 12 weeks was rejected. But a 1988 vote that would have
strictly forbidden abortions also was defeated. The Swiss
population is 46 percent Roman Catholic.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The deadly bombing of a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant probably came in retaliation for the
U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan and was likely the work of a
local group, government officials said Wednesday.
	   FBI agents headed to the site of Tuesday evening's bombing that
killed one man and wounded 27.
	   Police had identified suspects, President Nelson Mandela said
after a meeting with religious leaders in the southeastern town of
Umtata.
	   ``I am confident they will be arrested soon,'' South African
Press Association quoted him as saying. Security officials provided

Tanzania bombing toll rises to 12 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The death toll in the twin
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania rose Wednesday to
259 after two more deaths were reported.
	   The near-simultaneous bombings on Aug. 7 killed 247 people in
Nairobi, Kenya, and the death toll in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania rose
to 12, after relatives and hospital officals said two more died
this week.
	   The bombs injured more than 5,500 people, mostly Kenyans.
	   A doctor at the Aga Khan hospital in Dar es Salaam said
Aimosaria Mzee, 42, who was applying for a visa at the time of the
blast, died Sunday of complications from a head wound.
	   Relatives of a 51-year-old woman, whose name was not released,
said she died Sunday from internal injuries. She was to be buried
Thursday.

Amid new clashes, Kosovo rebel speaker says no side can win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid new clashes in the Serbian
Kosovo province, the secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels' spokesman
hinted Wednesday they may eventually negotiate because no side in
the bloody conflict can win.
	   After meeting two Western diplomatic envoys in Pristina, the
Kosovo province capital, Adem Demaci, the spokesman for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, said: ``I told them we are ready to negotiate on
condition that the Serb regime ... knows that it cannot win
militarily.
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' admitted Demaci, who said in recent
interviews that, following a string of defeats, the KLA has decided
to adopt guerrilla tactics from now on.
	   Demaci also declared: ``We are ready to do that if the Serb
regime makes an effort and withdraws its forces, ... stops the
terror and accepts the Albanian framework for talks, which is the
1991 referendum'' on Kosovo's independence.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has ruled out independence
for Kosovo, and Western powers are also strictly opposed to it,
saying a change of borders could trigger a larger Balkan conflict.
	   Restoration of Kosovo's regional autonomy, which Milosevic
adopted in 1989, would be the most likely compromise, although most
Kosovo Albanians insist they want independence.
	   One of the diplomats who met with Demaci, Gerhard Jandl, head of
the European Union's working group for the Balkans, said there can
be no political solution until there is a humanitarian one.
	   ``The humanitarian situation will amount to a catastrophe in the
fall and winter if it is not addressed properly,'' he said,
referring to tens of thousands of refugees displaced in six months
of fighting and destruction.
	   ``The first priority ... is to try to get the displaced people
to their villages and towns, and unless this is achieved we don't
see any chance for real progress on the political front because it
is understandable that under current circumstances the prospect for
political negotiations are very, very dim,'' Jandl said.
	   More bloodshed and shooting was reported Wednesday in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population.
	   The Yugoslav army said it ``liquidated four terrorists'' when it
intercepted Wednesday an armed group attempting to enter illegally
Kosovo from neighboring Albania.
	   The incident occurred near the border outpost Goden, about 85
kilometers (53 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The group, which the army said was smuggling weapons, opened
fire at a border guard patrol, drawing return fire from the patrol.
A large quantity of weapons was confiscated, the army statement
said.
	   Albanian sources confirmed four bodies were brought Wednesday to
the morgue in Djakovica, the nearest town to the Goden outpost.
	   Also Wednesday, the Serbian Media Center in Pristina said that
armed ethnic Albanian extremists attacked early morning police
positions near Dulje, on the Pristina-Prizren road in southwest
Kosovo.
	   Two additional police patrols were hit overnight with
machine-gun fire, and one policeman was reported wounded Monday
afternoon in the embattled province, the center said.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported
that Serb police entered the village Banja, near the militants'
former stronghold of Malisevo, which police overran last month. The
village was said to be in flames. Two more villages were also
shelled.
	   Another casualty of the three-day clashes near Suva Reka was
discovered today: Safet Micaj, 21. This brought the ethnic Albanian
death toll in the Suva Reka fighting to 10, the center said.
	   Over 10,000 refugees who fled the Suva Reka clashes are now in a
valley connecting this region to nearby Malisevo, it said.

Opposition boycotts debate on bank bills; threatens to delay reform
</HEADLINE>
plans

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A political battle over the government's financial
reform plans heated up Wednesday as opposition parties boycotted a
key debate on bills designed to clean up Japan's debt-ridden banks.
	   The debate on a series of bills aimed at reviving the nation's
ailing financial system stalled Wednesday when opposition parties
refused to attend a parliamentary committee meeting because of a
dispute with the ruling Liberal Democrats over procedure.
	   The bills are seen as vital to saving Japan's economy and the
delay dealt an immediate blow to Japan's markets. The benchmark
stock average plunged 1.4 percent and the yen slipped against the
dollar as investors worried that government deadlock could drive
Japan deeper into recession.
	   ``If the opposition can block the proposals, in the worst-case
scenario it could lead to another general election,'' said Stephen
Wood, senior equity salesman at ING Baring Securities. ``That would
lead to a delay in needed reforms.''
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the banking reform
bills, which they say would bail out poorly managed banks at public
expense.
	   The ruling party's bills would allow the use of public money to
take over ailing banks. Opposition parties want the wording of the
bills strengthened to ensure that public funds are used only as a
last resort.
	   The opposition has focused its criticism on Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's plan to use public money to save the ailing Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government wants to clean up the
bank's bad loans before a proposed merger with Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co.
	   Opposition parties agreed later Wednesday to abandon their
boycott of the committee meeting on condition that debate during
the next session, on Thursday, focuses on the proposed Long-Term
Credit Bank bailout.
	   Both sides say they realize the urgency of resolving Japan's
banking problem, and are willing in principle to compromise.
	   Chief cabinet secretary Hiromu Nonaka said Wednesday that the
LDP would review the opposition's proposals to try to find areas on
which they could negotiate.
	   But Nonaka conceded reaching a compromise would not be easy.
	   ``We'll have to go through a process before we can reach
agreement, and there is certainly a feeling of distance between the
parties,'' he said.

Thailand nominates Panichpakdi as candidate to head WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A deputy prime minister of Thailand has been
nominated by its government as a candidate to become the new chief
of the World Trade Organization, a WTO spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The Thai government wrote to the chairman of the WTO General
Council, Ambassador John Weekes, on Wednesday confirming it is
nominating Supachai Panichpakdi as its official candidate for the
post, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Panichpakdi is the second candidate to formally enter the race
to succeed current WTO director-general and former Italian trade
minister Renato Ruggiero, who has said he intends to leave by April
1, 1999.
	   In July, Canada nominated Roy Maclaren, a senior diplomat and
former trade minister, as its candidate.
	   Panichpakdi wrote to Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai earlier
this month seeking permission to become a candidate, saying he
would represent Asian interests as head of the world's supreme
trade body.
	   Thailand was the first of Asia's former miracle economies to
plunge into crisis last year. Supachai said in his letter to Chuan
that resolving the country's economic problems needed a global
approach.
	   Supachai has said his bid is supported by ministers representing
India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Weekes has asked governments to nominate candidates by October 1
this year. The contest will be decided by consensus.

Tajik, U.N. representatives discuss killing investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Leaders of Tajikistan's parliament and the
opposition met with United Nations envoy Jan Kubis on Wednesday to
discuss the investigation of the killing of U.N. workers.
	   The U.N. has decided to recall all non-essential foreign staff
from Tajikistan and refuses to assist the return of former Tajik
opposition fighters from Afghanistan until the government arrests
suspects in last month's killing of U.N. workers.
	   The government announced last week that it had identified four
suspects, and said they were on the territory controlled by the
opposition. Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri has ordered his
field commanders to arrest the suspects and turn them over to the
government, but the plans have been stalled.
	   Meanwhile, some 250 former opposition fighters remained stranded
in Afghanistan on Wednesday, because their return must be observed
by U.N. representatives.
	   Nuri and parliament deputy speaker Abdumazhid Dostiyev told
Kubis on Wednesday that three of the suspects would be brought to
the capital Dushanbe in the next few days, Russia's Interfax news
agency reported.
	   They also appealed to Kubis for help with the return of Tajik
ex-rebels, but the U.N. envoy said the help would only be extended
after the suspects are arrested, Interfax said.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while on a regular
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.

Owner of limousine company questioned by Diana judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The owner of the company that rented Princess
Diana's Mercedes to the Ritz Hotel was being questioned Wednesday
by the judge investigating the fatal crash.
	   Nils Siegel, owner of Etoile Limousines, was believed to be
testifying about the condition of the Mercedes, which crashed into
a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma traffic tunnel last Aug. 31, killing
Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul.
	   Questions have been raised about the car's brakes, and whether
the Ritz may have been warned that the car was precarious when
braking suddenly.
	   On Tuesday, Judge Herve Stephan questioned two officials from
the Ritz _ its president, Frank Klein, and its director, Claude
Roulet.
	   A lawyer for Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard who was the sole
survivor of the crash, had asked Stephan to question both the Ritz
and Etoile managers to determine responsibility for the crash,
which left him seriously injured.
	   Rees-Jones worked for Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father and the
owner of the Ritz, but has since resigned.
	   Siegel testified for about an hour and a half Wednesday, then
left without comment.

Britain approves disposal of Shell's Brent Spar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government on Wednesday approved Shell's plans
to chop up the obsolete Brent Spar oil platform and make a
Norwegian ferry pier, ending a saga that proved enormously
embarrassing to the oil giant.
	   Shell's original plans to sink the Brent Spar in the North
Atlantic were thwarted when Greenpeace activists boarded the vessel
in April 1995, unleashing a wave of environmental protests across
continental Europe that forced Shell to change course.
	   Shell towed the Brent Spar to a fjord in Norway, where it has
been floating ever since _ and the company finally announced plans
early this year to convert the old platform into a pier.
	   But Britain had approved only the previous plan to dump the
Brent Spar at sea, so Shell could not proceed until the government
passed judgment on the new proposal.
	   Shell said it plans to begin dismantling the Brent Spar later
this year and hopes the new pier in Mekjarvik will be finished by
the end of 1999.
	   The company said it was ``delighted'' by Wednesday's
development.

Taxi drivers under fire after rash of tourist rip-offs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Athens' biggest taxi union is urging the
government to show no mercy to cab drivers arrested for cheating
foreign visitors.
	   ``They should chop off their heads,'' said Thimios Lyberopoulos,
the head of Athens' taxi drivers association.
	   The call came Wednesday when four taxi drivers were charged with
overcharging three people, including a foreigner who was about to
pay double for a ride from the Athens airport to the Acropolis.
	   Lyberopoulos complained that local authorities were too lenient
with a taxi driver who last week charged an Australian tourist 25
times the normal fare for a ride from the airport. Local
authorities Tuesday suspended his license for two weeks and fined
him 60,000 drachmas (dlrs 195).
	   Lyberopoulos said nearly two dozen drivers had been arrested for
overpricing this year, and called on the government to implement
planned legislation that will impose stiff penalties on cheaters.
He said his union did not have the power to discipline its members.
	   Tourism officials worried about Greece's image abroad have in
the past launched campaigns to improve the manners of often rude
taxi drivers, especially those who work at the airport.
	   Athens's 17,000 or so taxis are among the cheapest in the
European Union and complement the often disorganized mass transit
system.

	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ The U.S. Open Cup final between
Major League Soccer teams the Chicago Fire and Columbus Crew has
been moved from Wednesday night to Thursday because of the expected
impact of Hurricane Bonnie.
	   Both teams agreed to the switch as Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore
has already issued a state of emergency. He declared the Hampton
Roads region an anticipated disaster area.
	   ``Naturally, we are very disappointed about the change,'' said
U.S. Soccer Federation spokesman Emilio Pozzi, ``but we have no
choice. The safety of the fans, players and officials must always
come first.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid new clashes in the Serbian
Kosovo province, the secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels' spokesman
hinted Wednesday they may eventually negotiate because no side in
the bloody conflict can win.
	   After meeting two Western diplomatic envoys in Pristina, the
Kosovo province capital, Adem Demaci, the spokesman for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, said: ``I told them we are ready to negotiate on
condition that the Serb regime ... knows that it cannot win
militarily.
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' admitted Demaci, who said in recent
interviews that, following a string of defeats, the KLA has decided
to adopt guerrilla tactics from now on.
	   Demaci also declared: ``We are ready to do that if the Serb
regime makes an effort and withdraws its forces, ... stops the
terror and accepts the Albanian framework for talks, which is the
1991 referendum'' on Kosovo's independence.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has ruled out independence
for Kosovo, and Western powers are also strictly opposed to it,
saying a change of borders could trigger a larger Balkan conflict.
	   Restoration of Kosovo's regional autonomy, which Milosevic
abolished in 1989, would be the most likely compromise, although
most Kosovo Albanians insist they want independence.

Report: Israel planned to assassinate Arafat 30 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Inspired by an Oscar-winning psychological
thriller about an assassination, Israel's intelligence agency tried
30 years ago to brainwash a Palestinian into killing PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   According to the Haaretz newspaper, Benjamin Shalit, then chief
psychologist for the Israeli navy, got the idea from the 1962 film
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' in which an American prisoner of war
in Korea is brainwashed, programmed to kill and returned to the
United States to assassinate a powerful politician.
	   Haaretz said Shalit spent three months hypnotizing a captured
Palestinian faithful to Arafat's Fatah organization to carry out
the assassination.
	   Mossad agents then equipped the candidate with a small radio and
sent him to Jordan to allegedly wait for instructions to be
broadcast on the radio at an appointed time, giving him the go
ahead to kill Arafat.
	   But higher ups in the Mossad, apparently unconvinced that the
psychological route would yield results and anticipating the
radio's turn-over to Arafat, rigged the radio and planned to
explode it by wireless remote at the appointed broadcast time.
	   But both the radio and the psychology failed.
	   On Israel Radio Wednesday, Ronen Bergman, the Haaretz reporter
who wrote the story, said the candidate immediately reported his
entire experience to Palestinian leaders in Jordan and showed them
the radio. Arafat listened to the radio, curious as to how the
Mossad would try to contact the candidate. But the explosive device
in the radio failed to detonate, the reporter said.
	   Bergman said a former Mossad agent involved in the plot told him
that after 30 years and a change in Israeli policy recognizing the
Palestinian leader, he would be happy to apologize to Arafat.

Mark James named new Ryder Cup captain

 &UR; EDS: ADDS details on Ryder Cup history, adds BYLINE, Jame's
nickname as ``Jesse James'' and CORRECTS name of assistant to Ken
Brown in graf 13 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ England's Mark James, who once said he
never would take the job, on Wednesday was selected as Europe's new
Ryder Cup captain.
	   The 44-year-veteran of seven Ryder Cup teams, a controversial
figure early in his career, had been widely expected to replace
Seve Ballesteros and lead Europe's 1999 effort against the United
States in golf's most prestigious team competition.
	   James had been Ballesteros right-hand man when the European team
upset the favored Americans by a point at Valderrama, Spain one
year ago.
	   ``I think I can handle the job,'' said James at the BMW
International Open where the announcement was made. ``I have the
experience to get the best out of the team and cope with whatever
comes along.''
	   James, who is chairman of the tour's player committee, is
regarded as highly popular with other players on the European
circuit.
	   The next Ryder Cup will be held Sept. 24-26, 1999 at The Country
Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, setting forth a competition that
has heated up and grown in prestige in recent years.
	   While James had been the leading candidate since Ballesteros
resigned after the European triumph last September, the names of
several more renown golfers had also popped up.
	   Ian Woosnam, a former Masters winner, had been angered that he
hadn't been asked by the Ryder Cup selection committee.
	   ``I would like to have been captain,'' the Welshman was quoted
as saying in the Tuesday edition of Britain's Daily Mail. ``I think
somebody should have asked me if I was interested.''
	   Ballesteros had originally suggested Germany's Bernhard Langer
as his replacement, but the two-time Masters champions preferred to
try to earn a berth on the next two Ryder Cup teams.
	   ``But I would like to be captain sometime in the future if they
offer it to me,'' said Langer.
	   James said Ken Brown and Sam Torrance, regarded as another
candidate for the job, would be his assistants in Massachusetts.
	   James, who has captured 23 titles, was mired in controversy
during his first Ryder Cup in 1979, being disciplined for missing
meetings and refusing to don team uniforms.
	   He earned the nickname ``Jesse James'' for his occasional stormy
relationship with the media and other antics.
	   There are also numerous tour stories circulating about James'
early days, such as the one that senior teammates at the 1979 Ryder
Cup held in Greenbrier, West Virginia, threatened to give the then
25-year-old a thrashing for his attitude.
	   ``I think the stories are wonderful, but unfortunately they're
not true,'' James said.
	   But he admitted to once saying he would never take a job as
Ryder Cup captain.
	   ``I think I said, you would have to be mental to want the job,''
said James, laughing. ``But that shows you what 20 years on the
tour can do.''
	   James said he doesn't expect the 1999 Ryder Cup team to differ
much from the group that won in Valderrama.
	   ``I think we're at a stage now on the European tour where we
have the best of the last generation and the best of the new,'' he
said.
	   The United States dominated the competition until 1979 when a
British team was expanded to include all Europeans and leads
overall with 23 wins, seven losses and two ties.
	   But the European team has swept the past two Ryder Cups and four
of the past seven, with winning the now fiercely competitive cup
becoming a major source of pride for golfers on both sides of the
Atlantic.
	   James earlier in the week also drew the support of former
European captain Bernard Gallacher, who led the team to victory in
New York in 1995.
	   ``If he is confirmed as captain he would be an excellent
choice,'' Gallacher said. ``He is the right man for the job.''

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police on Wednesday said 28 people died
in the bombing of two long-distance buses in central Uganda and
said a dormant rebel group claimed responsibility for the blasts.
	   President Yoweri Museveni condemned the attacks as ``senseless
and cowardly,'' and vowed to bring the attackers to justice.
	   ``The president ... said the government is more than ever
resolved to fight terrorism from all fronts and will use all means
available in the various security agencies to wipe out terrorism in
the country,'' said a statement released by his office Wednesday.
	   Deputy police spokesman John Kimera said the explosions,
possibly caused by grenades, both occurred around 10 a.m. (0700gmt)
Tuesday on two buses, one headed for the Rwanda capital, Kigali,
and the other headed for Kasese in western Uganda.
	   ``There was very good linkage. The whole thing was
coordinated,'' Kimera said. ``We have arrested four people, and the
investigations are going on.''
	   He said he did not know how many people were injured in the
explosions.
	   Kimera said the private station Radio Simba received a call
Wednesday claiming that the National Army for the Liberation of
Uganda was responsible for the attacks.
	   Initial reports Tuesday spoke of explosions on three buses, the
third headed for the northern town of Gulu.
	   Kimera said an explosion occured in the Gulu-bound bus after all
the passengers but a young boy had gotten out because of a
mechanical problem. He said the boy was injured in the blast, but
not killed, as previously reported.
	   He said all four people arrested had been passengers on the
Gulu-bound bus.
	   Kimera said he could neither confirm nor deny that the
explosions on the two buses near Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175
miles) southwest of Kampala, were timed to occur on the day
Museveni was supposed to meet members of a parliamentary committee
at his home in Rwakitura, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from where
the explosions occurred.
	   Museveni was still in Rwakitura Wednesday, his office said.
	   It was not clear whether the buses were in the same place when
the blasts occurred. The Kampala-Mbarara road is the main highway
to Kigali and Kasese.
	   NALU was founded in 1988 and based in what was then eastern
Zaire, now Congo, from where it launched attacks on western Uganda.
It has been dormant in recent years and eclipsed by the Allied
Democratic Forces who also operate from Congo and attack western
Uganda.
	   The government-owned New Vision said Wednesday that Foreign
Minister Eriya Kategaya told parliament 75 people were in police
custody in connection with bomb and grenade attacks carried out in
Uganda since the beginning of the year in which six people died.

Libya asks for Security Council delay on Pan Am trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Libya asking for council to delay any
decision on deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya asked the Security Council to delay
a decision on a U.S.-British proposal to try two suspects in the
Pan Am bombing in the Netherlands until it can study the plan
further, according to a letter made public on Wednesday.
	   ``Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned,'' said the Aug. 25 letter from the Libyan deputy
ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg.
	   The letter, the first official reaction from Tripoli on the
proposal, said Libya's judicial authorities need more time to study
the proposal and asked for international experts ``more familiar
with the laws of the states'' to help them.
	   The letter said Secretary-General Kofi Annan needed more time to
provide Libya with assistance, assuring ``that the two suspects
appear in a court in a neutral third country as soon as possible.''
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the Pan Am bombing, which killed
259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground in
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The council would have to endorse the deal because previous U.N.
resolutions stipulated that the trial take place only in the United
States or the United Kingdom. Libya has refused to turn over the
two suspects, fearing they would not get a fair trial in either
country.
	   The letter said Libya was surprised to learn that the Security
Council was already considering a resolution backing the initiative
and will suspend U.N. sanctions on Libya as soon as the suspects
appear for trial in the Netherlands.
	   The council met Wednesday to resume discussions on the draft.
	   Libya asked for a decision on the resolution to be postponed
until Libya's judicial authorities have studied it.
	   According to the draft, the council will consider additional
sanctions if Libya doesn't promptly turn over Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah for trial. Current sanctions
include an air embargo and curbs on arms sales and on certain
financial and travel activities.
	   In a January letter to the Security Council, Libyan Foreign
Minister Omar al-Muntasser said his government would agree to a
trial by Scottish judges in accordance with Scottish law. He
specified that the trial should be at the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, in the Netherlands.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid,
said Libya would probably accept the deal because it was
``compatible with previous suggestions, which Libya has accepted.''
	   The resolution also says that sanctions will only be suspended
once Libya satisfies a French investigation into the bombing of UTA
flight 772, which exploded over the Niger desert on Sept. 19, 1989,
killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere said last year that Libyan
officials' cooperation ``satisfied most of the French demands.''

Thai central bank files charges against another finance firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the second time in a week,
Thailand's central bank has filed criminal charges against
executives of a failed finance company accused of financial
wrongdoing.
	   The Bank of Thailand announced Wednesday it has lodged a
criminal complaint against executives of the now defunct Sitca
Investment and Securities, alleging they had siphoned off company
assets and funds for personal benefit.
	   Last Thursday, the central bank accused six executives of
General Finance and Securities of extending 338 million baht (dlrs
8.1 million) of illegal loans. One of those charged was the defunct
company's former chairman and chief executive office, Narongchai
Akrasanee, who served as commerce minister in a previous
government.
	   Sitca and General Finance were among 56 finance companies shut
down by the government last December when they fell into virtual
bankruptcy. Assets of these companies are being liquidated by the
government's Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
	   Central bank assistant governor Rathakorn Nimwattana told
reporters the bank filed charges on Tuesday against Sitca's
president and vice presidents for allegedly misappropriating 415
million baht (dlrs 10 million) in loans from five affiliated
companies in Nov. 1995.
	   Rathakorn said the central bank also alleged some of the SITCA
executives of approving loans even though they didn't have the
power to do so.
	   If found guilty, the SITCA executives could face up to ten years
of imprisonment, Rathakorn said. He declined to name the
executives. Under Thai law, the central bank is not allowed to
disclose names of people suspected of breaking the law until they
are found guilty.
	   The central bank is investigating executives at other commercial
banks and finance companies that made loans to individuals and
companies without sufficient collateral.
	   Rathakorn said he may stop holding press conferences to announce
central bank charges against executives at finance companies and
banks.
	   ``There will be many cases against finance companies,''
Rathakorn said. ``I can't hold a press conference every time it
happens.''
	   The granting of loans to insiders with little or no collateral
seems to have been a common practice with Thai banks and finance
companies before the financial system all but collapsed last year.
	   The government has been struggling since then to restore the
health of the financial sector, its most recent major move coming
earlier this month when it announced a comprehensive restructuring
plan for ailing banks.

Thailand nominates Panichpakdi as candidate to head WTO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPLACES 'Supachai' with 'Panichpakdi' in grafs 6 and 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A deputy prime minister of Thailand has been
nominated by its government as a candidate to become the new chief
of the World Trade Organization, a WTO spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The Thai government wrote to the chairman of the WTO General
Council, Ambassador John Weekes, on Wednesday confirming it is
nominating Supachai Panichpakdi as its official candidate for the
post, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Panichpakdi is the second candidate to formally enter the race
to succeed current WTO director-general and former Italian trade
minister Renato Ruggiero, who has said he intends to leave by April
1, 1999.
	   In July, Canada nominated Roy Maclaren, a senior diplomat and
former trade minister, as its candidate.
	   Panichpakdi wrote to Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai earlier
this month seeking permission to become a candidate, saying he
would represent Asian interests as head of the world's supreme
trade body.
	   Thailand was the first of Asia's former miracle economies to
plunge into crisis last year. Panichpakdi said in his letter to
Chuan that resolving the country's economic problems needed a
global approach.
	   Panichpakdi has said his bid is supported by ministers
representing India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Weekes has asked governments to nominate candidates by October 1
this year. The contest will be decided by consensus.

ministers pledged Wednesday to rout IRA dissidents for the sake of
defending Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   Tony Blair flew to Ashford Castle for two hours of talks with
his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, 11 days after a car bomb
planted by the Real IRA slaughtered 28 people and wounded more than
330 others in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh.
	   Afterward, Ahern and Blair stood shoulder to shoulder in the
County Mayo sunshine and promised to imprison armed opponents of
the Belfast agreement _ an accord that, ironically, offers early
paroles for more than 400 Irish Republican Army members and
pro-British militants.
	   Blair and Ahern expect emergency sessions of their parliaments
in London and Dublin next week to pass new anti-terror laws giving
police a pivotal role in convicting suspected members of outlawed
paramilitary groups.
	   The proposed powers include allowing judges to convict suspects
of belonging to an outlawed group if a senior detective testifies
they do, particularly if the suspects refuse to answer questions
during police interrogation.
	   With Ahern nodding beside him, Blair said such powers were
``tough'' but would enjoy widespread acceptance because the public
would see ``the British and Irish governments marching in step
together, making sure that our measures are complementary with one
another.''
	   Blair emphasized that mainstream armed groups in Northern
Ireland were observing truces and that their political
representatives had endorsed the agreement, struck in Belfast in
April among both governments and eight parties.
	   He said the joint security crackdown was necessary ``to protect
people from this small group of extremists that, as Omagh has
indicated, will not stop at anything in order to wreck the
prospects of peace for everyone else.''
	   British and Irish security forces estimate that the Real IRA _
founded after the IRA command called a truce in July 1997 and
authorized its Sinn Fein party to join the Belfast talks _ contains
50 to 100 members, with senior figures residing in the Irish
Republic.
	   The group began placing car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in
February at a critical juncture in the negotiations, causing
widespread destruction and many injuries but no deaths _ until
Omagh.
	   The group announced Aug. 19 it had ``suspended'' its campaign _
one step short of a formal cease-fire _ in the wake of that attack,
the deadliest in the three-decade history of the Northern Ireland
conflict. Fifty-three people remained hospitalized Wednesday,
including three in critical condition.
	   Responding to media reports that Real IRA commanders had met
secretly Tuesday to discuss their next step, Ahern said his
government demanded a declaration ``that there will be a complete
cessation of all their evil acts.''
	   After their joint statement, the two leaders dined together in
the castle, the former family home of the Guinness brewing dynasty
and now an American-run luxury hotel. The estate lies between Lough
Corrib and Cong, a tourist village made famous by the 1951 John
Wayne-Maureen O'Hara classic movie ``The Quiet Man.''

Civil war reaches Congo's capital

 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The thud and echo of artillery fire
shuddered through empty streets in Congo's capital, where a
three-week-old civil war rumbled Wednesday into the eastern
suburbs.
	   Doctors at Kinshasa's General Hospital said hundreds of fighters
had been wounded or killed.
	   Few pedestrians ventured out past tense soldiers patrolling
deserted neighborhoods _ a dramatic turn around from the scene one
day earlier when crowds of cheering and waving residents welcomed
President Laurent Kabila back to the city.
	   Fighting between government soldiers and rebel forces trying to
oust Kabila raged through the night and only began tapering off in
the afternoon.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi tried to calm a nervous
city, saying the situation was under control. A dusk-to-dawn curfew
was imposed on the city.
	   He described the fighting as an operation by government forces
to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like monkeys'' in the forests
around Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   Soldiers with bullet and shrapnel wounds were pouring into the
General Hospital, said one doctor who asked not to be identified.
	   The artillery and small arms battle, sustained through the
morning, came after a string of defeats in recent days that had
seemingly put the rebels on the defensive in western Congo.
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military.
	   Wednesday's fighting centered around Kinshasa's airport in the
area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke districts, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   The mixed sound of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions
rolled through Kinshasa.
	   Green army helicopters, with gunmen leaning out through side
doors, buzzed back and forth just above the city's rooftops.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled the battle and headed to central
Kinshasa.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
suburbs during the night.
	   Although the government quickly moved to calm fears, Mumengi
also warned city inhabitants to be on guard.
	   ``Since this morning our Congolese forces have been pursuing the
bandits,'' Mumengi said in an unusual live broadcast on Voice of
the People radio. ``Today more than any other day we need to
redouble our efforts against this aggression.''
	   He urged the population to denounce suspected rebel
collaborators.
	   ``This will be a long and popular war. Vigilance. Vigilance,''
he said.
	   Throughout the day, Voice of the People radio broadcast scathing
attacks on neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ both of which have been
accused by Kabila of supporting the rebels with weapons and
soldiers.
	   Roadblocks were erected in key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares.
	   Often at gunpoint, the few vehicles that went out were stopped
and searched.
	   An Organization of African Unity meeting scheduled in Kinshasa
was canceled Wednesday, as was a planned meeting between the
foreign minister and ambassadors.
	   The United States closed its embassy more than a week ago and
many foreign embassies have sent all but essential staff home.
	   The scale of Wednesday's assault was not immediately clear, but
rebel fighters just days before had been on the retreat in a
corridor of land stretching about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from
Kinshasa to the Atlantic coastline.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwean warplanes have been staging air strikes
in support of their troops who were battling the rebels.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor of
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, though it denies the charge.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.

Swiss government rejects move to legalize abortion up to 14 weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government rejected a
recommendation to legalize abortion within the first 14 weeks of
pregnancy, but said Wednesday that the country's 56-year-old
abortion law needs to be changed.
	   Abortion is currently illegal under Swiss law unless the
mother's life is in danger.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said a revised law must take into
account appropriate protection for the unborn child, and said the
proposed 14-week limit didn't satisfy that requirement.
	   Koller said that existing legislation is outdated, with a
growing gap between the law and reality. There have been no
convictions for illegal abortion in more than a decade, he said.
	   Other options remaining open include the possibility of allowing
abortion on legal or social grounds, the cabinet said.
	   Under such a system, a woman would have to undergo
state-approved counseling before deciding to have an abortion.
	   A 1977 referendum that would have allowed abortion within the
first 12 weeks was rejected. But a 1988 vote that would have
strictly forbidden abortions also was defeated. Switzerland is 46
percent Roman Catholic.

Hecht speaks openly on plans for Super League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The man behind plans to create a breakaway
European soccer super league says the project is close to reality
and he's confident the competition will kick off by 2000.
	   Rodolfo Hecht, president of Media Partners, the Milan-based
marketing company, outlined his proposals to leading European clubs
this week in London.
	   ``Now I definitely have the confidence and the mandate from the
clubs,'' he said in interviews published Wednesday in British
newspapers.
	   The 38-year-old Italian businessman gave further details of the
project which would revolutionize European club soccer.
	   The basic proposal is for a European Football League (EFL)
comprising 32 teams in two divisions.
	   Under the plan, 16 ``founder members'' will be invited to join
the league based on their peformance over the past decade.
	   The 16 candidates so far are: Arsenal, Manchester United and
Liverpool from England's Premier League; Italian giants Juventus,
Inter Milan and AC Milan; Germany's Bayern Munich and Borussia
Dortmund; Spain's Barcelona and Real Madrid; Dutch club Ajax;
Marseille and Paris St. Germain of France; Benfica of Portugal;
Panathanaikos of Greece, and Galatasaray of Turkey.
	   The founder members would be guaranteed a place in the league on
a three-year basis, renewable subject to performance.
	   The other 16 sides will qualify on season by season performances
in the respective national domestic leagues.
	   A second competition _ a Pro Cup _ would involve another 56
teams, including at least six from England, in a knock-out style
competition similar to the UEFA Cup.
	   Hecht said each team in the EFL would be guaranteed nearly 20
million pounds (dlrs 32.8 million) for taking part.
	   Games are expected to be played on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays, with each team involved in a minimum 15 games and a
maximum 22 games _ including playoffs.
	   Hecht said he waited to go public with EFL plans until the
concept was finalized. He said he now had ``absolute confidence''
the league would begin in 2000.
	   Hecht said he was confident he would get the support of UEFA,
European soccer's governing body, but UEFA is expected to combat
the breakaway league by reforming its own competition.
	   UEFA's Committee for Professional Football, comprising the
chiefs of Europe's major domestic leagues, met in Geneva on Tuesday
and announced its opposition to the super league project.
	   At a special meeting in Monaco on Saturday, UEFA is expected to
confirm the proposed expansion of the Champions League and a merger
of the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup to try to head off the super
league.
	   Hecht rejected criticism that clubs from smaller European
countries would miss out on the spoils of international competition
if the super league replaced the UEFA-run competitions.
	   ``We have no desire to exclude anyone,'' he said. ``It is the
clubs that are leading this.''
	   Hecht, the son of film producer Gianni Hecht, who won an Oscar
in the 1970s for The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, started Media
Partners in 1992.
	   He was involved in the first pay-per-view soccer deal in Europe,
which was approved by the Italian League in 1996.
	   His business links extend to media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, a
former Italian Premier who owns AC Milan. Hecht worked for the
holding company in Berlusconi's media enterprise.
	   He said Berlusconi was not involved in EFL at this stage,
although he probably could be involved in the future, as most of
the revenue for the competition would be raised through television.
	   Hecht said he had already made contact with leading
broadcasters, including Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.
	   He said broadcasters were lining up to pay ``far in excess'' of
what they pay for UEFA games.
	   ``UEFA have not maximized clubs' potential,'' he said. ``We wnat
to raise it to a different level.''

Controversy deepens as newspaper prints three new diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The controversy surrounding five
new pages of Anne Frank's famed diary deepened Wednesday when a
newspaper published what it called excerpts, prompting the
foundation holding the copyright to call in its lawyers.
	   Het Parool, an Amsterdam daily, ran the text from three diary
pages on its front page next to a large photograph of the teen-age
Jewish diarist who hid with her family from the Nazis.
	   The excerpts accompanied a story claiming that Anne never wanted
her writings published in the first place.
	   The purported diary entries contained criticisms of her parents'
marriage, speculating that her father, Otto, did not really love
her mother, Edith.
	   The Anne Frank Fund, based in Basel, Switzerland, and holder of
the copyright to Anne's internationally best-selling diary,
declined to comment on their publication.
	   ``The case is in the hands of our lawyers,'' said Pierre Loewe
of the fund.
	   The newspaper was unrepentant.
	   ``We think the whole subject is news and there is no copyright
on news,'' said Het Parool's deputy editor, Frits Campagne. ``If
they send their lawyers we will ask our lawyers to answer them.''
	   Campagne refused to say how the newspaper obtained the pages.
Their existence was revealed last week by startled World War II
scholars who thought they'd managed to publish a complete version
of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   Citing one of the pages, Het Parool said Anne wrote she ``would
make sure nobody got their hands on'' the diary.
	   David Barnouw, a spokesman for the Netherlands State Institute
for War Documentation, dismissed the claim and noted that Anne had
written often about her aspirations of becoming a journalist.
	   ``She is like any girl contradicting herself in her diary,''
Barnouw said Wednesday. ``Her idea about becoming a famous writer,
that is the part Otto Frank found more compelling, and I think he
is right.''
	   Since its first publication in 1947, the diary has become a
best-selling modern literary classic translated into dozens of
languages.
	   The five pages have caused a storm in the Netherlands this week.
	   On Tuesday, longtime Frank family friend and confidante Cor
Suijk, who insists that Otto Frank gave him the pages before his
death in 1980, demanded that proceeds from their publication should
go to his Holocaust awareness crusade in the United States.
	   Suijk, a former employee of the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank
Foundation, now works for the Anne Frank Center USA in New York. He
admitted to having the pages earlier this month.
	   The war documentation center, which plans to include the pages
in a new edition of the diary, also has a lawyer helping it obtain
the pages.
	   ``I'm confident we'll get the pages,'' Barnouw said.
	   Anne's diary trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks
were betrayed and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Starving and
freezing, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks
before the camp was liberated in the spring of 1945.

 &UR; With South Africa-Explosion

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Wednesday condemned the bombing of a
Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town and offered to help the
South African authorities track down the bombers.
	   Among the victims was an 8-year-old British girl, Laura
Giddings, one of a family of six caught up in the Tuesday night
bombing. Her left foot was amputated.
	   ``I offer my deepest sympathies to the government of South
Africa and to the victims of this outrage and their families,''
said Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd.
	   ``There can be no justification for this cowardly attack on
innocent people. We stand ready to offer any assistance that the
South Africans might need in tracking down those responsible.''
	   The Giddings family, from Southampton, England, had taken the
children to Planet Hollywood as a treat, Laura's grandmother Iris
Giddings, the only member of the family who was not injured, said.
	   Laura's brother, Jacob, 3, is in intensive care with spinal
injuries, and her parents, Tony, 38, and Mandy, 35, and grandfather
Brian Giddings, 65, have shrapnel wounds.
	   The Giddings, on holiday in South Africa, had taken the children
to Planet Hollywood as a treat on Tuesday evening.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Mrs. Giddings, 65, was quoted as
saying in a telephone interview with the British news agency Press
Association. ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as
the ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us.''
	   ``I was knocked down and saw my family all lying injured before
me,'' she added. ``It was one of the most terrible things I could
imagine seeing _ there was absolute chaos and my family were all
terribly hurt before me.''
	   South Africa's security minister said Wednesday the bombing,
which killed one person and injured 27, was an apparent retaliation
for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Mrs. Giddings said she and her husband had fallen in love with
South Africa on previous trips and this year invited their son and
his family along too on vacation.
	   ``We wanted to show them just what it was like,'' she said. ``On
all our previous visits we have found everybody so welcoming and
obliging and we wanted to show them that.
	   ``We had been to a park outside Cape Town to look at the flowers
and plants which are part of South Africa's tremendous natural
beauty. Then we went to Cape Town for what supposed to be a
pleasant night out.''

Report: Japanese schoolboy poisoned with mailed medicine sample
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A junior high school student in Tokyo fell ill
Wednesday after taking a poisonous sample of disinfectant disguised
as ``diet medicine'' that was mailed to his house, a news report
said.
	   Seventeen other students and a teacher at the boy's school
received similar mail, Kyodo News agency reported citing school
officials, but apparently none of them ingested the poison.
	   The 15-year-old boy was taken to a hospital after complaining of
a sore throat, but his condition was not dangerous, the report
said, citing police.
	   Police were not available for comment late Wednesday.
	   The case came as investigators were still looking into the fatal
poisoning of four people at a community picnic in western Japan
where arsenic was mixed into pots of curry.
	   It also coincides with a case in the United States, where a
woman has been accused of mailing cyanide packets disguised as
nutritional supplements to at least eight people.
	   In the Japanese case, the mailed substance was a cresol used as
a disinfectant. The brown ``medicine'' was contained in a small 20
milliliter-30 milliliter plastic bottle sent in the mail, police
said.
	   The mail included a letter that said: ``This is a free sample of
a medicine called `more slender,' and promises a beautiful body
when taken immediately after opening,'' Kyodo reported.
	   The package also included phoney information, including the name
of a shop supposedly selling the medicine and a phone number.

Oasis star follows in Beatles footsteps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oasis star Noel Gallagher often is accused of
ripping off the Beatles' sound on his band's records.
	   Now, he's taking it one step further: He'll be emulating his
idols when he makes his movie debut.
	   Gallagher will make a very brief appearance in the movie ``Mad
Cows,'' walking across the famous Abbey Road crossing which
featured on the cover of the Beatles' 1969 album of the same name.
	   The movie, which begins filming next month, is based on the
novel by Kathy Lette, which chronicles the comic adventures of an
Australian visitor to London who ends up in jail after being caught
shoplifting in Harrods.
	   Gallagher's wife, Meg Matthews, also will take a cameo role in
the film, directed by their friend, Sara Sugarman.

Three British athletes face ban for drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Confirms English athletes 6th graf, adds England CGC quotes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English track cyclist Gary Edwards was suspended
from the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday after failing a drug test
and two British weighlifters also faced possible doping bans.
	   The British Cycling Federation said Edwards, 32, had been
suspended from the English team for next month's Commonwealth Games
in Kuala Lumpur after failing an out-of-competition test.
	   ``The suspension follows a finding which warrants further
investigation, not possible in the short period involved before the
games commence,'' the statement said.
	   The random tests were conducted by the UK Sports Council on
hundreds of athletes preparing for the Commonwealth Games.
	   Representatives of the English and Welsh Commonwealth Games
Councils confirmed that two English athletes and one Welsh
competitor had ``adverse findings'' to the doping tests.
	   An English Commonwealth Games Council spokeswoman confirmed
Wednesday the English athletes were Edwards and weightlifter Paul
Supple.
	   ``We have to be notified by the relevant sporting bodies that
the athletes are guilty under their rules,'' she said. ``When we
receive that notification, the athletes are banned for life under
English Commonwealth Games Council rules.''
	   ``Currently neither athlete is banned by the Council because we
have not received official notification,'' she added.
	   ``In some sports, an athlete is not considered guilty after an
A-sample is opened and can continue competing until the B-sample
finding is released.''
	   The Times and Daily Mail newspapers identified the Welsh athlete
as weightlifter Andrew Goswell.
	   Edwards and Supple, 1996 British 94-kilogram-class weightlifting
champion, were found to have excess levels of testosterone in the
A-samples of their urine specimens, the Times reported.
	   Supple denied using performing enhancing drugs.
	   ``I cannot say anything expect that I have never taken drugs in
my life,'' he was quoted as saying in the Times.
	   The Times reported Goswell's sample allegedly showed traces of
the anabolic steroid Stanozolol _ the same drug Canadian 100-meter
sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for before he was stripped of
100-meter gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
	   Testing of the three B-sample specimens will be undertaken at
the International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in
London. If the tests confirm the A-samples, the athletes face bans
of two or more years.
	   The UK Sports Council conducted the doping tests to avoid a
repeat of drugs scandals which have plagued British teams at major
international championships in the 1990s.
	   In 1990, defending Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion
Dean Willey returned a positive doping test before the Games and
was dropped from the English team. Two Welsh weightlifters tested
positive in Aukland and were sent home.
	   In 1992 a sprinter and two weightlifters were sent home from the
Barcelona Olympics after failing pre-games tests.
	   In 1994 Paul Edwards and Diane Modahl were sent back from the
Commonwealth Games in Canada, although Modahl later won an appeal
and is currently taking legal action against the British Athletics
Federation for compensation.

Rangers threaten to file protest against PAOK Salonica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Rangers may lodge a protest with
Europe's governing body over the behavior of Greek fans in
Tuesday's UEFA Cup qualifying match in Salonica.
	   Rangers drew 0-0 in the second-leg game and advanced on a 2-0
aggregate to the first round of the UEFA Cup. Officials of the
Scottish club said they were bombarded during the game by a barrage
of objects apparently thrown by PAOK Salonica supporters.
	   Chief executive Bob Brannan said he sat amid a contingent of
Glasgow supporters and would decide in the next few days whether to
file a protest with UEFA.
	   ``It was scary, not at all a pleasant experience,'' he told the
Glasgow Evening Times. ``We were subjected to all sorts of
missiles.
	   ``A flare was thrown, pieces of fencing were aimed at us,
bottles were thrown, and coins were coming down throughout the 90
minutes. We could have sat in the main stand and distanced
ourselves from this but we thought it was the proper thing to do.''
	   Brannan said Rangers fans were well behaved.

Report: Hull says Hitler had some good ideas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former NHL star Bobby Hull told a Russian
newspaper that Nazis were not without merit, that the black
population of the United States was growing too fast, and that
genetic breeding was a worthy idea.
	   ``Hitler, for example, had some good ideas. He just went a
little bit too far,'' the Hall of Fame player told the
English-language Moscow Times newspaper.
	   The former Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets star also said
the Canadian government was too left-wing and was giving welfare
payments to people who don't deserve them, the Moscow Times
reported on Tuesday.
	   Asked if it would be fair to describe him as a racist, Hull
reportedly replied: ``I don't give a damn. I'm not running for any
political office.''
	   Hull, 59, gave the interview last week while in Russia as a
guest of the organizers of the annual Spartak hockey tournament.
	   Hull also touched on his relationship with his son, Brett, who
recently signed a free agent contract with the Dallas Stars. It's
been said the relationship has been strained for years. But Hull
said they were close.
	   ``He is a very loyal kid,'' Hull reportedly said. ``Maybe he is
not as strong mentally as I was and can't always follow through on
his decisions.''
	   It was Hull's first visit to the former Soviet Union since 1976,
when the Jets played in the Izvestia Cup. He also played for the
World Hockey Association version of Team Canada when it visited
Russia in 1974.
	   Hull, who scored 610 goals during 16 NHL seasons and twice won
the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player, said that the
``biggest disappointment of his life'' was not being allowed to
play in the 1972 Canada-Soviet series, which only used NHL players.
	   ``I wanted to play more than anything else. But those big NHL
heads decided to pay me back,'' said Hull, who had 303 goals in
seven seasons in the WHA after leaving the NHL after the 1971-72
season.
	   The lengthy report on Hull's visit appeared beside a photograph
of him and former Russian hockey player Alexander Yakushev.
	   Hull, who grew up on a farm near Belleville and still breeds
cattle, toured a collective farm in Russia and visited St.
Petersburg.
	   ``I played the way I live _ straightforward,'' Hull said in the
interview. ``I have no regrets about anything I did in life.''
	   However, if he had to do it all again, he reportedly laughed and
said, ``Maybe I'd drink a bit more.''

Report: Israel planned to assassinate Arafat 30 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Inspired by an Oscar-winning psychological
thriller about an assassination, Israel's intelligence agency tried
30 years ago to brainwash a Palestinian into killing PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   According to the Haaretz newspaper, Benjamin Shalit, then chief
psychologist for the Israeli navy, got the idea from the 1962 film
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' in which an American prisoner of war
in Korea is brainwashed, programmed to kill and returned to the
United States to assassinate a powerful politician.
	   Haaretz said Shalit spent three months hypnotizing a captured
Palestinian faithful to Arafat's Fatah organization to carry out
the assassination.
	   Mossad agents then equipped the candidate with a small radio and
sent him to Jordan to allegedly wait for instructions to be
broadcast on the radio at an appointed time, giving him the go
ahead to kill Arafat.
	   But higher ups in the Mossad, apparently doubtful that the
psychological route would yield results and anticipating the
radio's turnover to Arafat, rigged the radio and planned to explode
it by wireless remote at the appointed broadcast time.
	   But both the radio and the psychology failed.
	   On Israel Radio, Ronen Bergman, the Haaretz reporter who wrote
the story, said Wednesday that the candidate immediately reported
his entire experience to Palestinian leaders in Jordan and showed
them the radio. Arafat listened to the radio, curious as to how the
Mossad would try to contact the candidate. But the explosive device
in the radio failed to detonate, the reporter said.
	   Bergman said a former Mossad agent involved in the plot told him
that after 30 years and a change in Israeli policy recognizing the
Palestinian leader, he would be happy to apologize to Arafat.

Palestinian flagmaker supplies authorities and demonstrators

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Mansour Akrouk's best work goes up in
smoke and he isn't entirely unhappy about that.
	   The 29-year old Palestinian makes flags and his biggest clients
are Palestinian protesters who like to burn them at rallies.
	   Akrouk said Wednesday that he started his flag business in 1994,
when the brand-new Palestinian Authority needed flags for its
ministries.
	   But he soon found another outlet for his flags - Palestinian
demonstrations.
	   It means he might be among the first to know when a group like
the Islamic militant Hamas is going to stage a demonstration. Hamas
leaders order the flags, Israeli and American, in advance.
	   Mansour knows the flags are meant for burning. He says that
makes his work doubly hard. ``I feel bad when I make the Israeli
and American flags,'' he says. ``The Israelis are our enemy, and
the Americans support Israel. And I know my hard work will be
wasted after a few minutes.''
	   But that doesn't stop him from doing business with the
demonstrators, even anticipating their next target. After the
United States bombed alleged terror targets in Aghanistan and
Sudan, Mansour quickly stitched together Sudanese and Pakistani
flags to be carried by militants in support rallies, along with the
usual supply of American flags for burning.

Libya asks for more time to study Lockerbie trial offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RAISE context, ADDS Scottish counsel
questioning details of proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya has asked the U.N. Security Council
to delay any decision on a U.S.-British proposal to try two
suspects in the Pan Am bombing in the Netherlands until it can
study the proposal further, according to a letter made public
Wednesday.
	   The letter, from the Libyan deputy ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg,
was dated Aug. 25 and represented the first official reaction from
Tripoli on the proposal. Further comment was expected later
Wednesday out of Libya itself.
	   ``Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned,'' the letter said.
	   But it said Libya's judicial authorities need more time to study
the proposal and requested international experts ``more familiar
with the laws of the states'' help them.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States had insisted
the trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if found guilty, they would
serve their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The resolution threatened other sanctions if Libya does not
produce the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   The Libyan letter said Secretary-General Kofi Annan needed more
time to provide Libya with assistance to bring the two to trial,
which the United States and Britain had requested.
	   As a result, Libya asks that ``a decision on the draft
resolution presented to the Security Council be postponed until
Libya's judicial authorities have completed their study.''
	   Such a delay would ensure ``that the two suspects appear in a
court in a neutral third country as soon as possible,'' the letter
said, adding that Libya was surprised that the council was already
considering a resolution on the issue.
	   The council must endorse the deal because previous U.N.
resolutions stipulated that the trial take place only in the United
States or the United Kingdom.
	   In Britain, Alistair Duff, a Scottish counsel for the Libyans,
says in Wednesday's The Guardian that some issues have not been
addressed.
	   ``Where are the suspects going to be held in custody? Are they
going to be guaranteed safe passage to and, in the event of
acquittal, from, the trial?'' he was quoted as saying in the
newspaper.
	   The draft resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere last year said Libyan
officials gave cooperation in his investigation that ``satisfied
most of the French demands.''

New report says Abu Nidal in Egypt; foreign minister denies it

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A high-ranking Palestinian official said
Wednesday that the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal has been detained
in Egypt, but the country's foreign minister denied the report.
	   The Palestinian's statement follows nearly two weeks of similar
claims, all denied by Egyptian security officials who spoke
anonymously. The comment by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is the
first denial by an Egyptian official speaking publicly.
	   The interest in Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of struggle'' _
comes because of his notoriety for his daring attacks on Israelis
and even Palestinians whom he opposed, and for the mystery
surrounding him.
	   He was once considered the world's most dangerous terrorist. He
is reported to have died several times _ only to reappear _ and to
have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   In recent days, several Palestinian officials insisting on
anonymity have told news organizations, including The Associated
Press, that Abu Nidal was either jailed or hospitalized with
leukemia. None, however, has offered proof he was in the country.
	   On Wednesday, a leading Palestinian official _ again speaking on
condition of anonymity _ said the onetime guerrilla whose real name
is Sabri al-Banna was arrested five weeks ago coming from Libya.
	   He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the 61-year-old
Palestinian to leave or if Abu Nidal's own people were trying to
smuggle him out through Egypt to another country.
	   Abu Nidal is near death and being treated in a hospital, but is
in effect in detention by Egyptian officials, the official
contended.
	   He theorized Egypt is denying the arrest because it does not
know what to do with Abu Nidal and fears revealing his arrest could
make Egypt the target of anger by other terrorists.
	   Hours later, Moussa issued his public denial. He was asked about
reports Tuesday and Wednesday by American newspapers and
broadcasters which quoted U.S. and Arab officials as saying Abu
Nidal had been arrested by Egyptian police.
	   ``Abu Nidal is not in Egypt,'' Moussa replied. He did not expand
on the statement.
	   In Washington, the State Department's intelligence and
counterterrorism offices could not confirm reports of Abu Nidal's
arrest. ``We just don't know,'' a U.S. official said.
	   Abu Nidal's group has been listed by the U.S. State Department
as ``the most dangerous terrorist organization.'' It has been
blamed for killing 300 people and wounding more than 650 in 20
countries since 1973.
	   He is said to have operated out of Syria, Iraq and Libya at
various times. However, most of the incidents blamed on Abu Nidal
occurred years ago, and he is now believed to have only a few
hundred followers, mostly in Lebanon.
	   Born in Jaffa in then-Palestine in 1937, Abu Nidal's main
targets have been Israelis. But he also was blamed for killing some
of Yasser Arafat's chief aides after he split with the PLO leader,
claiming he was not keeping up the struggle against Israel.
	   The terrorist leader is not wanted in the United States, though
he has been blamed for blowing up two American airliners: a Pan Am
jet on the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in 1974 in the
air over the Aegean Sea. The combined death toll was 120.
	   His most famous attacks were the twin assaults on ticket
counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna airports
on Dec. 27, 1985. Eighteen people were killed and 120 wounded.

Russia praises, criticizes Latvia on touchy citizenship law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAESTERAAS, Sweden (AP) _ Underlining the potentially incendiary
tensions between Latvia and the Kremlin, Russia's deputy foreign
minister veered from conciliation to criticism Wednesday of
Latvia's effort to make citizenship easier for stateless ethnic
Russians.
	   At a news conference at the end of a regional foreign ministers'
meeting, Aleksandr Avdeyev began by expressing confidence in
Latvia's commitment to changing naturalization laws that left
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians stateless after Latvia
became independent in 1991.
	   Then, showing increasing agitation, he said proposed law changes
contained provisions that raised doubts about the government's
sincerity.
	   ``Latvia will still have to do a lot to improve political and
civil rights,'' he said.
	   The issue has been a longtime irritant between Latvia and its
giant neighbor, escalating this spring into Kremlin threats to
impose economic sanctions on Latvia _ which conducts about 20
percent of its foreign trade with Russia.
	   Latvians still sensitive to the memories of a half-century of
Soviet occupation also were concerned by the outbursts of harsh
rhetoric from nationalist Russian politicians in the spring,
including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's cocontention that Latvia was
committing ``genocide'' against ethnic Russians.
	   The spring escalation of tensions gave new momentum to Latvian
politicians who favored changing the citizenship laws and they
succeeded in pushing changes through Parliament in June.
	   However, Latvian nationalists started a petition drive to hold a
referendum on the changes. The electoral commission is expected to
rule by Friday on whether enough signatures were collected to force
a plebiscite.
	   Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs said his government
would campaign strongly for the changes if a referendum is held and
Avdeyev thanked him for that assurance.
	   But he then launched into a long criticism of the proposed
changes, specifically of an amendment to allow automatic
citizenship for all children born of stateless parents in Latvia
since independence.
	   He noted that the proposed change requires that a citizen have
no criminal record for five years, and since the children in
question would be no more than seven years old, that provision
implied that the naturalization process would drag on for years.
	   Plus, he said, the proposed change requires that parents of such
children bring them up in a spirit of Latvian patriotism, even
though some 10,000 ethnic Russians in Latvia still consider
themselves Soviet citizens.
	   ``These people, too, have small children'' and could not be
expected to rear them as patriots, Avdeyev said heatedly.
	   A source close to the meeting said Avdeyev's public statement
was harsher than the conciliatory tone he had taken during the
ministers' closed-door sessions.
	   Birkavs, asked if he was surprised by Avdeyev's public posture,
said he had long experience of dealing with the Kremlin and ``It's
not so easy to disturb me.''
	   The meeting in Vaesteraas, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest
of Stockholm, also included foreign ministers of the Nordic
countries and Lithuania and Estonia.

Keane returns to international soccer for Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Roy Keane, who missed most of last season
due to a cruciate ligament injury, was selected Wednesday in
Ireland's 22-man squad for the European Championship qualifying
match against Croatia in Dublin on Sept. 5.
	   The Manchester United midfielder returned to action with United
this season and is expected to play a crucial role in Ireland's
Euro campaign starting against Croatia, the team which finished
third at the World Cup in France in July.
	   Ireland coach Mick McCarthy said he couldn't stress how
important it was to have Keane back on the team.
	   ``He is regarded as one of the best in Europe and the world, and
we don't have many of those,'' he said.
	   ``Each game he has had since his comeback has given him more
confidence. Back playing international football will be another
step up the ladder.''
	   McCarthy also recalled Norwich forward Keith O'Neill and
veterans Ray Houghton and Tony Cascarino.
	   McCarthy said he was confident his Irish side could beat Croatia
in its first qualifying game for the 2000 European Championship in
Belgium and the Netherlands.
	   ``At home we have the ability to cause problems for anybody.
Croatia is a good side but we can beat them because we have a
strong squad and are an improving team,'' he said.
	   Ireland's second Euro clash is against Yugoslavia in Belgrave on
Oct. 10.

Bosnia may request return of part of Montenegrin coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIRSAD BEHRAM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hinting at another possible
territorial dispute, a Bosnian official announced Wednesday his
government may request the return of a small part of the Adriatic
coast lost to Montenegro during Communist rule.
	   ``Very soon the time will come when politicians will request
restitution of the territory of post-1945 Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' the
leader of the Bosnian Liberal Party, Rasim Kadic, told The
Associated Press.
	   He referred to just a few miles of coastline called Sutorina,
now part of neighboring Montenegro. Bosnia is struggling to gain
access to the Adriatic coast and is interested in every mile.
	   In 1718, it received two small parts of the coast as a gift from
the then Dubrovnik Republic, Sutorina: south of Dubrovnik and Neum
north of it.
	   This territorial gift was confirmed by the Berlin Congress in
1878, where European powers gathered to define borders.
	   Sutorina and Neum remained part of Bosnia-Herzegovina until
after World War II. But one of the Communist officials gave
Sutorina to Montenegro without the approval of the Bosnian
parliament.
	   Since they say they were illegally deprived of part of their
territory, some Bosnian politicians consider requesting it be
returned.
	   Kadic said at present the Sutorina issue is still on the level
of media speculation.
	   But, he predicted, ``the time is coming when politicians will
seize upon this idea ... and request restitution of the
territory.''
	   ``It will be very difficult, but I think we should insist on
it,'' Kadic said.

Famous British perfume maker ends up in receivership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Yardley, perfumers to Britain for two centuries,
was placed Wednesday under the control of receivers who will try to
sell the company to partially repay debts accumulated since a 1990s
takeover.
	   Yardley and Co. Ltd. and its parent, Old Bond Street Holding Co.
Ltd., are now being run by accountants from the firm KPMG who
promised to move quickly to try to clean up the financial mess.
	   Yardley had no immediate comment after the receivers moved in
and said they would look for a buyer to take over the company as a
going concern.
	   ``We expect Yardley's brands to be highly attractive,'' said
Tony Thompson, a KPMG partner appointed as one of the receivers.
	   ``In recent years, Yardley has been unable to fully develop its
brands due to cash constraints. This receivership offers the
opportunity for the right buyer to acquire them and unleash their
potential.''
	   The accountants said major international consumer products
companies were high on their list of potential purchasers, but they
wouldn't discuss any names or say how much money they believe
Yardley might fetch.
	   The proceeds from the purchase would be used to partially pay
off Yardley's creditors.
	   The British news agency Press Association said Yardley's debts
came to 120 million pounds (dlrs 195 million) _ but a KPMG
spokesman could not immediately confirm that figure.
	   The receivers were not immediately able to say why Yardley got
into trouble, although they said the debts had been increasing for
several years, making it difficult for the company to find any way
to bounce back.
	   Yardley was founded in 1770 and became famous for perfumes,
powders and body lotions made from lavender, English rose and
spring flower.
	   The company evolved in recent years _ including its association
with the 1960s model Twiggy _ and increased its product line to
include bright lipsticks and nail polish.
	   Yardley employs 300 workers and has a manufacturing plant in
Basildon, England, along with operations spreading through
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police Wednesday were closing in
on suspects in the fatal bombing of a Planet Hollywood, which
authorities said probably was the target of home-grown terrorists
aiming at the United States.
	   ``I am confident they will be arrested soon,'' South African
Press Association quoted President Nelson Mandela as saying.
	   The explosion Tuesday evening at the crowded tourist spot, on
Cape Town's trendy and spectacular waterfront, killed a South
African bank employee and injured 27 people -- including eight
Britons. The identities of the other victims were not immediately
known.
	   A pair of FBI agents headed to the site from Nairobi to help in
the investigation.
	   The blast prompted the nation's intelligence officials to
scrutinize security at American businesses and government offices,
said police spokeswoman Supt. Sally de Beer.
	   U.S. companies like McDonald's boosted protective measures.
	   ``Staff carried out visible inspections and we brought in the
local police to take a more expert look at the restaurants,'' said
the restaurant chain's managing director in South Africa, Darryl
Webb.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the Planet Hollywood
bombing came from a caller to a radio station who said he
represented the anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims
Against Global Oppression.
	   But a leader of the South African organization on Wednesday
repudiated the claim and condemned the blast, saying it was an
attempt to discredit Muslims.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the bombing
``must be seen against the backdrop'' of the U.S. cruise-missile
attacks, themselves retaliation for the bombings earlier this month
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   It appeared the blast came from a pipe bomb, Mandela spokesman
Parks Mankahlana said. That ``might be an indication that we are
not dealing with an international network but a local group,'' he
said.
	   Pipe bombs are the favored weapon of a Muslim vigilante group
called People Against Drugs and Gangsterism, which has targeted
suspected gangsters and drug dealers in the area.
	   Meanwhile, 11 Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders hung bouquets
of red and white roses onto coils of barbed wire erected around the
wrecked restaurant.
	   ``None of our religions condones this barbarism,'' said a
black-robed Mohammed Moerat, a Muslim religious leader. ``Such
despicable actions can only serve to turn all people of good will
against the perpetrators.''
	   South Africa has nearly 500,000 Muslims, or slightly more than 1
percent of the population. Most are descendants of Malays brought
as slaves from what is now Indonesia by the Dutch colonists of the
Cape. A small number of radicals maintains a vocal presence --
protesting a stop by President Clinton to Cape Town in March and
pushing for a visit by the leader of the militant Palestinian group
Hamas.
	   Among the injured were five members of a family from Hampshire,
England, including an 8-year-old girl who lost a foot and her
3-year-old brother, in intensive care with spine injuries.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' family member Iris Giddings, 65, was
quoted as saying by the British news agency Press Association.
	   ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as the
ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us. I was knocked down
and saw my family all lying injured before me. It was one of the
most terrible things I could imagine seeing.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Wednesday condemned the bombing of a
Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town and offered to help the
South African authorities track down the bombers.
	   Among the victims was an 8-year-old British girl, Laura
Giddings, one of a family of six caught up in the Tuesday night
bombing. Her left foot was amputated.
	   ``I offer my deepest sympathies to the government of South
Africa and to the victims of this outrage and their families,''
said Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd.
	   ``There can be no justification for this cowardly attack on
innocent people. We stand ready to offer any assistance that the
South Africans might need in tracking down those responsible.''
	   The Giddings family, from Southampton, England, had taken the
children to Planet Hollywood as a treat, Laura's grandmother Iris
Giddings, the only member of the family who was not injured, said.
	   Laura's brother, Jacob, 3, is in intensive care with spinal
injuries, and her parents, Tony, 38, and Mandy, 35, and grandfather
Brian Giddings, 65, have shrapnel wounds.
	   ``We had just arrived and were being shown our seats when the
whole place was torn apart,'' Mrs. Giddings, 65, was quoted as
saying in a telephone interview with the British news agency Press
Association. ``There was a flash and then everything went dark as
the ceilings and walls seem to come down upon us.''
	   ``I was knocked down and saw my family all lying injured before
me,'' she added. ``It was one of the most terrible things I could
imagine seeing _ there was absolute chaos and my family were all
terribly hurt before me.''
	   South Africa's security minister said Wednesday the bombing,
which killed one person and injured 27, was an apparent retaliation
for U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Mrs. Giddings said she and her husband had fallen in love with
South Africa on previous trips and this year invited their son and
his family along too on vacation.
	   ``We wanted to show them just what it was like,'' she said. ``On
all our previous visits we have found everybody so welcoming and
obliging and we wanted to show them that.
	   ``We had been to a park outside Cape Town to look at the flowers
and plants which are part of South Africa's tremendous natural
beauty. Then we went to Cape Town for what supposed to be a
pleasant night out.''

Bulgaria reassures Greece that Kozlodui nuclear plant is safe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Bulgaria Wednesday tried to convince
Greece that its Kozlodui nuclear plant does not pose a threat to
the region.
	   ``The nuclear station's security level is being constantly
upgraded. During its use, there has not been a single accident,''
said Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, here on a one-day visit.
	   He made the comment after giving Premier Costas Simitis a report
which includes safety programs for the plant's six reactors and
Bulgaria's official position on the issue. Greece has voiced
concerns that the nuclear reactors are unsafe and fears it could be
affected by a potential accident there.
	   ``The rare incidents which have been referred to never concerned
a radioactive leak with consequences to human health and the
pollution of the environment,'' Kostov added.
	   The report will be reviewed by the Greek Atomic Committee, which
will examine any possible problems, Simitis said.
	   ``The main interest of both sides is securing the safety of the
populations, and ... this is what we will work for,'' he added.
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, comprises four 440-megawatt pressurized water reactors
without safety encasement. They were started up between 1974 and
1982.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units with encasement were installed in
1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as a safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and repeatedly balked at calls from the
West to close them down. The plant provides some 40 percent of the
country's electricity.
	   Kostov and Simitis also discussed the opening of a proposed oil
pipeline, linking the ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and
Alexandroupolis in northern Greece. The project would allow Russia
to export oil through the Black Sea while bypassing the Bosporus.
	   They stressed that the pipeline is a private business enterprise
and not a government project, although both governments are
particularly interested in its realization.
	   ``We believe both sides have the same interests in the
realization of this project ... and will do everything possible to
promote it,'' Kostov said.
	   Bulgarian officials are to discuss the issue in Russia Thursday,
the two premiers said, and any problems arising from these talks
will be examined.
	   Simitis added that the two also discussed the establishment of a
25-kilometer trade-free zone on either side of the border.

Angola committed to keeping Congo leader in power, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's Interior Minister said
Wednesday his country will use all means at its disposal to keep
Congolese President Laurent Kabila in power, according to news
reports.
	   Minister Santana Pitra said Angola's military involvement in
neighboring Congo, where it has deployed troops, armor and aircraft
to aid Kabila against insurgents, was prompted by concerns about
security along its northern frontier, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa reported.
	   ``The border would be more unstable than ever if Angola didn't
have the capacity for internal defense and external offense,'' Lusa
quoted Pitra as saying.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war was prompted by government
concerns that Kabila's departure could usher in a new
administration sympathetic to the Angolan former rebel movement
UNITA.
	   UNITA fought a two-decade civil war with the government before
signing a fragile peace accord in 1994.
	   After seizing power last year with Angola's help, Kabila agreed
to cut off UNITA's supply lines between the two countries that
allowed UNITA to smuggle out diamonds and bring in military
equipment, according to the government.
	   However, Pitra said Angola would remain in Congo only as long as
other member countries of the Southern African Development
Community were also involved. Zimbabwe has also sent troops to to
buttress Kabila's forces.
	   Pitra was speaking in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa
where he was attending Guinea-Bissau's peace talks.
	   In Luanda, a source at the military hospital, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said troops wounded in the Congo fighting
were being treated there. However, he declined to say how many had
been admitted, nor would he disclose their nationality.
	   After its weekly Cabinet meeting Wednesday, the government did
not comment on the war in Congo.

Swiss firm says stolen erotic watches found after four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAUDEX, Switzerland (AP) _ German police have recovered 29
erotic watches, some dating from the 17th century, which were
stolen from a Munich museum four years ago, their Swiss
manufacturer said Wednesday.
	   The antique timepieces from the Blancpain firm's collection were
stolen in 1994 in an overnight break-in at the Deutsches Museum in
Munich, where the collection was being exhibited.
	   The thieves broke into the museum by climbing over the roof and
smashing windows, and made a fast getaway with the watches. Nothing
else was stolen.
	   Blancpain's director, Jean-Claude Biver, said the watches were
recovered intact Tuesday. Police authorities in Munich are expected
to give more details Thursday.
	   The watches ``depict a variety of frank, animated lovemaking
scenes that date from the period of courtly love,'' the company
said in a statement.
	   Biver said the company intends to continue exhibiting the watch
collection.

Lawmakers demand suspension of security chief after police beating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian legislature demanded
Wednesday that West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub be suspended
and investigated after his troops beat several lawmakers and
journalists at a protest outside the home of a Hamas fugitive.
	   ``We demand from President Yasser Arafat that he suspend Rajoub
and turn him over to investigators and prosecute all the officers
involved in the beatings,'' said a statement issued by the
88-member elected Palestinian Legislative Council.
	   The council called the police actions at the protest
``unacceptable and condemnable.''
	   Three lawmakers were beaten Wednesday outside the family home of
Hamas fugitive Imad Awadallah who escaped from a Jericho prison.
	   Palestinians human rights groups have been sponsoring protests
outside the house demanding police end a round-the-clock
surveillance of the home.
	   At a similar protest Tuesday, police officers beat three other
lawmakers and two journalists on assignment for The Associated
Press.
	   Khader Shkirat, a Palestinian human rights activist said in a
statement that members of the Awadallah household have been
prevented from leaving the house or receiving visitors.
	   ``Only the mother can go shopping and she must be accompanied by
a preventive security officer,'' Shkirat said.
	   Lawmaker Hatem Abdel Qader, who was beaten on Tuesday, told
lawmakers that he personally intervened to allow Awadallah's
three-year-old daughter to attend pre-school.
	   Rajoub denied that restrictions were place on the family and
would not comment on calls for his suspension.

Prime Minister forms two advisory councils to help boost economic
</HEADLINE>
growth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Wednesday announced he would form two special advisory councils on
economic affairs and trade and industry that would help him
formulate policy to boost economic growth.
	   A statement issued from the prime minister's office said the
economic advisory council will consist of India's most prominent
economists who will have regular meetings with Vajpayee. Two civil
servants would also be part of the council.
	   The trade and industry advisory council will consist of some of
India's most powerful industrialists and businessmen, including
members of the Tata, Birla and Reliance business houses, the
release said.
	   Membership of the councils would change periodically to allow
the prime minister to interact with a large number of
representatives from trade and industry.
	   These councils will be in addition to economic advisers Vajpayee
already has.
	   The prime minister has been worried about the slow growth rate
and the recent fall in the rupee following India's nuclear tests in
May. Earlier this month, he reshuffled key bureaucrats in the
finance ministry.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams cancels Sarajevo trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
has canceled a planned trip to Sarajevo for a global crisis
conference, officials in Sarajevo said Wednesday.
	   Adams was to be among the political leaders from global hotspots
gathering in Sarajevo on Thursday to share ideas on how to end
conflicts. But organizers said he is too tied up with peace
negotiations in his own country to attend.
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, also
canceled, but other politicians from South Africa, Cyprus and
Bosnia will attend, according to the organizers.
	   Northern Ireland will be represented by David Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist Party leader and Protestant first minister of
Northern Ireland's new cross-community government; and Lord John
Alderdice, moderator of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
	   Others taking part are former Canadian Foreign Minister Flora
McDonald, South African Justice Minister A.M. Omar and the former
commander of the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia, William Nash.
	   The one-day panel discussion is organized by Hunt Alternatives
and the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Some 5,000 people sat in a park
across from Cambodia's National Assembly for a third day Wednesday
to protest alleged electoral fraud and demand the resignation of
Hun Sen _ the declared victor of last month's election.
	   The leaders of the opposition parties, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, rejected government demands to move the sit-in,
which began Monday.
	   ``The people will not move,'' Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said in a
written statement. ``It is a public place, it is the site of the
National Assembly that is meant to represent the people's will, and
it is a place where the people have left their blood in the
struggle for freedom.''
	   The opposition's defiance has heightened concerns of renewed
bloodshed if Hun Sen's patience wears out with the political
stalemate that has only deepened since last month's elections.
	   Though international observers said that voting and the first
day of counting were fair and credible, the opposition asserted
hundreds of cases of fraud in the 10 days it took to finish the
count. They also said widespread violence and intimidation before
the vote tainted the outcome.
	   The opposition leaders threaten to boycott the assembly,
preventing a government from forming, and have rejected offers from
the winnner _ Hun Sen _ to form a coalition until their concerns
are addressed.
	   The new assembly is scheduled to meet Sept. 24, but the lack of
progress in resolving the dispute is making citizens highly
nervous.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said their followers remained committed
to overturning what they called widespread electoral fraud and were
prepared face violence.
	   On Tuesday, Sam Rainsy's party asked the U.N. to send monitors
to the park, claiming he had received reports that elements within
the government planned to kill him.
	   The park _ dubbed ``Democracy Square'' by the opposition _ was a
sea of makeshift blue tarpaulin tents separate by little paths.
Supporters handed out baskets of free food, and even the poor
donated crumpled banknotes to keep up the protest.
	   The park was the scene of a grenade attack last year against a
Sam Rainsy-led protest that killed 16 people and wounded more than
100. Hun Sen has been widely blamed for the attack, but denies
responsibility.
	   On Wednesday night, television and radio stations controlled by
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party broadcast the purported
confession of a man who said he was hired by some supporters of Sam
Rainsy to toss a grenade into this week's rally.
	   Khem Khan, described as a wood cutter from the eastern province
of Kampong Cham, said on Bayon TV and radio that he was offered
dlrs 1,000 to carry out the attack.
	   There seemed to be little reason to believe his story, since
media controlled by Hun Sen have made similar accusations against
Sam Rainsy without evidence and without prosecuting the cases.
	   Hun Sen toppled Ranariddh as his co-prime minister last year in
a bloody coup and called the elections in an effort to win back
lost international legitimacy and aid.
	   The prince had won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.

Controversy deepens as newspaper prints three new diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with excerpts from purported
diary pages. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Publishing Anne Frank's bitter
observations of her parents' near-loveless marriage, a Dutch
newspaper Wednesday deepened the controversy surrounding five
newfound pages of her famed diary.
	   The Amsterdam daily Het Parool ran what it said was the text
from three of five missing pages on its front page, next to a large
photograph of the teen-age Jewish diarist who hid with her family
from the Nazis.
	   The excerpts accompanied a story claiming that Anne never wanted
her writings published in the first place. Their publication
prompted the foundation that has the copyright to ``The Diary of
Anne Frank'' to call in its lawyers.
	   The Anne Frank Fund, based in Basel, Switzerland, and holder of
the rights to the internationally best-selling diary, declined to
comment on their publication.
	   ``The case is in the hands of our lawyers,'' said Pierre Loewe
of the fund.
	   The purported diary entries contained criticisms of Anne's
parents' marriage, speculating that her father, Otto, did not
really love her mother, Edith.
	   ``What has their marriage become? No arguments and differences
of opinion _ no, but it is not an ideal marriage either. Father
values mother and loves her, but not with the marital love I would
expect ...,'' the excerpts read in part.
	   ``... Father is not in love, he kisses her as he kisses us
(children) ... He looks at her teasingly and mockingly but never
lovingly ... She loves him as she loves no other and it is
difficult to see this kind of love always unanswered ...''
	   ``... If she had just one aspect of an understanding mother,
either tenderness or friendliness or patience or anything else, I
would keep trying to approach her. But this unfeeling nature, these
mocking ways. To love that becomes more impossible each day.''
	   The newspaper was unrepentant about printing the excerpts.
	   ``We think the whole subject is news and there is no copyright
on news,'' said Het Parool's deputy editor, Frits Campagne. ``If
they send their lawyers we will ask our lawyers to answer them.''
	   Campagne refused to say how the newspaper obtained the pages.
Their existence was revealed last week by startled World War II
scholars who thought they'd managed to publish a complete version
of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   Citing one of the pages, Het Parool said Anne wrote she ``would
make sure nobody got their hands on'' the diary.
	   David Barnouw, a spokesman for the Netherlands State Institute
for War Documentation, dismissed the claim and noted that Anne had
written often about her aspirations of becoming a journalist.
	   ``She is like any girl contradicting herself in her diary,''
Barnouw said Wednesday. ``Her idea about becoming a famous writer,
that is the part Otto Frank found more compelling, and I think he
is right.''
	   Since its first publication in 1947, the diary has become a
best-selling modern literary classic translated into dozens of
languages.
	   The five pages have caused a storm of controversy in the
Netherlands this week.
	   On Tuesday, longtime Frank family friend and confidante Cor
Suijk, who insists that Otto Frank gave him the pages before his
death in 1980, demanded that proceeds from their publication should
go to his Holocaust awareness crusade in the United States.
	   Suijk, a former employee of the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank
Foundation, now works for the Anne Frank Center USA in New York. He
admitted to having the pages earlier this month.
	   The war documentation center, which plans to include the pages
in a new edition of the diary, also has a lawyer helping it obtain
them.
	   ``I'm confident we'll get the pages,'' Barnouw said.
	   Anne's diary trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks
were betrayed in their secret annex behind a movable bookcase in an
Amsterdam canal house and were sent to Nazi concentration camps.
	   Starving and freezing, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen
camp, just weeks before the camp was liberated in the spring of
1945.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former chairman of Hong Kong's Allied Group,
which was involved in one of the territory's biggest commercial
crimes, was charged Wednesday for conspiracy to defraud, police
said.
	   Lee Ming-tee, 58, a Malaysian-Chinese, was charged with
``various offenses involving conspiracy to defraud,'' a police
statement said. He was arrested Tuesday night at a mainland border
checkpoint when leaving Hong Kong. A police spokeswoman refused to
give further details.
	   Lee was later released on bail of 25 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 3.2 million), Television Broadcast reported.
	   Allied came under investigation in 1992 for shares deals between
January 1990 and May 1992 that regulators said may have breached
the territory's takeover and disclosure rules.
	   The Hong Kong government said in 1993 that the probe into the
property and manufacturing group uncovered evidence that company
executives sidestepped shareholder-protection rules and disguised
share transactions.
	   It said the investigation showed standards of commercial
corporate conduct that gave serious cause for concern, but did not
say at the time what legal action it planned to take.
	   The 100 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.8 million) probe
was the most expensive commercial crime investigation in Hong Kong,
the Hong Kong Standard said.

Human rights panel says U.N. should lift Iraq embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council should lift its
eight-year embargo against Iraq, a U.N. panel of human rights
experts said Wednesday in a statement critical of the sanctions'
effects on civilians.
	   Members of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination
and Protection of Minorities said the embargo deprives the entire
Iraqi population of food, care and education.
	   They noted ``with grave concern the immense suffering endured by
the Iraqi people, and by children in particular,'' adding there is
an ``unacceptable decline in levels of health, nutrition, health
care and employment and in agriculture.''
	   They urged all governments, including that of Iraq itself, to
enable the delivery of food, medical supplies and other aid.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions prohibit the
free sale of the country's economic mainstay, oil.
	   Weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and biological, chemical and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift the sanctions.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors are waiting for more instructions from
the Security Council before deciding how and when they'll try to
search for banned weapons in the face of Iraq's decision to stop
cooperation, chief inspector Richard Butler said Tuesday.
	   Baghdad froze cooperation after Butler refused to certify Iraqi
compliance. The move paralyzed inspections since inspectors can't
conduct searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   The Iraqi government has claimed the sanctions are responsible
for the deaths of 500 children a month.
	   The sub-commission, which has been meeting in Geneva this month,
adopted its decision by consensus.
	   The statement said ``any embargo that condemns an ``innocent
people to hunger, disease, ignorance and even death without
attaining the objectives for which it was declared'' is ``a
flagrant violation of the economic, social and cultural rights of
the people concerned.''

New study finds calcium supplements can soothe PMS symptoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Women can dramatically reduce symptoms of
premenstrual syndrome by taking calcium-based antacid tablets,
according to a new study.
	   Conducted by researchers at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center,
the study of 497 women showed that daily 1,200-milligram doses of
calcium slashed the symptoms by 54 percent.
	   The study backs up several smaller ones that found a link
between calcium deficiencies and PMS. The results of the study,
sponsored in part by SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, which
makes the calcium-based over-the-counter antacid Tums, are to be
published this week in the American Journal of Obstetrics and
Gynecology.
	   The earlier studies were so small that many scientists were
skeptical, said nutritionist Connie M. Weaver of Purdue University,
a recognized expert on calcium issues. ``This one, they did it
right,'' she said.
	   PMS symptoms include bloating, pain, irritability, food
cravings, malaise, migraines and mood swings. It affects millions
of women of childbearing age _ as many as 40 percent.
	   In the study, half the women were given four chewable calcium
carbonate tablets a day, for a total of 1,200 milligrams of
calcium. The other half received tablets without calcium.
	   The study showed a drop in symptoms among those who took the
calcium supplements.

More arrested for gang-related Hong Kong money laundering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with TV reports saying Cheung's wife arrested in graf
5. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Law enforcement officers staged about two dozen
raids and arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in
connection with a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
	   The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong
police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old
Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender.''
	   Hong Kong police were alerted when an unidentified man
approached them saying his cousin _ who had sneaked into Hong Kong
from China _ was being held for ransom by the gang, Radio Hong Kong
said.
	   The report quoted Chief Inspector Lam Nam-wing as saying 85
officers were mobilized early Wednesday to search 23 addresses and
two safety deposit boxes.
	   Among those arrested by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Hong
Kong police was Cheung's wife, who was in one of the houses raided,
Television Broadcast reported.
	   Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in
China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery. The gang
allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets
of 17 relatives of Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles
are restrained under the order.
	   Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the
ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about
200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,740) during the raids.
	   The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police _ some of them illegal
immigrants _ are still being detained for questioning.
	   Although no official information was ever released on the
kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons
from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
	   Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at
seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
	   In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8
million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan
(U.S. dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese
state media.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Wednesday laid to rest a soldier shot to
death in Afghanistan after U.S. missile strikes there.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro presided over the funeral of Lt.
Col. Carmine Calo, promising to award him the ``highest military
honors.''
	   Calo, 42, a military observer with the U.N. force in
Afghanistan, was shot Friday in Kabul and died Saturday. A French
civilian with the United Nations was wounded in the attack.
	   They were shot the day after U.S. cruise missile strikes on a
suspected terrorist base in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant
in Sudan.
	   The Afghan strike was aimed at a base run by Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi activist whom U.S. officials say was behind the Aug. 7
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.

China summer flooding kills 3,004, vice premier says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with vice premier saying neglect of
environment partly to blame for heavy flooding, comment from flood
official about why death toll much lower than 1954 floods; other
detail &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Neglect of the environment is partly to blame for
devastating floods that have killed 3,004 people in China this
summer, a senior government official said Wednesday.
	   Vice Premier Wen Jiabao's new report of deaths was a sharp
increase from the government's last official death toll of 2,000
three weeks ago. He told the legislature that as of Saturday, 1,320
of the 3,004 deaths took place along the Yangtze River.
	   He called for new efforts to protect the environment in order to
prevent floods in the future, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Logging along the upper Yangtze has caused serious erosion.
Denuded hillsides are unable to absorb rain, and the water washes
soil into the river and its tributaries, raising water levels and
silting up channels.
	   The erosion problem is just one part of the severe degradation
of China's air, water and soil caused by years of rapid growth at
any cost.
	   This week the government belatedly banned logging along the
upper Yangtze in parts of Sichuan province.
	   The Yangtze floods have been the worst since 1954, when 30,000
people were killed. Flooding also has been at record levels in
northeastern China along the Nen and Songhua rivers.
	   This year's death toll is so much lower than in 1954 mainly
because China's dikes basically held, thanks to reinforcements in
the past decade and patrols and repairs by millions of people, said
Zhou Wenzhi of the State Flood Control Headquarters.
	   But other reports suggested the government had not done enough
to protect millions of people, rich farmland and industry from
floods.
	   As a result of misallocation of government funds and corruption,
many new dikes were poorly built. The official China Daily said
Wednesday that the flood control system was ``often antiquated and
dangerously dilapidated.''
	   As more land is reclaimed from rivers and lakes, funds and
technology for flood control lag far behind, the report said,
citing experts it did not identify at the Ministry of Water
Resources.
	   Between 1991 and 1997, state investment in water conservation
routinely fell below spending for other infrastructure investments,
the report said. It added that substandard flood control works can
be found in 70 percent of China's more than 600 flood-prone cities.
	   Government officials have also used the floods to put a
spotlight on bureaucratic mismanagement. Five officials from
inundated Lindian county in the northeast were disciplined for
leaving the disaster scene to play mah-jongg for more than four
hours, the state-run Legal Daily reported.
	   In central China, floods remained very serious on the Yangtze,
with more than 300 kilometers (about 200 miles) of the river at the
highest levels ever recorded. More than 8 million soldiers and
civilians are working on dikes along the Yangtze and the rivers in
the northeast, Xinhua said.
	   The dikes were soggy and perilously weakened in places after
more than 60 days of high water. Earthen walls of dikes collapsed
under surging waters near Yueyang, a city of 5 million, Xinhua
reported.
	   Nationwide 5 million houses have been destroyed and 21 million
hectares (52 million acres) of land swamped, according to the
government. Economic losses have surpassed 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs
20.2 billion). More than 233 million people _ a fifth of the
population _ have been affected by flooding.
	   Under a ``do-or-die'' order from President Jiang Zemin, 178,000
soldiers and police guarded shaky dikes Wednesday to battle the
Yangtze's seventh flood crest this summer, state media reported.
	   Honghu Lake's dikes were the weakest on the whole river, and a
collapse would threaten the lives and property of 8 million people
living on the rich flood plain near the industrial city of Wuhan,
the People's Daily reported.
	   In the northeast, the government appealed for tents, quilts and
warm clothing for 1 million people made homeless by flooding.
	   Factories were clearing out warehouses to use them for housing
in the bitter northeastern winter ahead, the China Daily reported.

Lloyd's expels broker in kickback scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lloyd's of London said Wednesday it had
permanently expelled a broker who took dlrs 200,000 in kickbacks
for helping a French aviation executive cheat his own company.
	   Lloyd's found that Michael James Cowie had practiced
``thoroughly dishonest behavior, involving considerable sums of
money over a lengthy period of time and committed for reasons of
personal gain.''
	   The kickbacks were paid out from 1989 until November 1996, when
Cowie served as managing director of the aviation department at a
Lloyd's insurer, Bain Clarkson Ltd., which later became part of
Bain Hogg International Ltd.
	   The scheme started when Jacques Pate, managing director of the
French aviation company Aviafrance, gave Cowie a bigger share of
Aviafrance's insurance business on condition that Cowie set up a
secret commission account that was used to funnel money to Pate,
Lloyd's said.
	   Over the years, Cowie transferred more than dlrs 600,000 worth
of various currencies that should have gone to Aviafrance into the
special account, and he then moved most of the money into Pate's
private bank accounts in London and Luxembourg, Lloyd's said.
	   Pate then let Cowie take kickbacks equalling about dlrs 200,000
out of the account, Lloyd's said.
	   Cowie was fired when his bosses found out about the scheme,
Lloyd's spokesman Martin Leach said.
	   Lloyd's began proceedings against Cowie through its Disciplinary
Tribunal, but Cowie offered no defense and lost the case by
default.
	   Lloyd's had no information about Cowie's current whereabouts,
Leach said.
	   Lloyd's barred Cowie from the insurance market for life, fined
him 80,000 pounds (dlrs 130,000) and ordered him to pay costs.

	   BUNOL, Spain (AP) _ In Spain's messiest summer festival, more
than 30,000 people spent an hour Wednesday pelting each other with
tons of tomatoes, painting themselves and a town with thick red
mush.
	   The annual food fight began at high noon with the burst of a
rocket fired in Bunol's town square. The crowd _ estimated at
30,000 to 35,000 people _ then began a ritual chant: ``Tomatoes!
Tomatoes! We want tomatoes!''
	   They got them, about 100 tons, brought in aboard five trucks
that rumbled into the square in single file.
	   From the backs of the trucks attendants dumped the ripe red
produce onto the streets for warriors to scoop up and throw at
anybody and everybody.
	   The mayhem lasted about an hour. Some people wore safety goggles
to protect their eyes from the acid in the tomatoes. Others sported
straw hats in a futile bid to keep their hair clean. Everybody
stood ankle deep in red pulp.
	   Spectators watched from the sidelines, some with video cameras
duly wrapped in plastic.
	   Bunol, a working class town 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the
Mediterranean city of Valencia, swells to three times its normal
population when the Tomatina festival rolls around every year on
the last Wednesday in August, said Minerva Gomez, a town hall
official.
	   She said it's not really clear exactly how far back the festival
goes, although it's been a yearly thing since the 1940s and became
a city-sponsored event in 1979.
	   There are several theories as to how it got started. One is that
a group of friends meeting in the town square for lunch hurled
tomatoes at one who showed up late.
	   Another says young people threw tomatoes at some rich kids whose
parents had vacation homes nearby.
	   However it began, the festival has become one of Spain's most
popular, drawing people from a variety of countries.
	   Gomez says there has never been an injury reported. It's just
good clean fun, she says.
	   When the projectiles stopped flying this Wednesday, people
trudged to one of 300 or so makeshift showers.
	   But they were already wet even before they became targets.
Before the trucks brought in the ammunition, the crowd was hosed
down so people would be slippery and direct hits from tomatoes
would sting a bit less.

Palestinian, Israeli negotiators quietly leave Norway

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian and Israeli negotiators quietly
ended talks aimed at breaking an 18-month deadlock in the Middle
East peace process on Wednesday without commenting on the result.
	   According to Norwegian and U.S. officials, the negotiators and
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross slipped out of Oslo on Wednesday
morning, and did not wish to make any statement.
	   Later in the day, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who
organized the meeting, said the silence did not indicate failure.
	   ``This was not a breakdown. If anything it was the opposite,
since they have agreed to continue talks,'' said Vollebaek at
Oslo's Fornebu Airport upon his return from an unrelated meeting.
He would not say when and where future talks would take place.
	   The Palestinians and Israelis were in Oslo to mark the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo Accords, a peace agreement that was
finalized in August 1993 after months of secret talks brokered by
Norway.
	   The peace process has been stalled since the right-wing Likud
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in
Israeli in May 1996. Netanyahu took over from Shimon Peres, of the
Labor Party.
	   During the anniversary gathering, delegations led by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and Meir Sheetrit, a top member of the
Likud coalition government, met in private to discuss such
obstacles to the peace process as Israeli withdrawals from occupied
territory.
	   Arafat left on Tuesday morning, in keeping with his original
schedule, while the delegations and Ross extended their stays to
continue talks.
	   On Tuesday, Ross, the U.S. envoy, said some progress had been
made in narrowing the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians,
but refused to discuss details. He left Oslo on Wednesday morning,
and did not wish to comment on the meetings, according to Michael
T. Scanlin, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Oslo.
	   Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister, said the point of the
fifth anniversary ceremony was to get the parties talking again.
	   ``These informal talks between the parties maintained a contact
between Israelis and Palestinians that was in danger of being
broken,'' said Vollebaek. He said he had briefed Netanyahu about
the talks by telephone, and was assured that Israel wants to move
ahead in the peace process.
	   Vollebaek said difficult issues remaining include the withdrawal
of Israeli troops from a portion of the West Bank, and Palestinian
security guarantees for Israel. He said those conflicts are
possible to solve, although there was no specific agreement in
Oslo.

Study: Lingering cancer cells ominous sign in childhood leukemia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2100 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Even small numbers of lingering cancer cells can
be an ominous sign in children who have undergone seemingly
successful treatment for leukemia, a study found.
	   Generally, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are
considered to be in remission when doctors cannot see any cancerous
cells in their bone marrow when looking through a microscope.
	   However, a genetic-fingerprinting technique called PCR, for
polymerase chain reaction, can spot as few as five cancer cells in
every 100,000 cells.
	   Using this test, doctors examined 178 children who appeared to
be in remission after undergoing chemotherapy, and detected traces
of cancer in 42 percent of them.
	   During three years of follow-up, 8 percent of those who appeared
cancer-free on the PCR test suffered a relapse, compared with 40
percent of those who showed traces of disease.
	   The study was conducted by Dr. Helene Cave and others from
Robert Debre Hospital in Paris. It was published in Thursday's
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   In the United States, between 3,000 and 4,000 people are
diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia each year, two-thirds
of them children. Nearly 80 percent of children can be cured,
compared with about one-third of adults, according to a separate
report from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis,
Tennessee.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Three people were injured when police
clashed with protesting students outside Ghana's main university,
Accra police said.
	   The students, from the University of Ghana and a nearby
polytechnic, demonstrated Tuesday to protest a new yearly fee for
campus residents.
	   After marching across the campus, the group spilled onto a major
road outside the university chanting and singing.
	   Police used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to block
their way into town.
	   In the resulting confusion, a woman and a child who were not
part of the demonstration were injured, Greater Accra Regional
Police Commander Cephas Kwashivie Agbelie told reporters.
	   The injured also included a policeman whose eyes were hurt by
water spray, and were to be discharged Wednesday from the
university hospital.
	   ``We had informed their leaders not to extend the demonstration
outside the campus but the students refused. We had to use
reasonable force to restore order,'' Agbelie said.
	   University authorities proposed the dlrs 65 annual fee to force
students to share in campus utility costs and to help maintain
residential facilities.
	   Students who until now have lived on campus free of charge say
they are burdened with other costs.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ West African peacekeepers on Wednesday
denied allegations they helped disguise Liberian policemen as
international troops during a house search.
	   Former warlord Roosevelt Johnson claimed last week that the west
African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, had given uniforms to
President Charles Taylor's security forces to wear during a search
for arms at Johnson's house in Monrovia.
	   Johnson said the peacekeeping team that came to his home
included dozens of Taylor's security forces dressed in Ghanaian
military uniforms.
	   Wednesday's ECOMOG statement said the search was a joint
exercise with Liberian police and involved men who were all ``duly
dressed in their recognized uniforms.''
	   Nigeria and Ghana form the bulk of ECOMOG.
	   Johnson was Taylor's chief rival in the seven-year civil war in
which more than 150,000 people died. Relations between the two have
remained frosty since Taylor was elected.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Two people have been admitted to
Windhoek Central Hospital with suspected cases of Congo fever,
hospital officials said.
	   Superintendent Dr. Jack Obholzer said on Tuesday that the
diagnosis in the case of a farmer from eastern Namibia admitted on
Friday was not confirmed and doctors were awaiting test results.
	   ``We are treating him in an isolation ward and taking all the
necessary precautions,'' Obholzer said.
	   The patient was admitted after he developed symptoms typical of
Congo fever, including high temperature, muscular aches and
internal hemorrhaging, hospital staff said.
	   The illness followed a tick bite he received last week on his
farm, hospital staff said.
	   The second case was admitted on Tuesday, said Dr. David Uirab.
	   The fever is usually fatal within several days.
	   A hospital spokesman said a team of doctors was monitoring
family members for similar symptoms.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The leader of the opposition party
supports the government's decision to stay out of the conflict in
Congo, a news report said.
	   Afonso Dhlakama, head of RENAMO _ the Portuguese acronym for
Mozambique National Resistance _ criticized neighboring Zimbabwe
for sending troops last week to back Congolese President Laurent
Kabila, the daily news pamphlet MediaFax said.
	   The Congo crisis is the most serious threat to stability in
southern and central Africa in years, with Zimbabwe and Angola
sending troops to help Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda are said to be
backing the rebels.
	   Dhlakama recalled that Zimbabwe had sent troops to defend
Mozambique's socialist government against former RENAMO rebels.
	   ``It is not time to send troops to fight in another country.''
he was quoted as saying.

	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The worst drought in memory for the
Seychelles archipelago is causing the population of 75,000 them
more than inconvenience _ it is also beginning to adversely effect
the economy.
	   A Hindu temple held a ceremony to call for rain, but the
meteorological office said Wednesday it does not expect substantial
rainfall until mid-October.
	   The southeast monsoon that blows in Seychelles from May to
October is normally the dry season, and this year, the lack of rain
has forced the state-owned water company to place severe
restrictions on water usage.
	   On Mahe, the largest island in the 92-island Indian Ocean
archipelago, most residents receive water only a few hours a day.
	   The islands' brewery and a tuna-processing plant, which had been
poised to become a major source of hard currency, have both had to
cut back production because of lack of water.
	   The restrictions have inconvenienced tourists who are advised to
fill their bathtubs at night to make sure they have water in the
morning. Tourism is now the Seychelles' main source of income.
	   ------- &QC; 
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Zambia's highest court on Wednesday
rejected an appeal by two politicians to drop charges that they
were involved in a failed coup last year.
	   Lawyers for Dean Mung'omba, head of the small opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress party, and Princess Nakatindi Wina, a ruling
party official, told the Lusaka Supreme Court that state
prosecutors had failed to provide evidence from witnesses linking
them to the coup attempt.
	   Mung'omba and Wina, a wealthy tribal princess who headed the
women's wing
	   of President Frederick Chiluba's ruling party, are the only two
civilians facing the treason charges that carry a death sentence.
	   Seventy-six soldiers have also been charged.
	   Supreme Court Judge Matthew Chaila said a five-judge panel had
no jurisdiction to quash the charges, since the two politicians
were still undergoing trial.

FA under fire for paying for Hoddle's faith healer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle and his business
relationship with faith healer Eileen Drewery came under renewed
scrutiny Wednesday as club officials demanded to know who pays her
bills.
	   Chelsea chairman Ken Bates called for an inquiry after England's
Football Association admitted paying Drewery a 75-pound (dlrs 123)
fee for each player who had a consultation while on international
duty.
	   Bates, also an FA councillor, said he wanted to know why Drewery
was being paid by the FA.
	   Hoddle's use of the faith healer for his players before the
World Cup in France dominated headlines in the media and the
profile of Drewery _ the mother of his former girlfriend _
increased dramatically.
	   Hoddle will name his squad Thursday for the Euro 2000 qualifier
against Sweden on Sept. 5 and was no doubt hoping the media focus
would switch back to on-field issues.
	   Already under fire for publishing details of his pre-World Cup
bust-up with Paul Gascoigne in his 1998 World Cup diary, Hoddle was
recently accused of making money from a business venture with
Drewery.
	   He mentioned Drewery on 14 pages of his controversial book and
defended her therapeutic use with the England players during the
World Cup buildup.
	   Hoddle told a news conference earlier this month that his
biggest regret at the World Cup was not taking Drewery earlier to
the championship in France. He also said she would continue to help
in the future.
	   Drewery, a former barmaid turned faith healer, and Hoddle
established The Lychgate Sanctuary Ltd in October 1997. In December
the company applied for registration as a charity _ usually a
15-day process _ but still has not been granted registration.
	   Hoddle denied the pair would be cashing in on the exposure her
business would get as a result of her work with the England team or
that his involvement in the business was a conflict of interest.

Newspaper prints three new Anne Frank diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Amsterdam newspaper published
excerpts from five new pages of Anne Frank's famed diary on
Wednesday, prompting the foundation holding the copyright to call
in its lawyers.
	   Het Parool, an Amsterdam daily, ran what it said was the text
from three diary pages on its front page next to a large photograph
of the teen-age Jewish diarist who hid with her family from the
Nazis.
	   The excerpts accompanied a story claiming that Anne never wanted
her writings published in the first place.
	   Het Parool's deputy editor, Frits Campagne, refused to say how
the newspaper obtained the pages.
	   Earlier this month, longtime Frank family friend and confidante
Cor Suijk admitted to having the pages. He insists that Otto Frank
gave him the pages before his death in 1980, and demands that
proceeds from their publication should go to his Holocaust
awareness crusade in the United States. Suijk works for the Anne
Frank Center USA in New York.
	   The Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which
wants to include the pages in a new edition of the diary, has a
lawyer helping it obtain the pages.
	   After Wedesday's publication, the Anne Frank Fund, based in
Basel, Switzerland, and holder of the copyright to the diary,
responded that the case was in the hands of its lawyers.
	   The purported diary entries contained criticisms of Anne's
parents' marriage, speculating that her father, Otto, did not
really love her mother, Edith.
	   ``Father is not in love; he kisses her as he kisses us
(children). ... She loves him as she loves no other and it is
difficult to see this kind of love always unanswered,'' the
excerpts said.
	   Citing one of the pages, Het Parool said Anne wrote she ``would
make sure nobody got their hands on'' the diary.
	   David Barnouw, a spokesman for the war documentation institute,
dismissed the claim and noted that Anne had written often about her
aspirations of becoming a journalist.
	   ``She is like any girl contradicting herself in her diary,''
Barnouw said today.
	   Since its first publication in 1947, the diary has become a
best-selling modern literary classic translated into dozens of
languages.
	   Anne's diary trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks
were betrayed and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Starving and
freezing, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks
before the camp was liberated in 1945.

Now pointed West, Central Europe wrestles with Russian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Lingering investor perceptions of Central
Europe's economic dependence on Russia has contributed to volatile
swings in currencies and share prices this week as Moscow wrestles
with its economic prices.
	   But few analysts expect long term problems for the emerging
market economies of Central Europe because most have successfully
shifted their trade to the West.
	   ``We are looking at continued weakness and volatility,'' said
Anthony Thomas, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in
London. ``But to turn Central Europe into a full blown crisis we
would have to see not just Russia but China and Latin America go as
well.''
	   The biggest problem has been nervous investors pulling out their
money to cover losses from Russia's plunging ruble and debt
rescheduling, according to analysts.
	   Such hedging has little impact in large Western markets, but it
causes percentage drops in the smaller markets of countries like
Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
	   More selling is expected in upcoming weeks as further details of
Russia's restructuring plan come out. Under the deal announced
Tuesday night, Russian treasury securities maturing before the end
of 1999 must be traded in for a variety of new ones that mature
later and yield less.
	   ``The fact that the Russia deal is somewhat worse than expected
from investors' point of view may mean they will sell more of their
central European holdings,'' said Wike Groenenberg, currency
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
	   Some of the investor reaction is due to perceptions that Central
European economies remain heavily linked to Russia and will
crumble.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ the three former Soviet
satellites that will join NATO next year and are negotiating to
join the European Union _ now export less than 10 percent of their
goods to Russia.
	   ``Stereotypes persist that the former Soviet economies are still
dependent on each other,'' noted Cezary Jozefiak of Poland's
Monetary Policy Council.
	   While damage so far has avoided the foundations of economic
structures, analysts emphasized the fallout of the Russian crisis
will continue to cause some volatility.
	   Poland's zloty currency has fallen about 8 percent against the
U.S. dollar, closing at 3.779 to the dollar Wednesday. Analysts say
it was artificially high before the drop and now would likely
stabilize.
	   ``Foreigners have put a lot of money recently into Poland,
they've made a lot of money, and now they want to sell and cash in
what they have,'' said Krzysztof Bledowski, an economist at Wood
and Co. in Warsaw.
	   Hungary's National Bank intervened Wednesday for the first time
since 1995 to prop up the florint currency, which has fallen to
record lows against the U.S. dollar and German mark due to
sell-offs by foreign investors to cover losses in Russia.
	   But Economics Minister Attila Chikan, noting that only 4 percent
of Hungary's exports go to Russia, said he expected no direct
long-term impact from the Russian crisis.
	   In the Czech Republic, Prague's PX-50 Index dropped 2.63 percent
on the day while the koruna currency also struggled against the
dollar and mark. One dealer offered a 50-50 scenario _ the koruna
could strengthen if investors choose higher-yielding Czech
securities over Russian debt, or it could fall further if more
money leaves the Czech markets.
	   The Romaniam Stock Exchange fell 11 percent Wednesday to its
lowest level since opening in 1996, due to selling by foreign
investors. Stere Farmache, general manager of the exchange, said
the drop continued a trend that began in June and has been
exacerbated by nervousness over the Russian crisis.
	   In Bulgaria, which has a huge trade imbalance with Russia,
Premier Ivan Kostov predicted problems for Bulgarian exporters
because the ruble's fall makes importing more expensive for
Russians.
	   But Vladimir Popov, a dealer at a local ING branch, said exports
to Russia were a small portion of Bulgaria's total exports and any
drop would have little effect overall.

Brazilian reports to Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian striker Edmundo resumed his
on-again, off-again relationship with Fiorentina Wednesday,
reporting to the Serie A club less than three weeks before the
start of the season.
	   He'll likely pair with Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta in
attack.
	   The 27-year-old scored four goals in nine games for Fiorentina
after being acquired during the 1997-98 campaign, but argued openly
with then-coach Alberto Malesani over playing time. At one point,
Edmundo walked out on the team before being coaxed back from
Brazil.
	   ``This will be a very positive season and doing well in Italy
can only be advantageous for me,'' Edmundo said Wednesday. ``I'm
here more than anything to help Batistuta score. If I score too,
all the better.''
	   He said the new transfer clause added to his contract _
reportedly calling for a dlrs 13 million fee, but only for a move
to a Brazilian club _ does not mean he's looking to leave Florence
next summer.
	   ``That gives me the certainty that I will have an alternative in
case of problems,'' Edmundo said. ``But it does not mean that at
the end of the season I'll definitely go. If I have a good season,
I could remain a long time.''

Amid new clashes, Kosovo rebel speaker says no side can win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid new clashes in Kosovo, the
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels said Wednesday they may
eventually negotiate because no side can win the bloody conflict.
	   After a string of defeats at the hands of Serb soldiers, the
Kosovo Liberation Army announced it would wage a guerrilla war to
gain independence for the southern Serbian province.
	   ``I told them we are ready to negotiate on condition that the
Serb regime ... knows that it cannot win militarily,'' Adem Demaci,
the KLA spokesman said after meeting two Western diplomatic envoys
in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' he said.
	   More bloodshed and shooting was reported Wednesday in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population.
	   The Yugoslav army said it ``liquidated four terrorists'' when it
intercepted Wednesday an armed group attempting to enter illegally
Kosovo from neighboring Albania.
	   The incident occurred near the border outpost Goden, about 85
kilometers (53 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The group, which the army said was smuggling weapons, opened
fire at a border guard patrol, drawing return fire from the patrol.
A large quantity of weapons was confiscated, the army statement
said.
	   Albanian sources confirmed four bodies were brought Wednesday to
the morgue in Djakovica, the nearest town to the Goden outpost.
	   Demaci also declared: ``We are ready to do that if the Serb
regime makes an effort and withdraws its forces, ... stops the
terror and accepts the Albanian framework for talks, which is the
1991 referendum'' on Kosovo's independence.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has ruled out independence
for the province. Western powers also oppose it since a change of
borders could trigger a larger Balkan conflict.
	   Restoration of Kosovo's regional autonomy, abolished in 1989,
would be the most likely compromise, although most Kosovo Albanians
insist they want independence.
	   On Wednesday, the Serbian Media Center in Pristina said that
ethnic Albanian militants attacked police positions near Dulje, on
the Pristina-Prizren road in southwest Kosovo.
	   Two additional police patrols were hit overnight with
machine-gun fire, and one policeman was wounded Monday in the
embattled province, the center said.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported
that Serb police entered the village Banja, near the militants'
former stronghold of Malisevo, which police overran last month. The
village was said to be in flames. Two more villages were also
shelled.
	   Another casualty of the three-day clashes near Suva Reka was
discovered Wednesday, bringing the ethnic Albanian death toll to
10. The center identified the latest victims as Safet Micaj, 21.
	   Over 10,000 refugees who fled the Suva Reka clashes are now in a
valley connecting this region to nearby Malisevo, it said.
	   One of the diplomats who met with Demaci, Gerhard Jandl, head of
the European Union's working group for the Balkans, said there can
be no political solution in Kosovo until there is a humanitarian
one.
	   ``The humanitarian situation will amount to a catastrophe in the
fall and winter if it is not addressed properly,'' he said,
referring to tens of thousands of refugees displaced in six months
of fighting and destruction.
	   ``The first priority ... is to try to get the displaced people
to their villages and towns, and unless this is achieved we don't
see any chance for real progress on the political front because it
is understandable that under current circumstances the prospect for
political negotiations are very, very dim,'' Jandl said.

Angolan gov't threatens military action against former rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A top Angolan official Wednesday warned
the former rebel group UNITA that the government could take
military action if they did not turn over their rural strongholds
by the end of the week, news reports said.
	   ``If the international community does not pressure UNITA, the
government will take political, moral, psychological and even
military action,'' Interior Minister Santana Pitra was quoted as
saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   The government has given UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ until Aug. 28
to comply fully with the 1994 peace accord that ended a two-decade
civil war.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its four remaining
central highland strongholds has held up full implementation of the
peace pact and has brought U.N. and U.S. sanctions against the
group.
	   UNITA on Monday accused the countries monitoring the peace
process _ the U.S., Russia and Portugal _ of bias towards the
government and said it was severing ties with them.
	   Pitra said UNITA's decision was simply a way of stalling
implementation of the peace deal, according to Lusa.
	   Pitra was speaking in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa.
	   The new United Nations envoy to Angola was due to arrive Friday
in the former Portuguese colony, Lusa reported.
	   Issa Diallo was to replace Alioune Blondin Beye, who died in an
aircrash in June.

Agreement to hold 2005 Ryder Cup in Ireland signed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany _ The PGA European tour has signed an agreement
for Ireland to host the 2005 Ryder Cup, tour officials announced
Wednesday.
	   Venues for the Ryder Cup will be announced sometime after the
Masters championship in April, the officials said. Only courses
that hold major events in Ireland or European tour competitions are
under consideration.
	   The agreement includes an eight-year plan to promote the event,
along with tourism in the country. The PGA will be paid dlrs 12.2
million for providing marketing and promotion opportunites.
	   The money will come in equal amounts from the government of
Ireland and three major banks, Aer Lingus, Allied Irish Banks and
Waterford Crystal.
	   The decision that Ireland would be the Ryder Cup host nation for
2005 had been announced in September at the 1997 event held at
Valderrama, Spain, but no details had been announced.
	   One goal of the promotional activities is to help the country
become a leading international golf destination, said Ireland
tourism director James McDaid.
	   ``My prediction is that by is that by 2005 we will have at least
500,000 golfers visiting Ireland annually, a doubling of present
numbers,'' said McDaid.
	   He expects the golfers to provide a boom to the country's
tourism industry. Ireland's visitors have tripled since 1986, from
1.7 million to an estimated 5.4 million this year.

German goalkeeper Koepke retires from international soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke,
capped 54 times by his country, said Wednesday he was retiring from
international soccer.
	   Koepke, 35, is the ninth player to have quit the German national
team since it lost 3-0 in the World Cup quarterfinals against
Croatia.
	   Like many other ageing stars of the team, Koepke came under
criticism for his performances during the tournament.
	   Coach Berti Vogts, under fire after Germany's second successive
early World Cup exit, has promised to rebuild the national team
with young players.
	   Koepke starred at the 1996 European Championships in England,
saving a penalty in a shootout against the host nation to send
Germany into the final where it beat the Czech Republic.
	   He currently plays for French first division club Marseille. But
after two years as first choice goalkeeper, he has been on the
bench for the first three matches this season, replaced by
Frenchman Stephane Porato.
	   Koepke met with Marseille officials Tuesday to discuss his
future, and later said he was prepared to remain with the club, but
that he would consider any offers from other clubs.
	   Veterans Andreas Moeller and Thomas Haessler announced Saturday
they were quitting the team, although both left the door open for a
return.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Le Huynh Duc scored a pair of goals in the
final five minutes to complete Vietnam's 4-1 victory over Laos
Wednesday night and cap the the country's grandest display
pageantry for the opening of the Tiger Cup.
	   Singapore beat Malaysia 2-0 earlier in the day to open the
eight-nation event, a regional competition in which Thailand is the
highest-ranked team at No. 45 in the world. But it is the biggest
international sports event to come to Vietnam, and excitement
bubbled over everywhere.
	   Top officials, including the prime minister and the Communist
Party chief, were on hand in Hanoi's 20,000-seat stadium, which
recently completed a dlrs 400,000 upgrade.
	   The opening ceremony, delayed until the break between games for
prime-time TV coverage in Southeast Asia, blended youth, women
dancing in traditional costumes, miniature hot-air balloons flaming
into the night sky and a laser light show.
	   With the World Cup theme song blaring, the standing-room-only
crowd left happy after seeing the its local heroes rout neighboring
Laos.
	   Nguyen Hong Son and Nguyen Van Sy each scored in the first half,
but Keolakhone Channiphone pulled Laos with 2-1 in the 60th minute.
The two late goals then clinched the victory to the delight of the
more than capacity crowd.
	   In the Group B opener, Mohammed Rafi Bin Mohammed Ali and Ahmad
Latiff Bin Kamaruddin each scored in the first half, and
Singapore's defense stymied Malaysia's lackluster attack.
	   Group A competition starts Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City when
Indonesia plays the Philippines, followed by Thailand against
Myanmar. The finals are Sept. 5 with first-place prize money of
dlrs 80,000.
	   Soccer is a national obsession in Vietnam, so even though the
gates didn't open until 2 p.m., people with general-admission
tickets began packing an adjacent street in early morning so they
could grab prime spots.
	   Two hours before the kickoff of the first mat, entire sections
already had filled. Thousands of other fans milled around outside
the stadium, many painting their faces with the gold-star-on-red
Vietnamese flag.
	   Capitalism, at its best and worst, was in evidence everywhere in
the heart of the communist country.
	   Virtually every nearby home was turned into a makeshift outdoor
cafe. One vendor said she had sold nearly 100 small Vietnamese
flags in the first hour. Parking was going for triple the rate for
a regular match.
	   Despite a heavy police presence, ticket scalpers, or touts,
operated openly, seeking 150,000 dong (dlrs 10.70) _ a huge amount
in a country with an average annual per-capita income of about dlrs
300 _ for a 65,000 dong (dlrs 4.64 ticket).
	   Only 3,000 tickets are being made available for each match to
the general public; the rest have been allocated to government
departments and agencies.
	   Metal detectors were in use at each entrance to help enforce a
ban on cans and bottles. Drinks were poured into plastic bags with
straws.
	   During the six-week World Cup _ a tournament for which Vietnam
has never qualified _ the country nearly shut down as people stayed
up to 4 a.m. to watch matches live. Streets that normally would be
bustling on a Saturday night were deserted.

Newspaper prints three new Anne Frank diary pages

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to RESTORE country to slug &QL;

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Amsterdam newspaper published
excerpts from five new pages of Anne Frank's famed diary on
Wednesday, prompting the foundation holding the copyright to call
in its lawyers.
	   Het Parool, an Amsterdam daily, ran what it said was the text
from three diary pages on its front page next to a large photograph
of the teen-age Jewish diarist who hid with her family from the
Nazis.
	   The excerpts accompanied a story claiming that Anne never wanted
her writings published in the first place.
	   Het Parool's deputy editor, Frits Campagne, refused to say how
the newspaper obtained the pages.
	   Earlier this month, longtime Frank family friend and confidante
Cor Suijk admitted to having the pages. He insists that Otto Frank
gave him the pages before his death in 1980, and demands that
proceeds from their publication should go to his Holocaust
awareness crusade in the United States. Suijk works for the Anne
Frank Center USA in New York.
	   The Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which
wants to include the pages in a new edition of the diary, has a
lawyer helping it obtain the pages.
	   After Wedesday's publication, the Anne Frank Fund, based in
Basel, Switzerland, and holder of the copyright to the diary,
responded that the case was in the hands of its lawyers.
	   The purported diary entries contained criticisms of Anne's
parents' marriage, speculating that her father, Otto, did not
really love her mother, Edith.
	   ``Father is not in love; he kisses her as he kisses us
(children). ... She loves him as she loves no other and it is
difficult to see this kind of love always unanswered,'' the
excerpts said.
	   Citing one of the pages, Het Parool said Anne wrote she ``would
make sure nobody got their hands on'' the diary.
	   David Barnouw, a spokesman for the war documentation institute,
dismissed the claim and noted that Anne had written often about her
aspirations of becoming a journalist.
	   ``She is like any girl contradicting herself in her diary,''
Barnouw said today.
	   Since its first publication in 1947, the diary has become a
best-selling modern literary classic translated into dozens of
languages.
	   Anne's diary trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks
were betrayed and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Starving and
freezing, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks
before the camp was liberated in 1945.

New report says Abu Nidal in Egypt; foreign minister denies it

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A high-ranking Palestinian official said
Wednesday that the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal has been detained
in Egypt, but the country's foreign minister denied the report.
	   The Palestinian's statement follows nearly two weeks of similar
claims, all denied by Egyptian security officials who spoke
anonymously. The comment by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is the
first denial by an Egyptian official speaking publicly.
	   The interest in Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of struggle'' _
comes because of his notoriety for his daring attacks on Israelis
and even Palestinians whom he opposed, and for the mystery
surrounding him.
	   He was once considered the world's most dangerous terrorist. He
is reported to have died several times _ only to reappear _ and to
have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   In recent days, several Palestinian officials insisting on
anonymity have told news organizations, including The Associated
Press, that Abu Nidal was either jailed or hospitalized with
leukemia. None, however, has offered proof he was in the country.
	   On Wednesday, a leading Palestinian official _ again speaking on
condition of anonymity _ said the onetime guerrilla whose real name
is Sabri al-Banna was arrested five weeks ago coming from Libya.
	   He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the 61-year-old
Palestinian to leave or if Abu Nidal's own people were trying to
smuggle him out through Egypt to another country.
	   Abu Nidal is near death and being treated in a hospital, but is
in effect in detention by Egyptian officials, the official
contended.
	   He theorized Egypt is denying the arrest because it does not
know what to do with Abu Nidal and fears revealing his arrest could
make Egypt the target of anger by other terrorists.
	   Hours later, Moussa issued his public denial. He was asked about
reports Tuesday and Wednesday by American newspapers and
broadcasters which quoted U.S. and Arab officials as saying Abu
Nidal had been arrested by Egyptian police.
	   ``Abu Nidal is not in Egypt,'' Moussa replied. He did not expand
on the statement.
	   In Washington, the State Department's intelligence and
counterterrorism offices could not confirm reports of Abu Nidal's
arrest. ``We just don't know,'' a U.S. official said.
	   Abu Nidal's group has been listed by the U.S. State Department
as ``the most dangerous terrorist organization.'' It has been
blamed for killing 300 people and wounding more than 650 in 20
countries since 1973.
	   He is said to have operated out of Syria, Iraq and Libya at
various times. However, most of the incidents blamed on Abu Nidal
occurred years ago, and he is now believed to have only a few
hundred followers, mostly in Lebanon.
	   Born in Jaffa in then-Palestine in 1937, Abu Nidal's main
targets have been Israelis. But he also was blamed for killing some
of Yasser Arafat's chief aides after he split with the PLO leader,
claiming he was not keeping up the struggle against Israel.
	   The terrorist leader is not wanted in the United States, though
he has been blamed for blowing up two American airliners: a Pan Am
jet on the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in 1974 in the
air over the Aegean Sea. The combined death toll was 120.
	   His most famous attacks were the twin assaults on ticket
counters of the Israeli airline El Al at Rome and Vienna airports
on Dec. 27, 1985. Eighteen people were killed and 120 wounded.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with China saying Libya's response
`reasonable;' saying it has amendments to draft, US and UK still
eager to push through resolution quickly; Libyans noting that the
proposal took months to arrive at &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya has asked the Security Council to
delay any decision on a U.S.-British proposal to try two suspects
in the Pan Am bombing in the Netherlands until it can study the
proposal further, according to a letter made public Wednesday.
	   The Security Council was considering the Libyan request, but
both the British and U.S. representatives said they still wanted to
push through a resolution quickly. China said the Libyan concerns
were reasonable.
	   The letter, from the Libyan deputy ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg,
was dated Aug. 25 and represented the first official reaction from
Tripoli on the proposal.
	   ``Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned,'' the letter said.
	   But it said Libya's judicial authorities needed more time to
study the proposal and requested international experts ``more
familiar with the laws of the states'' help explain the complex
details of the plan.
	   The letter noted that the U.S.-British proposal took several
months to achieve, that Libya had only received it on Monday
evening, and that it had to be translated into Arabic.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States had insisted
the trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if found guilty, they would
serve their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   The Security Council was considering Libya's request in
consultations Wednesday on a U.S.-British-sponsored draft
resolution to back the initiative and suspend U.N. sanctions when
the suspects arrive in the Netherlands for trial.
	   The draft threatened other sanctions if Libya does not produce
the suspects in a timely manner.
	   ``The Libyan government obviously has the right to study the
text but the Libyan government has also had access to legal
expertise on the Scottish system for a long time,'' said Britain's
deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall.
	   ``We believe that fundamentally it is a political decision for
the Libyan government to make.''
	   China believes the council should consider a delay because the
issue involves such complicated legal questions that have taken
months for the United States and Britain to work out, China's
deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang said.
	   ``Their request is reasonable,'' Shen said. China also has some
amendments of its own that it wants addressed in the resolution,
Shen said, without elaborating.
	   Gomersall added that on the basis of Wednesday's consultations,
``We are optimistic that we will be able to put a text of a draft
resolution to the vote fairly soon.''

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The thud and echo of artillery fire
shuddered through empty streets in Congo's capital, where a
three-week-old civil war rumbled Wednesday into the eastern
suburbs.
	   The city, already battered by power cuts and water shortages,
was bracing for what some believe may be the start of a full-scale
rebel assault on Kinshasa.
	   The government moved quickly to calm rising fears, but sent out
mixed signals to an uncertain population.
	   Few pedestrians ventured out past tense soldiers patrolling
deserted neighborhoods _ a dramatic shift from the scene one day
earlier when crowds of cheering and waving residents welcomed
President Laurent Kabila back to the city.
	   The fighting between government soldiers and rebel forces trying
to oust Kabila raged through the night and only began tapering off
in the afternoon.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the situation was under
control, but a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the city.
	   Rumors _ in the absence of hard facts from the government _ ran
rampant through the city. Many people, clustered around transistor
radios, speculated on whether the fighting was the last desperate
act of a rebel side on the run or indeed a coordinated offensive to
take the city.
	   The scale of Wednesday's assault was not immediately clear, but
rebel fighters just days before had been retreating in a corridor
of land stretching about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Kinshasa
to the Atlantic coastline.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwe warplanes have been staging air strikes in
support of their troops who were battling the rebels.
	   Mumengi described the latest fighting as an operation by
government forces to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like
monkeys'' in the forests around Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   Doctors from Kinshasa's General Hospital said hundreds of
fighters had been wounded or killed.
	   Troops with bullet and shrapnel wounds were pouring into the
General Hospital, said one doctor who asked not to be identified.
	   The artillery and small arms battle, sustained through the
morning, came after a string of defeats in recent days that had
seemingly put the rebels on the defensive in western Congo.
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military.
	   Wednesday's fighting centered around Kinshasa's airport in the
area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke districts, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   The mixed sound of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions
rolled through Kinshasa.
	   Green army helicopters, with gunmen leaning out through side
doors, buzzed back and forth just above the city's rooftops.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled the battle and headed to central
Kinshasa.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
suburbs during the night.
	   Mumengi warned city inhabitants to be on guard.
	   ``Since this morning our Congolese forces have been pursuing the
bandits,'' Mumengi said in an unusual live broadcast on Voice of
the People radio. ``Today more than any other day we need to
redouble our efforts against this aggression.''
	   He urged the population to denounce suspected rebel
collaborators.
	   ``This will be a long and popular war. Vigilance. Vigilance,''
he said.
	   Throughout the day, Voice of the People radio broadcast scathing
attacks on neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ both of which have been
accused by Kabila of supporting the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Roadblocks were erected in key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares. Foreign journalists were restricted from venturing
more than a few hundred meters (yards) from their hotels.
	   Often at gunpoint, the few vehicles that went out were stopped
and searched.
	   An Organization of African Unity meeting scheduled in Kinshasa
was canceled Wednesday, as was a planned meeting between the
foreign minister and ambassadors.
	   The United States closed its embassy more than a week ago and
many foreign embassies have sent all but essential staff home.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, though it denies backing the rebels.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.

Report: Hull says Hitler had some good ideas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Hull denial on Wednesday; RESTORES writethru tag;
CORRECTS slug to conform to style. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ North American National Hockey League Hall of Fame
member Bobby Hull was quoted by a Russian newspaper as saying Nazis
were not without merit, that the black population of the United
States was growing too fast, and that genetic breeding was a worthy
idea.
	   ``Hitler, for example, had some good ideas. He just went a
little bit too far,'' the English-language Moscow Times quoted the
former NHL great in Tuesday's editions.
	   On Wednesday, however, Hull issued a fierce denial of the
report.
	   ``The statements attributed to me by the Moscow Times and now
republished by other media outlets are false and defamatory,'' Hull
said in a statement released by his lawyer, Timothy Danson.
	   ``To my mind Adolf Hitler was the most evil and despicable
person who ever lived and there is nothing good or positive that
can ever be said about such an evil man.''
	   The newspaper also quoted the former Chicago Blackhawks and
Winnipeg Jets star as saying the Canadian government was too
liberal and was giving welfare payments to people who don't deserve
them.
	   Asked if it would be fair to describe him as a racist, Hull
reportedly replied: ``I don't give a damn. I'm not running for any
political office.''
	   Hull, 59, gave the interview last week while in Russia as a
guest of the organizers of the annual Spartak Cup.
	   Hull also touched on his relationship with his son, Brett, who
recently signed a free agent contract with the Dallas Stars. It's
been said the relationship has been strained for years. But Hull
said they were close.
	   ``He is a very loyal kid,'' Hull reportedly said. ``Maybe he is
not as strong mentally as I was and can't always follow through on
his decisions.''
	   It was Hull's first visit to the former Soviet Union since 1976,
when the Jets played in the Izvestia Cup. He also played for a
Canadian select team organized by the World Hockey Association, a
rival to the NHL in the 1970s, when it visited Russia in 1974.
	   Hull, who scored 610 goals during 16 NHL seasons and twice won
the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player, said that the
``biggest disappointment of his life'' was not being allowed to
play in the 1972 Canada-Soviet series, which only used NHL players.
	   ``I wanted to play more than anything else. But those big NHL
heads decided to pay me back,'' said Hull, who had 303 goals in
seven seasons in the WHA after leaving the NHL after the 1971-72
season.
	   Hull, who grew up on a farm near Belleville and still breeds
cattle, toured a collective farm in Russia and visited St.
Petersburg.
	   ``I played the way I live _ straightforward,'' Hull said in the
interview. ``I have no regrets about anything I did in life.''
	   However, if he had to do it all again, he reportedly laughed and
said, ``Maybe I'd drink a bit more.''

Anxiety, but not panic, at Russian banks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than a dozen people watched Yuri Deyev punch
the buttons on an automatic teller machine Wednesday, waiting and
wondering whether it would give him any dollars.
	   It didn't.
	   ``They've blocked my account,'' Deyev, a 42-year-old sports
supply company executive, told them as he walked out of the
Rossisky Credit Bank into the rain.
	   The scene has become typical in recent days, as Russia's banking
crisis has deepened. The banks are hoarding what dollars they have
to preserve their hard currency reserves, and are paying out on
dollar accounts only in rubles.
	   For the most part, depositors feel like Deyev _ anxious, but not
panicked.
	   ``Of course I'll lose money. Best case scenario, I'm going to
lose about 15 percent of the thousand dollars I have in savings,''
he said.
	   Russia's ruble sank another 5 percent Wednesday and the first
bank collapsed _ a small commercial bank that like many in Russia
traded in securities but had few customer deposits.
	   Analysts estimate that less than 10 percent of Russians keep
their savings in the commercial banks at risk of failure in
Russia's current financial turmoil. And many of those savings are
deposited in dollars, which have only gained value as the ruble has
lost.
	   The rest keep their money under the mattress or in the state-run
Sberbank, where the deposits are guaranteed.
	   Lines formed at a few banks rumored to be in trouble, but
by-and-large Russians were seeking answers more than withdrawals.
	   ``What do we do?'' a wide-eyed woman asked Deyev, beginning to
cry.
	   ``In a few days everything will be clear,'' he said with a sigh.
	   ``Why doesn't the government control the banks?'' she persisted.
	   ``If the government doesn't have any money, how can it control
the banks?'' he said, exasperated.
	   The problem for Deyev, as for almost all depositors who want to
make withdrawals from hard currency accounts, is deciding whether
to accept rubles or get put on a waiting list for dollars.
	   ``Most banks are suggesting depositors take money out in rubles,
but I admit the exchange rates are really poor,'' said Sergei, a
32-year-old bank clerk at RussoBank, who refused to give his last
name.
	   The small central hall inside the Most-Bank branch on Novy Arbat
Street was packed with over 50 depositors, some leaning on
counters, some sitting on the floor, others nodding off on a couch.
But it remained open, slowly dispensing rubles to those who wanted
them.
	   ``I'm losing a lot on the exchange,'' lamented a 29-year-old
woman outside MostBank, who identified herself only as Maria. ``
But I'm so used to this damn country I'm not so upset about it.
It's more like resignation.''
	   ``It's bad, but it's not a catastrophe,'' Deyev said. ``I
believe in the Federal Reserve of the United States, and I always
will, so I think my ruble losses will be minimal.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's rebels suggested Wednesday
they were ready to talk instead of fight. But Western officials
said Yugoslavia's president wants to continue the battle against
the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The potential olive branch was offered by Adem Demaci, spokesman
for the Kosovo Liberation Army. He said after meeting Western
diplomats that his side would negotiate if Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic, acknowledges ``it cannot win militarily.''
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' Demaci said. Other conditions included
a withdrawal of Serbian special forces and acceptance of the Kosovo
Albanian demand of independence for the province as the basis for
negotiations.
	   But independence has been ruled out by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who controls Serbia's fate. Western powers also
are opposed, fearing a change of borders could trigger a larger
Balkan conflict.
	   Restoration of Kosovo's regional autonomy, which Milosevic
abolished in 1989, would be the most likely compromise, although
most Kosovo Albanians insist they want independence.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with Milosevic in Belgrade
on Tuesday, returned to Pristina on Wednesday for talks with Kosovo
Albanian leaders.
	   Reporting on the talks with Milosevic, a senior Western official
called them ``tough and difficult.'' The official, who asked for
anonymity, said Milosevic refused to call a halt to the months-long
offensive against the guerrillas that has burned scores of villages
and displaced as many as 265,000 people, according to the U.N.
refugee agency.
	   Washington has repeatedly protested the destruction, including
the widespread torching of houses in non-combat situations. But
Milosevic maintained that such acts were the exception.
	   ``The negotiation path is very difficult while villages are
being burned and people are being killed,'' said the official.
	   As fighting continues, creating more refugees, concern is
growing that many people caught without shelter will die during the
winter. The official said Milosevic promised to increase efforts to
allow villagers to return home, but suggested Hill remained
skeptical until returns begin.
	   Gerhard Jandl, a European Union representative, said after
meeting with Demaci that ``the humanitarian situation will amount
to a catastrophe in the fall and winter'' unless refugees are
allowed to return.
	   During a European forum in the Austrian mountain town Alpbach,
Poland's foreign minister, Bronislaw Geremek, said there was little
that international diplomacy could accomplish in Kosovo without
``good will on both sides.''
	   Geremek said efforts to reinforce diplomacy with the threat of
force had failed because the Russians had made clear they would use
their Security Council veto to block any resolution authorizing
NATO to intervene.
	   An assistant U.S. secretary of state was expected in Pristina on
Thursday. Julia V. Taft, an expert in refugees, planned a tour of
some devastated areas.
	   More blood was shed Wednesday in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
account for 90 percent of the population.
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed four ``terrorists'' trying to
smuggle guns from neighboring Albania.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina reported a series of new
KLA attacks on police positions, wounding one policeman.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb
police had entered Banja, a village near the militants' former
stronghold of Malisevo, which police overran last month. The
village was said to be in flames.
	   It reported that three days of clashes near Suva Reka, southwest
of Pristina, had left at least 11 ethnic Albanians dead and caused
more than 10,000 refugees to flee into a valley connecting Suva
Reka with Malisevo.
	   In the Glogovac region, north of Suva Reka, Serb forces killed
six ethnic Albanians over the past two days, according to the the
ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of Human Rights and
Freedoms.
	   Two victims were tortured before the Serb forces killed them,
the council claimed.

the government to show no mercy to cab drivers arrested for
cheating foreign visitors.
	   The call came Wednesday when four taxi drivers were charged with
overcharging three people, including a foreigner who was about to
pay double for a ride from the Athens airport to the Acropolis.
	   ``They should chop off their heads,'' said Thimios Lyberopoulos,
the head of Athens' taxi drivers association.
	   Lyberopoulos made the comment after complaining that local
authorities were too lenient with a taxi driver who last week
charged an Australian tourist 25 times the normal fare for a ride
from the airport.
	   That driver charged 38,500 drachmas (dlrs 127) for a trip that
should have cost no more than 1,500 drachmas (dlrs 5) for the
1,600-meter (one-mile) ride to a travel agency.
	   Local authorities Tuesday suspended his license for two weeks
and fined him 60,000 drachmas (dlrs 195).
	   Tourism officials worried about Greece's image abroad have in
the past launched campaigns to improve the manners of often rude
taxi drivers, especially those who work at the airport.
	   Lyberopoulos said nearly two dozen had been arrested for
overpricing this year, and called on the government to implement
planned legislation that will impose stiff penalties on cheaters.
He said his union did not have the power to discipline its members.
	   Athens's 17,000 or so taxis are among the cheapest in the
European Union and complement the often disorganized mass transit
system.

Sampras could have tough road to regain U.S. Open crown

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras was drawn to face Andre Agassi in
the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, and the road to a fifth title
according to Wednesday's draw could get tougher from there for the
ATP Tour's No. 1-ranked player.
	   Patrick Rafter, the defending champion from Australia, could
face Sampras in the semifinals if the draw plays out.
	   Sampras starts play with a relatively easy foe, Marc Goellner of
Germany, in his bid for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam tournament
singles title when the Open begins its two-week run on Monday.
	   But to reach the final at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Sampras would
have to get past 15th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain in the
fourth round, No. 8 Agassi and Rafter. He then could face No. 2
Marcelo Rios of Chile for the title.
	   Also with Sampras in the top half of the draw, staged Wednesday
at the National Tennis Center, are hard-serving Croatian Goran
Ivanisevic, who is seeded 14th, and Britain's Greg Rusedski, last
year's runner-up who holds the record for the fastest serve, along
with No. 9 Karol Kucera of Slovakia and No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden.
	   If the seedings hold, Agassi would play Kucera, Rafter would
face Ivanisevic and Bjorkman would take on Rusedski in the fourth
round.
	   The fourth-round pairings in the bottom half of the men's draw
could pit No. 5 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands against No. 11
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, No. 4 Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic against No. 13 Tim Henman of Britain, No. 7 Alex Corretja
against No. 10 Carlos Moya in a battle of Spaniards, and Rios
against No. 16 Albert Costa of Spain.
	   In the women's draw, top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland
will begin the defense of her title against a qualifier, while No.
2 Lindsay Davenport of the United States will play Romania's
Catalina Cristea in an opening-round match.
	   If the seedings hold, the fourth-round pairings would be Hingis
against No. 16 Ai Sugiyama of Japan, No. 6 Monica Seles against No.
14 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium, No. 3 Jana Novotna of the Czech
Republic against No. 9 Irina Spirlea of Romania, No. 8 Steffi Graf
of Germany against No. 11 Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, No. 5
Venus Williams of the United States against No. 12 Mary Pierce of
France, No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain against No. 15 Anna
Kournikova of Russia, No. 7 Conchita Martinez of Spain against No.
13 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, and Davenport against No. 10
Nathalie Tauziat of France.

Palestinian, Israeli negotiators quietly leave Norway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment from Norwegian foreign
minister. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian and Israeli negotiators quietly
ended talks aimed at breaking an 18-month deadlock in the Middle
East peace process on Wednesday without commenting on the result.
	   According to Norwegian and U.S. officials, the negotiators and
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross slipped out of Oslo on Wednesday
morning, and did not wish to make any statement.
	   Later in the day, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who
organized the meeting, said the silence did not indicate failure.
	   ``This was not a breakdown. If anything it was the opposite,
since they have agreed to continue talks,'' said Vollebaek at
Oslo's Fornebu Airport upon his return from an unrelated meeting.
He would not say when and where future talks would take place.
	   The Palestinians and Israelis were in Oslo to mark the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo Accords, a peace agreement that was
finalized in August 1993 after months of secret talks brokered by
Norway.
	   The peace process has been stalled since the right-wing Likud
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in
Israeli in May 1996. Netanyahu took over from Shimon Peres, of the
Labor Party.
	   During the anniversary gathering, delegations led by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and Meir Sheetrit, a top member of the
Likud coalition government, met in private to discuss such
obstacles to the peace process as Israeli withdrawals from occupied
territory.
	   Arafat left on Tuesday morning, in keeping with his original
schedule, while the delegations and Ross extended their stays to
continue talks.
	   On Tuesday, Ross, the U.S. envoy, said some progress had been
made in narrowing the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians,
but refused to discuss details. He left Oslo on Wednesday morning,
and did not wish to comment on the meetings, according to Michael
T. Scanlin, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Oslo.
	   Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister, said the point of the
fifth anniversary ceremony was to get the parties talking again.
	   ``These informal talks between the parties maintained a contact
between Israelis and Palestinians that was in danger of being
broken,'' said Vollebaek. He said he had briefed Netanyahu about
the talks by telephone, and was assured that Israel wants to move
ahead in the peace process.
	   Vollebaek said difficult issues remaining include the withdrawal
of Israeli troops from a portion of the West Bank, and Palestinian
security guarantees for Israel. He said those conflicts are
possible to solve, although there was no specific agreement in
Oslo.

President: dlrs 11 billion invested in Kazakstan since 1993
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign investment in Kazakstan totaled dlrs 11
billion since 1993, Kazak president said Wednesday, as he praised
his policies for attracting foreign investors.
	   Many foreign companies have moved to this former Soviet republic
to explore oil fields near the Caspian Sea. But Kazakstan has
lagged in political and economic reform and President Nursultan
Nazarbayev does not allow challenges to his authority.
	   But Nazarbayev said Wednesday that investors have been attracted
by ``political stability, the unchanging strategy of the country's
leadership and a favorable investment climate,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Nazarbayev said 35 percent of the investments were in the oil
and gas industries, and the rest in steel, metallurgy, energy and
other areas.
	   In the first six months of this year, direct investments in the
Kazak economy totaled 2.688 billion tenge (dlrs 34.4 million), he
said.
	   The Kazak president has earlier said he seeks dlrs 3 to 4
billion in investments each year.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - IMF managing director Michel Camdessus
arrived in Ukraine Wednesday to meet with the leaders of Belarus,
Russia and Crimea in the wake of a financial crisis shaking Moscow.
	   Camdessus arrived in the Crimean capital of Simferopol and
headed for the peninsula's southern coast where Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma is staying at a government resort, the Interfax news
agency quoted a Crimean parliament source as saying.
	   There was no immediate independent confirmation to the report.
	   Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in Crimea earlier
in the day for a previously scheduled summit with Kuchma.
	   Acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also has left
Moscow for Crimea. The Russian government's press service said
President Boris Yeltsin has approved his trip and meetings with the
Ukrainian and Belarusian leaders.

	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Reigning British Amateur champion
Sergio Garcia of Spain, defending champion Matt Kuchar of the
United States and Australia's Aaron Baddeley helped fill the field
of 64 who advanced to the match play U.S. Amateur Golf Championship
on Wednesday.
	   Two-time runner-up Joel Kribel led the group winnowed from the
starting field of 312 with a 66 on Tuesday, finishing two rounds at
3-under 136 total.
	   One behind at 137 was American Charles Howell, followed by
countryman David Eger at 138.
	   After a 1 1-2-hour delay caused by lightning and heavy rain, a
downpour suspended play in the second stroke-play round Tuesday
night with 94 players still on the courses at Oak Hill, the venue
for the 1995 Ryder Cup.
	   After those rounds were completed Wednesday morning, the cutoff
ended up at 6-over 145 and 10 players at 145 faced off in a playoff
for the last eight slots. Among those who squeaked through was Andy
Miller, son of 1973 U.S. Open champion Johnny Miller.
	   The first match play round was set to start later Wednesday.
	   Baddeley finished with a 141 and Garcia with a 142.

German party says military suits are being produced in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A small opposition party alleged Wednesday
that a German military contractor is producing uniforms at
Yugoslav-run factories in Kosovo.
	   Winfried Nachtwei of the left-leaning Greens said it would be an
``unbelievable political scandal'' if Germany were supporting the
military industry of Yugoslavia, which is at war with separatist
Albanians in the Yugoslavian region of Kosovo.
	   The Defense Department provided no details about its uniforms
contracts, saying only that the primary contractors would be German
companies.
	   But the agency said it was reviewing details of the contracts
and the subcontractors involved, and that it would take action if
anything was done improperly.
	   The agency also said it would check whether any production in
Yugoslavia began before the 1995 lifting of economic sanctions on
Yugoslavia for its role in the Bosnian war. European countries have
discussed but not implemented any new sanctions in light of the
Kosovo conflict.
	   Nachtwei and party colleagues said that textile industry sources
say Yugoslavian firms in the Kosovo region have a 40-million-mark
(dlrs 22 million) contract to produce camouflage suits for the
German military.
	   The suits are designed to protect soldiers from detection by
night-vision equipment, the Greens said.

Doctors: woman forced to give birth in car because of closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army confirming complaints and ordering
investigation &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers at a roadblock held up
a Palestinian woman in labor who then gave birth in a car and
arrived at a hospital with her newborn gasping for air, doctors
said Wednesday.
	   The child died minutes after arrival at Alia Hospital in Hebron
on Tuesday evening, said deputy director Abdel Rahim Namoura.
	   Namoura said the cause of death could not be determined until an
autopsy was performed. However, Namoura said the child's chances
for survival would have been much higher had the mother,
24-year-old Fadwa Adam, made it to the hospital on time.
	   The Israeli army's brigade commander for Hebron ordered soldiers
manning checkpoints in the Hebron area to be questioned and later
confirmed the incident occurred.
	   ``Results of a preliminary investigation ordered by the Hebron
commander confirmed that a Palestinian vehicle arrived yesterday at
the northern checkpoint in Hebron. The driver asked the soldiers to
enter the city and emphasized that one of the passengers was
pregnant, but the soldiers did not allow the vehicle to enter,'' a
statement from the army spokesman's office said.
	   ``The Hebron brigade commander has appointed an officer to
oversee an inquiry into the incident,'' the statement said.
	   The case was the second in four days in which Israeli troops
were accused of indirectly causing the death of a Palestinian
child.
	   Israeli troops have been enforcing a closure on the West Bank
town of Hebron since last Thursday when a Jewish settler was killed
in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   Under the closure, no one can enter or leave the city of 130,000
Palestinians.
	   Bassem Khatib, the deputy police chief in Hebron, said Mrs. Adam
from the village of Betula west of Hebron was trying to reach Alia
Hospital on Tuesday evening after she went into labor.
	   Adam and her husband drove toward Hebron, but were stopped at an
Israeli army checkpoint west of the city, Khatib said. Soldiers
turned back the couple. In order to reach the hospital, the Adams
had to take a longer unpaved backroad, Khatib said.
	   Mrs. Adam gave birth in the car and her baby was gasping for air
when she finally reached Alia Hospital at 8:30 p.m., Khatib said.
	   In a related development, the army said it was looking into the
death of a 3-month-old Palestinian boy in Hebron on Saturday. The
child's parents said the boy died because Israeli troops enforcing
a curfew in the center of town refused to let them seek medical
treatment for their son.
	   The army said it questioned soldiers in the city and did not
find evidence of a child dying at one of the checkpoints. The
Hebron area commander visited the family and offered humanitarian
aid.
	   The army said soldiers have instructions to allow those
requiring medical care to pass checkpoints without delay.

Angolan government threatens military action against former UNITA

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A top Angolan official warned the former
rebel group UNITA on Wednesday that the government could take
military action if it did not turn over rural strongholds by the
end of the week, news reports said.
	   The government has given UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ until Aug. 28
to comply fully with the 1994 peace accord that ended its
two-decade civil war.
	   ``If the international community does not pressure UNITA, the
government will take political, moral, psychological and even
military action,'' Interior Minister Santana Pitra was quoted as
saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its four remaining
central highland strongholds has held up full implementation of the
peace pact and has brought U.N. and U.S. sanctions.
	   UNITA accused the countries monitoring the peace process _ the
U.S., Russia and Portugal _ of bias towards the government and said
Monday it was severing ties with them.
	   Pitra said UNITA's decision was simply a way of stalling
implementation of the peace deal, according to Lusa.
	   Pitra was speaking in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa.
	   The new U.N. envoy to Angola was to arrive Friday in the former
Portuguese colony, Lusa reported.
	   Issa Diallo was to replace Alioune Blondin Beye, who died in a
plane crash in June.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ The only bang guests expected to
hear at Tomer Cohen's wedding was the sound of a single glass
breaking, the traditional end to a Jewish wedding ceremony.
	   But what they heard instead at Tuesday's ceremony were huge
explosions of Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese guerrillas. The
shells slammed down near the candle-lit outdoor ceremony as the
bride and groom exchanged vows.
	   Most of the guests fled before the rabbi said ``mazel tov,'' or
congratulations.
	   The sudden breakup of the wedding underscored the ability of
Islamic guerrillas over the border to disrupt life for Israel even
if they cannot drive Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
	   Tuesday, Israeli forces tracked and killed a leading guerrilla
figure in south Lebanon, the head of the militant Amal group Israel
holds responsible for recent attacks on soldier outposts. Hours
later came a massive rocket barrage over the border onto Israeli
towns.
	   The attacks spilled over into Wednesday's violence with a member
of an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia killed in sporadic exchanges
of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   The militia man from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA), was killed when Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the SLA, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Later, the Israeli army said its helicopter gunships were
attacked by anti-air craft fire. ``The helicopters fired back and
returned safely to base,'' the statement.
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over.
	   There was controversy in Israel over whether the killing of
Hossan al-Amin of Amal was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, a retired
general from the opposition Labor Party, said it was a mistake
because it put Israeli civilians at risk.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Israel army radio.
	   However, party colleague Ephraim Sneh, also a retired general,
said the killing was justified. Interviewed on Israel radio he said
that ``the correct and the most effective way to fight terrorism is
by killing their key figures.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured damaged homes
of Kiryat Shemona Wednesday, visited some of the 19 people wounded
and defended the army's action.
	   President Ezer Weizman also lobbed criticism, saying ``I hope
the army thought things through before they did it.''
	   Weizman, who also paid a visit to Kiryat Shemona Wednesday, went
to a community center hit by one of the rockets where another
couple's wedding was disrupted during the attacks. He invited Eitan
and Lilah Maman to spend a weekend in a hotel of their choice,
anywhere in Israel, at his expense.
	   Tomer and Irit Cohen's wedding nuptuals were also disrupted
during the rocket strike.
	   ``When the first barrage landed, people were hysterical and a
number of women fainted,'' said the groom's friend Yaacov Abutbul.
After a second set of rockets landed close to the outdoor ceremony
on the edge of the city, ``most of the guests left, but the
ceremony continued after a few minutes,'' he said. The bride and
groom later left for their honeymoon to the Israeli city of Tel
Aviv, far-away from the fighting.

Taliban claim to have downed cargo plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Taliban rockets brought down a cargo
plane Wednesday in Afghanistan that the Islamic militia claimed was
supplying opposition fighters with arms from its foreign backers.
	   A Taliban source reached by telephone in their southern Afghan
stronghold of Kandahar said the plane was hit as it landed at the
airport in Baghram, held by Ahmed Shah Masood, the military chief
they ousted two years ago from the capital, Kabul. The airport, 60
kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Kabul, is the last functioning
airport in Masood's hands.
	   If the unconfirmed Taliban report were true, it would mean that
aircraft at the airport were vulnerable to rocket attack.
	   The Taliban source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane was carrying arms and ammunition, but he did not specify from
which country. The Taliban accuse Russia and Iran of prolonging the
war by backing their enemies, while the anti-Taliban alliances
levels similar charges at Pakistan.
	   Taliban victories further north earlier this month also cut off
Masood's land route for supplies from neighboring Central Asian
countries. The Taliban control most of Afghanistan, and surround
the last remaining opposition strongholds in the north.
	   Russian and Iranian news agencies reported fierce fighting
Wednesday in the north. The Itar-Tass and IRNA reports said the
anti-Taliban alliance gained ground in far northeastern Takhar
province.

35 feared dead as boat capsizes in swollen river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ As many as 35 people were feared killed
Wednesday when a boat carrying 50 passengers across a river swollen
by monsoon rain capsized in eastern India, police said.
	   Divers managed to pull out one dead body from the swirling
waters of the Ai River. Fifteen people swam to shore but there was
no trace of 34 other passengers.
	   All the victims were going to shop at a weekly market across the
river from their village. The accident took place in Assam state's
Goalpara district which is 1,350 kilometers (800 miles) east of the
Indian capital New Delhi.
	   Inspector General N. Ramachandran said army and paramilitary
divers were searching for survivors or dead bodies in the river.
Details were not immediately available because of the remote
accident site.

Russian government tries reassure investors as crisis deepens

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government failed to restore
confidence in its collapsing banking sector Wednesday with the
ruble sinking ever lower and despondent investors tallying their
mounting losses.
	   There were signs the financial crisis was escalating. For the
first time ever, the Central Bank canceled already agreed dollar
sales, and the government failed to make payments on longer-term
debt previously unaffected by the crisis.
	   But while some Russians were irked that they could withdraw bank
deposits only in rubles, not dollars, the situation on the streets
remained anxious, not panicky.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman waiting outside a
branch of the troubled SBS-Agro bank who identified herself only as
Julia.
	   The government devalued the ruble 10 days ago, which has swelled
demand for dollars both among banks and the public. Banks with
inadequate hard currency reserves are expected to collapse, and the
first went belly up Wednesday _ Imperial Bank, a small commercial
bank that like many in Russia concentrates on money speculation
instead of customer deposits.
	   Anatoly Chubais, a former top Kremlin policymaker highly
regarded in the West, said the government is in a tight spot.
	   ``On the one hand, the banking system should be prevented from
complete collapse, but on the other hand declare the bankrupt banks
bankrupt,'' he said.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin rushed to Ukraine to
hold an emergency meeting with International Monetary Fund head
Michel Camdessus. He was expected to plead with the IMF not to
delay the next installment of a multibillion dollar loan that
Russia has been using to shore up its Central Bank reserves _
eroded by the effort of supporting the ruble.
	   Traders and investors expressed dismay with a government debt
repayment plan announced Tuesday, and their disappointment dragged
the stock market even further down _ closing at 76.26 points, down
8 percent from Tuesday in feeble trading.
	   ``Many thought the debt swap conditions were just
unacceptable,'' said Mikhail Koltsov, trader at Moscow-based
investment bank MFK-Renaissance.
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the debt restructuring _ in
some cases receiving just 17 cents on the dollar, according to some
analysts _ will discourage many from returning any time soon.
	   In a further worrying sign, a number of major Western banks
reported the Russian government had also defaulted on payments on
long-term government debt not covered by the restructuring plan.
	   The ruble dropped another 5 percent, ending at 8.26 rubles to
the dollar or 12.1 cents. It plummeted even more _ nearly 40
percent _ against the German mark, as banks went after marks.
	   The Central Bank, afraid to spend more of its reserves on
propping up the currency, decided instead to cancel the dollar
transactions _ the first time it took such a step since Russia
began its free market reforms in 1992.
	   The move suggested the government was giving up efforts to stem
the fall of the ruble and analysts said the government should
consider imposing currency controls _ in effect, taking the ruble
off the open market.
	   In an interview late in the day on Echo Moscow radio, Central
Bank spokeswoman Irina Yasina denied that currency controls were in
the works, saying the country is not yet ready to switch to ``a
different economic model.''
	   Parliament leaders moved forward, meanwhile, with plans to form
a governing coalition with Chernomyrdin that would give top jobs to
hard-liners and Communists.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov also renewed his call
for President Boris Yeltsin to resign and warned his faction and
allies would only vote to approve Chernomyrdin if he gives the
opposition a say in his program.
	   ``So far the talk has been all about how `we should work
together,''' Zyuganov said. ``I don't believe a single word from
Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin.''
	   Lawmakers in the lower house, the State Duma, proposed a
power-sharing agreement with the government that would curb
Yeltsin's powers and give parliament a say in Cabinet appointments.
	   Parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleznyov, who is also a
Communist, offered his own cure for Russia's crisis: the government
should print money and renationalize the nation's small and
medium-size commercial banks.
	   Seleznyov said it was high time for Russia to ``part with
monetarism,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Sudan warns U.S. refusal of investigation further angers Muslims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Bombings, Sudan-Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The American refusal to support a U.N.
investigation into whether a bombed pharmaceutical factory was
producing precursors for chemical weapons will further alienate
Muslims from a United States they already distrust, Sudan's
information minister said Wednesday.
	   The United States has said it possesses a soil sample from El
Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. that contains traces of a
chemical used in making VX nerve gas. A U.S. strike Thursday
destroyed the factory. Sudan has said the plant only made
pharmaceuticals and has called the attack criminal.
	   The Sudanese government has repeatedly demanded a U.N.
investigation to settle the matter.
	   The United States says no investigation is needed because
Washington already has compelling evidence.
	   ``To depend on brute force to convince people, to intimidate
people, that's no use. They might get away with it, OK, but
ultimately, it's not going to help them in their fight against
terrorism,'' Information Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din, a leading
official in the government, told The Associated Press.
	   He said the U.S. stand would anger Muslims who already resent
American policy in the Middle East, particularly its support for
Israel.
	   From the start, Sudan has sought to frame the attack as
aggression against not only Sudan but all Muslims in general.
	   ``They have created exactly the right atmosphere for terrorism
to grow and to become worse. It's just like creating the right
atmosphere for disease to spread,'' Salah el-Din said. ``You are
creating the atmosphere for new recruits.''
	   The United States attacked the plant after the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Its relations with Sudan soured soon after a 1989 coup brought
the Islamic government to power. The United States has cut off all
but humanitarian aid, withdrawn its diplomats, imposed sanctions
and added Sudan to its list of nations that support terrorism.
	   Salah el-Din suggested the soil sample did not exist, and if it
did, it was either tampered with or taken from another country.
	   ``It's absurd, it's ridiculous. I think we have won the argument
by default. They have a lot to hide. Obviously, we have nothing to
hide, we have opened the facility,'' he said.
	   Sudan was reported to have cooperated with Iraq in military
production, including chemical weapons manufacturing, a field in
which Iraq gained expertise before U.N. inspectors began
dismantling its arms programs after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But Salah el-Din said that although relations with Iraq have
remained strong, it needed neither its military assistance nor
Iraqi experts to help it develop its own industry.
	   ``The market is full of experts, full of supply,'' he said.
``You don't have to go to the Iraqis for experts.''
	   Iraq has also denied that it helped Sudan build chemical
weapons.
	   Salah e-Din said it was possible some Iraqi experts had visited
the country, but added, ``We don't have a program of cooperation.''

Belarusian president calls on Moscow to change economic policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
called on Russia Wednesday to change its economic policies, saying
he could not accept the reformist course of Sergei Kiriyenko's
outgoing government.
	   ``I also don't accept the people who realized that course,''
Lukashenko said in Crimea, where he arrived to meet with Ukraine's
President Leonid Kuchma.
	   The hard-line Belarusian president, who is nostalgic for the
Soviet Union and is said to favor a command economy, refrained from
direct comment on the re-appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin to head
the Russian government.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the shakeup last weekend
after Kiriyenko's Cabinet failed in its efforts to combat a major
financial crisis in Russia.
	   Lukashenko, however, said the question ``is not that of
personalities,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``If something needs to be changed there, it's the policy
course. It does not matter who is put in charge of that course,''
Lukashenko said.
	   The Belarusian president praised his union treaty with Russia,
saying it has served to boost trade turnover by as much as 50
percent.

<TEXT>
	   CHAMONIX, France (AP) _ Two Spanish climbers died on Wednesday
after falling several hundred meters (yards) while descending Mont
Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, authorities said.
	   The deaths brought to ten the number of climbers to have died on
the peak since the weekend.
	   The climbers, who were not identified, fell to their deaths on
the icy northern approach to the peak a few hours after having
reached the summit in the morning, local police said.
	   Eight climbers died and three were gravely injured last weekend
while scaling Mont Blanc.
	   Mont Blanc, at the borders of France and Italy, is Europe's
highest mountain at 4,800 meters (15,750 feet).

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity
formally opened a home for disabled children Wednesday as part of
birthday celebrations for the nun who dedicated her life to serving
the poor.
	   The home, named Dayadaan or ``gift of kindness'' is the 602nd
home for the poor run by Mother Teresa's charity.
	   ``This home was one of mother's favorite dreams. This is one of
the best gifts we could give to mother on her birthday'' said
Sister Nirmala, who succeeded Mother Teresa last year as head of
the charity.
	   The building for the home was donated by a Calcutta businessman,
who gifted it to the charity before he died. Dayadaan can
accommodate 150 children.
	   Earlier Wednesday, thousands of residents of this eastern
metropolis joined nuns of Missionaries of Charity in prayers on the
88th anniversary of Mother Teresa's birth.
	   ``On this sacred day, we rededicate ourselves to the services of
the poorest of the poor and toward the path shown by our beloved
mother,'' Sister Nirmala said.
	   ``Mother Teresa is no more. But we feel she is everywhere.''
said Sister Mary Thomas, one of the participants.
	   Hundreds of children lined up for mass at the orphanage and
other institutions that Mother Teresa founded in Calcutta.
	   Meanwhile, a proposal by a group of citizens to install a statue
of Mother Teresa in a public park was put off after the local
municipal officials withdrew permission.
	   The residents formed a committee to raise money to pay for the
statue. The Missionaries of Charity objected, saying no money could
be raised in the name of Mother Teresa. Municipal officials then
refused permission to set up the statue. The citizens group has
filed a lawsuit against the local government and the case is still
being heard.

Doctors: woman forced to give birth in car because of closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army confirming complaints and ordering
investigation &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers at a roadblock held up
a Palestinian woman in labor who then gave birth in a car and
arrived at a hospital with her newborn gasping for air, doctors
said Wednesday.
	   The child died minutes after arrival at Alia Hospital in Hebron
on Tuesday evening, said deputy director Abdel Rahim Namoura.
	   Namoura said the cause of death could not be determined until an
autopsy was performed. However, Namoura said the child's chances
for survival would have been much higher had the mother,
24-year-old Fadwa Adam, made it to the hospital on time.
	   The Israeli army's brigade commander for Hebron ordered soldiers
manning checkpoints in the Hebron area to be questioned and later
confirmed the incident occurred.
	   ``Results of a preliminary investigation ordered by the Hebron
commander confirmed that a Palestinian vehicle arrived yesterday at
the northern checkpoint in Hebron. The driver asked the soldiers to
enter the city and emphasized that one of the passengers was
pregnant, but the soldiers did not allow the vehicle to enter,'' a
statement from the army spokesman's office said.
	   ``The Hebron brigade commander has appointed an officer to
oversee an inquiry into the incident,'' the statement said.
	   Israeli troops have been enforcing a closure on the West Bank
town of Hebron since last Thursday when a Jewish settler was killed
in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   Under the closure, no one can enter or leave the city of 130,000
Palestinians.
	   Bassem Khatib, the deputy police chief in Hebron, said Mrs. Adam
from the village of Betula west of Hebron was trying to reach Alia
Hospital on Tuesday evening after she went into labor.
	   Adam and her husband drove toward Hebron, but were stopped at an
Israeli army checkpoint west of the city, Khatib said. Soldiers
turned back the couple. In order to reach the hospital, the Adams
had to take a longer unpaved backroad, Khatib said.
	   Mrs. Adam gave birth in the car and her baby was gasping for air
when she finally reached Alia Hospital, Khatib said.
	   The case was the second in four days in which Israeli troops
were accused of indirectly causing the death of a Palestinian
child.
	   The army also said it was looking into the death Saturday of a
3-month-old Palestinian boy in Hebron. The child's parents said the
boy died because Israeli troops enforcing a curfew in the center of
town refused to let them seek medical treatment for their son.
	   The army said it questioned soldiers in the city and did not
find evidence of a child dying at one of the checkpoints. The
Hebron area commander visited the family and offered humanitarian
aid.
	   The army said soldiers have instructions to allow those
requiring medical care to pass checkpoints without delay.

Army officers in Romania unearth WWII anti-Hitler pamphlets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Army engineers who were summoned to
detonate an unearthed World War II shell got a surprise when the
blast shook loose 100 old anti-Hitler leaflets buried in the soil
nearby.
	   The papers, written in German and still in good condition, were
found Tuesday in the village of Copalau near Botosani in northern
Romania, authorities said. ``Hitler lies to the German people,
Hitler bring Germany to destruction!'' they said in part.
	   The officers said Wednesday they don't know exactly how the
leaflets came to be in Romania _ a Nazi ally in World War II.
	   ``They arrived by mistake or were thrown from planes by Hitler's
enemies to the German troops settled in the region,'' officer Cezar
Chieriu, of the Botosani Inspectorate for Civilian Protection,
suggested by telephone.
	   One of the finders, Maj. Gheorghe Baltag, said the pamphlets
also contain quotes from speeches made by Hitler between January
1941 and November 1942, with the comment, ``Each word is an obvious

Court: New sick pay rules hold even under old contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KASSEL, Germany (AP) _ Companies are permitted to reduce pay for
sick days even under contracts negotiated before Germany's 1996
sick-pay law went into effect, a court ruled Wednesday.
	   Employers can choose to reduce pay to 80 percent of wages for
days when employees call in sick if their contracts don't specify
conditions for sick pay, the Federal Labor Court said.
	   That applies even for umbrella labor contracts negotiated before
the sick-pay law went into effect Oct. 1, 1996, the court said.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl pushed through the law as a way of
reducing labor costs and making German companies more competitive.
Previously, employers had to pay full wages for up to six weeks a
year of sick leave.
	   Kohl's main challenger in Sept. 27 national elections, Social
Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, has vowed to have the new sick-pay
rules repealed if he wins office.
	   The court on Wednesday rejected four lawsuits by workers in the
concrete, printing, metal and baking industries, who argued that
their contracts predated the sick-pay law and therefore protected
their right to full payment during sick leave.

Israelis shaken after rocket attack on northern communities

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ The only bang guests expected to
hear at Tomer Cohen's wedding was the sound of a single glass
breaking, the traditional end to a Jewish wedding ceremony.
	   But what they heard instead at Tuesday's ceremony were huge
explosions of Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese guerrillas. The
shells slammed down near the candle-lit outdoor ceremony as the
bride and groom exchanged vows.
	   Most of the guests fled before the rabbi said ``mazel tov,'' or
congratulations.
	   The sudden breakup of the wedding underscored the ability of
Islamic guerrillas over the border to disrupt life for Israel even
if they cannot drive Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
	   Tuesday, Israeli forces tracked and killed a leading guerrilla
figure in south Lebanon, the head of the militant Amal group Israel
holds responsible for recent attacks on soldier outposts. Hours
later came a massive rocket barrage over the border onto Israeli
towns.
	   The attacks spilled over into Wednesday's violence with a member
of an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia killed in sporadic exchanges
of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   The militia man from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA), was killed when Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the SLA, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Later, the Israeli army said its helicopter gunships were
attacked by anti-air craft fire. ``The helicopters fired back and
returned safely to base,'' the statement.
	   ``The firing against the Israeli air force was from the Lebanese
army. This is not the first time that the Lebanese army has fired
on air force planes. Whoever shoots against air force planes turns
himself into a target. The army is not interested in involving the
Lebanese army in the conflict,'' the statement said.
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over.
	   There was controversy in Israel over whether the killing of
Hossan al-Amin of Amal was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, a retired
general from the opposition Labor Party, said it was a mistake
because it put Israeli civilians at risk.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Israel army radio.
	   However, party colleague Ephraim Sneh, also a retired general,
said the killing was justified. Interviewed on Israel radio he said
that ``the correct and the most effective way to fight terrorism is
by killing their key figures.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured damaged homes
of Kiryat Shemona Wednesday, visited some of the 19 people wounded
and defended the army's action.
	   ``We will continue to fight terror organizations,'' Netanyahu
said, calling on the Lebanese government to reign in Hezbollah.

Bangladesh asks for foreign aid to cope with flood devastation

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh appealed Wednesday to the
international community for more than dlrs 600 million in immediate
financial aid to help cope with floods that have caused devastation
and claimed more than 550 lives.
	   The rising floodwaters have inundated two-thirds of Bangladesh,
displacing millions of people, damaging standing crops and washing
away roads and bridges.
	   ``The floods have now become an emergency and we have decided to
seek foreign assistance to deal with the situation,'' Finance
Minister Shah Mohammad Kibria told representatives from donor
countries and aid agencies.
	   In addition to the financial help, Bangladesh will need more
than 1.3 million tons of grain to meet a food deficit caused by the
floods that have ravaged this delta nation for nearly two months.
The agriculture ministry estimates the deficit at 2.9 million tons.
	   The United States promised 200,000 tons of grains in immediate
aid and the commitment is expected to increase up to 260,000 tons,
according to the Finance Ministry. Britain, Canada and Norway have
promised to help.
	   ``Nothing is now left in the areas affected by the floods,'' the
finance minister said. The government estimates dlrs 300 million
worth of grain was lost in the flood.

Egypt pressing Libya to accept US-British proposal

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Egypt pressing Libya to accept proposal, details,
ADDS byline
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak's top adviser met
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Wednesday to press him to accept
a U.S.-British proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am passenger jet in the Netherlands, diplomats said.
	   The move came as Gadhafi summoned his senior aides to discuss
the U.S.-British proposal and Libya asked the U.N. Security Council
to delay any decision on the offer until it could further study the
proposal.
	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   London and Washington had earlier insisted that any trial must
be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Mubarak's political adviser, Osama el-Baz, met Wednesday with
Gadhafi in Tripoli to discuss the proposal, Libya's official
television said. The report was monitored in Cairo.
	   The broadcast also said that Libyan officials in Tripoli were
meeting with diplomats from the member states of the Security
Council. The United States and Britain have no diplomatic relations
with Libya.
	   The television gave no further details on the visit, but Arab
diplomats in Cairo, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said el-Baz was trying to persuade Gadhafi to accept the proposal.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Libya asked
for a postponement of Security Council action on the proposal,
saying Libya needed more time to study the offer. It was the first
official reaction from Tripoli on the proposal.
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said Gadhafi was meeting with his senior
aides to discuss the US-British offer and make a recommendation to
the Popular Conference, a committee that is appointed by the
government and acts like a parliament.
	   Gadhafi claims that he acts under the instructions of the
conference and wields no real power in Libya.
	   The diplomats said Gadhafi may also be delaying a decision to
consult with the tribes of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, before making any decision.
	   Al-Megrahi belongs to a major bedouin tribe which has always
given its support to Gadhafi.
	   Under the U.S.-British proposal, the suspects cannot be
extradited from the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve
their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The draft resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not
hand over the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Civil war reaches Congo's capital

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The thud and echo of artillery fire
shuddered through empty streets in Congo's capital, where a
three-week-old civil war rumbled Wednesday into the eastern
suburbs.
	   The city, already battered by power cuts and water shortages,
was bracing for what some believe may be the start of a full-scale
rebel assault on Kinshasa.
	   The government moved quickly to calm rising fears, but sent out
mixed signals to an uncertain population.
	   Few pedestrians ventured out past tense soldiers patrolling
deserted neighborhoods _ a dramatic shift from the scene one day
earlier when crowds of cheering and waving residents welcomed
President Laurent Kabila back to the city.
	   The fighting between government soldiers and rebel forces trying
to oust Kabila raged through the night and only began tapering off
in the afternoon.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the situation was under
control, but a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the city.
	   Rumors _ in the absence of hard facts from the government _ ran
rampant through the city. Many people, clustered around transistor
radios, speculated on whether the fighting was the last desperate
act of a rebel side on the run or indeed a coordinated offensive to
take the city.
	   The scale of Wednesday's assault was not immediately clear, but
rebel fighters just days before had been retreating in a corridor
of land stretching about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Kinshasa
to the Atlantic coastline.
	   Rebel officials urged the capital city's residents to remain
inside.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the head of the rebels' political wing,
told reporters in the eastern Congolese town of Goma.
	   ``We are determined to fight, we are determined to win and
control the city of Kinshasa,'' he said, refusing to provide
further details.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwe warplanes have been staging air strikes in
support of their troops who were battling the rebels.
	   Mumengi described the latest fighting as an operation by
government forces to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like
monkeys'' in the forests around Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   Doctors from Kinshasa's General Hospital said hundreds of
fighters had been wounded or killed. Troops with bullet and
shrapnel wounds were pouring into the hospital, said one doctor who
asked not to be identified.
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   Wednesday's fighting centered around Kinshasa's airport in the
area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke districts, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   The mixed sound of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions
rolled through Kinshasa.
	   Green army helicopters, with gunmen leaning out through side
doors, buzzed back and forth just above the city's rooftops.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled the battle and headed to central
Kinshasa.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
suburbs during the night.
	   Mumengi warned city inhabitants to be on guard.
	   ``Since this morning our Congolese forces have been pursuing the
bandits,'' he said in an unusual live broadcast on Voice of the
People radio. ``Today more than any other day we need to redouble
our efforts against this aggression.''
	   Roadblocks were erected in key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares. Foreign journalists were restricted from venturing
more than a few hundred meters (yards) from their hotels.
	   Often at gunpoint, the few vehicles that went out were stopped
and searched.
	   An Organization of African Unity meeting scheduled in Kinshasa
was canceled Wednesday, as was a planned meeting between the
foreign minister and ambassadors.
	   The United States closed its embassy more than a week ago and
many foreign embassies have sent all but essential staff home.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   But Angolan Interior Minister Santana Pitra, speaking in the
Cape Verde islands off West Africa, said his country would use all
means at its disposal to keep Kabila in power, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Pitra also said Angola's involvement in the conflict was sparked
by fears over the security of its northern border.
	   It was border security concerns that also apparently drew Rwanda
and Uganda into the rebellion. Both countries, however, deny
backing the rebels.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.

	   ROME (AP) _ Captain Paolo Maldini could miss Italy's European
Championships qualifying game against Wales next month because of
an abdominal muscle injury, the ANSA news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Maldini hurt himself Tuesday night during a Serie A exhibition
game that his AC Milan club lost 2-1 to Juventus.
	   The defender's father, Cesare, was fired as Italy's coach in
July, just weeks after a quarterfinal loss to France at the World

Czech government makes no immediate decision on RFE broadcast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite new skepticism by Czech
officials, the government apparently made no immediate decision
Wednesday on whether to allow a U.S.-run radio station to broadcast
from its territory into Iran and Iraq.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the American-sponsored radio
station began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading
uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron
Curtain during the Cold War.
	   Following the collapse of communism, the station moved its
headquarters to Prague in 1995 and began broadcasting out of a
prominent downtown building that once housed Czechoslovakia's
Parliament.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that will be beamed into Iran and Iraq, expanding in
Prague to the former Cuban embassy in a residential part of
northern Prague.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
center-left government of Milos Zeman has had second thoughts in
light of recent terrorist attacks against American targets abroad.
	   ``It is unusual to say the least to place a building which may
be a target of terrorist attacks in a residential area,'' Zeman
told journalists Wednesday.
	   Deputy Premier Pavel Rychetsky also complained that the Cabinet
did not have enough official information from American authorities.
	   ``We were informed with some delay about the Farsi service to be
broadcast into Iran, but never heard officially about the service
into Iraq,'' Rychetsky said without elaborating.
	   There was no announcement after the government's session ended
Wednesday, and it was not clear when a decision would be announced.

Ukrainian government prepares debt restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 8-9 to UPDATE with summit in Ukraine, fresh hryvna
exchange, IMF visit. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet is preparing a debt
restructuring plan that would allow investors to swap treasury
bills denominated in the local currency for dollar bonds, the
Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The plan might be formally signed Wednesday or Thursday, said
ministry spokeswoman Iryna Bezverkha. She declined to disclose
details.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, however, said the proposed dollar
bonds would mature in a period from 18 months to five years and
carry a 12 percent to 14 percent coupon payable semi-annually.
	   Such a proposal would in fact benefit investors, analysts said,
since they stand to lose money if they are to get redemption
payments in the Ukrainian currency, the hryvna, amid a sharp
decline in the currency's exchange rate.
	   Foreign investors currently hold about 18 percent of Ukraine's
outstanding treasury bills, which totaled some 10.3 billion hryvna
(dlrs 4.6 billion) in mid-August, according to Central Bank and
ITAR-Tass figures. In all, 3.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.7 billion)
are expected to mature by the end of 1998 and the rest in 1999.
	   Ukraine, with dlrs 18 billion in foreign debt, long has been
gripped by a financial crisis caused by high-interest borrowing
abroad, the withdrawal of foreign investors from its shaky
financial markets and inability to collect tax payments.
	   Russia's ruble crisis has prompted fears of a further investor
exodus and put a question mark over the future of trade with
Russia, Ukraine's largest economic partner.
	   Acting Russian premier Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived in Ukraine
Wednesday for a whirlwind visit to discuss the crisis with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Belarusian President
Alexander Lukashenko, who also is visiting Ukraine.
	   The sides discussed their nations' economic situation and steps
to towards stabilization, said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr
Maidannik.
	   One major effect of the crisis was the slide of the battered
hryvna down from 2.1435 to the U.S. dollar in mid-August to 2.2491
Wednesday, close to the limit of the government-set currency
fluctuation corridor of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar.
	   Most market analysts expect that corridor to be widened in the
near future.
	   The government's decision to restructure the bond debt
apparently has been accelerated by the IMF's delay in discussing a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   An International Monetary Fund mission approved the release of
the loan last month and its board of directors was expected to
discuss it this week.
	   But on Tuesday, the IMF said it would need more time to assess
the effect of Russia's intensifying financial crisis and political
change on Ukraine before it sets a date for the meeting.
	   ``With recent developments in Russia, we are reviewing the
situation in Ukraine,'' an IMF spokeswoman said in Washington.
	   The delay has put heavy pressure on Ukraine's Central Bank,
which had hoped to used the loan to replenish its coffers. The
bank's reserves have decreased by almost half, to dlrs 1.1 billion
so far this year, in efforts to defend the hryvna.
	   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus also arrived in Crimea
Wednesday, where he met with Kuchma and was expected to meet with
Chernomyrdin.

and the chief of the International Monetary Fund held a series of
meetings Wednesday in the wake of a financial crisis shaking
Russia.
	   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus, who arrived in Ukraine's
Crimea Wednesday evening, headed straight for the peninsula's
southern coast where Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma was staying
at a government resort, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in Crimea earlier
in the day for a previously scheduled summit with Kuchma, and
acting Russian premier Viktor Chernomyrdin rushed to Ukraine from
Moscow.
	   The Russian government's press service said President Boris
Yeltsin has approved Chernomyrdin's trip and meetings with the
Ukrainian and Belarusian leaders. Chernomyrdin also was expected to
meet with Camdessus.
	   Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr Maidannik said Chernomyrdin held a
meeting with Kuchma to discuss ways of minimizing the effects of
the Russian crisis on Ukraine.
	   Chernomyrdin, Lukashenko and Kuchma then held a tripartite
meeting that focused on their countries' shaky financial situation
and ways to stabilize it, he said.
	   A Camdessus-Kuchma session began late Wednesday. There were no
immediate reports about its outcome, but the meeting followed an
IMF announcement that the fund was delaying consideration of a dlrs
2.2 billion loan for Ukraine in view of the crisis in Russia.

Amid new clashes, Kosovo rebel speaker says no side can win

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatists
suggested Wednesday they were ready to talk instead of fight. But
Western officials said Yugoslavia's president wants to continue the
battle.
	   A potential olive branch was offered by Adem Demaci, spokesman
for the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. He said after meeting
Western diplomats Wednesday that the rebels would negotiate if
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, acknowledges ``it cannot
win militarily.''
	   ``We are aware that we, too, cannot win militarily, and one day
we will have to negotiate,'' Demaci said.
	   His comments came amid new fighting in Kosovo, where violence
has intensified in the past six months.
	   Demaci's other conditions included a withdrawal of Serbian
special forces and acceptance of the Kosovo Albanians' demand of
independence as the basis for negotiations. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   But independence for Kosovo has been ruled out by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who controls the fate of both Serbia
and its Kosovo province. Western powers also are opposed, fearing a
change of borders could trigger a larger Balkan conflict.
	   Restoration of Kosovo's regional autonomy, which Milosevic
abolished in 1989, would be the most likely compromise, although
most Kosovo Albanians insist that's not enough.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with Milosevic in the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on Tuesday, returned to Kosovo's
capital Pristina on Wednesday for talks with Kosovo Albanian
leaders.
	   A senior Western official called the talks with Milosevic
``tough and difficult.''
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to halt the Serbs' offensive against the
guerrillas that has burned scores of villages and displaced as many
as 265,000 people, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
	   Washington has repeatedly protested the destruction, including
the widespread torching of houses outside of combat. But Milosevic
maintained that such acts were the exception.
	   ``The negotiation path is very difficult while villages are
being burned and people are being killed,'' said the official.
	   As fighting continues, creating more refugees, concern is
growing that many people caught without shelter will die during the
winter. The official said Milosevic promised to increase efforts to
let villagers return home, but Hill apparently was remaining
skeptical until such returns begin.
	   Gerhard Jandl, a European Union representative who met Wednesday
with Demaci, said after their talks that ``the humanitarian
situation will amount to a catastrophe in the fall and winter''
unless refugees are allowed to return.
	   An assistant U.S. secretary of state was expected Thursday in
Pristina. Julia V. Taft, an expert in refugees, planned a tour of
some devastated areas.
	   More bloodshed was reported Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed four ``terrorists'' trying to
smuggle guns from neighboring Albania.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb
police had entered Banja, a village near the militants' former
stronghold of Malisevo, which police overran last month. The
village was said to be in flames.
	   It reported that three days of clashes near Suva Reka, southwest
of Pristina, had left at least 11 ethnic Albanians dead and caused
more than 10,000 refugees to flee.
	   In the Glogovac region, north of Suva Reka, Serb forces killed
six ethnic Albanians over the past two days, according to the
ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of Human Rights and
Freedoms.

Council working on resolution in spite of Libyan request
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to RECAST, UPDATE with council president saying he's
hopeful for vote Thursday, Russia and Kenya also requesting
amendments, UK saying no time limits on acceptance. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Libya wants time to consider a
U.S.-British proposal to try two suspects in the Pan Am bombing in
the Netherlands, but the U.N. Security Council pressed ahead
Wednesday with plans to put the draft resolution to a vote. .
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hoped a
vote would come Thursday. Discussions were continuing Wednesday
afternoon; China, Russia and Kenya had amendments they wanted
considered, diplomats said.
	   In its first official reaction, Libya asked for a postponement
on a resolution until it had studied the proposal further.
	   The letter from the Libyan deputy ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg
said Libya's judicial authorities needed more time to study the
proposal and requested international experts ``more familiar with
the laws of the states'' to help explain the complex details of the
plan.
	   ``Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned,'' Barg said.
	   The letter noted that the U.S.-British proposal took several
months to achieve, that Libya had only received it on Monday
evening, and that it had to be translated into Arabic.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States had insisted
the trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if found guilty, they would
serve their sentences in Britain.
	   The Security Council noted Libya's request in consultations
Wednesday but proceeded with a U.S.-British-sponsored draft
resolution to back the initiative and suspend U.N. sanctions when
the suspects arrive in the Netherlands for trial.
	   The draft threatened other sanctions if Libya does not produce
the suspects in a timely manner. There is no specific time limit on
acceptance of the proposal, ``but we have said that we expect Libya
to respond quickly and without equivocation to the offer we have
put forward,'' said Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall.
	   ``The Libyan government obviously has the right to study the
text but the Libyan government has also had access to legal
expertise on the Scottish system for a long time,'' he added.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   In Britain, Alistair Duff, a Scottish counsel for the Libyans,
said in Wednesday's The Guardian that some issues have not been
addressed.
	   ``Where are the suspects going to be held in custody? Are they
going to be guaranteed safe passage to and, in the event of
acquittal, from, the trial?'' he was quoted as saying in the
newspaper.
	   The draft resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Israeli helicopter rockets Lebanese army outpost, wounding soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, LEBANON (AP) - An Israeli helicopter gunship fired a
rocket at an army post in southern Lebanon Wednesday, wounding one
soldier and destroying an armored personnel carrier, an army
spokesman said.
	   The helicopter, one of two in the area, was met with
anti-aircraft fire and withdrew after firing on the Lebanese army
position at Maidoun in the western Bekaa Valley, the spokesman
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Israel, the army said its helicopter gunships returned fire
after they were fired upon.
	   It warned that anyone who ``shoots against air force planes
turns himself into a target. The army is not interested in
involving the Lebanese army in the conflict.''
	   Maidoun is one kilometer (mile) west of the Israeli-occupied
security zone in south Lebanon. The outpost is the Lebanese army's
most forward position in the area, some 40 kilometers (24 miles)
southeast of Beirut, the Lebanese capital.
	   The attack came during a day of clashes along the security zone
between Shiite Muslim Amal guerrillas and Israeli soldiers and
their allied militiamen.
	   One member of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia was
killed in the Kantara outpost, a Lebanese security official said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   One Tuesday, a missile from an Israeli helicopter killed Hossam
Al-Amin, an Amal military commander as he drove on a highway in the
south.
	   Later that night, Hezbollah, the largest Shiite guerrilla group
fighting Israeli forces in the south, fired more than 60 Katyusha
rockets on northern Israel to retaliate for attacks by Israeli
troops and allied militiamen that injured six Lebanese civilians
earlier in the day.
	   Nineteen Israeli civilians were injured in those rocket attacks.
	   Wednesday's rocket attack was the first against the Lebanese
army since Sept. 12 when Israeli military aircraft rocketed
positions near the occupied border enclave, killing six soldiers
and a civilian woman and wounding five soldiers.
	   That attack followed clashes between Israeli forces and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in which six Israeli soldiers,
were killed.

Seven World Cup members absent as Spain names Cyprus side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Seven members of this summer's
disappointing Spanish World Cup team were absent Wednesday when
coach Javier Clemente named his 18-man team for next month's
European Championship qualifier in Cyprus.
	   Absent was goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, who has retired from
international play, and six others: Jose Francisco Molina, Ivan
Campo, Julen Guerrero, Juan Antonio Pizzi, Albert Ferrer and Albert
Celades.
	   The 18-man team for the Sept. 5 match in Larnaca, Cyrpus will
feature three new faces: Michel Salgado of Celta, Santiago Ezquerro
of Athletic Bilbao and Antonio Prats of Real Betis.
	   Spain, one of the favorites to win the World Cup, was one of the
most disappointing when it was eliminated in the first round,
prompting wide-spread criticism of Clemente.
	   Clemente, in one of his few statements since the summer debacle,
said Wednesday he'd considered resigning but changed his mind
because of support from players, the Spanish football federation
and, he said, ``people in the street.''
	   The team: Rafael Alkorta, Joseba Etxeberria, Juan Carlos
Aguilera, Francisco Narvaez, Abelardo Fernandez, Luis Enrique
Martinez, Miguel Angel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan, Alfonzo Perez,
Guillermo Amor, Fernando Hierro, Fernando Morientes, Raul Gonzalez,
Augustin Aranzabal, Santiago Canizares.

Agreement to hold 2005 Ryder Cup in Ireland signed

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The PGA European Tour has signed an
agreement for Ireland to host the 2005 Ryder Cup, tour officials
announced Wednesday.
	   Venues for the Ryder Cup will be announced sometime after the
U.S. Masters championship in April, the officials said. Only
courses that hold major events in Ireland or European tour
competitions are under consideration.
	   The agreement includes an eight-year plan to promote the event,
along with tourism in the country. The tour will be paid dlrs 12.2
million for providing marketing and promotion opportunites.
	   The money will come in equal amounts from the government of
Ireland and three major banks, Aer Lingus, Allied Irish Banks and
Waterford Crystal.
	   The decision that Ireland would be the Ryder Cup host nation for
2005 had been announced in September at the 1997 event held at
Valderrama, Spain, but no details had been announced.
	   One goal of the promotional activities is to help the country
become a leading international golf destination, said Ireland
tourism director James McDaid.
	   ``My prediction is that by is that by 2005 we will have at least
500,000 golfers visiting Ireland annually, a doubling of present
numbers,'' said McDaid.
	   He expects the golfers to provide a boom to the country's
tourism industry. Ireland's visitors have tripled since 1986, from
1.7 million to an estimated 5.4 million this year.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ The only bang guests expected to
hear at Tomer Cohen's wedding was the sound of a single glass
breaking, the traditional end to a Jewish wedding ceremony.
	   But what they heard instead at Tuesday's ceremony were huge
explosions of Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese guerrillas. The
shells slammed down near the candle-lit outdoor ceremony as the
bride and groom exchanged vows.
	   Most of the guests fled before the rabbi said ``mazel tov,'' or
congratulations.
	   The sudden breakup of the wedding underscored the ability of
Islamic guerrillas over the border to disrupt life for Israel even
if they cannot drive Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
	   Tuesday, Israeli forces tracked and killed a leading guerrilla
figure in south Lebanon, the head of the militant Amal group Israel
holds responsible for recent attacks on soldier outposts. Hours
later came a massive rocket barrage over the border onto Israeli
towns.
	   The attacks spilled over into Wednesday's violence with a member
of an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia killed in sporadic exchanges
of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   The militia man from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA), was killed when Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the SLA, the Israeli army said.
	   Another Lebanese guerrilla group, Amal, said it also attacked
Israeli positions with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
	   Later, the Israeli army said its helicopter gunships were
attacked by Lebanese army anti-air craft fire, but unharmed.
	   ``Whoever shoots against air force planes turns himself into a
target. The army is not interested in involving the Lebanese army
in the conflict,'' the Israeli army statement said.
	   In Beirut, a spokesman for the Lebanese army said the Israeli
helicopter fired a rocket at an army post in southern Lebanon,
wounding one soldier and destroying an armored personnel carrier.
	   While an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and the
Lebanese army is rare, it does not tend to lead to direct fighting,
which Israel, insisting its quarrel is with the guerrillas, is
eager to avoid.
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in the
bomb shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over.
	   There was controversy in Israel over whether the killing of
Hossan al-Amin of Amal was wise. Legislator Ori Orr, a retired
general from the opposition Labor Party, said it was a mistake
because it put Israeli civilians at risk.
	   ``If you think you can keep tens of thousands of people in bomb
shelters and bring normal activity in northern Israel to a halt,
then by all means carry out such operations. But I don't think you
can,'' he told Israel army radio.
	   However, party colleague Ephraim Sneh, also a retired general,
said the killing was justified. Interviewed on Israel radio he said
that ``the correct and the most effective way to fight terrorism is
by killing their key figures.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured damaged homes
of Kiryat Shemona Wednesday, visited some of the 19 people wounded
and defended the army's action.
	   ``We will continue to fight terror organizations,'' Netanyahu
said, calling on the Lebanese government to rein in Hezbollah.

Security Council considering assistance in upcoming elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council considered
recommendations Wednesday for U.N. assistance in upcoming elections
in the Central African Republic.
	   Council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia said there was ``broad
support for measures'' proposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
that council members were reflecting on his requests.
	   ``I will continue to have bilateral contacts with the council
members and we will see what transpires in that process,'' Turk
said.
	   Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Jean-Paul Ngoupande
accused President Ange-Felix Patasse's government of stalling
legislative elections by deliberately refusing to equip or fund the
country's national electoral commission.
	   Annan's recommendation was not prompted by the allegations, said
his spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   ``It's an offer to assist in the technical side primarily and to
a certain extent on the security side to enhance the chances that
the elections will be fully free and fair,'' Eckhard said.
	   Ngoupande was fired last year after being accused of backing
disgruntled soldiers who launched at least three bloody mutinies.
He warned further delays of the election would provoke a potential
civil war.
	   Elections are scheduled for Sept. 20. But the electoral
commission, which has complained it is not prepared, said it needs
logistical equipment and at least another dlrs 3.1 million in
funding.
	   A number of opposition parties have boycotted the election
plans, accusing Patasse of trying to manipulate the process.
	   United Nations peacekeepers led by eight African countries and
supported by French and Canadian troops will remain in the country
through October to set the stage for the poll.

Egypt pressing Libya to accept US-British proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Libyan letter was to the Security Council, not
secretary-general, ADDS background &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak's top adviser met
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Wednesday to press him to accept
a U.S.-British proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am passenger jet in the Netherlands, diplomats said.
	   The move came as Gadhafi summoned his senior aides to discuss
the U.S.-British proposal and Libya asked the U.N. Security Council
to delay any decision on the offer until it could further study the
proposal.
	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   London and Washington had earlier insisted that any trial must
be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Mubarak's political adviser, Osama el-Baz, met Wednesday with
Gadhafi in Tripoli to discuss the proposal, Libya's official
television said. The report was monitored in Cairo.
	   The broadcast also said that Libyan officials in Tripoli were
meeting with diplomats from the member states of the Security
Council. The United States and Britain have no diplomatic relations
with Libya.
	   The television gave no further details on the visit, but Arab
diplomats in Cairo, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said el-Baz was trying to persuade Gadhafi to accept the proposal.
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Libya asked for a
postponement of Security Council action on the proposal, saying it
needed more time to study the offer. It was the first official
reaction from Tripoli on the proposal.
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said Gadhafi was meeting with his senior
aides to discuss the US-British offer and make a recommendation to
the Popular Conference, a committee that is appointed by the
government and acts like a parliament.
	   Gadhafi claims that he acts under the instructions of the
conference and wields no real power in Libya.
	   The diplomats said Gadhafi may also be delaying a decision to
consult with the tribes of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, before making any decision.
	   Al-Megrahi belongs to a major bedouin tribe which has always
given its support to Gadhafi.
	   Under the U.S.-British proposal, the suspects cannot be
extradited from the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve
their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The draft resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not
hand over the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Nuclear tests form backdrop for Hindu religious festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Devotees throng a colorful enclosure in
which a large idol of a revered elephant-headed Hindu god towers
over a replica of a nuclear test reactor and a miniature model of
the desert where India conducted five underground nuclear tests in
May.
	   Outside, worshippers chants prayers to the sound of drum beats
and bells as they carry home idols of the god Ganesh at the start
of a 10-day festival Wednesday, that marks his birth. Hindus pray
to Ganesh before starting a new venture, asking for prosperity and
wisdom.
	   Vinay Karekar, who learnt the art of painting clay images of
Ganesh from his grandfather, says the theme of the festival this
year is the nuclear explosions.
	   ``We have tried to show that the explosions were necessary, but
India has peaceful intentions. The land of Mahatma Gandhi will
never forget it is bound to peace,'' said Karekar who sells
one-foot to 12 feet high Ganesh idols.
	   While the world condemned India's nuclear test, a large number
of Indian's were defiant. They said India needed nuclear weapons as
a deterrent because powerful nations had not been able to stop
proliferation in its neighborhood.
	   Models of doves were scattered around a platform on which a
10-foot Ganesh idol stood in central Bombay. Alongside were
cardboard cutouts of the scientists who helped conduct the nuclear
tests.
	   Artisans often use the annual Ganesh festival to promote public
messages ranging from campaigns against corrupt politicians to
crusades for women's rights.
	   The intricately painted Ganesh idols are kept at homes for a
period of one to 10 days during which religious ceremonies are
performed daily. The idols are then carried out in huge processions
through the city before they are immersed in the Arabian Sea.
	   In addition to the nuclear theme this year, social workers have
used the Ganesh festival to appeal to devotees to stop using
plastic.
	   Hundreds of thousands of plastic bags used to carry flowers as
offerings to the gods create a nuisance for the city's civic
workers.
	   ``We don't face such a problem with the statues because these
are washed away into the sea, but plastic bags are thrown back onto
the shore,'' said Mukesh Shahani, a solid waste engineer with the
Bombay municipal corporation.
	   Posters were pasted at the entrance of many Ganesh platforms
urging devotees to ``Kick Plastic''. But most worshippers paid more
attention to the sound and light recreations of the nuclear test
explosions rather than to the environment friendly posters.

Angola committed to keeping Congo leader in power, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's Interior Minister said
Wednesday his country will use all means at its disposal to keep
Congolese President Laurent Kabila in power, according to news
reports.
	   Minister Santana Pitra said Angola's military involvement in
neighboring Congo, where it has deployed troops, armor and aircraft
to aid Kabila against insurgents, was prompted by concerns about
security along its northern frontier, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa reported.
	   ``The border would be more unstable than ever if Angola didn't
have the capacity for internal defense and external offense,'' Lusa
quoted Pitra as saying.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war was prompted by government
concerns that Kabila's departure could usher in a new
administration sympathetic to the Angolan former rebel movement
UNITA.
	   UNITA fought a two-decade civil war with the government before
signing a fragile peace accord in 1994.
	   After seizing power last year with Angola's help, Kabila agreed
to cut off UNITA's supply lines between the two countries that
allowed UNITA to smuggle out diamonds and bring in military
equipment, according to the government.
	   However, Pitra said Angola would remain in Congo only as long as
other member countries of the Southern African Development
Community were also involved. Zimbabwe has also sent troops to to
buttress Kabila's forces.
	   Pitra was speaking in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa
where he was attending Guinea-Bissau's peace talks.
	   In Luanda, a source at the military hospital, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said troops wounded in the Congo fighting
were being treated there. However, he declined to say how many had
been admitted, nor would he disclose their nationality.
	   After its weekly Cabinet meeting Wednesday, the government did
not comment on the war in Congo.

Former regional administration chief wins Odessa election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Completing a long political battle, a
former regional administration chief won the mayoral race in the
Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa, election officials said
Wednesday.
	   Final results showed Ruslan Bodelan, an ally of President Leonid
Kuchma, receiving of 36.7 percent of the vote in Sunday's ballot.
	   His primary rival from among the 32 other contestants, Oleksiy
Kostusev, received 22.4 percent of the vote, the city electoral
commission said.
	   The election capped months of political turmoil in one of
Ukraine's major business centers. The central government wants to
use the port to transport Caspian Sea oil to Europe and long has
sought to increase control over Odessa.
	   In a previous mayoral election last March, incumbent Eduard
Hurvits beat Bodelan, his long-time rival. But Ukraine's Supreme
Court invalidated the election results after a campaign punctuated
by violence.
	   In the current race, election authorities refused to register
Hurvits, now a lawmaker in Ukraine's new parliament, but did
register his rival Bodelan. Government auditors, meanwhile, have
accused Hurvits' former administration of financial wrongdoing.
	   Hurvits, in turn, has accused the president of ``doing
everything'' to secure the victory of Bodelan.

 &UR; Luzhkov: Chernomyrdin to blame for crisis, but likely to keep the
job &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and edits throughout with Luzhkov assailing Ukraine,
color &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on
Wednesday blamed Russia's financial crisis on acting premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin's policies during his previous term in office, but
said parliament would likely approve his reinstatement.
	   Chernomyrdin served for more than five years as prime minister
until President Boris Yeltsin replaced him with Sergei Kiriyenko
this spring.
	   Luzhkov said the crisis was rooted ``in the ways the state's
economic problems were tackled in the previous six years, in the
ways the previous _ Chernomyrdin's _ government functioned.''
	   The powerful Moscow mayor also rushed to confirm his own
reputation as an experienced manager, stating he has signed a
package of orders aimed at supporting Moscow's banks and finding
cash to ensure that city residents would be able to get back their
bank deposits.
	   ``I think that Moscow should survive in this situation,''
Luzhkov said while visiting the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Luzhkov, a presidential hopeful for the next election in 2000,
is hugely popular in Moscow, but it remains unclear how much
influence he can muster in provinces, which often resent Moscow's
wealth.
	   To compensate, Luzhkov frequently plays to Russians' nationalist
feelings.
	   He has made Sevastopol _ a former Soviet naval base that is now
part of Ukraine but still houses Russia's Black Sea Fleet _ one of
the issues, saying the city must become part of Russia.
	   On Wednesday, he assailed Ukraine for trying to turn the Crimean
port into a Ukrainian city and forcing its language on mainly
ethnic Russian residents.
	   ``We see the efforts toward a forced Ukrainization of education,
of kindergartens, even of such simple things as ads and
billboards,'' Luzhkov charged.
	   Luzhkov and acting Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
visited the city to take part in a ceremonial opening of a school
for 1,200 Russian children. Luzhkov has been engaged in building
housing for Russian sailors in the city.
	   In Moscow, despite Luzhkov's assurances, the crisis has caused a
shortage of dollars at several banks, forcing them to allow
withdrawals only in rubles, even from dollar accounts.
	   Six Moscow banks, however, set up a pool with guarantees from
the city government, their main shareholder, a participating bank
said. The Central Bank's Moscow department hopes the pool would
guarantee a reliable payment system, Interfax reported.
	   Luzhkov also called for the Russian government and the Central
Bank to pour large cash resources into other banks in order to
stabilize the ruble.

South African share prices plummet after bomb, global crisis

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The bombing of a popular Cape
Town restaurant contributed to havoc on Wednesday at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where the All Share index plunged 6.2
percent to a three-year low.
	   Earlier in the day, when the market temporarily dropped 8.7
percent, many brokers pointed to the fallout from Russia's decision
to reschedule its debt as the principal cause of the huge losses,
Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   But as the market recovered somewhat, it appeared that the
bombing at Planet Hollywood, where one person died Tuesday night,
exacerbated the financial downturn prompted by global problems.
	   Kevin Lings, an economist at banking conglomerate Nedcor Ltd.,
said the Cape Town blast would revive South Africa's reputation for
political violence at a time when tourism needs to play a key part
in propping up an ailing economy.
	   Two of the children seriously injured in the blast were Britons
who traveled as tourists with their parents and grandparents to
Cape Town.
	   ``It's another factor and potentially a very damaging one to our
tourism industry,'' Lings was quoted by Dow Jones as saying. ``It's
the sort of thing that can damage sentiment locally and among
foreign investors at a time when we need every friend we can get.''
	   Earlier this week, Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister
Pallo Jordan said the tourism industry could create 5 million jobs
over the next decade if the country could provide good service and
ensure the health and safety of tourists.
	   He was speaking at an Africa-wide exhibition on tourism in
Johannesburg. Soaring crime that has claimed the lives of several
tourists has further stained the country's image.
	   Brokers were also watching the U.S. Standard and Poors futures
index in New York and anticipating heavy falls in U.S. shares.
	   The stock price tumble was magnified by soaring local bond
yields, with the benchmark seven-year government bond soaring from
17.94 percent to 18.8 percent since Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's attorney general said Wednesday
that the government has filed a lawsuit in criminal court against
the United States for its missile strike last week against a
Khartoum factory.
	   The attorney general, Ali al-Zaki, told The Associated Press
that U.S. President Bill Clinton is named in the suit.
	   ``We have filed a lawsuit against the United States of America,
which is represented by President Bill Clinton,'' al-Zaki said.
	   He added that ``the normal procedure is that if a person or an
entity fails to show up in court, he will be tried in absentia.''
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said he was not aware that the
lawsuit had been filed.
	   But he added that ``we have to consider the source a little bit.
This is a government that has supported terrorism in the region.''

Civil war reaches Congo's capital

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The thud and echo of artillery fire
shuddered through empty streets in Congo's capital, where a
three-week-old civil war rumbled Wednesday into the eastern
suburbs.
	   The city, already battered by power cuts and water shortages,
was bracing for what some believe may be the start of a full-scale
rebel assault on Kinshasa.
	   The government moved quickly to calm rising fears, but sent out
mixed signals to an uncertain population.
	   Few pedestrians ventured out past tense soldiers patrolling
deserted neighborhoods _ a dramatic shift from the scene one day
earlier when crowds of cheering and waving residents welcomed
President Laurent Kabila back to the city.
	   The fighting between government soldiers and rebel forces trying
to oust Kabila raged through the night and only began tapering off
in the afternoon.
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the situation was under
control, but a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the city.
	   Rumors _ in the absence of hard facts from the government _ ran
rampant through the city. Many people, clustered around transistor
radios, speculated on whether the fighting was the last desperate
act of a rebel side on the run or indeed a coordinated offensive to
take the city.
	   The scale of Wednesday's assault was not immediately clear, but
rebel fighters just days before had been retreating in a corridor
of land stretching about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Kinshasa
to the Atlantic coastline.
	   Rebel officials urged residents of the capital to remain inside.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the head of the rebels' political wing,
told reporters in the eastern Congolese town of Goma.
	   ``We are determined to fight, we are determined to win and
control the city of Kinshasa,'' he said, refusing to provide
further details.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwe warplanes have been staging air strikes in
support of their troops who were battling the rebels.
	   Mumengi described the latest fighting as an operation by
government forces to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like
monkeys'' in the forests around Kinshasa's eastern outskirts.
	   Doctors from Kinshasa's General Hospital said hundreds of
fighters had been wounded or killed. Troops with bullet and
shrapnel wounds were pouring into the hospital, said one doctor who
asked not to be identified.
	   Wednesday's fighting centered around Kinshasa's airport in the
area of Kingasani and Kinbanseke districts, both suburbs about 20
kilometers (12 miles) east of downtown, a witness said.
	   The mixed sound of sharp blasts and long, thundering explosions
rolled through Kinshasa.
	   Green army helicopters, with gunmen leaning out through side
doors, buzzed back and forth just above the city's rooftops.
	   ``We couldn't sleep all night, the fighting was so loud,'' said
a woman named Malu, who fled the battle and headed to central
Kinshasa.
	   She said she had been told rebel fighters had moved into the
suburbs during the night.
	   Mumengi warned city inhabitants to be on guard.
	   ``Since this morning our Congolese forces have been pursuing the
bandits,'' he said in an unusual live broadcast on Voice of the
People radio. ``Today more than any other day we need to redouble
our efforts against this aggression.''
	   Roadblocks were erected in key districts of the capital _
including along June 30th Boulevard, one of the city's primary
thoroughfares. Foreign journalists were restricted from venturing
more than a few hundred meters (yards) from their hotels.
	   The few vehicles that went out were stopped and searched, often
at gunpoint.
	   A meeting scheduled between Kabila and four African peace envoys
in Kinshasa was canceled Wednesday due to the fighting, as was a
planned meeting between Congo's foreign minister and ambassadors.
	   In Zimbabwe's capital of Harare, President Robert Mugabe
criticized his neighbors' efforts at mediation, saying southern
African countries were deeply divided over the issue. He called on
the Organization of African Unity to step in.
	   The United States closed its embassy more than a week ago and
many foreign embassies have sent all but essential staff home.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   But Angolan Interior Minister Santana Pitra, speaking in the
Cape Verde islands off West Africa, said his country would use all
means at its disposal to keep Kabila in power, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Pitra also said Angola's involvement in the conflict was sparked
by fears over the security of its northern border.
	   It was border security concerns that also apparently drew Rwanda
and Uganda into the rebellion. Both countries, however, deny
backing the rebels.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.

Inter Milan rolls past Skonto Riga on 7-1 aggregate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Youri Djorkaeff, Ivan Zamorano and Fabio
Galante scored as Italy's Internazionale of Milan beat Skonto Riga
3-1 Wednesday to easily qualify for Champions League group play on
a 7-1 aggregate.
	   With Ronaldo still working his way into shape for Inter Milan,
France's Djorkaeff and Chile's Zamorano teamed in attack with
Roberto Baggio and the experimental trio dominated the action in
front of 6,000 spectators under a steady rain.
	   Zamorano's header made it 1-0 after nine minutes and Inter
Milan, second in Serie A last season, looked set to roll.
	   But the Latvians fought back to equalize 12 minutes later on
their first scoring threat. With the ball on the left flank,
striker Mihails Miholaps fired a shot that skimmed off Inter
sweeper Salvatore Fresi's leg and bounced between 'keeper Gianluca
Pagliuca and the near post.
	   Inter took over in the second half, with Baggio _ who had one
goal and three assists in Inter's 4-0 home leg victory _ setting up
two goals. The veteran lofted a corner kick that Galante headed
into the roof of the net in the 54th minute, and then helped spring
Djorkaeff for the final tally in the 69th.
	   Djorkaeff, who helped France win the World Cup last month, and
Baggio were both replaced by Inter Milan coach Luigi Simoni one
minute later.
	   Ronaldo did not make the trip with Inter. The Brazilian striker
reported for preseason training only a week ago because the club
gave him an extended vacation after the World Cup.

	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   The Libyan announcement came shortly after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi met with his senior aides to discuss the proposal and Libya
asked the U.N. Security Council to delay any decision on the offer
until it could further study the proposal.
	   Under the U.S.-British proposal, the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in the United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The draft resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not
hand over the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Libya accepts US-British proposal for Lockerbie trial

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya accepted a U.S.-British proposal
Wednesday to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 in the Netherlands, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said.
	   Earlier, a letter was made public in which Libya asked the U.N.
Security Council to delay any decision to give it more time to
study the proposal, which calls for the suspects to be tried under
Scottish law. The letter represented the first official reaction
from Tripoli on the plan for the Netherlands trial.
	   But later in the day, the Libyan ministry released a statement
saying it ``announces its acceptance of ... the new position of the
United Kingdom and the United States.''
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Among
the dead were 189 Americans.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges in the Netherlands. Before making the
compromise, Britain and the United States had insisted the trial be
held on their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects would not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if found guilty, they would
serve their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   On Wednesday, Libya also urged the United Nations to lift its
travel sanctions against the country. By accepting this position,
the Foreign Ministry ``stresses the need to lift the sanctions.''
	   The Ministry's statement was carried by the official Libyan news
agency, JANA.
	   The Libyan announcement came shortly after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi met with his senior aides to discuss the proposal and Libya
asked the U.N. Security Council to delay any decision on the offer
until it could further study the proposal.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to suspend
U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The draft resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not
hand over the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Champions League: Galatasaray advances with 3-2 away win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Galatasaray beat Swiss champion
Grasshoppers 3-2 in a second-round qualifying match Wednesday,
sealing a 5-3 aggregate win to put the Turkish side into the
Champions League.
	   Grasshoppers had high hopes of qualifying after a 2-1 defeat in
Istanbul.
	   But Galatasaray's leading striker Hakan Sukur fired his team
ahead in the 17th minute.
	   In the 45th minute, Sukur was left unmarked to head past
Grasshoppers keeper Pascal Zuberbuehler from close range.
	   Deep into first-half injury time, Kubilay Tuerkyilmaz pulled a
goal back for Grasshoppers.
	   However, Galatasaray's domination continued in the second half.
Romanian star Gheorghe Hagi made it 3-1 in the 65th minute when
Grasshoppers' Bernt Haas conceded a penalty.
	   Johann Vogel, who scored Grasshoppers' goal in the first leg,
scored with a penalty at the other end in the 71st minute.
	   But the Swiss team, with qualification virtually out of reach,
did little else to trouble Brazilian Taffarel in the Galatasaray
goal.

Gartner retires after 19 National Hockey League seasons

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Mike Gartner of the Phoenix Coyotes, the fifth
leading goal scorer in National Hockey League history, retired
Wednesday after 19 years in the NHL.
	   Gartner, 38, had 708 goals, 627 assists and 1,335 points, the
18th most in NHL history. The right-wing Gartner played in 1,432
games for Phoenix, the Washington Capitals, Minnesota North Stars,
New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   Gartner has 12 goals and 15 assists last season for Phoenix.
	   Gartner was drafted in the first round by the Washington
Capitals in 1979 and still leads the franchise in career goals
(397) and points (789).
	   In 1994, Gartner became the first NHL player to score 30 or more
goals in 15 consecutive seasons.

Libya accepts US-British proposal for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya on Wednesday accepted a US-British
proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight
in the Netherlands, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said.
	   A ministry statement listed no conditions and did not say when
the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
_ might be moved to the Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   Libya ``announces its acceptance of ... the new position of the
United Kingdom and the United States,'' the ministry said.
	   The Libyans and the Western nations involved were all likely to
see a trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a
trial on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end to the United
Nations sanctions imposed in 1992, which the holding of the trial
is expected to bring.
	   The United States and Britain see the agreement as an acceptance
by Libya that its citizens should be called to account in the
bombing, and should face trial under Scottish law.
	   In its acceptance of the proposal, Libya urged the United
Nations to lift its travel sanctions against the country.
	   Libya ``hopes that the governments of the United States and the
United Kingdom are serious in their efforts to resolve this
problem,'' said the statement. ``This will be proven when the two
governments impose no conditions which might block the trial.''
	   The statement was carried by the official JANA news agency.
	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   The suspects also could not be extradited from the Netherlands.
If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the United
Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The Libyan announcement came shortly after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi met with his senior aides to discuss the proposal and Libya
asked the U.N. Security Council to delay any decision on the offer
until it could further study the proposal.
	   The Security Council met Wednesday to consider a draft
resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain that would
suspend the sanctions when the suspects arrive in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The draft resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not
hand over the suspects in a timely manner.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Norwegian money earmarked for fishermen dwindled under Boesak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Funds designated by the Church of
Norway for South African fishermen were diverted under management
of a foundation by prominent anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak,
according to court testimony Wednesday.
	   Forensic accountant Dawn King said the church had directed the
Western Cape Fisherman's Union to receive 50,128 rand (dlrs
15,000), but the union actually received only 19,999 rand (dlrs
6,000.
	   Boesak is accused of embezzling nearly 1 million rand (dlrs
300,000) from the Foundation for Peace and Justice, which he
operated from 1988 to 1994. Boesak, who has pleaded not guilty, has
paid back some of the missing money.
	   Donations to the foundation came from U.S. singer Paul Simon,
the Coca-Cola Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and others.
	   Boesak is a former minister who once headed the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's bookkeeper at the foundation, was
sentenced in 1997 to six years in jail after pleading guilty to
embezzlement. During his trial, Steenkamp said he was only
following Boesak's example.
	   The court on Wednesday heard detailed accounts, including an
analysis of what happened to the 328,458 rand (dlrs 100,000) the
Church of Norway donated to the foundation.
	   King said only 27 percent of that money _ designated for a range
of projects to benefit rural communities including the fishermen _
reached the desired recipients.
	   King also produced a long list of transactions which she said
showed that Boesak and Steenkamp benefited from the funds.
	   The trial is scheduled to last at least three months.

Croatia's 3-0 victory over Scottish champions Celtic in Wednesday's
second-round, second-leg qualifier as the Crotaian side advanced on

save.

Nervous PSV scrapes into Champions League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A freak extra-time goal from
Dennis Rommedahl inspired PSV Eindhoven to a 4-1 defeat of
Slovakian side Maribor Wednesday, and a 5-3 aggregate win.
	   PSV started this second leg of the second qualifying round 2-1
down to Maribor after the first game, but now joins Dutch rival
Ajax in the Champions League.
	   In the 100th minute of the game subsitute Rommedahl's center
from wide on the right was deflected, and out-of-position Maribor
keeper Goran Stankovic could only parry the ball into his own net.
	   Belgian striker Gilles de Bilde then sealed a game which had
gone into extra time at 3-3 on aggregate with a stunning drive from
distance.
	   The fragility of the new cosmopolitan PSV defense was exposed
after just five minutes when Portuguese center back Abel Xavier and
Brazilian colleague Marcos were caught marking the same striker.
	   Dalibor Filipovic turned swiftly, sprinted twenty yards (meters)
and neatly chipped over PSV reserve keeper Patrick Lodewijks to
open the scoring and put Maribor 3-1 up on aggregate.
	   But just three minutes later PSV attackers swarmed into the
Maribor box and De Bilde crossed for Ruud van Nistelrooij to head
home.
	   The Maribor defense massed around its penalty area but Van
Nistelrooij popped up again on 69 minutes to head on for substitute
Arnold Bruggink to volley home and take the game into extra time.
	   De Bilde almost won the game for PSV twice within 90 minutes,
first with a header against the post, then with a tap-in goal
disallowed for offside two minutes from time.
	   In the end new English coach Bobby Robson's second half Dutch
substitutes, Bruggink and Rommedahl, won the game for his foreign
legion-dominated side.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nikos Lymberopoulos struck twice, once in
favor and once against his team, as Panathinaikos Athens beat
Steaua Bucharest 6-3 Wednesday in a second-leg, Champions Cup
second qualifying round to gain a berth in one of the groups of the
Champions League on a 8-5 aggregate.
	   In a similar case, Steaua's Miodrag Belodedici scored a goal for
his team but also sent the ball into his own net.
	   Panathinaikos, which reached the semifinals of the Champions
League two years ago, managed to take an early lead when Serbian
defender Vladan Milojevic converted a penalty kick in the 7th
minute.
	   Five minutes later, Valeriu Rachita levelled off a free-kick
from Marius Lacatus.
	   Lymberopoulos silenced the 54,000 fans at the Athens Olympic
stadium in the 15th minute when a free-kick from Lacatus the ball
deflected on the Greek player to give a 2-1 lead to the visitors.
	   The Greeks equalized in a similar way when a shot by Croatian
ace Aljosa Asanovic deflected on Belodedici in the 27th.
	   Lymberopoulos gave Panathinaikos a 3-2 lead in the 35th and
Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha made it 4-2 in the 59th.
	   Belodedici narrowed the gap in the 60th, but Warzycha stretched
the score to 5-3 in the 66th and Asanovic closed it with a penalty
kick three minutes before the end of the game.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ The only bang guests expected to
hear at Tomer Cohen's wedding was the sound of a single glass
breaking, the traditional end to a Jewish marriage ceremony.
	   What they heard instead Tuesday were explosions of Katyusha
rockets fired by Lebanese guerrillas. The shells slammed down near
the candlelit outdoor ceremony in the Israeli town of Kiryat
Shemona as the bride and groom exchanged vows.
	   Most of the guests fled before the rabbi said ``mazel tov,'' or
congratulations.
	   The attack underscored the ability of Islamic guerrillas over
the border to disrupt life for Israel even if they cannot drive
Israeli troops from Lebanese soil.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli forces killed a leading guerrilla figure in
south Lebanon, the head of the militant Amal group Israel holds
responsible for recent attacks on soldier outposts. Hours later
came a massive rocket barrage over the border onto Israeli towns.
	   The attacks continued Wednesday, and a member of an
Israeli-backed Lebanese militia was killed in sporadic gunfire
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   The Israeli army said Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrilla force, had fired mortars, machine guns and rockets at
positions of the Israeli army and the Israel-allied South Lebanon
Army.
	   Amal said it also attacked Israeli positions with machine guns
and rocket-propelled grenades.
	   Later, the Israeli army said its helicopter gunships were
attacked by anti-aircraft fire from the Lebanese army. A Lebanese
army spokesman said the Israeli gunships fired first _ a rocket
landed at an army post, wounding one soldier and destroying an
armored personnel carrier.
	   An exchange of fire between Israeli forces and the Lebanese army
is rare and does not tend to lead to direct fighting.
	   Israel has controlled parts of south Lebanon on its own or
through proxy Lebanese militias since a 1978 invasion. Israel
invaded again in 1982, going as far north as the capital, Beirut,
and in 1985 pulled back into the area it now occupies.
	   Civilians in northern Israel, who had spent the night in bomb
shelters, emerged into the light Wednesday morning as the army
declared the alert over.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the damaged
homes of Kiryat Shemona and visited some of the 19 people wounded.
He also defended the army's action against Amal leader Hossan
al-Amin, which had drawn criticism from some in Israel.
	   ``We will continue to fight terror organizations,'' Netanyahu
said, calling on the Lebanese government to rein Hezbollah in.
	   When the first barrage landed during Tomer and Irit Cohen's
wedding, ``people were hysterical and a number of women fainted,''
said a friend of the groom, Yaacov Abutbul.
	   The wedding went on, even though most of the guests had left,
and the bride and groom later left for a honeymoon on safer ground
_ Tel Aviv.

Libya accepts US-British proposal for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya on Wednesday accepted a US-British
proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight
in the Netherlands, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said.
	   The ministry statement listed no conditions and did not say when
the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
_ might be moved to The Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   Libya ``announces its acceptance of ... the new position of the
United Kingdom and the United States,'' the ministry said in a
statement.
	   London and Washington had earlier insisted that any trial must
be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Libya also urged the United Nations to lift its travel sanctions
against the country.
	   By accepting the U.S.-British proposal, the Foreign Ministry
``stresses the need to lift the sanctions.''
	   Libya ``hopes that the governments of the United Kingdom and the
United States are serious in their efforts to resolve this
problem,'' the statement said. It was carried by the official
Libyan news agency, JANA.
	   ``This will be proven when the two governments impose no
conditions which might block the trial,'' the statement added.
	   The Libyans and the Western nations involved were all likely to
see a trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a
trial on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end to the United
Nations sanctions imposed in 1992, which the holding of the trial
is expected to bring.
	   The United States and Britain see the agreement as an acceptance
by Libya that its citizens should be called to account in the
bombing, and should face trial under Scottish law.

Russian government tries reassure investors as crisis deepens

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government failed to restore
confidence in its collapsing banking sector Wednesday with the
ruble sinking ever lower and despondent investors tallying their
mounting losses.
	   There were signs the financial crisis was escalating. For the
first time ever, the Central Bank canceled already agreed dollar
sales, and the government failed to make payments on longer-term
debt previously unaffected by the crisis.
	   But while some Russians were irked that they could withdraw bank
deposits only in rubles, not dollars, the situation on the streets
remained anxious, not panicky.
	   ``I've got no confidence left in the government, of course. You
can't even buy hard currency now,'' said a woman waiting outside a
branch of the troubled SBS-Agro bank who identified herself only as
Julia.
	   The government devalued the ruble 10 days ago, which has swelled
demand for dollars both among banks and the public. Banks with
inadequate hard currency reserves are expected to collapse, and the
first went belly up Wednesday _ Imperial Bank, a small commercial
bank that like many in Russia concentrates on money speculation
instead of customer deposits.
	   Anatoly Chubais, a former top Kremlin policymaker highly
regarded in the West, said the government is in a tight spot.
	   ``On the one hand, the banking system should be prevented from
complete collapse, but on the other hand declare the bankrupt banks
bankrupt,'' he said.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin rushed to Ukraine to
hold an emergency meeting with International Monetary Fund head
Michel Camdessus. He was expected to plead with the IMF not to
delay the next installment of a multibillion dollar loan that
Russia has been using to shore up its Central Bank reserves _
eroded by the effort of supporting the ruble.
	   ``We must consolidate our efforts ... First of all, we must
preserve the banking system and the financial system,''
Chernomyrdin said after meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma.
	   Chernomyrdin said he was holding consultations with all Russian
politicians and parties in hopes of ending the crisis.
	   ``The government must be a government of professionals no matter
to what party or movement they belong,'' he said.

Mugabe criticizes region over Congo intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS background of Mugabe-Mandela conflict in 9th and 10th

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Strife among African nations about how
to deal with the Congo crisis deepened Wednesday, with Zimbabwe's
president criticizing his neighbors' efforts at mediation.
	   President Robert Mugabe sent troops last week to back Congolese
President Laurent Kabila to help fend off rebels, opposing a call
for mediation from South Africa's President Nelson Mandela.
	   Meanwhile, severe fighting between government troops and rebels
in Kinshasa, Congo's capital, prevented a four-nation mediation
team formed at a Mandela-initiated summit from flying into the city
Wednesday to meet with Kabila, a South African foreign affairs
official said.
	   ``There are reports of mortar shelling at the (Kinshasa)
airport,'' said Machiel an Niekerk. ``At this stage (a meeting) is
still on, but they are trying to find a new venue.''
	   A proposed meeting between the team and Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, who has also sent troops to help Kabila, was
less likely to take place, van Niekerk said.
	   Angolan state radio said Wednesday that a meeting between the
Southern African Development Community team and the president would
not take place.
	   The mediation team comprises foreign ministers from South
Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, and is currently in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, meeting with Organization of African Unity
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Mugabe met Wednesday in Harare with U.S. Great Lakes envoy
Howard Wolpe and conceded the 14-nation SADC is deeply divided over
intervention, according to a report by the official state news
agency ZIANA.
	   The rift stems in part from lingering resentment by Mugabe over
Mandela's rise as a regional leader after 1994's first all-race
elections ended apartheid in South Africa and made Mandela
president.
	   Until then, Mugabe was the premier leader in black-ruled
southern Africa, famous for his role in ousting white leader Ian
Smith from the former Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was once known.
	   Mugabe said any future peace initiatives should be handled by
the OAU, not the regional SADC headed by Mandela. Zimbabwe is also
a member of SADC.
	   ``We want the solution to come from the OAU. The SADC initiative
must lead to where the OAU comes in because we are divided,'' he
said.
	   Fighting in Congo threatens to engulf the region and poses its
most severe security threat in four years, with at least four
foreign countries now involved.
	   Defense officials in Harare said Wednesday that some Zimbabwe
troops are involved in the fighting outside Kinshasa. Zimbabwe has
sent combat helicopters, transport planes and up to 600 troops to
support Kabila's forces.

	   LODZ, Poland (AP) _ Powerful English side Manchester United was
held to a lackluster scoreless draw Wednesday against Polish side
Lodz, but still advanced to the regular portion of the Champions
League on a 2-0 aggregate.
	   The Polish side came out strong in the first 10 minutes, but
Manchester United slowly took control and dominated the first half
and most of the second but was unable to score.
	   Manchester United started England World Cup striker Teddy
Sheringham for the first time this season with Andy Cole sitting on

IBF lightweight champ unimpressed by challenger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ From what he's seen, unbeaten IBF lightweight
champion Shane Mosley is unimpressed by the fighter who will try to
take his title next month.
	   ``He is not seasoned yet, he is not a world-class fighter,''
Mosley said of Eduardo Morales, the Argentine challenger he fights
Sept. 22 at Madison Square Garden.
	   Mosley, 28-0 with 26 knockouts, only recently got tapes of
Morales, 26-0 with 21 KOs, who has never fought outside his
homeland.
	   In the limited time that the 26-year-old Californian has watched
the top-ranked contender, he has already come up with a game plan
for his fifth title defense.
	   ``As far as figuring him out, I figured him out already,''
Mosley said in a teleconference call Wednesday from his training
camp in Big Bear, California. ``I've seen little flaws in some of
the thing that he does.''
	   The most obvious ones are giving away his punches and relying
too much on the left hook as his power punch, according to Mosley.
	   ``He telegraphs his jabs and I can come over that and I can
build on that,'' Mosley said. ``He also considers himself a power
puncher and all the power comes from his left hook. By going to my
right I will take away the left hook and if I take that away from
him, he'll be lost.''
	   Still, Mosley can see the fight _ the debut of boxing on TNT _
going five or six rounds.
	   ``He is 26-0 and he has a bit of an ego,'' Mosley said. ``He is
going to work extra hard. But basically what I worry about is what
I am going to do.''
	   The card will also feature two other world title bouts.
	   WBU super featherweight champion Angel Manfredy, 24-2-1 with 19
KOs, meets John Brown, 18-4 with 9 KOs, in the co-feature, and WBU
junior flyweight champion Masibulele Makepula of South Africa
(13-0, 11) fights Rafael Torres of the Dominican Republic (15-7,
two).

Mercury pollution continues to draw investigators
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Years after mercury poisoning
caused two deaths and severe illness among workers at a Thor
Chemical plant, renewed investigations have started in Parliament
and at a local university.
	   Jacques Oosthuizen, a senior lecturer in environmental health,
plans to study soil and hair samples, goat's milk and earthworms
for traces of mercury around the plant, the University of Cape Town
announced Wednesday.
	   Parliament's environmental affairs committee last week set up a
task force to take interim measures to safeguard the health of
workers at the plant, located at Cato Ridge near Durban.
	   The plant processed mercury waste from 1986 to 1995.
	   Its owner, Britain's Thor Chemical, agreed last year to pay 9.4
million rand (dlrs 1.46 million) to 20 South African workers who
claim they suffered from mercury poisoning.
	   Thor accepted responsibility for polluting the rivers after a
Greenpeace video revealed that mercury levels were 8,200 times
higher than the acceptable level in the United States.
	   A parliamentary committee recently determined that 5,000 tons of
highly toxic mercury waste continues to be stored improperly at the
plant and is spreading into the soil, environmental affairs
committee chairwoman Gwen Mahlangu said last week.
	   Much of the waste is stored in leaking drums, and the rest is in
holding dams.
	   It was not clear who would carry out the cleanup.
	   A commission established by President Nelson Mandela in March
1995 recommended last year that the mercury waste be incinerated.
	   But an expert from New York's St. Lawrence University, Paul
Connett, warned the committee last week that high temperatures
would cause the mercury to vaporize and spread through the air.
	   The mercury waste was imported from abroad until officials
stopped the practice in 1994.
	   Concerns over Thor were first raised in the 1980s at its factory
in England, after allegations of excessive levels of mercury in the
air and in workers' urine.
	   When British authorities threatened the company in 1988 with
legal action, Thor moved its mercury production facilities to South
Africa.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain gave a cautious welcome Wednesday to
Libya's announcement that it would agree to a trial in the
Netherlands for two men accused of bombing a Pan Am jumbo jet over
Scotland.
	   ``I welcome this statement which looks like a positive
development,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   ``We shall need to study exactly what the Libyans have said, and

acceptance.
	   ``The terms of the U.K.-U.S. initiative are set out clearly in
the texts which the Libyans now have.
	   ``We now look for an unequivocal acceptance of those terms.
	   ``In due course we expect them to convey a formal response
through the United Nations Secretary General's office, the channel
through which this initiative has been conveyed to them,'' Cook
said.

EU says Israeli Golan settlements would be major blow to peace
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union called Wednesday on
Israel to scrap plans to build new housing in the disputed Golan
Heights, saying the project would call into question the Israeli
commitment to peace.
	   In a statement issued by the Austrian government, the EU said
the Israeli plan, announced last week, also represented ``a
significant step backward'' in efforts toward peace between Israel
and Syria.
	   The EU said construction of the new units would ``call into
question Israel's commitment to the peace process'' in the Middle
East and constitute a violation of international law.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU.
	   On Aug. 19, an Israeli ministerial committee headed by Israel's
hardline infrastructure minister, Ariel Sharon, approved
construction of 2,300 homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan
settlements.
	   Israel seized the strategic heights from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war and later annexed it. Before the war, Palestinian
gunners had used the Golan Heights to target Jewish settlements in
northern Israel.
	   Syria has long demanded the return of the Golan as a condition
for signing a peace treaty with Israel. The government of the late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was ready to give back the
heights before he was assassinated in 1995.
	   Rabin's successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he is not bound
by Rabin's promises and that the Golan is vital to Israel's
security.
	   The EU has taken a harder line against Israel than the United
States and has supported several resolutions in the U.N. General
Assembly which have denounced Israeli policies in territories
seized in the 1967 war.
	   But the Europeans have backed off on supporting punitive
measures against Israel, such as Arab proposals for a ban on
dealings with companies involved in settlements construction,
largely to avoid antagonizing Washington.
	   Last week, the 22-member Arab League said the Israeli decision
to build housing on the Golan was intended ``to torpedo the peace
process'' and maintain its hold on the plateau indefinitely.

Army officers in Romania unearth WWII anti-Hitler pamphlets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Army engineers who were summoned to
detonate an unearthed World War II shell got a surprise when the
blast unearth 100 old anti-Hitler leaflets buried nearby.
	   The leaflets, written in German and still in good condition,
were found Tuesday in the village of Copalau near Botosani in
northern Romania, authorities said. ``Hitler lies to the German
people, Hitler bring Germany to destruction!'' the leaflets said n
part.
	   The officers said Wednesday they don't know exactly how the
leaflets came to be in Romania _ a Nazi ally in World War II.
	   ``They arrived by mistake or were thrown from planes by Hitler's
enemies to the German troops settled in the region,'' suggested
officer Cezar Chieriu of the Botosani Inspectorate for Civilian
Protection.
	   The pamphlets are to be displayed in an army museum.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A high-ranking Palestinian official said
Wednesday that the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal has been detained
in Egypt, but the country's foreign minister denied the report.
	   The Palestinian's statement follows nearly two weeks of similar
claims, all denied by Egyptian security officials who spoke
anonymously. The comment by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is the
first denial by an Egyptian official speaking publicly.
	   The interest in Abu Nidal _ Arabic for ``father of struggle'' _
comes because of his notoriety for his daring attacks on Israelis
and even Palestinians whom he opposed, and for the mystery
surrounding him.
	   He was once considered the world's most dangerous terrorist. He
is reported to have died several times _ only to reappear _ and to
have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery.
	   In recent days, several Palestinian officials insisting on
anonymity have told news organizations, including The Associated
Press, that Abu Nidal was either jailed or hospitalized with
leukemia. None, however, has offered proof he was in the country.
	   On Wednesday, a leading Palestinian official _ again speaking on
condition of anonymity _ said the onetime guerrilla whose real name
is Sabri al-Banna was arrested five weeks ago coming from Libya.
	   He said he was uncertain if Libya arranged for the 61-year-old
Palestinian to leave or if Abu Nidal's own people were trying to
smuggle him out through Egypt to another country.
	   Abu Nidal is near death and being treated in a hospital, but is
in effect in detention by Egyptian officials, the official
contended.
	   He theorized Egypt is denying the arrest because it does not
know what to do with Abu Nidal and fears revealing his arrest could
make Egypt the target of anger by other terrorists.
	   Hours later, Moussa issued his public denial. He was asked about
reports Tuesday and Wednesday by American newspapers and
broadcasters which quoted U.S. and Arab officials as saying Abu
Nidal had been arrested by Egyptian police.
	   ``Abu Nidal is not in Egypt,'' Moussa replied. He did not expand
on the statement.
	   In Washington, the State Department said it had been in touch
with the Egyptian government but had ``no determinative
information'' whether Abu Nidal was in custody.
	   ``If he is in custody we feel he ought to be brought to
justice,'' said department spokesman James Foley.

Bucks fire Chris Ford as coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENNIFER BATOG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Chris Ford was fired as coach of the Milwaukee
Bucks on Wednesday after failing to break the team's seven-year
streak of missing the playoffs.
	   The team is ``going in a different direction,'' said general
manager Bob Weinhauer.
	   ``We're in the business of winning basketball games,'' Weinhauer
said. ``Even though we've had success to some extent, we have not
had enough.''
	   Ford, who coached the Boston Celtics for five years, had a year
left on his three-year contract.
	   Milwaukee had a 33-49 record in his first season, and 36-46 in
his second and last.
	   Weinhauer and Bucks owner Sen. Herb Kohl made the decision
Monday after lengthy discussion, Weinhauer said. Assistant coach
Dick Versace also was fired.
	   The new coach likely will decide the fate of the other two
assistants, Jim Todd and Mike Woodson, Weinhauer said.
	   Ford's replacement will be the team's sixth coach since 1987.
Ford has a 291-283 overall record and ranks 41st overall in
victories among NBA coaches.

Panathinaikos beats Steaua, advances in Champions League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nikos Lymberopoulos struck twice, once in
favor and once against his team, as Panathinaikos Athens beat
Steaua Bucharest 6-3 Wednesday in a second-leg, Champions Cup
second qualifying round to gain a berth in one of the groups of the
Champions League on a 8-5 aggregate.
	   In a similar case, Steaua's Miodrag Belodedici scored a goal for
his team but also sent the ball into his own net.
	   Panathinaikos, which reached the semifinals of the Champions
League two years ago, managed to take an early lead when Serbian
defender Vladan Milojevic converted a penalty kick in the 7th
minute.
	   Five minutes later, Valeriu Rachita levelled off a free-kick
from Marius Lacatus.
	   Lymberopoulos silenced the 54,000 fans at the Athens Olympic
stadium in the 15th minute when a free-kick from Lacatus the ball
deflected on the Greek player to give a 2-1 lead to the visitors.
	   The Greeks equalized in a similar way when a shot by Croatian
ace Aljosa Asanovic deflected on Belodedici in the 27th.
	   Lymberopoulos gave Panathinaikos a 3-2 lead in the 35th and
Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha made it 4-2 in the 59th.
	   Belodedici narrowed the gap in the 60th, but Warzycha stretched
the score to 5-3 in the 66th and Asanovic closed it with a penalty
kick three minutes before the end of the game.

Nervous PSV scrapes into Champions League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A freak extra-time goal from
Dennis Rommedahl inspired PSV Eindhoven to a 4-1 defeat of
Slovakian side Maribor Wednesday, and a 5-3 aggregate win.
	   PSV started this second leg of the second qualifying round 2-1
down to Maribor after the first game, but now joins Dutch rival
Ajax in the Champions League.
	   In the 100th minute of the game subsitute Rommedahl's center
from wide on the right was deflected, and out-of-position Maribor
keeper Goran Stankovic could only parry the ball into his own net.
	   Belgian striker Gilles de Bilde then sealed a game which had
gone into extra time at 3-3 on aggregate with a stunning drive from
distance.
	   The fragility of the new cosmopolitan PSV defense was exposed
after just five minutes when Portuguese center back Abel Xavier and
Brazilian colleague Marcos were caught marking the same striker.
	   Dalibor Filipovic turned swiftly, sprinted twenty yards (meters)
and neatly chipped over PSV reserve keeper Patrick Lodewijks to
open the scoring and put Maribor 3-1 up on aggregate.
	   But just three minutes later PSV attackers swarmed into the
Maribor box and De Bilde crossed for Ruud van Nistelrooij to head
home.
	   The Maribor defense massed around its penalty area but Van
Nistelrooij popped up again on 69 minutes to head on for substitute
Arnold Bruggink to volley home and take the game into extra time.
	   De Bilde almost won the game for PSV twice within 90 minutes,
first with a header against the post, then with a tap-in goal
disallowed for offside two minutes from time.
	   In the end new English coach Bobby Robson's second half Dutch
substitutes, Bruggink and Rommedahl, won the game for his foreign
legion-dominated side.

Oleg Prokofiev, son of composer, dead at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oleg Prokofiev, who devoted much of his life to
promoting the memory of his father, the composer Serge Prokofiev,
has died of a heart attack at age 69.
	   Prokofiev died Aug. 20 while vacationing in Guernsey, according
to an obituary published Thursday in The Times.
	   He was born in Paris, the second son of the composer and singer
Lina Codina. The family returned to Moscow in 1936, the marriage
foundered and Prokofiev and his brother were left in the care of
their mother.
	   He studied sculpture at the Moscow School of Art, and in the
1970s was a fellow in the fine arts department of Leeds University
in England.
	   Noelle Mann, curator of the Prokofiev Archive at Goldsmiths
College, London, said Prokofiev generously devoted time to
promoting his father's life and work.
	   ``He kept up a huge correspondence with artists, musicologists,
performers and film directors working on Prokofiev and Soviet
music,'' Mann wrote in an obituary published in The Independent
newspaper.
	   ``Deeply modest, he would always make time for anyone genuinely
interested in his father's music.''
	   Prokofiev is survived by a son from his first marriage, a
daughter from his second marriage and by his third wife, Frances
Child, and their four children.
	   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

PSV, Manchester United, Inter, Bayern advance; Celtic out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven survived in overtime against
Slovenian side Maribor Wednesday to reach the regular portion of
the Champions League.
	   In the second round, second leg of Champions League qualifying,
other big clubs like Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Inter
Milan also got through to next's month's opening of the Champions
League _ Europe's top club competition _ although Scottish
champions Celtic were eliminated.
	   PSV, which lost the first leg 2-1 at Maribor two weeks ago, was
leading after regulation 90 minutes 2-1, but that left the two
clubs tied 3-3 and also tied on the away-goal rule.
	   Denmark's Dennis Rommedahl scored what proved to be the winning
goal in the 100th minute with teammate Gilles de Bilde of Belgium
scoring two minutes later to seal the victory as the Dutch advanced
on 5-3 aggregate.
	   Manchester United _ up 2-0 after the first leg _ advanced after
a 0-0 draw at Lodz, Poland, and joins fellow English side Arsenal
when the Champions League starts for real next month.
	   In Riga, Latvia, Youri Djorkaeff, Ivan Zamorano and Fabio
Galante scored as Italy's Internazionale of Milan beat Skonto Riga
3-1 to easily qualify on a 7-1 aggregate.
	   With Brazilian Ronaldo still working his way into shape for
Inter Milan _ he skipped the trip _ France's Djorkaeff and Chile's
Zamorano teamed in attack with Roberto Baggio and the experimental
trio dominated the action in front of 6,000 spectators under a
steady rain.
	   German power Bayern Munich advanced 5-1 after a 1-1 draw in
Belgrade with Yugoslav side Obilic. Bayern won the first led 4-0.
	   It was bad news for Celtic.
	   In Zagreb, Croatia, Robert Prosinecki scored two goals in
Croatia's 3-0 victory over Celtic and advanced on a 3-1 aggregate.
Croatia scored early as midfielder Silvio Maric hit home in the
23rd. Prosinecki converted a penalty kick in the 45th and scored
again in the 68th.
	   In the other high-drama match of the night, Dynamo Kiev slipped
through over Sparta Prague.
	   Dynamo Kiev won the match 1-0, putting the clubs level on
aggregate (1-1) and away goals. After a scoreless 30-minute
overtime, Dynamo won 3-1 penalty kicks as Sergei Rebrov, Kaka
Kaladze and Yuri Dmitrulin scored their penalties.
	   In other games:
	   HJK Helsinki also moved through, drawing 1-1 with French side
Metz to advance 2-1. Metz was runners-up last season in France but
had not managed to score a goal in its first three games.
	   In Spain, Athletic Bilbao won 1-0 over Georgia's Dinamo Tiblisi
and got through on the away-goal rule after a 2-2 aggregate. The
Spaniards lost 2-1 in Tbilisi two weeks ago.
	   Greek side Panathinaikos, which played a 2-2 draw in Bucharest
two week ago, came back to win 6-3 and advance 8-5. Another Greek
side Olympiakos also got through, beating Anorthosis Famagusta of
Cyprus 4-2 to advance 6-3.
	   Norway's Rosenborg made it in on the away-goal rule despite a
4-2 loss to Brugge of Belgium. Rosenborg won the first game in
Norway 2-0. The clubs tied 4-4 on aggregate.
	   Spartak Moscow defeated Liteks (Bulgaria) 6-2 and advanced 11-2.
	   Beitar Jerusalem won over Portugal's Benfica 4-2, but Benfica
moved through 8-4.
	   In Budapest, Austrian side Sturm Graz won 3-2 over Hungary's
Ujpest to advance 7-2.
	   Turkey's Galatasaray also qualified with a 3-2 victory over
Grasshoppers of Switzerland to move through on a 5-3 aggregate.
	   In Copenhagen, Kosice of Slovakia won 1-0 but Denmark's Brondby
advanced on a 2-1 aggregate.

U.S. diplomatic building in Pristina hit by Molotov cocktail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Molotov cocktail thrown at USIS
building in Pristina, no damage or injuries &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An unidentified attacker hurled a
Molotov cocktail at a U.S. diplomatic building in Kosovo's capital
Wednesday night. There were no injuries or damage, but the incident
may raise new questions about the American role in trying to settle
the Serb-Albanian conflict.
	   No one immediately took responsibility for the late-evening
attack on the U.S. Information Services building in an upscale
residential section of Pristina. There was no indication whether it
was connected to this month's terrorist attacks on American targets
worldwide.
	   The lone guard on duty, Bedri Rama, an ethnic Albanian, said he
was sitting inside the two-story building shortly after 9 p.m. when
the explosive was hurled onto the steps outside.
	   ``Suddenly I heard a crash and saw a big flame,'' Rama said,
explaining that he came outside and extinguished it.
	   Pieces of glass could be seen scattered at the site shortly
afterward. Two U.S. security agents came to investigate, and armed
Serb police also were at the scene. None commented on the
explosion.
	   The building, surrounded by a wrought-iron fence, has only
minimal security and there have been few known incidents of
hostility toward Americans in Pristina. In May, Serb students broke
a window in the same building.
	   The United States has been among the strongest advocates of
military intervention to get the Serbs to halt their offensive in
Kosovo. But Washington's efforts to form a consensus have been
stymied but other nations that insist on a diplomatic settlement
only.
	   On Wednesday, Kosovo's rebels suggested they were ready to talk
instead of fight, but Western officials said Yugoslavia's president
wants to continue the battle against the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.

Libregts chosen to lead Nigerian squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Former Dutch national team coach Thijs
Libregts has been chosen to guide Nigeria until at least 2000, a
Nigerian soccer official said Wednesday.
	   He replaces Serbian-born Bora Milutinovic, whose coaching
contract expired after Nigeria's exit from the second round of the
World Cup in June.
	   The Nigerian Football Federation official, who asked to remain
anonymous, said Libregts was expected to sign a four-year contract
with a clause allowing the federation to terminate the deal after
two years.
	   Although monetary terms were not released, the new coach was not
expected to make less than Milutinovic's dlrs 35,000 a month fee,
officials said.
	   Libregts, 57, is the third Dutch coach chosen by Nigeria.
Clemens Westerhof took Nigeria to the second round of the 1994
World Cup while Bonferee Jo led Nigeria to win gold at the Atlanta
Olympics in '96.
	   Libregts last coached Greek first-division team Apollon Athens.
	   Nigeria disappointed fans after being knocked out of this year's
World Cup by Denmark in the second round. Milutinovic, the only
coach to guide 4 teams from different countries at the World Cup,
was widely blamed by fans although he had only two months to
prepare for the Cup.
	   Nigeria is favored to qualify for the African Cup of Nations in
2000 after a hiatus since 1994, when it won the continental
championship. Nigeria declined to participate in the 1994 Cup in
South Africa and was subsequently barred from competing at this
year's African Cup.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Bayern Munich, with a 1-1 draw
Wednesday against Yugoslavian side Obilic, advanced 5-1 to the
regular portion of the Champions League.
	   The Belgrade match between Yugoslav titlist Obilic and the giant
of European soccer from Munich opened with strong attacking by the
home team, desperate to at least soften its bitter 4-0 loss from
the first leg in Germany two weeks ago.
	   Halftime ended scoreless, mostly due to masterful peformances by
respective goalkeepers, Bayern's Oliver Kahn and Obilic's Nenad
Lukic.
	   Dragan Sarac raised Obilic's hopes with a spectacular header in
67th minute when he dived from some eight meters (yards), sending
the ball into Bayern's net.
	   In the 89th, when it appeared Obilic might get the comfort of
winning at least the second leg, Bayern's Michael Tarnat turned a
free-kick into a perfect pass to veteran Lothar Matthaeus who
scored into the roof of Obilic's net.

UNITED NATIONS: unannounced inspections.

	   ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the
extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Richard Butler, the top
U.N. weapons inspector, said in his letter accepting Ritter's
resignation.
	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons.
	   Ritter accompanied Butler to an Aug. 3 meeting in which Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asked Butler to declare Iraq had complied
with U.N. resolutions and Butler refused, essentially ending the
talks.
	   Butler refused to say why Ritter was leaving, but said he
planned to make an announcement Thursday.

Tendulkar arrives to meet Bradman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Indian batting star Sachin Tendulkar
has arrived in Australia to take part in celebrations for Sir
Donald Bradman's 90th birthday.
	   Bradman turns 90 on Thursday but will not attend a public dinner
of 1,300 to celebrate the milestone.
	   Bradman, who played 52 tests and finished with a peerless
average of 99.94, remains Australia's most famous sportsman despite
15 years of reclusive living.
	   In a rare interview in 1996 he said Indian captain Tendulkar was
the player who most reminded him of himself. He will meet Tendulkar
at his Adelaide home.
	   ``I hope I get to ask him some questions about batting and that
is what I'm looking forward to,'' Tendulkar said on arrival late
Wednesday.
	   He said meeting Bradman was something he had hoped for all his
life.
	   ``I'm very happy about it, it is a once in a lifetime
opportunity I'm glad I have made it,'' Tendulkar said.
	   He admitted he was embarrassed by comparisons to Bradman.
	   ``I have never liked comparisons but I don't think anybody can
be compared to Sir Donald Bradman at all,'' Tendulkar said.

U.S. diplomatic building in Pristina hit by Molotov cocktail

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Molotov cocktail thrown at USIS
building in Pristina, no damage or injuries. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Molotov cocktail was thrown at a
U.S. diplomatic building in Kosovo's capital Wednesday night. There
were no injuries or damage, but the attack may raise new questions
about the American role in trying to settle the Serb-Albanian
conflict.
	   No one immediately took responsibility for the late-evening
attack on the U.S. Information Services building in an upscale
residential section of Pristina. There was no indication that it
was connected to this month's terrorist attacks on American targets
in Africa.
	   The lone guard on duty, ethnic Albanian Bedri Rama, said he was
sitting inside the two-story building shortly after 9 p.m. local
time when the explosive was hurled onto the steps outside.
	   ``Suddenly I heard a crash and saw a big flame,'' Rama said. He
extinguished the fire himself.
	   Pieces of glass could be seen scattered at the site shortly
afterward. Two U.S. security agents came to investigate, and armed
Serb police also were at the scene. None would comment on the
explosion.
	   There have been few known incidents of hostility toward
Americans in Pristina. In May, Serb students broke a window in the
same building.
	   The United States has been among the advocates of military
intervention to get the Serbs to halt their offensive in Kosovo.
Washington's efforts to form a consensus have been stymied by other
nations that insist on a diplomatic settlement only.
	   On Wednesday, Kosovo's rebels suggested they were ready to talk
instead of fight, but Western officials said Yugoslavia's president
wants to continue the battle against the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.

Libya accepts US-British proposal for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with response from Britain, suspects' lawyers and
family of U.S. victim, FIXES quote in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya on Wednesday accepted a US-British
proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight
in the Netherlands, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said.
	   The ministry statement gave no conditions and did not say when
the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
_ might be moved to The Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   Libya ``announces its acceptance of ... the development in the
positions of the governments of the United Kingdom and the United
States,'' the ministry said in a statement.
	   London and Washington had earlier insisted that any trial must
be held in the United States or Britain.
	   The Libyan announcement came shortly after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi met with his senior aides to discuss the proposal and Libya
asked the U.N. Security Council to delay any decision on the offer
until it could further study the proposal.
	   The two Libyans are accused of planting a bomb aboard the
flight, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270
people.
	   The Libyans and the Western nations involved were all likely to
see a trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a
trial on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end to the United
Nations sanctions imposed in 1992, which the holding of the trial
is expected to bring.
	   The United States and Britain see the agreement as an acceptance
by Libya that its citizens should be called to account in the
bombing, and should face trial under Scottish law.
	   With Libya's acceptance of a deal, the Security Council pressed
ahead Wednesday with a draft resolution that would suspend U.N.
sanctions once the two suspects appear for trial. The draft
resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not hand over
the suspects in a timely manner.
	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   The suspects also could not be extradited from the Netherlands.
If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the United
Kingdom.
	   Libya ``hopes that the governments of the United Kingdom and the
United States are serious in their efforts to resolve this
problem,'' the statement said. It was carried by the official
Libyan news agency, JANA.
	   ``This will be proven ... when the two governments impose no
conditions which might block the trial,'' the statement added.
	   Britain cautiously welcomed the Libyan announcement.
	   ``I welcome this statement which looks like a positive
development,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   ``We shall need to study exactly what the Libyans have said, and
to ensure that they are not setting any conditions on their
acceptance,'' he added.
	   Alistair Duff, a Scottish lawyer who helps represent the
suspects, said the Libyan announcement could mean the decision on
whether to appear before the court would rest with the suspects.
	   Libya once before suggested that the men could be put on trial
if they were willing to go themselves. The suspects did not accept
the idea.
	   ``The Libyans could mean they are simply accepting the British
and U.S. proposal in principle but may not accept it fully,'' Duff
said from his home in Edinburgh.
	   ``It would still mean that the decision to go to trial at the
Hague would be with the accused,'' he said.
	   Paul Hudson, the father of one of the victims, was also
skeptical.
	   ``I would hope the Scots convene the court and the Libyans
follow through with turning over the suspects,'' said Hudson, whose
16-year-old daughter, Melina, was killed in the blast.
	   U.N. sanctions, which were imposed to force Libya to surrender
the suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms
sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Army engineers who were summoned to
detonate an unearthed World War II shell got a surprise when the
blast also uncovered 100 old anti-Hitler leaflets buried nearby.
	   The leaflets, written in German and still in good condition,
were found Tuesday in the village of Copalau near Botosani in
northern Romania, authorities said. ``Hitler lies to the German
people, Hitler brings Germany to destruction!'' the leaflets said

Laver scheduled to be discharged from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Former tennis great Rod Laver is scheduled to
be discharged from the UCLA Medical Center on Thursday _ one month
to the day after suffering a moderate stroke.
	   Laver, the only player to win the Grand Slam of tennis twice,
suffered the stroke July 27 while taping a television interview.
	   Laver, who turned 60 earlier this month, is expected to make a
brief statement at a news conference on the steps outside the main
entrance to the hospital before leaving with his wife, Mary, and
son, Rick.
	   Hospital spokesperson Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said Laver is
still having difficulty speaking.
	   A native of Australia who lives in Newport Beach, California,
Laver was moved out of the intensive care unit for good on Aug. 12,
and moved to the hospital's neuro-rehabilitation unit a day later.
	   Upon being moved to the neuro-rehabilitation unit, his condition
was upgraded to good, and he immediately began physical therapy.
	   A week ago, Laver was quoted as saying, ``I'm feeling very
good.''
	   ``While seated from a wheelchair, he was throwing a tennis ball
with his right hand and swinging a tennis racket with his left
hand,'' Dr. Eric Aldrich, a neurorehabilitation specialist, said
last week.
	   Laver, a left-hander, won the Australian, French, Wimbledon and
U.S. championships _ the grand slam of tennis _ as an amateur in
1962 and as a professional in 1969.

Soccer riot injures 50 in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police fired tear gas Wednesday to
disperse hundreds of angry soccer fans who rioted after a match
between two rival clubs was called off 25 minutes into play.
	   At least 50 people were injured, police said.
	   Some stones that rioters threw at players hit a government
minister M.A. Mannan who had come to watch the match between
Mohemmedan Sporting Club and Abahani Krira Chakra at a stadium in
Chittagong city, police said. The minister was unhurt.
	   Chittagong is 135 miles (216 kilometers) southeast of Dhaka, the
Bangladeshi capital.
	   The trouble began after the referee, reportedly advised by
officials of the two clubs, stopped the match when it was tied 1-1.
	   Suspecting match fixing, the fans rampaged through the stadium,
threw stones at players and officials. Police used batons and tear
gas to control the rioters.

World Series back for final time before name, format change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ After 37 years, the World Series of Golf is
about to fade into the shadows _ at least in its unique format.
	   As usual, though, the tournament will offer a good show and rich
history.
	   Large crowds and a glittering field including Masters and
British Open winner Mark O'Meara, Tiger Woods, PGA champion Vijay
Singh, Nick Price and David Duval will be on hand for Thursday's
opening round of the 72-hole tournament, which includes winners of
international events from the previous year.
	   Starting next year, there will be a new name _ the NEC
Invitational _ and a new format. The field will include the most
recent Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams.
	   The Invitational will be one of the four new World Golf
Championship events, devised by the America, Europe, Japan, South
Africa and Australasia tours.
	   One of the main ideas behind the new format is to bring together
a more diverse field than those in the Masters and U.S. Open,
creating a worldwide version of the four majors.
	   The other idea is money. That diverse field won't just be
playing for fame, but also dlrs 5 million in fortune.
	   The players say they come for the competition, not the
guaranteed paycheck (there is no cut).
	   ``The main thing,'' Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal said, ``is to
play every week against the best.''
	   England's Lee Westwood said, ``It will be very difficult for
players not to play. When you get to a certain stage, you want to
test yourself against the best players in the world.''
	   Firestone Country Club's South Course has received the likes of
Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Ray Floyd, Gary Player, Lee Trevino,
Tom Watson, Curtis Strange and Greg Norman. And those are just a
few of the winners since the course became host of the Rubber City
Open in 1954, on through three PGA Championships (1960, '66 and
'75) and the World Series, which debuted in its current form in
1976.
	   From 1962 to 1975, before golf became the international
spectacle that it is for millions of television viewers, the World
Series brought together the winners of the Masters, U.S. Open,
British Open and PGA Championship for a 36-hole exhibition. The
prize money was unofficial, but the bragging rights were genuine.
	   The tournament has seen more than its share of the odd and
memorable:
	   _ In 1996, someone detonated a small bomb in a trash container
just behind the first tee, a couple of hours after the last group
had teed off. Two spectators were injured, no one was ever caught
and the case is still open.
	   _ Lon Hinkle skipped a ball off the pond in front of the 16th
green and ended up saving par to win the 1979 tournament by a shot.
	   _ Olazabal opened the 1990 tourney with a course-record 61 and
went on to win by 12 shots. Not wanting to change his luck, he ate
dinner every night in a nearby steakhouse owned by two Spanish
friends.
	   _ In 1994, John Daly got into a fight in the parking lot with
the elderly parents of club pro Jeff Roth.
	   _ Six weeks before the start of that 1994 tournament, officials
had to shift the World Series across the street to the North Course
because the South's greens were dying.

Lots of Roberto Durans, but only one original for Friday night's
</HEADLINE>
title fight &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ There were so many Roberto Durans at the Las
Vegas Hilton on Wednesday that even the original was having trouble
keeping track of them without a scorecard.
	   Roberto Jr. was walking around with a camera around his neck to
record the proceedings. Roberto III was standing behind his father,
eager to translate his thoughts into English for an interviewer.
	   There was Roberto IV in a far corner with his sisters. And
Roberto V was crawling on the chairs and jumping in his father's
lap.
	   ``They're all really Roberto juniors,'' the senior Duran said.
``We just ran out of that name.''
	   The names may be the same, but only one Roberto Duran will be
walking into the ring Friday night to challenge for the WBA
middleweight title held by William Joppy.
	   That will be Duran Sr., who at the age of 47 is hoping he will
be able to turn back the clock once again in what figures to be the
last real chance in a pro boxing career that stretches back to the
presidency of Lyndon Johnson.
	   ``Roberto Duran will be the new champion,'' Duran proclaimed
during Wednesday's final pre-fight press conference. ``If I thought
of myself as being over the hill, I would have retired long ago.''
	   Duran, winner of titles in four weight classes, fights Joppy in
a scheduled 12-round fight, his first for a title since losing his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard nine years ago.
	   IBF middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins defends his title
against Robert Allen in the other title fight on the card.
	   The fight was originally supposed to be held June 6, when Duran
was a mere 46, but the card at Madison Square Garden in New York
was canceled after Henry Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis
and couldn't fight Evander Holyfield in the featured event.
	   Duran, who reportedly is giving his dlrs 200,000 purse to the
IRS to help settle a tax debt, isn't exactly on a roll coming into
the fight.
	   In his last fight, he was knocked down by someone named Felix
Hernandez in Panama before getting up to win a 10-round decision.
Duran's last victory of any substance came nearly a decade ago when
he upset Iran Barkley to win the WBC middleweight title that he
promptly lost to Leonard in his next fight.
	   But Duran has won fights he shouldn't have won, and Joppy
(25-1-1, 19 knockouts) remains wary at least of his reputation.
	   ``He's a legend,'' Joppy said. ``But he's had his time of
yesteryear. I want to be a legend myself now.''
	   Duran (102-13, 69 knockouts) was already 20-0 when Joppy was
born in 1970, just two years away from his first title win over Ken
Buchanan for the lightweight championship.
	   Now, he's a grizzled veteran whose best years are long past but
who believes deeply he has enough for one last hurrah. Joppy is a
4-1 favorite.
	   ``He's just another fighter,'' Duran said. ``I'm not concerned
about his speed or his punch.''
	   For Duran, however, it's not just another fight. It could be the
last of a career that made him a hero in his native Panama and a
legend in boxing.
	   ``I'm still having fun and enjoying myself,'' Duran said.
``Maybe in a year or two I'll retire. Not now.''

	   Ritter submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday and it
was accepted, said the chief inspector, Richard Butler.
	   ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the
extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   The resignation was sure to be greeted in Baghdad, where Ritter
had incurred the wrath of Saddam Hussein for his work in trying to
uncover Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
	   A dispute last year between the United Nations and Iraq first
surfaced when the American weapons inspector was barred from
entering a presidential palace in 1996. Ritter has angered Iraq
with unannounced inspections.
	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons.
	   Ritter accompanied Butler to an Aug. 3 meeting in which Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asked Butler to declare Iraq had complied
with U.N. resolutions and Butler refused, essentially ending the
talks.
	   Ritter's resignation was effective immediately, Butler said.
	   In January, Iraq accused Ritter of being a spy and said that his
team included too many American and British inspectors. They
refused to give him Iraqi escorts, preventing him from working.
	   Ritter's team was one of the largest ever sent to Iraq.
	   His last field inspection occurred in March, after the latest
standoff over inspections was resolved, Butler said.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan negotiated an agreement Feb. 23 to
allow inspectors into presidential palaces which Iraq had declared
off-limits, citing its sovereignty.

Libya accepts US-British proposal for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix lead sequence
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with response from Britain, suspects' lawyers and
family of U.S. victim, FIXES quote in 3rd graf
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya on Wednesday accepted a US-British
proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight
in the Netherlands, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said.
	   The ministry statement gave no conditions and did not say when
the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
_ might be moved to The Netherlands or when the trial might start.
	   Libya ``announces its acceptance of ... the development in the
positions of the governments of the United Kingdom and the United
States,'' the ministry said in a statement.
	   London and Washington had earlier insisted that any trial must
be held in the United States or Britain.
	   The Libyan announcement came shortly after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi met with his senior aides to discuss the proposal and Libya
asked the U.N. Security Council to delay any decision on the offer
until it could further study the proposal.
	   The two Libyans are accused of planting a bomb aboard the
flight, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270
people.
	   The Libyans and the Western nations involved were all likely to
see a trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a
trial on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end to the United
Nations sanctions imposed in 1992, which the holding of the trial
is expected to bring.
	   The United States and Britain see the agreement as an acceptance
by Libya that its citizens should be called to account in the
bombing, and should face trial under Scottish law.
	   With Libya's acceptance of a deal, the Security Council pressed
ahead Wednesday with a draft resolution that would suspend U.N.
sanctions once the two suspects appear for trial. The draft
resolution threatens other sanctions if Libya does not hand over
the suspects in a timely manner.
	   As part of the American and British offer, the two Libyan
suspects would be tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   The suspects also could not be extradited from the Netherlands.
If found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the United
Kingdom.
	   Libya ``hopes that the governments of the United Kingdom and the
United States are serious in their efforts to resolve this
problem,'' the statement said. It was carried by the official
Libyan news agency, JANA.
	   ``This will be proven ... when the two governments impose no
conditions which might block the trial,'' the statement added.
	   Britain cautiously welcomed the Libyan announcement.
	   ``I welcome this statement which looks like a positive
development,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   ``We shall need to study exactly what the Libyans have said, and
to ensure that they are not setting any conditions on their
acceptance,'' he added.
	   Alistair Duff, a Scottish lawyer who helps represent the
suspects, said the Libyan announcement could mean the decision on
whether to appear before the court would rest with the suspects.
	   Libya once before suggested that the men could be put on trial
if they were willing to go themselves. The suspects did not accept
the idea.
	   ``The Libyans could mean they are simply accepting the British
and U.S. proposal in principle but may not accept it fully,'' Duff
said from his home in Edinburgh.
	   ``It would still mean that the decision to go to trial at the
Hague would be with the accused,'' he said.
	   Paul Hudson, the father of one of the victims, was also
skeptical.
	   ``I would hope the Scots convene the court and the Libyans
follow through with turning over the suspects,'' said Hudson, whose
16-year-old daughter, Melina, was killed in the blast.
	   U.N. sanctions, which were imposed to force Libya to surrender
the suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms
sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Firebomb damages French bank in Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A propane gas canister bomb exploded early
Thursday outside a suburban Athens branch of the Banque National de
Paris, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The explosive device, consisting of more than 10 gas canisters,
exploded shortly after midnight, causing slight damage to the bank
branch in the northern suburb of Maroussi and seriously damaging
cars parked outside.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   The attack was the second of its kind this week. On Tuesday, two
makeshift gas canister bombs exploded in central Athens, one
outside a Commercial Bank branch and the other outside the
capital's town planning headquarters, causing damage but no
injuries.
	   The first device consisted of 15 propane gas canisters, while
the second was much smaller.
	   A little-known group called Autonomous Cells of Revolutionary
Action claimed responsibility for those attacks. The group has
claimed five attacks so far this year, including the April bombing
of a branch office of Britain's Barcleys bank.
	   The group said it was protesting the January arrest of Nikos
Maziotis, who was charged with heading a leftist firebombing ring.
	   Several arson attacks since then have been claimed by groups
protesting Maziotis' arrest.
	   Similar devices have been used to torch more than 150 cars and
offices since January. They belonged to officials, politicians,
Jewish and anti-Semitic groups, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy groups little known to
authorities.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Incensed that the Security Council has
failed to take a tougher stand on the latest Iraqi impasse over
arms inspections, Scott Ritter, a controversial American
concealment expert on the U.N. weapons inspection team, resigned
Wednesday.
	   In his letter of resignation, Ritter singled out the United
States for failing to fight for inspectors' unrestricted access to
suspected weapons sites. He also accused Secretary-General Kofi
Annan of allowing his office to become a ``sounding board for Iraqi
grievances, real or imagined.''
	   But he held out the toughest criticism for the Security Council,
whose recent decisions ``clearly indicates that the organization
... is no longer willing and or capable of the implementation of
its own law.
	   ``This abrogation of its most basic of responsibilities has made
the Security Council a witting partner to an overall Iraqi stragety
of weakening the Special Commission,'' which carries out
inspections, Ritter wrote.
	   ``What is being propagated by the Security Council today in
relation to the work of the Special Commissin is such an illusion,
one which in all good faith I cannot, and will not be a party to,''
he wrote.
	   Ritter, 37 and a six-year veteran of the U.N. Special
Commission, submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday and it
was accepted effective immediately, said the chief inspector,
Richard Butler.
	   ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the
extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   The resignation was sure to be greeted in Baghdad, where Ritter
had incurred the wrath of Saddam Hussein for his work in trying to
uncover Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
	   A dispute last year between the United Nations and Iraq first
surfaced when the American weapons inspector was barred from

	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions will be lifted.
	   ``The Special Commission of today, hobbled as it is by
unfettered Iraqi obstruction and non-existent Security Council
enforcement of its own resolutions, is not the organization I
joined almost seven years ago,'' Ritter wrote.
	   Ritter accompanied Butler to an Aug. 3 meeting in which Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asked Butler to declare Iraq had complied
with U.N. resolutions and Butler refused, essentially ending the
talks.
	   In January, Iraq accused Ritter of being a spy and said that his

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A lawyer defending imprisoned leftists
and other dissidents has been arrested, accused of involvement in
illegal squatting at a tourist development in this Pacific resort.
	   A state police news release late Tuesday said the lawyer, Jose
Sanchez Sanchez, was taken into custody on a warrant issued by the
6th Criminal Court in Acapulco.
	   Jose Reyes Camero, a colleague, claimed Sanchez was arrested in
retaliation for accusing Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero
of being involved in the July 9 assassination of a
peasant-organization leader in the town of Coyuca de Benitez.
	   Reyes said the governor personally warned Sanchez, who was a
lawyer for the organization, he would be arrested if he persisted
in the accusation.
	   Sanchez also represented the widows of 17 peasants massacred in
Guerrero by state troopers in 1995, 13 arrested members of the
People's Revolutionary Army and two more from the Insurgent
People's Revolutionary Army, a splinter group. Both are leftist
guerrilla organizations.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Petroleos Mexicanos said Wednesday that a
fire in the feeding pipes of its Lazaro Cardenas refinery caused
little damage and didn't affect operations.
	   Pemex, as the state-owned oil monopoly is known, said the fire
Tuesday night forced it to shut down an electricity generating
station that serves the plant. The pipes that caught fire feed
liquid petroleum gas to the plant.
	   The fire caused little damage, although a precise figure was
unavailable, said Pemex spokesman Arturo Martinez.
	   No injuries were reported, and the fire occurred outside the
plant's refinery area, he said.
	   The plant, in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, is one of
Pemex's largest, producing an average of 198,400 barrels of crude a
day in 1996.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Argentina's Chamber of Deputies
failed to reach quorum Wednesday, as opposition lawmakers boycotted
the government's attempt to vote on key labor reform legislation.
	   It was the third failure by the lower house in as many weeks to
gather the minimum 129 members needed to take up the labor reform
bill.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of truckers and other dissident factions of
organized labor protested against the legislation outside the
Congress.
	   The bill is intended to revamp Argentina's rigid labor laws,
allowing companies to negotiate labor agreements with their own
workers instead of submitting to industry wide negotiations.
	   It would also change longstanding hiring and firing practices as
a means to curb the country's jobless rate, now at 13 percent.
	   The opposition boycott raised the possibility that President
Carlos Menem may put the controversial legislation in place via
executive decree.

	   GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) _ Without a peep, Fanny Mejia let a
fellow inmate in Guayaquil's prison sew her lips shut with a needle
and thread Wednesday in a bizarre protest of Ecuador's judicial
system.
	   A few dots of blood emerged from her unanaesthetized lips, which
had been splashed with disinfectant. The black thread looped her
lips three times. Television cameras filmed the event. No doctors
were present.
	   Mejia, a 51-year-old Colombian woman arrested for drug
trafficking, became the 16th prisoner _ 10 men and six women _ to
sew her lips shut in the last two weeks to protest the slow pace
and unfairness of justice in Ecuador.
	   Another 50 prisoners are on a hunger strike in prisons in Quito
and Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest cities.
	   The prisoners claim they have spent more than a year in prison
without being brought to trial, and under Ecuadorean law they
should be freed.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A landslide destroyed twelve homes, killed
seven people and left two injured Wednesday in the western
Guatemala province of Quiche, volunteer firefighters reported.
	   Rescue workers pulled the seven bodies from the wreckage of a
settlement known as ``La Quebrada,'' about 50 miles northwest of
Guatemala City.
	   The search for bodies is continuing, said Layra Morataya of the
firefighter's office. About 20 people were thought to inhabit the
homes destroyed in the slide.
	   Officials reported that a road leading to the settlement had
been blocked by the slide, forcing rescue workers to reach the
hamlet on foot.

	   BUNOL, Spain (AP) _ It began with the ritual chant: ``Tomatoes!
Tomatoes! We want tomatoes!''
	   Then came the trucks. They rumbled into the square single file,
dumping about 100 tons of the ripe, red produce into the streets
for this town's annual food fight.
	   More than 30,000 people spent an hour Wednesday pelting each
other with tomatoes, painting themselves and a town with thick red
mush.
	   Some people wore safety goggles to protect their eyes from acid
in the tomatoes. Others sported straw hats in a futile bid to keep
their hair clean. Everybody stood ankle deep in red pulp.
	   Spectators watched from the sidelines, some with video cameras
wrapped in plastic.
	   Bunol, a working-class town 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the
Mediterranean city of Valencia, swells to three times its normal
population during the Tomatina festival, held on the last Wednesday
in August.
	   Minerva Gomez, a town hall official, said it is not clear
exactly how far back the festival goes, although it's been a yearly
event since the 1940s and gained the city's sponsorship in 1979.
	   There are several theories as to how it got started. One is that
a group of friends meeting in the town square for lunch hurled
tomatoes at someone who showed up late.
	   Another theory claims youngsters threw tomatoes at rich kids
whose parents had vacation homes nearby.
	   Gomez says there has never been an injury reported.
	   Before the trucks brought in the ammunition, the crowd was hosed
down so people would be slippery and direct hits from tomatoes
would sting less.
	   When the tomatoes stopped flying, people trudged to one of about
300 makeshift showers.

Cubs batter Reds as Sosa homers; Mets down Giants

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Sammy Sosa finally made contact against Brett
Tomko, hitting a towering shot for his 52nd homer Wednesday as the
Chicago Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds 9-2 to end a four-game losing
streak.
	   Kerry Wood (12-6) struck out 16 in eight innings, the
second-highest total of his rookie season, as he won for the first
time since July 31.
	   Sosa, who had struck out in his four career at-bats against
Tomko (11-10), hit a solo homer in the third inning that smacked an
advertising panel on the facing of the third deck in left-center
field.
	   The homer drew a standing ovation from a large part of the crowd
of 20,315 and moved Sosa to within one of Mark McGwire as they
close in on Roger Maris' record of 61.
 &UR; Mets 4, Giants 1
	   In San Francisco, Hideo Nomo pitched a three-hitter and struck
out 10 as the New York Mets retained their lead in the National
League wild-card chase with a 4-1 win Wednesday over the San
Francisco Giants.
	   Nomo, returning to the park where he made his major league debut
in 1995 and in which he came within five outs of a perfect game
later that season, had the Giants swinging wildly throughout the
game.
	   Nomo (6-11) did not allow a runner until Jeff Kent led off the
fifth with a soft single to left. He struck out Barry Bonds three
times, whiffed the side in the third inning, and walked only two.
	   Lenny Harris led off the game with a homer off Orel Hershiser
(9-9) and Brian McRae had a pair of RBI singles for the Mets, who
broke a three-game losing streak. The other New York run scored on
a wild pitch. McRae went 3-for-4, with three singles.

	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) _ South African Amanda Coetzer broke Anna
Kournikova's service three times in the final set Wednesday in a
1-6, 6-4, 7-5 in the Pilot Pen International.
	   Coetzer trailed 1-4 in the deciding set before she began to
frustrate the Russian with deep strokes that prevented hard, angled
returns. The unseeded teen then dropped a string of points serving
at 5-5 and sent Coetzer to the line up 6-5 to serve for the match.
	   ``I just had faith that I could hang in there,'' Coetzer said.
``I felt like I was starting to play better and better as the match
went on.''
	   Kournikova dominated the first set and part of the second,
jumping on Coetzer's shallow baseline play and running the No. 7
seed all over the court when she wasn't smashing her desperate
lobs. Kournikova, ranked 14th in the world, also used smart drop
shots and serves that reached 107 mph (171 kmph) to run up the
lead.
	   Kournikova returned to the tour last week in Montreal after
missing eight weeks because of a strained thumb. She said her
mental game may have suffered, but she also credited Coetzer for
hanging on.
	   ``She was just being tough out there,'' Kournikova said. ``She
started not making any mistakes.''
	   Coetzer, ranked 12th in the world, faces No. 4 seed Steffi Graf
in the quarterfinals.
	   Rain and a thunderstorm postponed play after the match, delaying
the start of a contest between Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the
No. 3 seed, and Julie Halard-Decugis of France. Also scheduled to
play Wednesday night were No. 1 seed Lindsay Davenport against
Spanish qualifier Virginia Ruano-Pascual, and Wimbledon champ Jana
Novotna against American Chanda Rubin.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Anka Huber of Germany beat No. 6 seed Patty
Schnyder 7-5, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Huber, who missed four months of competition after Achille's
tendon surgery, fended off a late drive by Schnyder, who forced a
tiebreaker after dropping the first four games.
	   ``It still gives me a lot of confidence to win close matches
anyway, especially against the top players,'' Huber said.
	   Schnyder, ranked 10th in the world, said her service returns and
mental game both need some work.
	   ``I couldn't hold my concentration at a high level,'' she said.

FBI: Cuban exiles charged in plot to kill Castro turning themselves

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Seven Cuban exiles, including a
director of the Cuban American National Foundation, are turning
themselves in to face trial for plotting to kill Fidel Castro, the
FBI said Wednesday.
	   The seven were indicted by a federal grand jury in San Juan on
Tuesday and the FBI issued warrants in what is believed to be the
first such court case after years of alleged plots against Cuba's
communist leader. Four of the suspects will face charges in court
in Puerto Rico on Thursday. The other three will appear in court
next week.
	   ``Other arrests and indictments .. could happen any moment
because the investigation is continuing,'' FBI spokeswoman Sara
Lema told The Associated Press.
	   Past assassination plots against Castro were attributed to U.S.
agencies including the CIA, which helped train Cuban exiles in
terror tactics in the 1960s. But an executive order has since
banned government-sponsored assassinations in foreign countries,
and there have been no known violations.
	   The indictment of Jose Antonio Llama, 68, was a blow to the
Miami-based group, of which he is a director. Castro himself has
accused the foundation of plotting to kill him, but the group
denies such intentions, professing a commitment to peaceful
political persuasion.
	   The foundation, which has strongly influenced Washington's
hard-line policy toward Cuba, claimed Tuesday the indictment aimed
to discredit Cuban exiles as part of ``an unprecedented and
well-financed assault on U.S.-Cuba policy in Washington.''
	   It said it was confident of Llama's innocence.
	   On Thursday, four men who fled their island's communist
revolution will appear in court to be formally charged with
conspiring ``to kill, with malice aforethought, Fidel Castro.''
	   Angel Manuel Alfonso, 58, Angel Hernandez Rojo, 65, Juan
Bautista Marquez, 62, and Francisco Secundino Cordova, 51, were
arrested off Puerto Rico on Oct. 27 when a search of their yacht
revealed weapons that included two .50 caliber assault rifles.
	   Alfonso, who like the others initially denied there were weapons
aboard, blurted out that he alone was responsible for the guns.
According to an initial complaint, he admitted planning to use them
to kill Castro at a November summit of Latin American leaders in
Venezuela.
	   Lema said Llama and two others _ Jose Rodriguez, 59, and Alfredo
Domingo Otero, 68 _ will be in court next Wednesday.
	   Tuesday's indictment accuses the seven of plotting Castro's
assassination since early 1995.
	   Llama has admitted that he owns the yacht, the 46-foot
(14-meter) Esperanza, and also is accused of providing one of the
two rifles.
	   The rifle is registered to Francisco ``Pepe'' Hernandez, the
foundation's president. Hernandez was questioned by the FBI but has
not been indicted. The other rifle is registered to Emilio Pou, a
veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
	   On Wednesday, The New York Times quoted a Justice Department
official as saying Hernandez was still under investigation, as were
others associated with the foundation.
	   The foundation has suffered a leadership vacuum since the death
of founding chairman Jorge Mas Canosa in November. Mas Canosa
enjoyed White House access to several presidents and was a
prodigious fundraiser with much clout in Congress.
	   Larry Burns, director of Washington's Council of Hemispheric
Affairs, said the indictment reflected a ``thaw'' in the U.S.
position on Cuba and ``really represents taps for the plenary
influence that the foundation had over the U.S. foreign policy (on)
Cuba.''

Egypt presses Libya to accept US-British proposal

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A decade after Pan Am Flight 103 exploded
over Scotland, Libya on Wednesday issued a qualified acceptance of
a U.S.-British compromise to try two suspects in the Netherlands,
urging that U.N. sanctions against Libya be lifted.
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it
``announces its acceptance of the development in the positions of
the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States'' and
``stresses the necessity to lift the sanctions.''
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the plane,
which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing
270 people. Among the dead were 189 Americans.
	   The statement made no specific reference to the handing over of
the two suspects.
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the two men would be tried in the
Netherlands, but under Scottish law and by a panel of three
Scottish judges.
	   The suspects cannot be extradited from the Netherlands. If found
guilty, they would serve their sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   In its statement, Libya urged the United States and Britain not
to impose conditions that might block the trial.
	   The compromise plan, a decade in the making, comes after Britain
and the United States had long insisted the trial be held in one of
their territories. For its part, Libya previously suggested that
the men could be put on trial if they were willing to go
themselves; they did not accept the idea.
	   Britain reacted cautiously to Wednesday's announcement, which
was carried by the official Libyan news agency, JANA.
	   ``I welcome this statement, which looks like a positive
development,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``We shall need
to study exactly what the Libyans have said.''
	   Both the Libyans and the Western nations involved would see a
trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a trial
on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end sanctions imposed in
1992, which the agreement is expected to bring.
	   The Security Council met for a second day Wednesday to consider
a draft resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to
suspend the sanctions upon the suspects' arrival in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hoped a
vote on the resolution would come Thursday.
	   The sanctions, imposed to push Libya to surrender the men, ban
air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales, freeze some
assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   The announcement Wednesday came several hours after a letter was
made public in New York in which Libya asked the U.N. Security
Council to delay any decision to give it more time to study the
proposal.
	   Also preceding the Libyan government statement, leader Moammar
Gadhafi had met in Tripoli with his top aides and a senior
political adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Libya's
official television reported.
	   The broadcast also said Libyan officials in Tripoli were meeting
with diplomats from the member states of the Security Council. The
United States and Britain have no diplomatic relations with Libya.
	   Alistair Duff, a Scottish lawyer who helps represent the
suspects, said the Libyan announcement could mean the decision on
whether to appear before the court would rest with the suspects.
	   Libya once before suggested that the men could be put on trial
if they were willing to go themselves. The suspects did not accept
the idea.
	   Paul Hudson, the father of one of the victims, was also
skeptical.
	   ``I would hope the Scots convene the court and the Libyans
follow through with turning over the suspects,'' said Hudson, whose
16-year-old daughter, Melina, was killed in the blast.

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Sean Sargent hit his fourth
homer of the Little League World Series as Langley, Canada, beat
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 9-3 to advance to Thursday's international
championship game.
	   The undefeated Canadians will face Kashima, Japan, a team they
beat 10-5 in seven innings behind five home runs _ four in the
extra inning.
	   A Canadian team has never won the World Series, and the last
team to even make it to the final was Stoney Creek, Ontario, in
1965. It lost 3-1 to Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
	   Sargent is batting .500 with five RBIs.
	   Langley, with nine home runs, is the biggest team in this World
Series, and it beat Dhahran with power.
	   Sargent's solo shot to left led off a five-run third inning,
Jared Krause knocked two runs home with a double to the warning
track and Mark Henderson hit an RBI single up the middle, then
scored on a wild pitch as Langley led 7-0.
	   The Canadians rocked starting pitcher Amit Karr for six earned
runs on five hits in 2 2-3 innings.
	   Langley starter Jared Krause gave up one run on four hits over

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Anaheim came from behind to beat New York for
the third straight time, with Reggie Williams hitting a go-ahead,
two-run homer that led the Angels to a 6-4 victory Wednesday in the
opener of a day-night doubleheader.
	   New York, which wasted a 2-0 lead, has allowed 41 runs in its
last five games and looks nothing like the powerhouse that raced to
a 94-32 record before the skid. The Yankees have lost four straight
for the first time this season.
	   The Angels, who began the day with a 3 1/2-game lead in the AL
West, are 6-3 against the Yankees this season _ the only team to
lead New York in the season series _ and could open the playoffs at
Yankee Stadium.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A decade after Pan Am Flight 103 exploded
over Scotland, Libya on Wednesday issued a qualified acceptance of
a U.S.-British compromise to try two suspects in the Netherlands,
urging that U.N. sanctions against Libya be lifted. The Libyan
Foreign Ministry said that it ``announces its acceptance of the
development in the positions of the governments of the United
Kingdom and the United States'' and ``stresses the necessity to
lift the sanctions.'' Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a
bomb aboard the plane, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on
Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people. Libya's statement made no
specific reference to the handing over of the two suspects and
urged the United States and Britain not to impose conditions that
might block the trial. The U.S.-British plan calls for the men to
be tried under Scottish law and, if found guilty, they would serve
their sentences in the United Kingdom.(LIBYA-PAN AM BOMBING)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The thud of artillery fire shuddered
through the empty streets of Kinshasa on Wednesday as a 3-week-old
civil war spilled into the capital's eastern suburbs. Hundreds of
fighters were reported wounded or killed. Residents of the capital
of this central African nation, already battered by power cuts and
water shortages, hunkered down for what some feared was the start
of a full-scale rebel assault. Tense soldiers patrolled deserted
neighborhoods _ a dramatic shift from one day earlier when crowds
of cheering residents welcomed President Laurent Kabila back to the
city. Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and
Zimbabwean troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of
Tutsi fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military.
(CONGO)
	   CONG, Ireland (AP) _ The British and Irish prime ministers
pledged Wednesday to rout IRA dissidents for the sake of defending
Northern Ireland's peace agreement. Tony Blair flew to Ashford
Castle for two hours of talks with his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, 11 days after a car bomb planted by the Real IRA slaughtered
28 people and wounded more than 330 others in the Northern Ireland
town of Omagh. Afterward, Ahern and Blair together promised to
imprison armed opponents of the Belfast agreement _ an accord that,
ironically, offers early paroles for more than 400 Irish Republican
Army members and pro-British militants. Blair and Ahern expect
emergency sessions of their parliaments in London and Dublin next
week to pass new anti-terror laws giving police a pivotal role in
convicting suspected members of outlawed paramilitary groups.
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South African police were closing
in Wednesday on suspects in the fatal bombing of a Planet
Hollywood, which authorities said probably was the target of
homegrown terrorists aiming at the United States. The explosion
Tuesday evening at the crowded tourist spot killed a South African
bank employee and injured 27 people. ``I am confident they will be
arrested soon,'' South African Press Association quoted President
Nelson Mandela as saying. A pair of FBI agents headed to the site
from Nairobi to help in the investigation. The blast prompted South
African intelligence officials to scrutinize security at American
businesses and government offices, said police spokeswoman Supt.
Sally de Beer. (SOUTH AFRICA-EXPLOSION)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A high-ranking Palestinian official said
Wednesday that the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal has been detained
in Egypt, but the country's foreign minister denied the report. The
Palestinian's statement follows nearly two weeks of similar claims,
all denied by Egyptian security officials who spoke anonymously.
The comment by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is the first denial by
an Egyptian official speaking publicly. The interest in Abu Nidal _
Arabic for ``father of struggle'' _ comes because of his notoriety
for his daring attacks on Israelis and even Palestinians whom he
opposed, and for the mystery surrounding him. He was once
considered the world's most dangerous terrorist. He is reported to
have died several times _ only to reappear _ and to have totally
changed his looks through plastic surgery. (EGYPT-ABU NIDAL)

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Princess Diana's fairy-tale life and real-world
death was the stuff of movies. Now, it's caught the attention of
Broadway _ sort of.
	   ``Queen of Hearts'' _ a musical portrait of Diana's life and
death _ is scheduled to open off-off Broadway in October,
playwright Stephen Stahl said Wednesday.
	   He said it was ``a very loving and basically straightforward
portrait of Diana.''
	   Stahl has cast two unknowns: Kendra Munger as Diana and James A.
Walsh as Prince Charles.
	   The musical also will feature a familiar cast of singing
characters from Diana's life: her sons, William and Harry; Prince
Charles' mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles; Diana's lover, Dodi
Fayed; and assorted courtiers, reporters and citizens.
	   The lyrics were written by Claudia Perry, whose credits include
``The Body Shop'' and ``Along for the Ride.''
	   ``Queen of Hearts'' opens Oct. 5 at the Grove Street Playhouse
in Greenwich Village.
	   Several other cultural icons have been immortalized in musicals.
Eva Peron and opera diva Maria Callas both were the subject of
popular shows.
	   Diana, 36, died in a Paris car crash with her boyfriend,
millionaire Dodi Fayed.
	   ___
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Photographs taken by youngsters from
Nairobi's sprawling Mathare slum to illustrate their lives and
hopes went on display Wednesday alongside the work of the world's
leading photojournalists at the Nairobi National Musem.
	   The photos are part of the Mathare Youth Sports Association
``Shootback Project'' that is running alongside the World Press
Photo exhibit.
	   ``They have basic, inexpensive 35mm point-and-shoot cameras and
are photographing aspects of their lives that they deem important
and/or problematic, including family, community, environment health
and personal issues,'' said project coordinator Lana Wong.
	   She said 32 youngsters between the ages of 12 and 17 are
participating in the project designed to encourage people to
improve living conditions in slum areas.
	   World Press Photo project manager Michiel Munnneke said the 1997
competition attracted 36,000 entries from around the world. The
winning 200 photos form the travelling exhibit.
	   The exhibit runs from Wednesday through Sept. 14.
	   The website for the MYSA Shootback Project is:

	   SYRACUSE, New York (AP) _ Billy Joel says recurring throat
problems have forced him to postpone the fall leg of his world
tour.
	   Earlier this year, the Piano Man canceled several American and
European dates, including an appearance with Elton John, because of
an upper respiratory infection,
	   Joel has spent the summer recuperating at his home in Long
Island, New York, and has rescheduled all his September and October
concerts for November and December.
	   ``My doctor is encouraged by the progress I've made, but he
wants to be sure that I am 100 percent before I step out on stage
again,'' Joel said Wednesday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oasis has a sound that draws heavily _ too
heavily, some critics complain _ from its idols, the Beatles.
	   Now, Oasis star Noel Gallagher is planning to emulate them in
his movie debut.
	   Gallagher is set to make a brief appearance in the movie ``Mad
Cows,'' walking across the Abbey Road intersection pictured on the
cover of the Beatles' 1969 album of the same name.
	   The movie, which begins filming next month, is about the comic
adventures of an Australian visitor to London who ends up in jail
after being caught shoplifting in Harrods.
	   ___
	   SYRACUSE, New York (AP) _ Shania Twain took the country music
scene by storm. At one of her sellout concerts, the storm struck
back.
	   Twain's concert at the New York State Fair grandstand came to an
abrupt end Monday night when lightning struck 40 yards (meters)
behind the stage, prompting officials to end the show.
	   Nearly 16,800 fans braved heavy rain and high winds for the
first 70 minutes of the show, to hear Twain sing hits such as
``You're Still the One'' and ``Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love
You).''
	   ___
	   INGLEWOOD, California (AP) _ Gary Coleman, the former ``What you
talking 'bout'' kid on TV's ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' pleaded innocent
to hitting a woman who sought his autograph at the mall where he
works as a security guard.
	   Coleman, 30, did not appear in court Tuesday for arraignment on
a misdemeanor assault charge, and his lawyer entered the plea. The
judge set a pretrial hearing for Oct. 20.
	   The woman, Los Angeles bus driver Tracy Fields, said Coleman
signed an autograph and then flew into a rage when she asked him to
personalize it for her son on July 30.
	   He punched her in the eye and kept hitting her after she fell
into a gumball machine in a uniform store, she said. She suffers
headaches and muscle spasms as a result, she alleges in a dlrs 1
million lawsuit against Coleman.
	   Adam London, Coleman's lawyer, said Ms. Fields is trying to
exploit his client's stardom to ``gain fame and fortune.''
	   Coleman played the affable Arnold Jackson on ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' which originally aired from 1978 to 1986.
	   ___
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Singer-songwriter Janis Ian is going
high-tech for an auction via the Internet in memory of her mother.
	   Among the 300 items on sale is the handwritten score to Ian's
1975 hit song ``At Seventeen,'' along with one of her guitars and
her first drafts of many songs.
	   Proceeds will go to a memorial fund at Vermont's Goddard
College, the alma mater of Ian's mother, Pearl Wadoff. While
fighting multiple sclerosis, she earned an undergraduate degree and
a master's in playwrighting from the school. She died last year.
	   ``Goddard kept my mother alive and healthy, longer than she
would have been without them,'' Ian said Tuesday.
	   Ian, 47, scored her first hit in 1967 with ``Society's Child
(Baby I've Been Thinking).'' Her 1975 album ``Between the Lines''
went platinum.
	   The auction will begin Sept. 15. The Internet address is
www.songs.com/janisian/auction.

Garcia hoping to add U.S. Amateur title to his British crown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN DOBBIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ They call him ``El Nino,'' Spanish
for little boy.
	   Sergio Garcia, 18, a phenom among the ever-younger array of golf
stars, is aiming for a rare double this weekend: a U.S. Amateur
title to add to the British Amateur trophy he picked up in June.
	   The affable Spaniard served notice in his opening match
Wednesday at Oak Hill, easily beating Ben Garner of Lake Forest,
California by 4 and 3 and raising the prospect of a showdown Friday
with defending champion Matt Kuchar.
	   ``I think if I can play like I have, I can try to do something
good,'' Garcia said as he strolled back to the clubhouse, signing
golf balls, hats and programs for a gaggle of young fans.
	   As for doing the double, a feat achieved in the same year by
just four golfers, Garcia is keeping his fingers crossed. And if he
fails, he won't lose any sleep.
	   ``It's very difficult _ there's a lot of great players here and
I'll have to play really, really well,'' he said. `` ... If not, it
doesn't matter. It's not the only thing I got in my head.''
	   After 36 holes of stroke play, the top 64 scorers in the field
of 312 moved into match-play duels that culminate in Sunday's
final.
	   Kuchar racked up three birdies as he rolled over Jamie Broce of
Muncie, Ind., 8 and 7.
	   ``Things just clicked,'' he said. ``I was just trying to play it
safe ... and I ended up playing a fabulous match.''
	   Joel Kribel, defeated by Kuchar in last year's final, crashed
out 2 and 1 against J.J. Henry of Fairfield, Conn. Henry grabbed
the final match-play slot in a playoff Wednesday morning.
	   Erik Compton, 18, America's top-ranked junior and a
heart-transplant recipient at age 12, lost 2 and 1 to Jason Dufner.
John Pitt knocked out 1995 finalist Buddy Marucci.
	   Kuchar, 20, takes on Matthew Saglio on Thursday morning and
Garcia is matched against Chip Travis. They will also need to
survive round 3 Thursday afternoon before tangling Friday.
	   Garcia picked up his nickname in his early teens when he wasn't
yet 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. He's now 5-10 meters (1.75 meters)
and says his game has improved more quickly than he expected.
Instead of waiting until after college, he expects to turn pro next
year, possibly after the Masters.
	   The last to win the British and U.S. Amateur titles in the same
year was Robert B. Dickson in 1967. The key for Garcia could come
against Kuchar. ``That could be a good match,'' he said with a
smile.
	   The two have played together a few times, most recently in a
practice round before this year's British Open.
	   ``For me he feels like a friend,'' he said. ``I don't know for
him.''

Blackhawks bring back Olczyk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Blackhawks signed free agent Eddie
Olczyk on Wednesday, returning him to the team with whom he began
his National Hockey League career in 1984.
	   Olczyk played last season with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Since
leaving Chicago after the 1986-87 season, he has also played for
the Toronto Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets, New York Rangers and Los
Angeles Kings.
	   In 937 career games, he's scored 330 goals with 435 assists. In
57 playoff games, he's scored 19 goals with 15 assists.
	   Olczyk was the No. 3 player picked in the 1984 entry draft
behind Mario Lemieux and Kirk Muller. His best season with the
Blackhawks came in 1985-86 when he scored 29 goals and had 79
points.
	   ``We're pleased to bring Eddie back to Chicago,'' Blackhawks
general manager Bob Murray said. ``He is a proven NHL player who
has shown the ability to score in this league. We feel he can help
give us some of the scoring punch we need this season.''
	   Terms of his contract were not revealed.

Defending champion Schalken reaches quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Sjeng Schalken of the
Netherlands, who surprised a few people a year ago by winning the
MFS Pro Tennis Championships, could be on track for a repeat.
	   The unseeded 21-year-old reached the quarterfinals Wednesday
with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Jeff Tarango.
	   Tarango, who beat second-seeded Karol Kucera in the first round,
couldn't handle Schalken's swift ground strokes.
	   Paul Haarhuis won the first five games of his match against Jiri
Novak but still needed three sets to escape with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5
victory.
	   The Dutchman, who had shown more success in doubles in recent
years, blew three match points at 5-4, allowing Novak to pull even.
But Haarhuis broke his foe at love and served out the match with
the loss of only one point.
	   Also, Nicolas Lapenti of Ecuador outlasted Carlos Costa of Spain
6-7 (10-8) 6-4, 7-5 and qualifier Sebastien Grosjean of France beat
Xavier Malisse of Belgium 6-4, 7-5.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A 3-week-old civil war is approaching the
capital, raising fears among some residents that a full-scale rebel
assault may not be far behind.
	   The thud and echo of artillery fire shuddered through the empty
streets of Kinshasa on Wednesday as fighting spilled into the
capital's eastern suburbs. Hundreds of fighters were wounded or
killed, doctors said.
	   Few pedestrians ventured outside and tense soldiers patrolled
deserted neighborhoods. The scene was a dramatic shift from the
cheering crowds who welcomed President Laurent Kabila back to the
city on Tuesday.
	   The fighting between government soldiers and rebel forces trying
to oust Kabila raged through the night and only began tapering off
in the afternoon.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi insisted the situation was
under control, but a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the city.
	   Rebel officials urged Kinshasa's residents to remain inside
their homes.
	   ``Our forces are now fighting inside the city of Kinshasa,''
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said in the eastern Congolese town of Goma.
``We are determined to fight, we are determined to win and control
the city.''
	   Mumengi described the latest fighting as a government operation
to flush out rebel fighters ``hiding like monkeys'' in the forests
around Kinshasa.
	   Kabila last week enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to help fend off the rebel force _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military. The
rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement and corruption.
	   Wednesday's fighting centered around Kinshasa's airport, near
the Kingasani and Kinbanseke districts, suburbs 20 kilometers (12
miles) to the east.
	   Throughout the day, the Voice of the People radio broadcast
scathing attacks on neighboring Rwanda and Uganda _ which Kabila
accuses of supporting the rebels with arms and soldiers.
	   Roadblocks were erected in key districts in Kinshasa. Foreign
journalists were not allowed to travel more than a few hundred
meters (yards) from their hotels.
	   The few vehicles that did go out were stopped and searched,
often at gunpoint.
	   Rwanda _ considered the main military and political sponsor for
the insurgents _ has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Zimbabwe
and Angola do not withdraw their soldiers.
	   But Angolan Interior Minister Santana Pitra said his country
would use all means at its disposal to keep Kabila in power, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. Pitra said Angola's
involvement was sparked by fears over the security of its northern
border.
	   Uganda is also believed to have sent troops and tanks to support
the insurgents, even though it denies backing the rebels.
	   A meeting scheduled between Kabila and four African peace envoys
in Kinshasa was canceled Wednesday due to the fighting, as was a
planned meeting between Congo's foreign minister and ambassadors.

With Libyan OK, council working on resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with Chinese demanding no threat of
further sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Libya's qualified acceptance of a
deal in the Pan Am bombing case, the Security Council pressed ahead
with a draft resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions once two
Libyan suspects appear for trial the Netherlands.
	   Libya's foreign ministry announced Wednesday that it had
accepted developments in the U.S.-British proposal. It had earlier
requested a delay in any council action until it studied the
proposal further.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hoped a
vote on a resolution would come Thursday. Discussions were
continuing Wednesday afternoon; China, Russia and Kenya had
amendments they wanted considered, diplomats said.
	   China wants to soften the language of the resolution, primarily
by deleting the threat of further sanctions, saying instead that
the council would ``further consider the matter'' if the suspects
are not delivered for trial promptly, according to an outline of
its discussion points.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The U.S.-British offer calls for the suspects to face a panel of
three Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands. Before
making the compromise, Britain and the United States had insisted
the trial be held on either of their territories.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. It also says that if found guilty, they would
serve their sentences in Britain.
	   The Security Council noted Libya's request for a delay in
council action on a resolution in consultations Wednesday but
proceeded with a U.S.-British-sponsored draft to back the
initiative and suspend U.N. sanctions when the suspects arrive for
trial.
	   A letter from the Libyan deputy ambassador, Ramadan A. Barg,
requesting the delay said Libya's judicial authorities needed more
time to study the U.S.-British proposal and requested international
experts ``more familiar with the laws of the states'' help explain
the complex details of the plan.
	   ``Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned,'' Barg said.
	   The letter noted that the U.S.-British proposal took several
months to achieve, that Libya had only received it Monday evening,
and that it had to be translated into Arabic.
	   The draft threatened other sanctions if Libya does not produce
the suspects in a timely manner. There is no specific time limit on
acceptance of the proposal, ``but we have said that we expect Libya
to respond quickly and without equivocation to the offer we have
put forward,'' said Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall.
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the
suspects, ban air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   The draft resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

Unofficial translation of Libyan statement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Libya-Pan Am Bombing &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The following is an unofficial translation by the Libyan mission
to the United Nations of the text of a statement by Libya's Foreign
Ministry, the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation:
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation reviewed the joint letter dated 24 August
1998 by the governments of the United States and the United
Kingdom, addressed to the secretary-general of the United Nations,
regarding the acceptance of holding a trial in a neutral third
country for the two suspects in the explosion of Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland. The General People's Committee for
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation wishes, in this
regard, to remind of the human and material losses the Libyan Arab
people have suffered unjustly due to the sanctions, imposed upon
them over the past seven years, as a result of the non-response by
the two governments to positive initiatives presented by the Great
Jamahiriya (Libya), aiming at finding a peaceful solution
satisfactory to all parties, and guaranteeing a just and fair trial
to the two suspects; initiatives welcomed and supported by the
international and regional organizations, and by friendly and
brotherly states, to whom we express our deep appreciation, for
their support for the Libyan people and for the efforts they
exerted in order to reach this solution, which guarantees justice
to the two suspects, as well as the families of the victims.
Moreover, the ruling by the International Court of Justice on 27
February 1998 has reaffirmed the Libyan position and the illegality
of the sanctions.
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation regrets the fact that many years have
passed without the United States and the United Kingdom accepting
such a solution, that enjoyed the full support of all international
organizations. It also regrets their contempt of the will of the
international community and the International Court of Justice.
	   While the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation announces its acceptance of the
development in the positions of the governments of the United
States and the United Kingdom, which we have called for, it
stresses the necessity to lift the sanctions imposed on the basis
of Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993).
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation hopes that the governments of the United
States and the United Kingdom are serious about finding a final
solution to this problem, and that they are sincere, rather than
compelled, in this regard. This shall be confirmed to the world
through the procedures if they were free of any preconditions from
the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom aimed
at obstructing the trial.
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation wishes to confirm that it will deal
positively with this step and will give it the attention it
deserves.

Inspector resigns, cites failure of US, Security Council to act on

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Incensed that the Security Council has
failed to take a tougher stand on the latest Iraqi impasse over
arms inspections, Scott Ritter, a American inspector who incurred
the wrath of Iraqis, resigned, effective immediately.
	   In a scathing letter of resignation on Wednesday, Ritter singled
out the United States for failing to fight for inspectors'
unrestricted access to suspected weapons sites. He also accused
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of allowing his office to become a
``sounding board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined.''
	   But he held out the toughest criticism for the Security Council,
whose recent decisions and inaction indicates the organization ``is
no longer willing and or capable of the implementation of its own
law,'' Ritter wrote in to the chief weapons inspector, Richard
Butler.
	   ``What is being propagated by the Security Council today in
relation to the work of the Special Commission is such an illusion,
one which in all good faith I cannot, and will not be a party to,''
he wrote.
	   Ritter, 37 and a six-year veteran of the U.N. Special
Commission, submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday and it
was accepted, said Butler.
	   ``I deeply regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the
extraordinary gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   The resignation was sure to be greeted well in Baghdad, where
Ritter had incurred the wrath of Saddam Hussein for his work in
trying to uncover Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had
called Ritter, a retired captain in the U.S. Marines, an American
spy.
	   Ritter was frequently the chief inspector on field missions in
Iraq and was an expert in concealment issues _ looking for
information and evidence that Baghdad claimed it didn't have.
	   A dispute last year between the United Nations and Iraq first
surfaced when Ritter was barred from entering a presidential
palace. Ritter had also angered Iraq with unannounced inspections.
	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions will be lifted.
	   The Security Council has only called the decision ``totally
unacceptable,'' and asked inspectors try to go about their work _ a
move privately criticized by inspctors because it failed to give
them stronger support.
	   The council's inaction ``makes a mockery of the mission the
staff of the Special Commission have been charged with
implementing,'' Ritter wrote, adding that because of the council,
the commission is ``not the organization I joined almost seven
years ago.''
	   Ritter accompanied Butler to an Aug. 3 meeting in which Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asked Butler to declare Iraq had complied
with U.N. resolutions and Butler refused, essentially ending the
talks.
	   Annan negotiated an agreement Feb. 23 to allow inspectors into
presidential palaces which Iraq had declared off-limits, citing its
sovereignty.
	   But in the most recent impasse, Annan has suggested a
``comprehensive review'' of sanctions to address Iraqi concerns _ a
move Ritter said ``would result in having the investigators
becoming the investigated, all at the behest of Iraq.''

At checkpoints, in war zones, in safe havens _ fear engulfs Kosovo

	   DRAGAS, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The groom is in his Sunday suit, the
bride in colorful tribal costume, and dozens of townsfolk have
joined them in a dance on the main square. But something's wrong
with this picture.
	   Smiles fade and pipes and drums fall silent as strangers
approach to wish good fortune. Eyes crinkled in joy narrow with
suspicion. Questions are shrugged aside.
	   There is no Serb-Albanian fighting here. But the eyes say it
all. The war has reached Dragas, ending its reputation as a town
open to strangers, a haven of sanity in the fear and bloodshed that
has enveloped the rest of Kosovo.
	   Most inhabitants in this southwestern town sandwiched between
Albania and Macedonia are Goranci, a tribe of Muslim Slavs
considered friends by Serb and Albanian alike. They walked the line
as ethnic tensions rose in the 1990s and remained out of the
conflict when it erupted into warfare in February between
authorities and Kosovo Albanians seeking independence from Serbia.
	   Both the town's mayor and police chief are Goranci _ the only
instance in Kosovo of these posts still entrusted to non-Serbs. And
many of the 16,000 Goranci in and near the town are married to
Serbs or Albanians.
	   But Mayor Skender Destari, previously ready to talk to
strangers, suddenly has no time. And the police chief is no longer
authorized to speak to the media.
	   ``Things are not quite like they used to be,'' admits town hall
employee Alia Jonze when asked what happened to Dragas' open
spirit.
	   Suspicion is the best-case scenario in wartime Kosovo.
	   Trying to negotiate passage with submachine gun-toting Serb
police manning checkpoints is routine. At times the police refuse
to let journalists through, forcing them onto back roads they hope
will lead them closer to the front line.
	   Often, the journey leads to nowhere. But a recent jaunt in an
armored car through cornfields and past deserted houses resulted in
paydirt _ a hilltop view of an ethnic Albanian village being
shelled just 300 yards (meters) away by Yugoslav army tanks teamed
with Serb police trying to eradicate Kosovo separatists.
	   The adrenaline was already high after the torturously slow drive
through open spaces, secure in the knowledge of being watched. But
it hit the boiling point shortly after arrival at the vantage
point, when the journalists heard short, breathless whistles _ the
method commonly used by spotters to direct sniper fire onto a
target.
	   The intruding reporters left. Quickly.
	   Passing Serb checkpoints is rarely a pleasant experience. The
police are heavily armed, often antsy after being sniped at, and
generally suspect foreign reporters of having a pro-Albanian bias.
	   One stop at such a checkpoint started off nasty, with one
policeman leveling his submachine gun at a car full of reporters,
while his colleague trotted off to their sandbagged stronghold to
check on their identities.
	   But a few pleasantries in flawed Serb from one of the
journalists paid off. One of the cops handed out beers and coffee.
Another philosophized about this Balkan war and its Bosnian
predecessor.
	   ``Sarajevo was a dream city, we were all brothers, whether Serb,
Muslim or Croat,'' he reminisced. ``Then came the senseless war.
	   ``But at least it was a real war where you knew who the enemy
was,'' he said, pausing to point at cars with Albanians inside
passing after identity checks. ``Here they drive past you in the
day, and shoot at you at night.''
	   Friendliness also pays off with the other side, the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas fighting Serbian and Yugoslav forces.
	   A KLA commander in southwestern Kosovo recently agreed to talk
to a reporter but remained suspicious, offering little more than
two-syllable answers.
	   Familiarity bred openness, however. Asked about children, the
commander, Agim Kuci, said he had two boys, 13 and 11. A reporter
produced pictures of his own children, girls, aged 11 and 8, and
Kuci flashed a broad smile.
	   ``We must become friends,'' he said. ``Maybe later on we can
pair up our kids into husbands and wives.''

Tokyo stock prices fall, dollar slips in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell sharply in early trading
Thursday, hurt by declines overnight on Wall Street and continued
economic turmoil in Russia. The U.S. dollar slipped against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 416.93 points, or 2.8
percent, to 14,449.10 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Wednesday, the average dropped 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 143.82
yen, down 0.85 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late
New York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average posted yet another loss
Wednesday, falling 79.30 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,523.35. The
Dow is about 800 points below the record 9,337.97 set on July 17.
	   World stock markets have been shaken by events in Russia, where
the government has failed to shore up confidence in the nation's
shaky banking system.
	   Those concerns have sent the ruble lower, and there are signs
things could worsen. On Wednesday, Russia's central bank canceled
already agreed dollar sales, and the government failed to make
payments on longer-term debt previously unaffected by the crisis.
	   In Japan, investor sentiment has also darkened as key banking
bills stalled in Parliament because of political wrangling.
	   Parliament began debate Tuesday on a series of bills aimed at
speeding up the write-off of bad loans, which have dogged the
nation's banks since the collapse of the land market in the early
1990s.
	   But progress halted Wednesday when opposition parties boycotted
a key parliamentary committee meeting after a tiff over procedures.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 28.37 points, or 2.47 percent, at 1,118.84.
The TOPIX closed down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.125 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.115
percent, driving its price down to 112.25 yen from 112.32 yen.

Argentina seeks new extradition treaty with South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina will try to negotiate a
new treaty with South Africa to obtain the extradition of an arms
dealer sought in connection with illegal weapons sales, a senior
Argentine Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday.
	   A South African judge on Tuesday rejected Argentina's request
for the extradition of arms dealer Diego Palleros, sought in
connection with the sale of weapons to Croatia and Ecuador in 1991
and 1995.
	   ``We will try to obtain from South Africa a treaty according to
the needs of (Argentine) justice,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister
Andres Cisneros after meeting with South African Embassy official
Louis Pienaar Cisneros.
	   Palleros, a former army lieutenant colonel who settled in
Johannesburg in 1997, was arrested last month by request of Federal
Judge Jorge Urso, who investigates the sale of 75 tons of weapons
and munitions to Ecuador.
	   He was set free Tuesday after the South African judge ruled
there were no grounds for extradition, Argentine press reports
said.
	   Urso also is investigating allegations that Argentina in 1992
sold 6,500 tons of weapons to Croatia, violating a U.N. embargo.
	   The Argentine government has denied knowledge of arms sales to
either country, saying they were sold to Panamanian and Venezuelan
weapons dealers who then diverted them.
	   Argentina is one of the guarantors of a peace agreement between
Ecuador and Peru.

Unofficial translation of Libyan statement

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Unofficial translation by the Libyan mission to the United
Nations of the text of a statement by Libya's Foreign Ministry, the
General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International
Cooperation:
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation reviewed the joint letter dated 24 August
1998 by the governments of the United States and the United
Kingdom, addressed to the secretary-general of the United Nations,
regarding the acceptance of holding a trial in a neutral third
country for the two suspects in the explosion of Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation wishes, in this regard, to remind of the
human and material losses the Libyan Arab people have suffered
unjustly due to the sanctions, imposed upon them over the past
seven years, as a result of the non-response by the two governments
to positive initiatives presented by the Great Jamahiriya (Libya),
aiming at finding a peaceful solution satisfactory to all parties,
and guaranteeing a just and fair trial to the two suspects;
initiatives welcomed and supported by the international and
regional organizations, and by friendly and brotherly states, to
whom we express our deep appreciation, for their support for the
Libyan people and for the efforts they exerted in order to reach
this solution, which guarantees justice to the two suspects, as
well as the families of the victims.
	   Moreover, the ruling by the International Court of Justice on 27
February 1998 has reaffirmed the Libyan position and the illegality
of the sanctions.
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation regrets the fact that many years have
passed without the United States and the United Kingdom accepting
such a solution, that enjoyed the full support of all international
organizations. It also regrets their contempt of the will of the
international community and the International Court of Justice.
	   While the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation announces its acceptance of the
development in the positions of the governments of the United
States and the United Kingdom, which we have called for, it
stresses the necessity to lift the sanctions imposed on the basis
of Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993).
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation hopes that the governments of the United
States and the United Kingdom are serious about finding a final
solution to this problem, and that they are sincere, rather than
compelled, in this regard. This shall be confirmed to the world
through the procedures if they were free of any preconditions from
the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom aimed
at obstructing the trial.
	   The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation wishes to confirm that it will deal
positively with this step and will give it the attention it
deserves.

Habibie survives Indonesia's crisis to reach 100 days in office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ When B.J. Habibie became president of
Indonesia in May, few thought he had the strength or savvy to last
long.
	   Although Indonesia has yet to come to grips with an economic
crisis and rolling political turmoil, his position seems to have at
least stabilized as he approaches 100 days in office on Friday.
	   He has tried hard to shed once close links to the discredited
regime of former President Suharto and to cultivate the image of a
democratic reformer dedicated to human rights and honest financial
management.
	   Some observers say he's achieved more than most had thought
possible.
	   ``So far so good,'' said William Liddle, an Indonesian expert
from Ohio State University.
	   Others continue to doubt Habibie's ability to guide the world's
fourth most populous nation through deep economic problems and
dangerous political times.
	   In a scathing editorial recently, the Jakarta Post described him
as ``an erratic leader'' whose deeds don't match his words.
	   Habibie was forced to move quickly when he took the oath of
office on May 21 after serving as Suharto's vice president.
	   Troops and tanks were on the streets of riot-torn Jakarta.
Foreigners and frightened members of the ethnic Chinese minority,
blamed for the economic crisis and the target of much of the
violence, packed the airport to evacuate.
	   The deadly street violence had killed 1,200 people and had just
pushed his powerful predecessor out of office, ending a 32-year
reign.
	   The economy, hardest-hit by Asia's financial meltdown, was in
tatters and seemed set to worsen, leading to fears of more
violence.
	   Protesting students, who cheered when they heard that Suharto
had quit, immediately called for Habibie to be put on trial, even
hanged.
	   As a buddy of Suharto for 40 years and a Cabinet minister for 20
years, Habibie was widely denounced as a frontman for the old
autocrat, himself the target of accusations over corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   ``Habibie still hasn't released himself from shadows of his
predecessor Suharto,'' said Amein Rais, the leader of a 28-million
member Islamic group who is shaping up as a serious political rival
to Habibie.
	   Nevertheless, determined to make his own mark on the presidency,
Habibie has wound back some of Suharto's repression and has cut off
many of lucrative deals that had enriched the ex-leader's family
and cronies for decades.
	   ``I am not a puppet (of Suharto),'' Habibie protested in a
recent interview.
	   He has even launched an inquiry into Suharto-era corruption and
has pledged not to stand in the way of the prosecutors if they find
any wrongdoing.
	   Habibie has also announced a sweeping program of democratic
reform.
	   The once-muzzled press is now free to report and comment.
	   Demonstrations, brutally suppressed by the military before, have
become routine affairs.
	   He has released more than 100 political prisoners put behind
bars by Suharto's regime and has promised to set free more.
	   He has made an unprecedented apology for human rights atrocities
carried out under Suharto.
	   He has reopened talks in the United Nations to bring peace to
East Timor, which has endured a guerrilla war ever since Suharto
ordered Indonesian troops to invade the ex-Portuguese colony in
1975.
	   Unlike Suharto, a retired army general, Habibie, a
German-educated engineer, has no ties with the powerful military.
Still senior generals have consistently pledged their loyalty as
they themselves set about reforming their own ranks.
	   In the wake of May political change, the armed forces have faced
a barrage of allegations of past crimes and is currently the
subject of major inquires over the shooting and abduction of
anti-Suharto activists. On Monday, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a
son-in-law of Suharto, was fired amid suspicion he ordered the
kidnappings of political activists.
	   Habibie most ambitious reforms, however, are in the political
arena.
	   Stability-obsessed Suharto used to allow only three closely
monitored parties to operate in a tightly controlled political
system.
	   More than 50 new parties have been established since Habibie
lifted the ban on the formation of new political organizations.
	   Parliamentary elections are to be held in May 1999 and will be
followed by the selection of a president a few months later by the
nation's top legislative body, the People's Consulative Assembly.
	   Confident of his popularity, Habibie says he'll stand if the
people want him.
	   In a state of the nation address to Parliament on Aug. 15
Habibie outlined a vision for ``a just and open democratic
society'' without the scourge of corruption.
	   But some remain unconvinced that much has fundamentally changed.
	   As a trusted Suharto aide for two decades, Habibie, himself has
been accused nepotism and other misdeeds.
	   Critics groaned earlier this month when he awarded medals of
honor to family members and close aides, including bestowing the
nation's highest civilian award to his wife.
	   Earlier, after showing compassion for poor people unable to cope
with soaring food prices, Habibie publicly suggested that
Indonesia's 202 million people fast every Monday and Thursday to
ease the need for rice imports.
	   Financial markets have been slow to warm to Habibie as the
economy lurches through its worst crisis in decades.
	   The rupiah, although marginally recovered, remains weak and
vulnerable. Foreign investment has dried up.
	   Habibie maintains that confidence must return before economic
recovery can begin. But he, himself, might be part of the problem.
	   Some analysts still remember Habibie in his role of Suharto's
technology and research minister who was often criticized for
sponsoring high-tech projects that the cash-strapped nation can now
ill afford.
	   They find it hard to trust Habibie, even though he has
enthusiastically pursued tough economic reforms required under a
multibillion-dollar International Monetary Fund rescue package.

	   In a state of the nation address to Parliament on Aug. 15
Habibie outlined a vision for ``a just and open democratic
society'' without the scourge of corruption.
	   But some remain unconvinced that much has fundamentally changed.
	   As a trusted Suharto aide for two decades, Habibie, himself has
been accused nepotism and other misdeeds.
	   Critics groaned earlier this month when he awarded medals of
honor to family members and close aides, including bestowing the
nation's highest civilian award to his wife.
	   Earlier, after showing compassion for poor people unable to cope
with soaring food prices, Habibie publicly suggested that
Indonesia's 202 million people fast every Monday and Thursday to
ease the need for rice imports.
	   Financial markets have been slow to warm to Habibie as the
economy lurches through its worst crisis in decades.
	   The rupiah, although marginally recovered, remains weak and
vulnerable. Foreign investment has dried up.
	   Habibie maintains that confidence must return before economic
recovery can begin. But he, himself, might be part of the problem.
	   Some analysts still remember Habibie in his role of Suharto's
technology and research minister who was often criticized for
sponsoring high-tech projects that the cash-strapped nation can now
ill afford.
	   They find it hard to trust Habibie, even though he has
enthusiastically pursued tough economic reforms required under a
multibillion-dollar International Monetary Fund rescue package.

Film reveals human side of elephant life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Elephants never forget, or so the
saying goes, but a good memory is not the only trait these enormous
creatures may share with humans.
	   Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who pioneered the first in-depth study of
elephant behavior in the mid-1960s, believes they also empathize
with each other, or in other words, interact emotionally in a
similar way to people.
	   Unique footage illustrating his beliefs is shown in a new
large-format film called ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom,'' made by
American company Discovery Communications Inc., which had its
African premier in Cape Town this month.
	   In one shot a family of elephants come across an unrelated
mother elephant desperately trying to raise her prone and dying
calf to its feet in a futile effort to save its life.
	   Slowly the herd approaches the frantic mother, reaching out to
her with their trunks, caressing and touching her face and body. It
is eerily reminiscent of the human gesture of putting an arm around
someone's shoulder.
	   ``It looks like they have a sense of feeling,'' Douglas-Hamilton
said in an interview. ``They have memory and an ability to
empathize, to know how their actions are affecting the feelings of
another elephant.''
	   Scottish-born Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants,
acted as scientific consultant for the project, shot over six
months last year in several Kenyan national parks.
	   He helped guide the film crew to their targets, eventually
focusing on a small family grouping, or clan, that became the
centerpiece of the film.
	   Following the clan, headed by a matriarchal female dubbed Torn
Ear, the movie aims to illustrate all aspects of elephant life from
birth to death and uncover some of the mysteries surrounding
elephants.
	   Since ancient times elephants have fascinated mankind, giving
rise to such legends as a fabled ``Elephants' Graveyard,'' hidden
in the heart of Africa where all elephants go to die.
	   But modern science has revealed kernels of truth in the myths.
Elephants do seem to have a powerful sense of death and often seek
to bury their dead kin in leaves and scrub.
	   During filming, the camera captured Torn Ear's family stumbling
across the bleached white bones of a bull elephant lying in the
dirt.
	   With trunks extended, the elephants explored the bones, sniffing
the hollow skull and tusks and picking up pieces of the skeleton.
	   Douglas-Hamilton believes the key to understanding this behavior
lies in elephants' immensely powerful sense of smell, controlled by
huge olfactory lobes in the brain where scents are detected and
analyzed.
	   ``It was an intense olfactory and tactile experience,'' he said
``I think they were interested in maybe who it was.''
	   However, workers on the project also had first hand experience
of the less gentle side of elephants.
	   Coming too close to a herd, the film crew triggered a charge by
the group's matriarch. With a camera mounted on the back of their
jeep, the enormous elephant was filmed chasing the vehicle down a
dirt track, eventually catching up with it and thrusting its tusks
just feet (several meters) away from the terrified passengers.
	   Producer and director Michael Caulfield said the moment was
scary, but produced amazing pictures.
	   ``Her tusks came on either side of the camera,'' he said ``The
crew is turning around, faces all contorted, screaming ``Go! Go!
Go!'' Finally we sped up again and as a last parting gesture she
raised her trunk and spat straight into the lens.''
	   Elephants' wariness in the face of man stems from the heavy
poaching of the 1970s and 1980s that wiped out many of Africa's
herds. From an estimated population of 1.3 million in 1979,
Africa's elephants now number about 380,000.
	   Though poaching has decreased in the face of a world-wide ivory
ban, a limited trade in ivory has recently restarted from African
countries with healthy elephant populations, such as Zimbabwe.
	   Douglas-Hamilton believes such a move is dangerous because
making any ivory legal lends it respectability as a consumer
product and encourages poaching.
	   With the human-like behavior shown in Discovery's film,
Douglas-Hamilton hopes to raise public awareness of elephantine
intelligence and so encourage their conservation, like other
animals people have imbued with such characteristics.
	   ``It is really no more acceptable to shoot an elephant for
pleasure or ivory than to shoot a dolphin or an ape,'' he said.

Inflatable Mars ship may double as space station crew quarters

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Astronauts aboard NASA's future
space station may find themselves eating, sleeping, exercising and
unwinding inside a balloon, rather than a can.
	   Space station managers expect to decide by the end of September
whether to replace the aluminum cylinder that's known as the
habitation module with a larger yet lighter inflatable chamber
designed for Mars trips.
	   It's called Transhab, short for transit habitat.
	   This huge pop-proof balloon, folded for launch and filled with
air in space, is envisioned by NASA as Home Sweet Home for
astronauts journeying to and from Mars. Similar balloons sent in
advance would house the crews once they land.
	   NASA figures if Transhab is feasible for Mars or possibly an
asteroid, then why not for the international space station, due to
begin soaring by year's end? And what better way to further
interplanetary travel than to tack on a Mars ship to the orbiting
laboratory, giving both programs a plug?
	   ``Anything that we can do that excites people and makes it more
real to them, the better the chances overall'' of sending
astronauts beyond Earth orbit, says Doug Cooke, head of the
explorations office at Johnson Space Center.
	   With sufficient funding, NASA could launch a Mars expedition as
early as 2012, Cooke says. The agency would be a step closer to
that goal, he notes, by testing Transhab on the international space
station.
	   If Transhab is approved for the mostly metal space station being
built by Boeing, construction likely would begin at Johnson in
2001. A space shuttle would carry Transhab up in early 2004, making
it the last piece of the station to fly.
	   It would cost about the same as the original, still-incomplete
habitation module _ less than dlrs 200 million _ but provide three
times more room, according to Transhab deputy project manager
Horacio de la Fuente.
	   Astronauts have helped de la Fuente develop a rudimentary
three-level mockup, which is on display at Johnson, and a winning
floor plan.
	   Among the frills: Cathedral ceilings. Picture windows. Penthouse
gym. Kitchenette with a table that can seat 12. Six bedrooms
equipped with desks and personal computers and surrounded by a
2-inch-thick (5-centimeter-thick) wall of water to shield against
noise and surges in radiation. And, of course, storage galore.
	   Never mind that all this luxury would be in a balloon that would
be in an Earth orbit littered with dangerous space junk.
	   The 1-foot-thick (30-centimeter-thick) shell would be
``bulletproof'' in space, de la Fuente says. The 17 or so layers
would be made of ceramic fabric, polyurethane foam, polymer film
and Kevlar, a tough material used in police vests, and be better
than metal.
	   ``This is very different from a child's balloon,'' de la Fuente
explains as he shows off samples of padding. He says it would be
closer to a soccer ball.
	   Like a soccer ball, the 40-foot-long (12-meter),
27-foot-diameter (8.2-meter-diameter) Transhab would have a bladder
system that holds in the air. The shell encompassing Transhab would
have three bladders, in fact, for redundancy.
	   Outside these thin-film bladders would be Kevlar webbing and
then sheets of ceramic fabric, each separated by 3 inches (7.6
centimeters) of foam. It's this ceramic, called Nextel, that would
protect against micrometeoroids and other orbital clutter zooming
by at tens of thousands mph (kph).
	   In ground tests, aluminum marble-sized balls fired into the
Transhab padding at orbital speed were pulverized by the outer
ceramic layers before reaching the air-containing bladders.
	   Even skeptics were impressed.
	   ``Once they see our micrometeoroid and orbital debris shots ...
they begin to realize, `Hey, this isn't a bad thing at all,' '' de
la Fuente says.
	   ``You also have to remember that the aluminum (space station)
module is a balloon, too. Any pressure vessel is truly a balloon.
Just because it's made out of aluminum you still get the same
pressure stresses.''
	   Indeed, when identical balls were shot at 1 1-2 -inch-thick (3.8
centimeter-thick) in aluminum plates, 3-inch-wide
(7.6-centimeter-wide) craters emerged and the shock waves ripped
chunks of metal off the back of the plates.
	   If fired at the reinforced aluminum plates intended for the bulk
of the international space station, the balls would penetrate the
skin, de la Fuente says.
	   Even in a nightmare case like last summer's near-catastrophic
collision between a Russian cargo ship and Mir, astronauts and
cosmonauts would be ``much safer'' in Transhab because of all the
protective padding, de la Fuente says.
	   ``I would feel much safer if I was in there,'' he says.
	   Unfortunately, NASA cannot use the ultrathick Transhab padding
on the conventional aluminum modules that will make up the rest of
the international space station, de la Fuente says. The cylinders
barely fit into the shuttle cargo bay; another foot (30
centimeters) of insulation on either side would make them too wide.
	   That's the beauty of Transhab, de la Fuente says.
	   It's relatively lightweight _ only about 26,000 pounds (11,793
kilograms) _ and can be folded for launch. So more of it can soar.
	   Astronauts would have three levels instead of one in which to
spend their off-duty time, providing a homier touch as well as
additional privacy. What's more, an opening between the first and
second floors would create the sense of open space.
	   All that's missing is a color scheme.
	   Astronaut Andrew Thomas, who returned from a 4 1-2 -month Mir
tour in June, would choose blue.
	   ``The colors inside Mir tended to be browns and grays,'' Thomas
says. ``You need to have bright, uplifting colors rather than these
dull shades.''

Prince Charles' popularity soars since Diana's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The popularity of Prince Charles has soared in the
year since Princess Diana has died, according to a new opinion poll
published Thursday.
	   The poll, conducted for The Times newspaper last weekend as the
Aug. 31 anniversary of Diana's death in a Paris car crash draws
near, indicated the public approves of the way the monarchy has
handled itself over the past year and the changed image Charles has
displayed, particularly in relation to his sons, The Times said.
	   Earlier opinion polls showed that before Diana's death, Prince
Charles had a negative approval rating, with 46 percent
dissatisfied with the way he was doing his job and 42 percent
satisfied. His ratings started to improve last autumn when he
appeared more in public in the role of father to his motherless
sons.
	   By Christmas, he had a 2-to-1 favorable rating, with 61 percent
of the public approving and 29 percent disapproving. This has now
been boosted further with the latest result of 63 percent approving
and 24 percent disapproving, The Times said.
	   That put Charles almost on the same level as Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who had a 65 percent approval rating in the same poll.
Blair's approval rating is better than Margaret Thatcher achieved
at any stage of her 12-year premiership, The Times said.
	   But the prince, who has been trying to improve his public image
in the wake of Diana's death, still lags behind his mother, Queen
Elizabeth II, who enjoys a 73 percent approval rating, according to
the poll of 994 people, conducted by the research group MORI.
	   The survey also indicated that public anger over the way Diana
was treated by the royal family has not eroded support for the
monarchy as an institution.
	   Overall, only 15 percent believed Britain would be better off
without a monarchy _ while 53 percent said losing the royals would
damage the country. Another 29 percent said it would make no
difference.
	   This was an improvement over a previous poll conducted
immediately after Diana's death, when 18 percent said Britain would
be better off without the royals and 48 percent said the country
would be worse off, The Times said.
	   However, respondents said they were much less impressed with
media coverage of the royal family, with 62 percent saying there
had been too much in the past year.
	   Asked specifically about Diana and the events surrounding her
death, the figure calling for less exposure rose to 83 percent.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States and Britain were reacting
cautiously to a statement by Libya that appears to accept a
compromise in the Pan Am bombing case that would allow two suspects
to be tried in the Netherlands.
	   Two Libyan suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the plane,
which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing
270 people.
	   	   Under a U.S.-British compromise, the two men would be tried in
the Netherlands under Scottish law and by a panel of three Scottish
judges. The suspects cannot be extradited from the Netherlands. If
found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the United
Kingdom.
	   On Wednesday, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said it ``announces
its acceptance of the development in the positions of the
governments of the United Kingdom and the United States'' and urged
that U.N. sanctions against Libya be lifted.
	   A U.S. official traveling with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Edgarton, Massachusetts, said: ``If this means that the Libyans are
willing to turn over the two suspects to Dutch authorities, we
would consider this a positive development.
	   ``If the Libyan statement signifies an attempt to negotiate the
terms of the trial, we would remind the Libyan government that the
terms are nonnegotiable,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He called on Libya to turn the men over to
Dutch authorities.
	   Libya made no specific reference to the handing over of the two
suspects. In its statement, Libya urged the United States and
Britain not to impose ... conditions which might block the trial.''
	   Britain also reacted cautiously to Wednesday's announcement,
which was carried by the official Libyan news agency, JANA.
	   ``I welcome this statement, which looks like a positive
development,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``We shall need
to study exactly what the Libyans have said.''
	   The U.S.-British compromise, a decade in the making, comes after
Britain and the United States had long insisted the trial be held
in one of their territories. For its part, Libya previously
suggested that the men could be put on trial if they were willing
to go themselves; they did not accept the idea.
	   Both the Libyans and the Western nations involved would see a
trial in the Netherlands as a victory. Libya has demanded a trial
on ``neutral'' ground, and has sought an end sanctions imposed in
1992, which the agreement is expected to bring.
	   The Security Council met for a second day Wednesday to consider
a draft resolution sponsored by the United States and Britain to
suspend the sanctions upon the suspects' arrival in the Netherlands
for trial.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hoped a
vote on the resolution would come Thursday.
	   The sanctions, imposed to push Libya to surrender the men, ban
air travel to and from the country, bar arms sales, freeze some
assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.

Ominous rise in virus levels haunt many who benefit from AIDS

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The first time Dr. Joel Gallant laid eyes on
Michael Willis, he was struck by how truly awful his new patient
looked. ``A skinny little emaciated creature'' is what the doctor
remembers.
	   Willis was in the full grip of AIDS, covered with eczema,
partially paralyzed by a herpes infection of the spine, 140 pounds
(63.5 kilograms) and falling. Death within a year seemed almost
certain.
	   That was 2 1-2 years ago. Now Willis, at 37, exudes energy. He
is toned and trim and handsome enough to model two or three times a
week at the Maryland Institute College of Art.
	   As stunning as Willis' turnaround seems, it is hardly unique. He
is one of the thousands of Americans rescued from the edge of death
by the AIDS cocktail, the combination of pills that changed a
uniformly lethal disease into a treatable one.
	   However, Willis' story is commonplace for another reason as
well. Despite his look of health, he clearly has not escaped HIV.
In the brutally precise language of medicine, Willis is a treatment
failure.
	   Estimates vary, but perhaps 30 percent to 60 percent of all
people taking the AIDS cocktails are considered treatment failures,
because HIV can still be found on standard tests that are sensitive
enough to spot as few as 20 copies of the virus in a milliliter of
blood. Either their viral levels never got that low or they
rebounded after a promising start.
	   When Willis first learned of his disease, 600,000 bits of virus
circulated in every milliliter of his blood. At the time, he had
been sick for a year, often so exhausted he could not get out of
bed. He felt oddly relieved to learn the cause, even though it
turned out to be HIV.
	   While he steadily got better on a combination of the protease
inhibitor Crixivan and two other drugs, the lowest his virus level
ever fell is around 1,000 _ far from the zero that defines success.
	   Most of his friends with HIV have seen their virus vanish. The
failure of treatment to do the same for him is obviously
disappointing.
	   ``Sometimes I cry about it,'' he admits. But mostly he focuses
on his good fortune. He enjoys the pleasure of playing and singing
with his rock band, the Radiant Pig, enjoys feeling well, enjoys
being alive.
	   ``I just try to ignore it,'' says Willis. ``I wish somebody
would tell me what is going to happen, but I don't want to ask,
either.''
	   But even if he asks, there are no clear answers.
	   No one knows for sure what will happen to those whose virus
stays stubbornly visible despite all-out treatment. From the start
of the epidemic, the amount of virus has been the surest barometer
of the disease's course. The higher the level, the faster it kills.
Experts believe that if there's enough HIV to measure, it's
probably continuing to damage the immune system, even if more
slowly than before.
	   ``Right now, we are seeing people like Michael who are having
less than satisfactory virological responses. Yet clinically he is
doing wonderfully and is as healthy as he has been in years,'' says
Gallant, an AIDS expert at Johns Hopkins University. ``We don't
know how long that will last. But our assessment is that without
complete viral suppression, it won't last forever.''
	   The doctors wonder: Will these people start to go downhill in
two years? Five? Ten or even longer? They worry that the dramatic
decline in AIDS deaths of the past two years is a honeymoon, a lull
before the epidemic reawakens.
	   ``We are winning many more battles than we won before, but we
still haven't won the war,'' says Dr. Michael Saag of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.
	   His program averaged 10 to 15 deaths a month among its 700 AIDS
patients in 1995. Then came the cocktail. In 1996 and 1997, there
were just one to three deaths a month. But this year, the figures
are creeping up again, averaging five to eight deaths a month.
	   For now, though, many like Willis continue to thrive despite
stable or even rising viral levels.
	   ``You still see wonderful, wonderful things happening with this
therapy,'' says Dr. Lori Fantry of the University of Maryland.
``People come into the clinic and they think you're God. Their
symptoms melt away before your eyes. The people aren't failing yet.
It's the numbers.''
	   The numbers.
	   Scientists estimate that for every unit of virus in a milliliter
of blood, somewhere in the body between 100,000 and 150,000
infected cells are making HIV. A viral load of 1,000, like Willis',
suggests between 100 million and 150 million virus-making cells.
	   Over time, these viruses may elude AIDS drugs by doing a sloppy
job of reproducing themselves. No unit of HIV is exactly like its
parent. With each copy it makes, HIV introduces an average of one
error into its genetic code. Chances are, everyone with HIV carries
a virus with a random mutation that makes it capable of resisting
whatever drug comes along.
	   When patients start treatment, doctors give them three drugs _
typically a protease inhibitor and two older medicines _ that they
have never taken before. The idea is to hit the virus hard,
knocking its production so low that lurking resistant versions
never have a chance to be made in quantity.
	   When treatment pushes the virus below detectable levels and
keeps it there, doctors feel fairly certain that patients will stay
healthy for several years. If treatment fails, it's because swarms
of drug-resistant viruses have been produced.

	   Doctors list three main reasons for treatment failure: Patients
neglect to take their medicines on schedule; they already have lots
of resistant virus because of earlier exposure to medicines, or
their doctors treated them inadequately.
	   Failure to take medicines consistently is probably No. 1.
Missing just a few doses allows resistant viruses to grow
explosively. Once that happens, there is no guarantee that
switching drugs will do any good, since the virus may be immune to
them, too.
	   However, staying on treatment isn't easy. It often means taking
15 or 20 pills a day on a precise schedule. Some must go down on an
empty stomach, some on a full one. They must be taken at just the
right time around the clock.
	   Many trigger nasty side effects, such as diarrhea, headaches,
insomnia, stomach pains, numbness in the fingers and toes and an
odd-looking rearrangement of body fat that leaves people with
potbellies and wasted arms.
	   As the medicines do their job, HIV symptoms disappear. In time,
people feel perfectly well except for the side effects of their
pills. This makes sticking with them even harder.
	   ``It was never so easy to be adherent as when I was on the brink
of serious illness,'' says Sean O'Brien Strub, 40, of New York
City. ``I couldn't wait for my next dose. As I felt better longer,
the treatment became more of an intrusion, and the side effects
were more bothersome.''
	   Strub, who is publisher of Poz, a magazine for HIV-infected
people, went on a trip in June and forgot his pills. So he decided
to stop taking them for a couple of weeks, just to see what would
happen. Within 10 days, he felt sick again. A blood test showed his
virus level, which had been undetectable, spiked to over a million.
	   Back on therapy, it's now down to 30,000. ``I definitely made a
mistake,'' he admits.
	   Some people are resistant to individual components of the AIDS
cocktail, often because they took them as single drugs before the
cocktail was created. Many are long-infected treatment pioneers,
eager to try each new drug that comes along.
	   For instance, Nick Houpis, 43, of Boston, has taken 10 of the 11
approved AIDS medicines. The lowest his viral load ever dropped was
37,000. Now it's 440,000, and this summer he had his first bout
with an AIDS-related illness.
	   ``There are an awful lot of us who are just a little bit too
late,'' he says. ``I don't think they will come up with something
that will make miracle stories out of us.''
	   Some appear to suffer because of physician incompetence, too.
For instance, doctors may err by adding a protease inhibitor to two
other medicines their patients are already taking, instead of
starting them on three fresh drugs. This greatly increases the risk
of rampant resistance. AIDS care has become so complicated, many
believe, that it now should be done only by specialists who know
how to avoid such potentially fatal mistakes.
	   Once someone fails AIDS treatment, the next step is what doctors
call salvage therapy _ the art of crafting a second attempt to
knock down the virus. They may prescribe five or six drugs at once.
	   ``You end up with a kitchen sink approach,'' says Dr. Kenneth
Mayer of Brown University. ``You try to pull together every
possible combination to keep the virus in check.''
	   Willis is an extreme example of this. Gallant has him on seven
anti-AIDS drugs, plus an assortment of others to ward off
AIDS-related infections.
	   Once a week, Willis hauls out an orange crate of big white pill
bottles and counts out his week's dosage: Norvir, sequinavir, 3TC,
hydroxyurea, ddI, abacavir, adefivir, Sustiva, Bactrim, acyclovir
and Zithromax, plus a shot of testosterone.
	   He starts each day with two packets of ddI dissolved in a glass
of water. Then he takes a fistful of pills with breakfast, another
handful with dinner, and a couple more at bedtime, 35 in all.
	   ``I've just made it part of my life,'' Willis says. ``I don't
really have any options. If I'm dead, I know that my options are
limited.''

Venezualan Indians injured by National Guard at protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The National Guard sprayed tear gas
and shot rubber bullets Wednesday at a group of Indians protesting
the construction of a high-voltage electricity line in the Amazon
jungle.
	   The Indians said three of their members were hospitalized with
injuries, a version denied by the National Guard.
	   About 350 members of the Pemon tribe in southern Bolivar state
occupied the site where crews planned to begin erecting an
electricity tower Wednesday. Within hours, national guardsmen
arrived and ``attacked the community,'' said Jose Luis Gonzalez,
head of the state's Indigenous Federation.
	   Gonzalez said the three victims included 13-year-old Orangel
Pulido, who he said suffered eye damage when a tear-gas bomb
exploded in his face.
	   Gen. Pedro Zambrano, state leader of the National Guard, told
The Associated Press that ``we cannot speak of injuries.''
	   But he did confirm ``there were some shots of rubber bullets and
tear gas bombs were used.''
	   For the past month, the Pemon tribe has been trying to block the
300-mile (480-kilometer) power line's construction, saying it will
damage the environment by supplying electricity to gold mining
companies that want to set up operations in the Imataca rain
forest.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A lawyer defending imprisoned leftists
and other dissidents has been arrested, accused of involvement in
illegal squatting at a tourist development in this Pacific resort.
	   A state police news release late Tuesday said the lawyer, Jose
Sanchez Sanchez, was taken into custody on a warrant issued by the
6th Criminal Court in Acapulco.
	   Jose Reyes Camero, a colleague, claimed Sanchez was arrested in
retaliation for accusing Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero
of being involved in the July 9 assassination of a
peasant-organization leader in the town of Coyuca de Benitez.
	   Reyes said the governor personally warned Sanchez, who was a
lawyer for the organization, he would be arrested if he persisted
in the accusation.
	   Sanchez also represented the widows of 17 peasants massacred in
Guerrero by state troopers in 1995, 13 arrested members of the
People's Revolutionary Army and two more from the Insurgent
People's Revolutionary Army, a splinter group. Both are leftist
guerrilla organizations.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Petroleos Mexicanos said Wednesday that a
fire in the feeding pipes of its Lazaro Cardenas refinery caused
little damage and didn't affect operations.
	   Pemex, as the state-owned oil monopoly is known, said the fire
Tuesday night forced it to shut down an electricity generating
station that serves the plant. The pipes that caught fire feed
liquid petroleum gas to the plant.
	   The fire caused little damage, although a precise figure was
unavailable, said Pemex spokesman Arturo Martinez.
	   No injuries were reported, and the fire occurred outside the
plant's refinery area, he said.
	   The plant, in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, is one of
Pemex's largest, producing an average of 198,400 barrels of crude a
day in 1996.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Argentina's Chamber of Deputies
failed to reach quorum Wednesday, as opposition lawmakers boycotted
the government's attempt to vote on key labor reform legislation.
	   It was the third failure by the lower house in as many weeks to
gather the minimum 129 members needed to take up the labor reform
bill.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of truckers and other dissident factions of
organized labor protested against the legislation outside the
Congress.
	   The bill is intended to revamp Argentina's rigid labor laws,
allowing companies to negotiate labor agreements with their own
workers instead of submitting to industry wide negotiations.
	   It would also change longstanding hiring and firing practices as
a means to curb the country's jobless rate, now at 13 percent.
	   The opposition boycott raised the possibility that President
Carlos Menem may put the controversial legislation in place via
executive decree.

	   GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) _ Without a peep, Fanny Mejia let a
fellow inmate in Guayaquil's prison sew her lips shut with a needle
and thread Wednesday in a bizarre protest of Ecuador's judicial
system.
	   A few dots of blood emerged from her unanaesthetized lips, which
had been splashed with disinfectant. The black thread looped her
lips three times. Television cameras filmed the event. No doctors
were present.
	   Mejia, a 51-year-old Colombian woman arrested for drug
trafficking, became the 16th prisoner _ 10 men and six women _ to
sew her lips shut in the last two weeks to protest the slow pace
and unfairness of justice in Ecuador.
	   Another 50 prisoners are on a hunger strike in prisons in Quito
and Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest cities.
	   The prisoners claim they have spent more than a year in prison
without being brought to trial, and under Ecuadorean law they
should be freed.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A landslide destroyed twelve homes, killed
17 people and left two injured Wednesday in the western Guatemala
province of Quiche, volunteer firefighters reported.
	   The landslide occurred in settlement known as ``La Quebrada,''
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Guatemala City. It was
caused by heavy rains in the region, said Jose Perez, a spokesman
for a national disaster agency.
	   Officials reported that the landslide blocked a road leading to
the settlement, forcing rescue workers to reach the hamlet on foot.

Brain adapts to `new ears' for locating sound, study shows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dutch scientists who wore molds that changed the
shape of their ears had trouble locating where sounds came from for
a few weeks. But their brains then adapted to using both the new
and old ear shapes.
	   Apparently their brains kept the ability to work with both sets
of ear shapes simultaneously, much like knowing two languages,
researchers from the University of Nijmegan in the Netherlands
wrote in the September issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience.
	   A person's ability to locate the source of sounds is largely
determined by what happens when sound waves reflect off the ridges
and folds of the outer ears. The brain uses the result to localize
sound. Since ear shape varies between people, each person has to
get used to his or her own ears.
	   Within six weeks of starting to wear the ear molds, the
scientists found they'd regained their ability to localize sound.
And suprisingly, when they took the molds off, they immediately
performed as well as ever with their natural ears.
	   The experiment involved the three scientists and a fourth adult.

 &UR; Falcons released in New York's Central Park
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Six strong and healthy American kestrel falcons
were released into Central Park, two months after they fell from
their nests while learning to fly earlier this summer.
	   ``They promptly took off and circled lazily in the sky over
Sheep Meadow, and then they headed for the cover of nearby trees,''
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said. ``We don't know if they'll
hang out in the park, go back to the neighborhood or go migrate
south.''
	   The baby birds, which had lived on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, fell from their nests while learning to fly during
severe storms in June. Urban Park Rangers rescued them after
residents called the Parks Department.
	   Veterinarians at the Raptor Trust in Millington, New Jersey,
treated the falcons for bruises, let them rest and then taught them
how to kill so they could live on their own, said Bram Gunther,
director of the Urban Park Rangers.
	   Hundreds of kestrel falcons live in New York City, Stern said.
The birds, which have strong taloned feet and powerful hooked
bills, grow to between nine inches and a foot long (23 to 30 cms)
and have wingspans of up to two feet (60 cms).
	   The kestrel falcons are predators, eating grasshoppers and
smaller birds.

 &UR; Colorado team finds ruins of ancient church under water off Turkish
coast
	   BOULDER, Colorado (AP) _ Researchers used a rowboat, ocean buoys
and snorkeling equipment to locate the ruins of a 1,700-year-old
Christian church off the Turkish coast.
	   The church apparently was built sometime after A.D. 330 in the
ancient city of Aperlae, and then sank about 6 feet (about 2
meters) into the Mediterranean Sea as centuries of earthquakes
caused the shoreline to subside, University of Colorado researchers
said this month.
	   The stone church is about 66 feet (20 meters) long and 33 feet
(10 meters) wide. The researchers found a multicolored mosaic and
large stone columns lying next to the ruins.
	   ``There is a confusion of riches on the sea floor,'' history
professor Robert Hohlfelder said. ``It looks like the structure had
been added to over the centuries. We think this church ... may have
supplanted a seaside temple.''
	   Hohlfelder and his students also relied on Global Positioning
System satellite receivers to chart the ruins.
	   The discovery came in June, during a two-year archaeological
project to explore the remains of the 2,400-year-old city.
	   The Aperlae project was begun in 1996 by a team led by
Hohlfelder, who also is a marine archaeologist, and a group of
University of Maryland students led by architecture professor R.
Lindley Vann.

Controversial U.N. weapons inspector resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that Ritter being investigated by FBI, US,
Butler and UN comment, Ritter comment possibly Thursday; US, UN and
Security Council accused of surrendering. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Incensed that the U.N. Security Council
failed to take a tougher stand on the latest impasse with Iraq, an
American arms inspector who Baghdad had accused of being a spy
resigned.
	   Scott Ritter, 37, a concealment expert and seven-year veteran of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) that carries out inspections,
harshly criticized the council, the United States and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for surrendering to Iraq.
	   In his scathing letter of resignation Wednesday, Ritter said the
council's decision not to take stronger action after Iraq froze
cooperation with weapons inspectors on Aug. 5 ``makes a mockery of
the mission the staff of the Special Commission have been charged
with implementing.''
	   It showed that the council ``is no longer willing and or capable
of the implementation of its own law.''
	   ``This abrogation of its most basic of responsibilities has made
the Security Council a witting partner to an overall Iraqi strategy
of weakening the Special Commission,'' Ritter wrote.
	   Ritter singled out the United States, accusing it of at least
implicitly surrendering to Baghdad by not fighting for inspectors'
unrestricted access to suspected weapons sites.
	   He also said Annan had allowed his office to become a ``sounding
board for Iraqi grievances, real or imagined,'' by agreeing to
conduct a comprehensive review of sanctions.
	   Ritter wasn't available for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said,
though he was expected to talk to the media on Thursday.
	   Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, said Ritter's
resignation was accepted and effective immediately. ``I deeply
regret his going and I thanked him deeply for the extraordinary
gifts he gave this place,'' Butler said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley saluted
Ritter for ``an admirable job under difficult, even dangerous
circumstances.''
	   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for Annan, denied the U.N. chief had
acted at the behest of Iraq and noted that Annan's job was to
``listen to the complaints of member states.''
	   The resignation was sure to be greeted well in Baghdad, where
Ritter had incurred the wrath of Saddam Hussein for his work in
trying to uncover Iraqi weapons. Iraq had called Ritter, a retired
captain in the U.S. Marines, an American spy and accused him of
working for the CIA.
	   CBS television, in a broadcast Wednesday, said the FBI was
investigating Ritter for allegedly showing classified information
about Iraq's weapons to Israel. The investigation is not complete,
but officials say it appears Ritter did nothing wrong, CBS said.
	   A dispute last year between the United Nations and Iraq first
surfaced when Ritter was barred from entering a presidential
palace. He also angered Iraq with unannounced inspections.
	   Ritter was frequently the chief inspector on field missions in
Iraq and was an expert in concealment issues _ looking for
information and evidence that Baghdad claimed it didn't have.
	   Ritter's departure comes at a time when inspections have been
paralyzed by Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before sanctions will be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
prompting the Gulf War.
	   The Security Council has only called the decision ``totally
unacceptable,'' and asked inspectors try to go about their work _ a
move criticized by inspectors because it failed to give them
stronger support.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis appears to be escalating
as the ruble remains on the skids and the Central Bank indicates it
may have to stop pulling it up.
	   For the first time ever, the Central Bank canceled already
agreed dollar sales on Wednesday, and the government failed to make
payments on some longer-term debt previously unaffected by the
crisis.
	   Nonetheless, the mood on the street remains anxious, not
panicked. While some Russians complained banks were only letting
them make withdrawals in rubles, not dollars, others said they were
growing accustomed to the country's state of continual crisis.
	   ``I'm so used to this damn country I'm not so upset about it,''
said a 29-year-old woman leaving a Moscow branch of MostBank who
gave her name as Maria. ``It's more like resignation.''
	   The government devalued the ruble 10 days ago, swelling demand
for dollars among banks and the public.
	   Analysts estimate that less than 10 percent of Russians keep
their savings in the commercial banks at risk of failure in
Russia's current financial turmoil. And many of those savings are
deposited in dollars, which have only gained value as the ruble has
lost.
	   The rest keep their money under the mattress or in the state-run
Sberbank, where the deposits are guaranteed.
	   Banks with inadequate hard currency reserves are expected to
collapse, and the first went belly up Wednesday _ Imperial Bank, a
small commercial bank that like many in Russia concentrates on
money speculation instead of customer deposits.
	   Anatoly Chubais, a former top Kremlin policymaker highly
regarded in the West, said the government is in a tight spot.
	   ``On the one hand, the banking system should be prevented from
complete collapse, but on the other hand declare the bankrupt banks
bankrupt,'' he said.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin rushed to Ukraine and
held an emergency meeting with International Monetary Fund head
Michel Camdessus. He was expected to plead with the IMF not to
delay the next installment of a multibillion dollar loan that
Russia has been using to shore up its Central Bank reserves _
eroded by the effort of supporting the ruble.
	   Traders and investors expressed dismay with a government debt
repayment plan announced Tuesday, and their disappointment dragged
the stock market even further down _ closing at 76.26 points, down
8 percent from Tuesday in feeble trading.
	   ``Many thought the debt swap conditions were just
unacceptable,'' said Mikhail Koltsov, trader at Moscow-based
investment bank MFK-Renaissance.
	   Foreign investors have already been leaving Russia in droves,
and the losses they will sustain under the debt restructuring _ in
some cases receiving just 17 cents on the dollar, according to some
analysts _ will discourage many from returning any time soon.
	   In a further worrying sign, a number of major Western banks
reported the Russian government had also defaulted on payments on
some long-term government debt not covered by the restructuring
plan.
	   The ruble dropped another 5 percent, ending at 8.26 rubles to
the dollar or 12.1 cents. It plummeted even more _ nearly 40
percent _ against the German mark, as banks went after marks.
	   The Central Bank, afraid to spend more of its reserves on
propping up the currency, decided instead to cancel the dollar
transactions _ the first time it took such a step since Russia
began its free market reforms in 1992.
	   The move suggested the government was giving up efforts to stem
the fall of the ruble, and analysts said the government should
consider imposing currency controls _ in effect, taking the ruble
off the open market.
	   In an interview late in the day on Echo Moscow radio, Central
Bank spokeswoman Irina Yasina denied that currency controls were in
the works.
	   Parliament leaders moved forward, meanwhile, with plans to form
a governing coalition with Chernomyrdin that would give top jobs to
hard-liners and Communists.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov also renewed his call
for President Boris Yeltsin to resign and warned his faction and
allies would only vote to approve Chernomyrdin if he gives the
opposition a say in his program.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Four men suspected of belonging to a
leftist guerrilla group that clashed with the army were ordered
held for trial Wednesday.
	   The four face charges of sedition and conspiracy stemming from
the June 7 clash in the village of El Charco in the western state
of Acapulco. Eleven suspected guerrillas of the Revolutionary Army
of the Insurgent People were killed.
	   The army claims the rebels had opened fire on them after an
anti-drug patrol stumbled on a rebel meeting in a schoolhouse.
Suspects have said that the soldiers fired on guerrillas and
civilians as they were trying to surrender.
	   The four are among 11 suspected guerrillas who have been
arrested on charges stemming from the clash. Six other suspects
remain at large.

BellSouth sells New Zealand mobile phone business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ U.S. telecommunications giant
BellSouth will sell its New Zealand cellular phone business to
British operator Vodafone for New Zealand dollars 360 million (U.S.
dlrs 750 million), the companies announced Thursday.
	   The deal ends months of speculation about which company would
buy the New Zealand operation, and completes BellSouth's exit from
Australasia.
	   All customer and supplier contractual obligations will be
transferred to the new owner in a sale conditional on regulatory
and interconnection approvals, which are expected to be completed
in six to eight weeks, the companies said.
	   Vodafone in 1985 launched Britain's second cellular network, and
specializes in GSM mobile operations in Europe, South Africa,
Australia and Fiji.
	   ``Mobile telephony is Vodafone's core business and the New
Zealand network is a very welcome addition to the group's growing
international portfolio,'' group chief executive Chris Gent said.
	   Vodafone has a 10 billion pounds (U.S. dlrs 16 billion) market
capitalization and reported a 418 million pounds (U.S. dlrs 680
million) net profit in fiscal 1998.
	   BellSouth New Zealand's chief executive, Larry Carter, said the
decision to divest arose from a change in strategic direction for
the two owners, the U.S. parent, which owns 65 percent, and
Singapore Technologies, which owns 35 percent.
	   Their plans to build strong Asian region activities had failed
to materialize, Carter said.
	   He said there was little strategic value in BellSouth staying in
the small New Zealand market given its dramatic expansion in
Central and South America.
	   However, he said the decision to leave New Zealand was not
forced and the price achieved was a good one for all parties.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Unseeded Julie Halard-Decugis
upset No. 3 seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 Wednesday
in a bizarre match delayed hours by rain and nearly called after
gnats swarmed the Pilot Pen International.
	   Halard-Decugis, who missed most of 1997 due to knee, shoulder
and wrist injuries, combined speed and precision to counter the
Spaniard's returns with consistent winners.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, No. 4 on tour, had a 2-1 first set lead going
into the rain delay. When they resumed under muggy conditions more
than two hours later, she quickly went up 5-2.
	   After that is was all Halard-Decugis. The Frenchwoman won the
next four games to go up 6-5, holding Sanchez-Vicario to just five
points. Sanchez-Vicario held serve to force the tiebreaker.
	   ``I was making some mistakes in the beginning,'' said
Halard-Decugis.``I just tried to focus more.''
	   By the middle of the second set, both had to contend with the
unsettling cloud of gnats.
	   ``There was so many going to the eyes and mouth and everywhere,
and it was difficult to play,'' Halard-Decugis said.
	   Sanchez-Vicario also was troubled by the bugs and humidity but
did not blame her second-round exit on that.
	   ``I make too many unforced errors. She played much more
consistent than myself,'' Sanchez-Vicario said.
	   They were able to finish, but the night match between No. 2 seed
Jana Novotna and wild-card entry Chanda Rubin was temporarily
suspended as tournament officials waited for the gnats to scat.
	   Also Wednesday, top seed Lindsay Davenport advanced to the
quarterfinals without raising a racket. Her opponent, Virgina Ruano
Pascual, withdrew after hurting her left hamstring while
practicing.
	   Earlier in the day, South African Amanda Coetzer beat Anna
Kournikova 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 and Anka Huber of Germany beat No. 6 seed
Patty Schnyder 7-5, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Coetzer trailed 1-4 in the deciding set before she began to
frustrate the Russian with deep strokes that prevented hard, angled
returns. The unseeded teen then dropped a string of points serving
at 5-5 and sent Coetzer to the line up 6-5 to serve for the match.
	   ``I just had faith that I could hang in there,'' Coetzer said.
``I felt like I was starting to play better and better as the match
went on.''
	   Kournikova, ranked 14th in the world, dominated the first set
and part of the second, jumping on Coetzer's shallow baseline play
and running the No. 7 seed all over the court when she wasn't
smashing her desperate lobs.
	   Kournikova returned to the tour last week in Montreal after
missing eight weeks because of a strained thumb. She said her
mental game may have suffered, but she also credited Coetzer for
hanging on.
	   ``She was just being tough out there,'' Kournikova said. ``She
started not making any mistakes.''
	   Huber, who missed four months of competition after Achille's
tendon surgery, fended off a late drive by Schnyder, who forced a
tiebreaker after dropping the first four games.
	   ``It still gives me a lot of confidence to win close matches
anyway, especially against the top players,'' Huber said.
	   Schnyder, ranked 10th in the world, said her service returns and
mental game both need some work.
	   ``I couldn't hold my concentration at a high level,'' she said.

Australian, New Zealand dollars plunge to new lows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Economic turmoil in Russia pushed the
Australian and New Zealand currencies to record lows Thursday,
while stock markets also declined.
	   The Australian dollar crashed to its lowest value against the
U.S. dollar since the local currency's float in 1983, shedding one
U.S. cent in value on overnight foreign exchange markets.
	   The Australian currency opened local trade at 56.45 U.S. cents
after reaching an overnight low of 56.25 U.S. cents. It fell
further Thursday morning to 56.10 U.S. cents, a post-float low.
	   In New Zealand, the dollar dipped to a 12-year low of 48.57 U.S.
cents before recovering slightly.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian ruble had its biggest one-day fall in
nearly four years. In addition, Russia announced a debt
restructuring plan that left bond holders with securities producing
yields way below what investors had been getting.
	   ``At the present time there is a good deal of turmoil from world
financial markets; there is a good deal of international pressure
on the Australian economy,'' Prime Minister John Howard said.
	   Dealers said the main attack on the Australian dollar came from
U.S. investors looking to sell commodity-based currencies such as
those from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
	   Many dealers expect Russia's dire economic straits will prompt
it to sell its commodities at cut-price rates, hurting Australia's
commodity-reliant economy.
	   The Australian share market opened sharply lower in early
trading Thursday as investors reacted to the plunging Australian
dollar and the global implications from the economic collapse in
Russia, dealers said.
	   The All Ordinaries Index of share prices was down 45.7 points,
or 1.8 percent, at 2562.3, from Wednesday's close at 2608.0.
	   In New Zealand, the share market was 1.57 percent lower in early
trade as the Russian currency crisis unnerved overseas markets,
traders said.
	   The benchmark NZSE-40 capital index was down 30.50 points at
1912.55 on low turnover.

will see its annual deficit balloon to 1.6 trillion yen (dlrs 11
billion) next year, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
said.
	   With 235 trillion yen (dlrs 1.6 trillion) in deposits, the
system ranks as the world's biggest bank, allowing account holders
to deposit and withdraw their savings from any of the nation's post
offices.
	   But the institution, which competes for depositors with private
banks by offering higher returns on savings accounts, no longer
earns enough money on its investments to cover those costs, the
ministry said in its 1999 budget request, released Wednesday.
	   Last year, the ministry said it expects the savings system to
see a 150 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion) loss in 1998.
	   Like private banks, the postal savings system has been forced to
cut returns paid to depositors as financial authorities have kept
key interest rates at record lows to rekindle the nation's sluggish
economy.
	   With the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond now near
historic lows of 1.110 percent, savings accounts at Japanese banks
typically offer annual interest of just 0.3 percent.

Ten Filipino crew missing after ship capsizes near Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A cargo ship sank off the southern coast of Japan,
and 10 Filipino crew members were still missing, the Japanese coast
guard said Thursday.
	   The 18,793-ton Panamanian-registered Sea Prospect, en route to
Japan from Indonesia, suddenly began tilting to one side Wednesday
night, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of the southern
island of Okinawa, said Yusuke Ono, a Maritime Safety Agency
official.
	   When crew members tried to right the ship, which was carrying
nickel ore, it began tilting in the other direction, then started
sinking, he said.
	   Eleven crew members floating on rafts, all Filipinos, were
rescued by the agency, after it received calls for help.
	   Rescue efforts continued Thursday for the missing, Ono said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. South winning &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Brack Massey and Kevin Hodges
hit consecutive homers and Hodges struck out the last six batters
as Greenville, North Carolina (U.S. South) won a spot in the U.S.
final with a 6-4 victory over Cypress, California (U.S. West)
Wednesday in the Little League World Series.
	   Hodges has given up two earned runs on five hits and struck out
17 _ eight on Wednesday _ in 12 innings to earn both of
Greenville's wins.
	   Richard Barnhill hit a three-run home run as Greenville rallied
from a four-run deficit.
	   In Thursday's final, Greenville faces Toms River, New Jersey
(U.S. East), an undefeated team that beat the Greenville 4-1 on
Tuesday behind Todd Frazier's two-run home run and Casey Gaynor's
five-hitter.
	   Greenville is the first North Carolina team in the series since
Mooresville in 1952.
	   In the international pool, Sean Sargent hit his fourth homer of
the World Series as Langley, Canada, beat Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
9-3 to advance to Thursday's international championship game.
	   The undefeated Canadians will face Kashima, Japan, a team they
beat 10-5 in seven innings behind five home runs _ four in the
extra inning.
	   A Canadian team has never won the World Series and no team had
even gone to the international pool final since the round-robin
format began in 1992. The last team from Canada to make it to the
championship: Stoney Creek, Ontario, in 1965. It lost 3-1 to
Windsor Locks, Conn.
	   Cypress struck first in a error-riddled third inning. Following
two walks and two wild pitches by Hodges, overthrows by third
baseman Sam Byrum and center fielder Richard Barnhill allowed two
runs to score.
	   Barnhill redeemed himself with a three-run homer in the third
inning that tied the game at 4-4. Then, in the fifth, Massey and
Hodges welcomed reliever Zach Wesley with the back-to-back shots.
	   Hodges followed that blow with another: He struck out the side
in both the fifth and sixth innings.
	   Langley, which has with nine home runs in the series and 28 in
the post-season, is the biggest team in this World Series, and the
Canadians beat Dhahran with power.
	   Sargent's solo shot to left led off a five-run third inning,
Jared Krause knocked two runs home with a double to the warning
track and Mark Henderson hit an RBI single up the middle, then
scored on a wild pitch as Langley led 7-0.
	   Sargent is batting .500 with five RBIs.
	   The Canadians rocked starting pitcher Amit Karr for six earned
runs on five hits in 2 2-3 innings.
	   Langley starter Jared Krause gave up one run on four hits over
five innings.
	   Doug Grosch had an RBI single for Dhahran.
	   The world championship game is Saturday.

After 19 seasons and 708 goals, Gartner retires from NHL

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ After scoring 708 goals over 19 seasons with five
National Hockey League teams, Mike Gartner has decided to call it a
career.
	   Gartner, who'll turn 39 in October, announced his retirement
Wednesday _ just weeks before the start of training camp and a few
months after playing out his option with the Phoenix Coyotes.
	   ``The timing is right,'' Gartner said in a telephone interview
from Toronto, where he and his family relocated in June. ``It's
something I planned on doing. My oldest son is now 14 years old and
is going to be a freshman in high school and my daughter is going
to junior high.
	   ``I always told my wife that when our kids got into high school,
we would have a stable environment and wouldn't be moving around. I
just wanted to be in one place and not have them worry about being
pulled out of school.
	   ``Everything was kind of coming to a point where I had to make a
decision. ... It's really the right time.''
	   Gartner retires as the No. 5 goal scorer in NHL history. He
ranks 18th in points with 1,335 in 1,432 games for Phoenix, the
Washington Capitals, Minnesota North Stars, New York Rangers and
Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   ``Mike has had a tremendous career,'' Coyotes general manager
Bobby Smith said. ``He can look back and be very proud of what he's
done. I think he has an outstanding chance for the Hall of Fame.
He's in very good company with 700 goals. Very few guys have done
that. The same thing with 600 goals and 600 assists.''
	   Obtained by the Coyotes in a draft-day trade with Toronto for a
fourth-round pick in 1996, Gartner became only the sixth player to
reach the 600-600 plateau with an assist against Dallas on Feb. 8,
1997.
	   Last Dec. 14 here against Detroit, Gartner sent a trademark
wrist shot from the slot over Detroit goalie Chris Osgood's glove
for goal No. 700.
	   Wayne Gretzky (885), Gordie Howe (801) Marcel Dionne (731) and
Phil Esposito (717) are the only other players to reach 700 goals.
That same group, plus Mario Lemieux and Gartner, are the only
members of the 600-600 club.
	   Gartner, who turned pro at age 19 with the Cincinnati Stingers
of the now defunct World Hockey Association, was drafted in the
first round by Washington in 1979 and still leads the Capitals
franchise in goals (397) and points (789).
	   In 1994, Gartner became the first NHL player to score 30 goals
in 15 consecutive seasons.

Tokyo stock prices plunge, dollar falls in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading, bond and currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks plunged in morning trading Thursday,
hit by growing worries about Russian-led global market turmoil. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 405.99 points, or
2.73 percent, to 14,460.04 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the average dropped 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The key index went as low as 14,378.67, its lowest intraday
level since July 3, 1995, when it fell as low as 14,295.90.
	   Traders said concern about a delay in the passage in Japan's
Parliament of bills to clean up the country's bad-loan-ridden
financial system also hurt sentiment.
	   Japanese stocks started lower on futures-led selling following
sharp overnight drops on Wall Street amid Russia's worsening
economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
8,523.35 on Thursday, down 79.30.
	   Continued weakness in major bank issues pulled the overall
market lower as strong resistance by opposition parties may hamper
the passage of banking reform bills submitted by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   ``Both domestic and overseas factors are heavily weighing on
Japanese stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co. ``Investors are actively unwinding
cross-shareholdings, and the market hasn't yet found solid downside
support,'' he said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 29.01 points, or 2.53 percent, at 1,118.20.
The TOPIX closed down 15.37 points, or 1.32 percent, the day
before.
	   Parliament began debate Tuesday on a series of bills aimed at
speeding up the write-off of bad loans, which have dogged the
nation's banks since the collapse of the land market in the early
1990s.
	   Opposition lawmakers have vowed to resist the bills, which they
say will bail out incompetent bankers at the public's expense.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 143.72 yen at
midday, down 0.95 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its
late New York rate of 144.02 yen overnight.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau with the
Finance Ministry, told reporters Thursday that the yen is
excessively weak against the dollar, but appeared to downplay the
yen's recent weakening against other currencies, including the
German mark.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.110 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.36 yen from 112.32 yen.

Overseas specialists begin tracking Sydney parasite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Residents of Australia's largest city
were told THursday they will have to boil their tap water before
drinking it for at least another 36 hours, as specialists try to
isolate the source of contamination by dangerous parasites.
	   As Sydney residents began the second day of the latest water
scare, experts from the United States arrived to help track the
source of the contamination.
	   No cases of illness have been reported so far.
	   Late Tuesday, the New South Wales state Health Department warned
almost all Sydney's 3.7 million residents they should boil tap
water for at least one minute before drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing uncooked foods or making ice.
	   The warning followed the discovery of high levels of the
dangerous microscopic parasites giardia and cyptosporidium in the
water system.
	   The alert is the second time in a month Sydney, which prides
itself as being on being one of the world's most modern and urbane
cities, has been told the water is unsafe to drink.
	   The outbreaks are a major embarrassment ahead of the 2000
Olympic Games, which Sydney will host.
	   A spokesman for the health department Thursday said the all
clear would not be given until a series of tests for the parasites
all showed clear readings. So far there had been none, the
spokesman said, on condition of anonymity.
	   Technical experts Dr. William Bellamy and Tony Myers of Chicago
water treatment operation firm CH2M Hill arrived Thursday and
immediately began work trying to trace the source of the
contamination.
	   A British expert from Thames Water is also taking part in the
investigation, which is centered on a privately-owned water
treatment plant.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
	   Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.

Suharto brother-in-law faces inquiry into business venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government will investigate a
brother-in-law of former President Suharto for the allegedly
illegal issue of dlrs 3 billion in promissory notes in 1985, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   It is the latest inquiry into the business dealings of the
family of Suharto, whose relatives built a huge economic empire
during his 32 years as Indonesia's leader. The autocrat quit in May
after riots and student protests against him.
	   Hartomo, a retired military general, did not have the right to
issue the notes at the time, The Indonesian Observer quoted
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib as saying. That right is
reserved only for the finance minister.
	   ``It was a deceptive and unlawful act,'' Ghalib said Wednesday.
``Nobody had the guts to question the decision at that time.''
	   He said the government is facing a lawsuit from several foreign
note-holders who bought the notes from Hartomo in the 1980s.
	   ``If we can prove that use of the funds was fraudulent and was
committed by an unauthorized individual, hopefully, we are then
free from lawsuits brought by foreign note-holders,'' Ghalib said.
	   Government prosecutors are investigating more than a dozen
charitable foundations set up and controlled by Suharto amid
allegations they were used for corrupt purposes.
	   Critics also say corruption in the business practices of
Suharto's children contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis,
which has stripped millions of people of their jobs.

McGrath ready for Games

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian paceman Glenn McGrath said
Thursday he expected to be bowling at 95 percent pace or better in
the Commonwealth Games cricket competition next month.
	   Australia is favored to qualify for the semifinals from its
group, which includes an as yet unnamed Indian lineup, plus Canada
and Antigua.
	   McGrath missed Australia's tour to India with a stomach injury
and has played just one low-key limited overs match since last
Australian summer.
	   But he is keen to get back near his best at the Games, in Kuala
Lumpur from Sept. 9, with Australia's tour of Pakistan to follow
later in the month.
	   ``The body has held together well,'' McGrath said Thursday.
``I've been training quite well for the last three months. I'm a
lot stronger and fitter than I've been in the past, so hopefully
that'll make me a lot quicker too.''
	   He played a match at Lord's recently and bowled at 75 percent.
	   ``Hopefully I'll now crank it up to 90 or 95 percent, or even
full pace,'' McGrath said.
	   He said he was disappointed that England decided not to compete,
because there is no prizemoney, and that at Pakistan and India will
send below-strength teams because of their clashing series in
Canada.
	   ``I'd prefer to be playing the full-strength sides, but at the
end of the day if we've got the gold medals hanging around our
necks we're not going to be worried about who we played,'' McGrath
said. ``You've got to be confident, with the team we've got and if
we play as well as we can we're a pretty tough team to beat.''
	   South Africa is sending a strong young team with several test
players including Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis, while world
champions Sri Lanka are at full strength and are in the other half
of the draw from Australia.
	   While the Canadian amateurs are unknown to Australia's players,
there are some familiar faces waiting in the pool match against
Antigua.
	   Antigua will be led by former West Indies test captain Richie
Richardson and paceman Curtly Ambrose will also be on hand to
torment his old foes.

 &UR; Rusedski breaks shoe, but advances in Hamlet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Greg Rusedski, in only his second
tournament since being sidelined seven weeks with a tear in his
left ankle, overcame a broken right shoe during the tiebreaker to
beat Brazil's Fernando Meligeni 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) on Wednesday in the
Hamlet Cup.
	   Meligeni thought Rusedski, last year's U.S. Open runnerup, was
stalling for time in the tiebreaker as he changed shoes with the
score 2-2.
	   ``The heel actually fell off,'' the 24-year-old Briton said. ``I
can't help it if my shoe fell apart and I certainly did not want to
risk another broken ankle. I showed it to the officials and
actually pulled on the shoe to show them the break.
	   ``Finally Melegeni believed me. What else could he do? The
evidence was there.''
	   Rusedski committed 38 unforced errors, but ``that is of no
concern as long as I won,'' he said. ``It takes seven matches to
win the U.S. Open and all seven aren't going to be outstanding.''
	   David Prinosil of Germany, who got into the tournament because
Yegeny Kafelnikov withdrew because of injury, beat defending Hamlet
champion and current French Open titleist Carlos Moya of Spain 6-2,
6-2. Moya is ranked 10th in the world, Prinosil 81st.
	   Russia's Matt Safin, an 18-year-old rookie on the ATP Tour,
reached a tournament quarterfinals for the first time by defeating
Filip Dewulf of Belgium 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
	   And Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic upset ninth-seeded Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.
	   Safin, who started the year ranked 204th, climbed to No. 72 this
week, partially as a result of scoring five-set victories over
Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten in the French Open. He then lost
to Cedric Pioline in the third round.
	   ``My game has been unbelievably bad since then,'' said Safin.
``I lost my confidence and played bad ... bad ... bad. There was no
physical problem. The problem for me was in my head.''
	   What turned things around?
	   ``Less practice,'' he said, then added: ``My early run was not
normal. I was not expected to beat Andre. Then I said, 'Why not?'
	   ``Right now I'm playing with confidence, but it's still not my
best tennis. I still need more work on my volleys and my serve. My
speed is exactly what I want.
	   ``With the way my confidence is, I hope to be playing for a long
time.''
