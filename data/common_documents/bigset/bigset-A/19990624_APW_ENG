<HEADLINE> Oswald's Russian Files To Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Archives rather than intelligence  
and defense agencies should get first crack at KGB files on Lee 
Harvey Oswald recently turned over to President Clinton, says an 
advocate of public access to government documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oswald files -- a surprise gift from Boris Yeltsin to  
President Clinton -- will first be reviewed for material sensitive 
to national security concerns, while also taking into account 
privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The interagency review set up by the White House will consist of  
officials from the CIA, the National Security Council and the State 
and Defense Departments, NSC spokesman David Leavy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Martin, a lawyer for the National Security Archive, a  
private research group and library, believes the papers should go 
to the National Archives, which oversees assassination records and 
makes them publicly available. 
</P>
<P>
	``This procedure they are talking about is very troubling to  
us,'' she said. ``It's very hard to imagine any real national 
security considerations for withholding these documents from the 
American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While officials said there is no estimate when the public might  
see the material, Leavy said the White House expects ultimately to 
make the documents public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our approach would be to declassify and make public as much as  
possible,'' he said. He could not specify how long it would take. 
</P>
<P>
	About 85 papers, all in Russian, were turned over by Yeltsin on  
Sunday when he met with Clinton during the Group of Eight summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, a former Marine, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959  
and renounced his American citizenship. That attracted the 
attention of the KGB, which bugged his apartment in the Belarus 
capital city of Minsk, paid neighbors to inform on him and kept 
Oswald and his Russian wife Marina under constant surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB amassed a six-volume file on Oswald's activities in  
Minsk. It was sent to Moscow after the assassination but returned 
to Minsk after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents handed over by Yeltsin are thought to be the KGB  
files compiled in Moscow, said John Tunheim, former chairman of the 
government's Assassination Records Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, which went out of business last year, was created to  
locate, gather and eventually make public all known assassination 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim said the documents could shed light on what the KGB knew  
about Oswald and how top-ranking Soviet officials reacted when they 
learned that Oswald was the suspected gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KGB had sophisticated intelligence at the time. They could  
have uncovered facts that we didn't get,'' said Tunheim, who was a 
member of a board delegation that tried but failed to get the 
documents from Russia in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian newspaper published three documents from the files on  
Wednesday, the Washington Post reported. One was a handwritten 
letter Oswald sent to Soviet authorities seeking asylum in 1959. 
Another discussed the Soviet reaction to the assassination and the 
third described plans for attendance at the Kennedy funeral.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Backs AP in Ad Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld the dismissal  
of a lawsuit accusing The Associated Press of trying to monopolize 
the electronic delivery of newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the AD/SAT  
delivery company had failed to prove there was a threat the AP 
could achieve monopoly power in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge appeals panel also found that much of the  
conduct challenged by AD/SAT's lawsuit was the kind of activity 
that previous rulings have made clear should not be deterred, much 
less punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is, it is not unlawful for an existing firm, entering a  
new product market, to promote its product by touting the benefits 
afforded by that product's association with the firm,'' the appeals 
court wrote in its ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nor is it unlawful for employees of one division of a firm to  
promote products produced by another division,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure in 1996 tossed out the  
lawsuit, deciding there were other competitors in the market and 
advertisers were beginning to develop their own electronic delivery 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP started its AdSEND service in September 1994, using  
satellites to deliver advertising to newspapers in minutes, in a 
form ready for pagination. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed AdSEND unfairly utilized the AP's network of  
member newspapers to enter the market, drive out competitors and 
become dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the AP said it was untrue that its prices were  
meant to drive others out of business. They said AdSEND could 
charge less than AD/SAT because it planned to carry a larger volume 
of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel R. Shulman, a lawyer for AD/SAT, said the business was  
forced to close its doors after 10 years when the earlier ruling 
went against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defendants in the lawsuit included the Newspaper  
Association of America; the National Newspaper Network; Cox 
Enterprises Inc.; Advance Publications Inc.; AP board member Donald 
E. Newhouse, who is president of Advance and The Star-Ledger of 
Newark, N.J., and was chairman of the NAA when AdSEND was 
developed; and AP member newspapers The Birmingham (Ala.) News, The 
Oakland Press of Pontiac, Mich., The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, 
N.C., and The Daily Oklahoman of Oklahoma City. The Lexington (Ky.) 
Herald-Leader was dismissed by the judge as defendant in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall: Dow Ends Down 132.03 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled again under the burden of higher  
interest rates, but investors on Thursday found an added impetus 
for a selloff -- scattered warnings of weakness in second-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 132.03 to close at  
10,534.83, the fourth straight decline for the blue chip index. The 
Dow has now lost 320 points since Monday, nearly wiping out a 
365-point gain from last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index fell 17.28 to 1,315.78, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 
44.13 to close at 2,553.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts expect companies to report generally robust  
earnings after the second quarter ends next week. But amid concerns 
about the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates to slow 
economic growth, some say the market has grown too fragile to 
withstand much bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices provided a solid dose  
late Wednesday when it said it expects a second-quarter loss far 
worse than analysts have anticipated. AMD said microprocessor 
prices have collapsed and the company has lost market share to 
industry leader Intel. Thursday, the company's stock fell 1 1/8 to 
close at 17 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also late Wednesday, Micron Technology said it lost 10 cents a  
share in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts had expected the chip 
maker to break even. Micron's stock fell 4 9/16 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings weakness wasn't confined to technology companies.  
Goodyear, a component of the Dow, said Thursday its second-quarter 
profits will fall well below analysts' expectations. Its shares 
held up, however, slipping just 1/8 to 56 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor results and warnings helped deflate Wall Street's  
optimism that strong earnings could lure investors back into the 
market. Stocks have sputtered in the weeks since the Fed first 
indicated it might raise interest rates, and many analysts have 
looked to corporate earnings as a potential salvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they aren't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Second-quarter earnings still look like they'll be strong, but  
there won't be the stream of upside surprises that we got used to 
in the first quarter,'' said Brian Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter beat Wall Street  
estimates in its earnings report Thursday, due to big business in 
trading, selling and underwriting securities. The firm's stock 
followed a pattern set by rival brokerages this week, falling 1 
15/16 to 91 5/16 as interest rate concerns outweighed good earnings 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	The continuing slide of the bond market also pressured stocks.  
The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose as high as 6.17 percent, its 
highest level since November 1997. The rising yield of bonds has 
presented investors with an attractive alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, a bond market rally helped stocks,'' Belski said.  
``This week, that support is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said last week's sentiment that the Fed will raise  
rates only a quarter of a percentage point has given way to a 
belief that Fed might raise rates higher, or more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is on pins and needles, waiting to see what the Fed  
will do,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. 
in Minneapolis. Sohn said that while market players fully expect a 
rate hike, they will be alert for clues about the Fed's future 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled a listless 
834.30 million shares, compared with 880.27 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index dropped 6.78 to 623.97, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.01 to 769.15. The 
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.88 to 443.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.24 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.2 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed down 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Mayor's Conduct Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Claims that the mayor used her influence  
improperly seem almost secondary to residents of this easy-going 
coastal city compared to debate the accusation has revived: whether 
a downtown ballpark is really a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A San Diego County grand jury has accused Mayor Susan Golding of  
improperly using her influence to gain a business group's support 
for a new Padres ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation, made public Thursday, did not bring criminal  
charges. It recommended that District Attorney Paul Pfingst pursue 
a civil misconduct case. He said he would decide within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor doesn't have anything to worry about,'' said Virgil  
Jackson, 44, the owner of a downtown shoe shine business. ``Most 
people are behind her and the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps not.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was absolutely opposed to it in November, and I'm absolutely  
opposed to it now,'' said Lee Chiles, 36, a clerk in a downtown law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	If Golding is found to have committed misconduct, she could be  
removed from office. However, her term expires next year and she is 
already barred from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are groundless,'' Golding said Thursday. ``I  
sleep very well at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury said Golding offered to support a $4 million  
allocation for a San Diego Hotel-Motel Association advertising 
program in exchange for the organization's support of a ballpark 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mansur, president of the hotel-motel association, said the  
grand jury was off the mark because his group does not market San 
Diego -- the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau does. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his organization asked Golding for an increase in  
marketing dollars for the bureau, but before the City Council voted 
to put the baseball stadium proposal on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury is trying to make it out like we hoodwinked  
everybody and got this big check,'' Mansur said. ``That never 
happened. At no time did the mayor try to influence us. Our budget 
request and our support of the ballpark were never linked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark and downtown redevelopment was approved by 60  
percent of the voters last November. The $411 million venture is to 
be financed in part with $225 million in municipal bonds secured by 
hotel-room tax revenue. The ballpark is set for completion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballpark opponents believe the city's contribution to the  
project would be better spent on a new library, school 
improvements, or other projects, and that the Padres should 
continue to share Qualcomm Stadium with the National Football 
League's Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hardy, co-owner of a tattoo shop, voted for the stadium,  
mostly because he's a lifelong Padres fan. But lately he's had 
doubts about the benefits and the cost of the project. The grand 
jury allegations only deepened his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything was laid on the table, the vote might be  
different,'' Hardy said.

<HEADLINE> Graf Escapes Against De Swardt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The serve came at Steffi Graf faster  
than she expected and whizzed past. She looked at the scoreboard 
and rolled her eyes: 116 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only bad news for Graf early in her second-round  
match Wednesday at Wimbledon. She lost five of the first six games 
to pesky Mariaan de Swardt, but then rallied to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wondering a little bit out there,'' Graf said. ``I felt  
like a spectator in the beginning, the way she was hitting those 
serves. There wasn't much I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt slammed four aces on her way to the early lead, but  
she was unable to pull off the second big upset in as many days at 
the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf became the tournament favorite when top-ranked Martina  
Hingis lost Tuesday to 16-year-old qualifier Jelena Dokic. But Graf 
grimaced when asked about her chances of winning Wimbledon for an 
eighth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is the biggest tournament around and the one I enjoy  
the most,'' she said. ``But if I win it or not, it's nothing that I 
worry right now about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Hingis' defeat and the absence of rain, the first  
three days of play produced few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles, Venus Williams, Anna Kournikova and 1998 runnerup  
Nathalie Tauziat joined Graf in the third round with straight-set 
victories. Hingis remained the only seeded woman eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Courier advanced beyond the second round at Wimbledon for  
the first time since 1993, when he lost in the final to Pete 
Sampras. Courier outlasted 12th-seeded Carlos Moya 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 
(7-1), 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, who has still never reached the third round in four tries  
at Wimbledon, was the first seeded man to lose. Fellow Spaniard 
Felix Mantilla, seeded 16th, was later eliminated by American Paul 
Goldstein, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-time champion Sampras, again looking almost invincible on  
grass, swept Sebastien Lareau 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good start,'' Sampras said. ``The fact that I've  
won here a couple of times gives me confidence. I don't feel the 
pressure, because I've proved myself here. If I don't win another 
Wimbledon, I'm sure I would be happy with five, but I'd love to win 
six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing were Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Mark Philippoussis, Greg  
Rusedski, Karol Kucera and Tommy Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseeded losers included Jennifer Capriati and French Open  
runnerup Andrei Medvedev. 
</P>
<P>
	With Graf coming off her French Open victory earlier this month,  
de Swardt appeared unlikely to mount a challenge. The stocky South 
African, ranked 38th, lost 10 of her first 12 matches in 1999 and 
has just one tournament title in 13 years on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graf brings out the best in de Swardt. They met twice  
previously, with Graf surviving a tough three-setter at Wimbledon 
in 1992, and de Swardt winning in 1995 at Brighton when Graf was 
ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt played almost flawless tennis in the first set  
Wednesday, belting aces and repeatedly winning points with 
acrobatic shots at the net. But she double-faulted twice to lose 
her serve in the first game of the final set, and Graf pulled away 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience helps a lot, and concentrating on what you know you  
can do,'' Graf said. ``You try to hang in there. The way she 
started the match, if she had continued like that, there would have 
been very little I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone suggested that the tough test might help Graf as she  
advances deeper into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always easy to say, `Yeah, I like to have  
three-setters,''' she said with a smile, ``if you come out as a 
winner.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Recall Cost Estimate: $60M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The world's leading bottler of Coca-Cola  
beverages estimates the price tag of the European soft-drink health 
scare is at least $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said Thursday that about 14 million  
cases, made up of 24 eight-ounce servings, were affected by the 
product recall in Belgium, less than 1 percent of its annual 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the $60 million one-time-only pretax expense of the  
recall, the bottling company said it expects reduced sales and 
lower operating profits and earnings per share in the second 
quarter as a result of the health scare. Some of the recall costs 
will be reimbursed by insurance and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the leading worldwide bottler,  
distributor and marketer of Coca-Cola beverages, fell 2.1 percent, 
or by 68 3/4 cents, to $31.68 3/4 Thursday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. holds a 40 percent stake Coca-Cola Enterprises,  
which owns and runs the plants at the center of the crisis. Belgian 
health officials say 249 cases of illnesses have been reported in 
Belgium since June 9 by people who drank Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Belgium authorized the resumption of production.  
</P>
<P>
	``As we reintroduce our products into the marketplace, the most  
important issues to Coca-Cola Enterprises are the quality of our 
products and earning the trust and confidence of our consumers, our 
customers, and all European officials,'' said Henry Schimberg, 
president and CEO of the Atlanta-based bottling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it couldn't estimate sales losses in Belgium  
and other European countries where sales were affected until after 
it sees the response to marketing efforts meant to revitalize 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we can minimize the short-term impact on sales  
and we are confident that this situation will not materially affect 
financial results in the year 2000 and beyond,'' Schimberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., also based in Atlanta, was ``still working on our  
assessment'' of the costs of the crisis, spokesman Rob Baskin said 
Thursday. ``It's premature for us.''

<HEADLINE> Gore On California Fund-Raising Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Al Gore concedes that Americans probably  
aren't ready for the 2000 presidential campaign, but he is. 
</P>
<P>
	At one campaign appearance after another, the vice president  
returned to the same themes: Stay the economic course that has 
brought prosperity. Improve public schools. Stiffen gun control 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In four back-to-back TV interviews and two speeches Wednesday,  
the vice president stayed relentlessly ``on message,'' hammering 
those themes from San Diego to San Francisco and often using them 
to extract himself from uncomfortable questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked him whether he is paying a political price  
for President Clinton's scandals, Gore responded he knew ``how to 
keep the prosperity going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned about attempts to shed his wooden image, Gore said he  
wasn't about to change his style -- and then added, ``I know how to 
keep the prosperity going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In both speeches and all four interviews, Gore made it clear he  
will seize on gun control as a defining campaign issue. He also 
took aim at Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure that the agenda for America's future is  
set by the American people, not by organizations like the National 
Rifle Association,'' he told 600 donors in San Francisco who 
responded with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of shielding gun manufacturers against being held  
responsible for their activities, we should be shielding children 
and families against violence,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments were references to a bill Bush signed into law last  
week that makes it harder for municipalities and counties to sue 
firearms makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore steered the conversation to gun control at every pass.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether a Bush-Gore general election race would be a dull  
contest between two men of privilege, he said: ``If that's how it 
turns out, you'll see a major debate about whether or not we should 
shield children and families from gun violence, or shield gun 
manufacturers with special protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president acknowledged to another interviewer that ``a  
lot of people aren't ready'' for the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't have time to worry about this right now  
because they know the election's a long way off,'' he said. ``As we 
get closer to it, you'll see a lot more attention paid to it, and 
then they'll see who is for shielding the gun manufacturers and who 
is for shielding children and families against gun violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke on the first day of a two-day fund-raising blitz  
through California that aides said would bring in $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled today to tour a gay and lesbian center in  
between fund-raising stops in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	California voters are likely to face a ballot measure on  
same-sex marriage on primary day next year. The proposal would 
declare that only heterosexual marriages are legally binding. Gore 
said in San Francisco he favors certain legal protections for 
domestic partners but opposes ``a change in the institution of 
marriage as we now know it between men and women.''

<HEADLINE> New Transplant Policy Favors Sickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients with less than a week to live will  
have a better chance getting a donated liver under a new policy 
approved Thursday by the nation's organ transplant network. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy change brings the United Network for Organ Sharing  
closer to the Clinton administration, which has been pressing the 
network to send scarce organs to the sickest patients first, rather 
than favoring patients in the area where the organs were donated. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's board, meeting in Atlanta, also was poised to  
retreat from its long-standing refusal to release information about 
individual transplant centers and their performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has bitterly opposed efforts to change its rules,  
and the last year and a half has been dominated by a nasty fight 
with the Department of Health and Human Services over who should 
direct allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued rules last year ordering that more data be released  
and directing the network to create a new allocation system that 
would get more organs to the sickest patients. The network mounted 
an intense lobbying effort and persuaded Congress to delay the 
regulations until this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the problem is supply and demand: The waiting list  
for organs has grown much faster than donations, and more than 
4,000 people die each year waiting. That's created intense 
competition for the organs that are available. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday the network moved closer to what HHS wants on liver  
transplants, which have engendered the most debate. The change will 
take effect as soon as it can be implemented, probably within a 
couple of months, network officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has opposed giving the sickest people the highest  
priority, arguing they are less likely to survive a transplant. But 
officials calculated that the effect of the policy change will be 
minimal: 78 percent of patients would survive one year, down from 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Livers are the most controversial because they can survive  
outside the body for 24 hours, making it possible to transport them 
anywhere in the nation. And medically, there is no way to keep 
someone in liver failure alive while awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy will direct more livers to the very sickest  
patients -- those classified as ``status 1.'' These are people who 
are suddenly struck by liver disease and have a week or less to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system offers livers first to status 1 patients in  
the designated local area, which can vary from part of a city to 
several states. If there are no medical matches, the livers are 
offered to other local patients, in order of medical urgency. If 
there are still no local matches, livers are offered to patients in 
the surrounding region, sickest first. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, approved on a 30-3 vote, would kick in if there  
are no local patients who are in the greatest medical need. In this 
case, livers would be offered to status 1 patients throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nation's 11 regions have already adopted similar  
agreements on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 14.5 percent of donated livers go to status 1  
patients. The network expects that to rise to 22.3 percent under 
the new policy. The percentages going to less urgent patients all 
drop slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS officials welcomed the change but said they hoped it would  
be expanded to other patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly moving in the right direction,'' said Dr.  
Claude Earl Fox, who directs the HHS agency in charge of transplant 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wants further changes. For example, while the new policy  
would speed up livers to the sickest patients who suddenly develop 
acute liver disease, it would not help those expected to die within 
a week from chronic liver ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said direct talks with network officials are continuing and  
progress is being made. ``We're going to work this out,'' he 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Network officials said government pressure did not force the  
policy turnabout, but they acknowledged that the dispute helped 
push them toward the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had some influence on the decision, there's no doubt about  
that,'' said network spokesman Bob Spieldenner. The network 
includes transplant hospitals, surgeons and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule would not eliminate geographic boundaries, even for  
the sickest patients. 
</P>
<P>
	A liver donated in Cleveland, for instance, might be directed to  
someone who is relatively healthy even if there is a status 1 
patient in nearby Pittsburgh, because the regional line is drawn 
between Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS rules also called for the network to release more data.  
The board scheduled a vote Friday on a plan to release information 
annually about patient survival rates and waiting times for 
transplants at individual hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also adopted a new policy Thursday on allocating  
livers that have been divided, with part to go to an adult and part 
to a child. Hospitals that agree to split all medically suitable 
livers will be part of the group that gets the first chance at 
other donated split livers.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Up; Grains, Soybeans Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean and grain futures prices fell in trading Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for more favorable Midwest 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures fell while sugar prices  
continued their recent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	July soybean futures plummeted 13 cents a bushel Thursday.  
Forecasters, who had been calling for unusually hot temperatures 
next week, now say that a high-pressure ridge in the Midwest has 
weakened. Updated forecasts called for scattered showers, which 
would be beneficial for crops. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service forecasters have downgraded the chance  
for a heat wave in the near future, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and spring wheat had risen in Wednesday's trading due to  
trader concern that hot, dry weather would damage newly planted 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures closed slightly lower Thursday, following the  
trend in corn and soybeans. Concern over the U.S. hard red winter 
wheat crop provided some support, limiting losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.50 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.12 1/2 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 13 cents to $4.52 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.32 cent to 63.15 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.43 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 2.00 cents to 50.70 cents a pound; and August pork 
bellies fell 1.25 cent to 43.45 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures posted losses Thursday on the Board of Trade of  
the City of New York on continued news of ample warehouse supplies 
and a lack of cold weather in Brazilian growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold-air mass that had dropped temperatures in Brazilian  
growing areas was moving out to sea and there were forecasts for a 
general warming trend, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee dipped lower in early trading but then leveled off as  
there was a general lack of activity on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil produces mostly robusta beans -- the type not  
favored by gourmet coffee drinkers -- its product often is blended 
with the better-tasting arabica produced by Latin American and 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for July delivery fell 2.05 cents to $1.032 per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures rose slightly Thursday on the Board of Trade of  
the City of New York, continuing the recent upward trend. Prices 
dipped in early trading but then recovered to settle on the 
positive side, matching the four-month highs reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures have been on the rise ahead of Russia's  
implementation of a 45 percent duty on new imports beginning Aug. 
1. Shipments must be loaded and delivered to importers by the date 
to avoid the increased taxes as that country moves to protect 
domestic growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest sugar importer, but shipments this  
year to that country have been sharply lower because of economic 
turmoil. Importers' sudden scramble to beat the duties, however, 
has caused a tightening of supplies of refined white sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for October delivery jumped .07 cent to 6.45 a pound.

<HEADLINE> Neighborhood Fights Yuppie Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a city where neighborhoods coexist like  
tightly nestled countries -- each with a distinct personality and 
culture -- people don't sit quietly when one begins to invade 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	And so San Francisco's Mission district, historically a haven  
for Hispanic immigrants and artists, has become a battlefield for 
yuppies, activists and one eccentric anarchist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yuppie takeover can be stopped,'' reads one of his fliers.  
``Vandalize yuppie cars ... Break the glass. Scratch the paint. 
Trash them all. Don't get caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All sides are scrambling madly for affordable housing as the  
thriving high-tech economy, coupled with the usual lure of 
attractive living in the Bay Area, has pulled 60,000 new residents 
into the city since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	With stock options to burn, these tech workers are buying  
properties and driving up rents. ``Live-work'' lofts built in the 
1980s as crash pads for struggling artists are selling for 
$400,000. Tiny one-bedroom apartments start at $1,200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-appointed voice for the displaced artists and  
blue-collar workers, operating under the alias Nestor Makhno in 
homage to an obscure Ukrainian anarchist, was unmasked by police 
recently as Kevin Keating. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, 38, was caught with his hands covered with wallpaper  
paste and a backpack full of fliers from the ``Mission Yuppie 
Eradication Project.'' He has been charged with malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	The fliers, like Makhno's letters to one of the city's free  
weekly papers, advocate trashing sushi restaurants and other 
symbols of the yuppie invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they haven't seen any increase in vandalism in the  
neighborhood. But Keating is quick to portray the Mission as an 
angry underclass about to be crushed by an indifferent aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working class neighborhoods are being destroyed for profit,''  
he said. ``We need a militant organization of tenants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomers who have invested in older homes and opened  
fashionable restaurants and stores in the Mission claim they're 
being unfairly vilified. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are saying things like, 'We don't want a certain a  
group to come into our neighborhood,' it's the same thing as a 
white group not wanting blacks,'' said new Mission resident Robert 
Cort Jr. ``Who are they to judge what the flavor of the city should 
be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the diatribes is a more complex picture of a neighborhood  
that many would like to call home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hispanic outpost since a Catholic mission was founded in 1776,  
the neighborhood has retained its Latin feel. Salsa music blares 
from storefronts; elderly women stroll past family-owned markets 
with fresh vegetables tucked under their arms. Walls are painted 
with madly colorful murals, celebrating images of Aztec warriors 
and mother goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, the salsa sounds are being replaced by the  
clashing and banging of new construction as industrial tracts are 
bulldozed for lofts and new nightclubs and eateries. 
</P>
<P>
	While Keating and his supporters decry the gentrification of the  
neighborhood, some longtime Mission residents aren't too worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been any trouble at all from the yuppies,'' said  
Anita Mercado, a volunteer at the Mission Cultural Center for 
Latino Arts and lifelong neighborhood resident. ``It's not owned by 
one race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others feel the changes undermine the very thing that makes  
San Francisco special: its quirky characters and ethnic 
neighborhoods, such as North Beach, Chinatown and Japantown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a crime to make money, but I do think it's  
a crime for the yuppies to come here and take all our apartments 
and drive up the rent,'' said Natalie Dillon, 24, who sings in a 
disco-funk band. ``All that 'Die yuppies' stuff is kind of harsh, 
but do they have to take our neighborhood?''

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 132.03  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled again under the burden of higher  
interest rates, but investors today found an added catalyst for a 
selloff: scattered warnings of weakness in second-quarter earnings. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 132.03 at 10,534.83, 
the fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index. Broader stock 
indicators also fell, with the Nasdaq composite index down 44.04 at 
2,554.08. While most analysts expect a robust reporting season when 
the second quarter ends next week, early indications of trouble 
sent stocks spiraling lower today.

	Microsoft Trial Testimony Ends  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 76 days, testimony ended today in the  
landmark Microsoft antitrust trial. The final witness, economist 
Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
argued forcefully that the $14 billion Microsoft Corp. isn't the 
entrenched monopolist that illegally wields extraordinary 
influence, as portrayed by the government. But the company's 
witness was challenged in a piercing cross-examination by David 
Boies, a Justice Department lawyer. Microsoft shares were at 84 5/8, 
down 1 3/8.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demand for autos and aircraft led orders for  
big-ticket manufactured goods up 1.4 percent in May, a sign that 
the nation's battered manufacturing sector could be headed for a 
revival. The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable 
goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- increased 
$2.8 billion last month to a seasonally adjusted $197.6 billion. 
May's increase was the ninth in the last 12 months and followed a 
2.3 percent decline in April, the government said. Analysts 
expected May's turnaround.

	Arco, BP Amoco Defend Merger Plan

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two corporations planning a merger that would  
create the world's second-largest oil company spent hours today 
trying to assure U.S. senators the deal would benefit consumers and 
encourage competition. Atlantic Richfield Chairman Mike Bowlin told 
a Senate committee that the $25.6 billion stock deal to marry his 
firm to BP Amoco would create a company that would invest in the 
latest and best technology and use it to develop new energy 
resources. Even after hearing from Bowlin and Richard Olver, a BP 
Amoco group managing director, however, members of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee questioned them closely on 
whether the merger would reduce competition and increase prices.

the Senate rejected a quota bill partly on grounds that imports 
were headed down. Whether the May numbers will give new life to 
quotas is unclear. Commerce Secretary William Daley, who had argued 
that U.S. quotas could start an international trade war, said the 
latest figures should not be cause for worry. ``One month is not 
reason to suddenly believe it's a trend,'' he told reporters.

it earned $1.15 billion in the second quarter of its fiscal year, 
handily beating analysts' estimates and marking a 35 percent 
increase over the same period a year ago. The big investment firm 
attributed the strong showing to healthy results across the broad 
range of its businesses, including equity underwriting, merger 
transactions, and overseas operations. The earnings were equivalent 
to $1.95 per share in the quarter ended May 31, easily surpassing 
the $1.54 per share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call 
Corp. In the same period a year ago, the company earned $852 
million, or $1.37 per share. Morgan Stanley stock was up 7/16 at 93

product since it was founded in 1946 to make oscilloscopes. The 
other will be based on the color printers and imaging equipment 
that has fueled expansion for Tektronix during the growth of the 
desktop computer market. The decision to split came as Tektronix 
announced fourth quarter earnings of $24.9 million, or 53 cents per 
share, down more than 41 percent from the $42.5 million, or 83 
cents per share, earned during the fourth quarter in 1998.

<HEADLINE> KKK Leader Convicted in Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- An all-white jury convicted a Ku Klux  
Klan leader of cross-burning, rejecting claims by his black ACLU 
lawyer that he was legally exercising his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Black, 51, of Johnstown, Pa., was fined $2,500 but spared  
jail time. He faced up to five years in prison for violating a 
state law against burning a cross to intimidate any person or group 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The imperial wizard with the International Keystone Knights of  
the Klan declined to testify, had no response to the verdict and 
refused comment after court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Black's lawyer, David Baugh of the American Civil Liberties  
Union, argued that while the act might make people uncomfortable, 
it was legal, and he expects to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cross was burned as a part of their ceremony, not because  
they want to intimidate anyone,'' Baugh said. ``Mr. Black has the 
right to express, by sign or gesture, any feelings he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baugh told the jury he knows the Klan hates blacks, but ``in  
America we have the right to hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Greg Goad said Black has every right to freedom of  
speech. ``What is different here is that nobody has the right to 
intimidate others,'' Goad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Rick Clark of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office testified  
that while he was monitoring the rally in August 1998, a black 
family drove up, saw the burning cross and drove away quickly. 
``They appeared to be upset,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A white woman who lives next to the pasture where the rally was  
held testified the sight of a flaming 25-foot cross frightened her. 
She said a Klan member speaking over a public address system 
advocated the shooting of blacks and Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Goad said Black indicated his intent to intimidate to a deputy  
on the way to jail. ``Mr. Black said, `When is the white man going 
to stand up to the blacks and Mexicans in this neighborhood?''' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent of the 26,000 residents of Carroll County in  
the mountains of southwestern Virginia are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Before trial, Baugh said he found the KKK's views offensive but  
took the Klan leader on as a client because ``we cannot afford any 
erosion of the First Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> Congressmen Urge 1972 Games Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new confession to a decades-old terrorist  
assault is stirring activity on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers 
want to encourage arrest of a mastermind of the deadly 
hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, and Jim Saxton, R-N.J., are  
collecting signatures on a letter urging President Clinton 
``demand'' that Jordan's king honor an Interpol arrest warrant and 
``immediately turn over'' former Palestinian guerrilla Mohammed 
Oudeh for prosecution in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In his autobiography published last month, Oudeh, better known  
by the code name Abu Daoud, acknowledged a role in the plan to take 
Israeli weightlifters hostage in order to dramatize the plight of 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the book came out, Germany has issued an arrest warrant,  
which Palestinian officials are trying to have rescinded; Israel 
has banned Oudeh from returning to his West Bank home; and France 
has turned Oudeh away at its doors. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourette and Saxton, chairman of the House Task Force on  
Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, became involved because an 
American was one of the 17 people killed in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	David Berger of Shaker Heights, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, held  
dual American and Israeli citizenship, but lived in the U.S. until 
1970, when he moved to Israel and made the Israeli weightlifting 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be reprehensible for the United States to turn its  
back and refuse to do all within its power to see that the assassin 
of an American citizen is brought to justice,'' the lawmakers say 
in their letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger's parents still live in Shaker Heights and attend a  
synagogue in LaTourette's district. They and the congressman were 
alerted about the published confession by the Zionist Organization 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Village raid led to a 20-hour hostage standoff, a  
bungled rescue attempt and 17 deaths. Two Israeli athletes were 
killed in the village. Nine others, including Berger, died during 
the attempted rescue at Munich's airport. A German policeman and 
five Palestinians also died. 
</P>
<P>
	Oudeh was arrested in France in 1977 then expelled to Algeria.  
Since then, he has lived in exile in Lebanon, Jordan, Eastern 
Europe and the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Radar Problems Surfacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Power outages, faulty computers and software  
glitches have caused at least six serious air traffic control 
outages from New York to Seattle since January. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, passengers have been stranded overnight at  
airports, as happened to 100 travelers in Minneapolis earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, in Philadelphia in May, controllers lost  
radio communication with six planes, leaving one to say, ``Helpless 
is a pretty good description.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government says a $13 billion upgrade of the nation's air  
traffic control system now under way should reduce problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The work includes replacing work stations at en route centers,  
which control airplanes during the cruise portion of their flight. 
The Federal Aviation Administration also is replacing radar scopes 
and upgrading software at centers controlling planes within 50 
miles of an airport. The overhaul will not be completed until 2005 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new computer systems and work stations will be more  
reliable and easier to maintain and upgrade than the current 
systems,'' said FAA spokesman William Shumann. 
</P>
<P>
	After an outage in Chicago on May 5, the union that maintains  
the FAA's equipment had a bleaker assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outage highlights the fact that the systems are  
deteriorating,'' said Tom Demske, a regional vice president for the 
Professional Airways Systems Specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis on Tuesday, radar scopes continued to show the  
position of an airplane, but they did not show the normal 
accompanying data, such as an aircraft's flight number and its 
airspeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers responded by cutting the number of flights landing  
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from 60 per hour 
to as few as 28. That caused the delay or cancellation of more than 
100 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumann said an investigation was under way, but preliminary  
information indicated there may have been a problem with connectors 
in the radar system as workers moved equipment from a smaller 
control room into a new, larger one. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 17, a faulty computer processor caused the control tower  
at Philadelphia International Airport to lose part of its 
jet-tracking data up to a dozen times. That caused a temporary halt 
to incoming and outgoing flights. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 6, computer problems at the air traffic control center in  
Ronkonkoma, N.Y., on Long Island caused delays at the airports in 
New York, Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Philadelphia tower lost radio contact with  
six planes in the middle of the night after a human error during a 
test of a new generator. A backup didn't turn on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on May 5, United Airlines had to cancel 25 percent of its  
afternoon flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
after software the FAA had installed at its regional air traffic 
control center in Elgin, Ill., started to display only partial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had to revert to older software that was reliable but  
not certified to handle the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The year started on an ominous note, when a power outage at the  
FAA's regional center in Auburn, Wash., on Jan. 15 disrupted air 
travel throughout the Pacific Northwest and delayed flights for 
about 8,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, a backup generator did not work as planned.  
</P>
<P>
	Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the National Air  
Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing 
controllers, said the problems highlight the existing system's 
Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is real susceptible to outside interference, power  
outages, traffic from other radio frequencies,'' Schwitz said.

<HEADLINE> 'Artist' Wins Copyright Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Artist formerly known as Prince has won a  
lengthy copyright infringement case surrounding his symbol-shaped 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer last week found no  
merit in the fraud and copyright infringement claims filed by 
guitar designer Ferdinand Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickett said he created the guitar -- which incorporates the  
symbols for man and woman -- in 1993 and showed it to the musician, 
hoping he would buy it. The Artist denied ever meeting Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickett sued for fraud in 1994 after learning the Artist was  
performing with a similarly shaped instrument. He amended the 
lawsuit in 1996 to charge copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Artist first used the symbol in the early 1990s and in 1992  
dropped his name in favor of using the symbol to identify himself.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Offer 'E-Contract' Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans have introduced an  
``e-contract'' agenda aimed at promoting the growth of American 
high tech industries through measures to reduce government taxes 
and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe a cutting edge society needs a cutting edge  
agenda,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Wednesday. '' We 
had the Contract with America to address a broad range of concerns. 
And we think we need a contract that specifically addresses the 
concerns of high-tech America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agenda includes tax cuts that promote investment and  
research, modernizing the education system, preventing frivolous 
lawsuits, removing barriers to Internet commerce, promoting high 
speed Internet access, protecting intellectual property rights and 
reining in excessive federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commitment to high technology begins with the notion that  
Congress must first do no harm,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. ``It is largely thanks 
to the absence of government interference that new technologies 
have been able to prosper and benefit us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri discounted the  
package, saying it was motivated by the GOP desire to win a bigger 
share of the high tech industry's political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology business leaders don't want e-pandering; they want  
a real e-policy which will promote the growth of e-commerce and 
make sure this sector will continue its leadership in our domestic 
and the global economy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NYC's Giuliani Walks Out on Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peppered with questions about a canceled  
magazine party at the Brooklyn Navy Yard that might have included 
his potential U.S. Senate rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani stonewalled, chided and, finally, walked out on 
the City Hall press. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap ensued when Deputy Mayor Randy Levine admitted Tuesday  
the glitzy August launch party for the new Talk magazine was 
canceled in part because Mrs. Clinton was being considered for the 
first cover and there was speculation she might be invited to the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	When first asked about the cancellation at the one time he was  
available to meet with the press on Wednesday, Giuliani said, 
``Talk to the Navy Yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Navy Yard would have treated me the same way,''  
the mayor said, adding, ``I don't think this is an issue of 
discrimination against somebody from Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pushed further on who made the decision, officials of the  
city-owned Navy Yard or his political operatives, the mayor said he 
was sure it was a joint decision and that he personally didn't care 
one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's pique began showing after the eighth straight  
question and was in full bloom by the ninth when he said: ``I 
imagine there must be something else going on in the life of this 
city that you'd like to ask about. Or have we gotten to the point 
of ultimate frivolity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the questions continued, an exasperated Giuliani said,  
``No, no, no. We have exhausted the subject. If there are no more 
questions about another subject, then I can go back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A television reporter obliged, asking him about a Jewish  
organization's plans to give Mrs. Clinton an award. ``Are they 
going to have that ceremony at the Navy Yard?'' the mayor jokingly 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Told it was happening in Washington, the mayor said, ``Oh, OK,  
well as long as it's not at the Navy Yard, I'll have no comment on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with the press was suddenly over.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you,'' the mayor muttered and left.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines officials and federal  
investigators hope a review of the airline's safety and training 
programs can shed light on why American has had more crashes than 
any other U.S. air carrier in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based American has suffered two crashes since  
1993 that killed a total of 171 people. Four other crashes damaged 
planes but caused only minor injuries, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, a slightly larger carrier with a  
comparable schedule, has had one fatal crash this decade, according 
to federal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be turning the place inside out, trying to  
find anything that will improve our performance,'' Robert Baker, 
American vice president for operations, told The Dallas Morning 
News in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if there were a magic bullet, I think we would have seen  
it a long time ago. We would have found glaring errors or 
omissions,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials, along with outside consultants and experts  
from the Federal Aviation Administration, plan to review safety and 
training programs. The FAA said it plans similar evaluations for 
all airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to look at American and see what these events are  
telling us,'' said Margaret Gilligan, the FAA's deputy associate 
administrator for regulation and certification. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it will focus on whether American's corporate  
culture and its bitter disputes with its pilots' union are in any 
way affecting safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation experts said American's problems don't necessarily mean  
the airline is more dangerous than others. When compared with the 
rest of the industry and number of miles flown over the last 15 
years, American's safety record remains among the best. 
</P>
<P>
	But American officials and outside experts agree that the string  
of accidents since 1993 is something the airline should worry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be irresponsible not to step back and see whether  
your accident prevention program was working,'' said C.O. Miller, 
who headed the National Transportation Safety Board's Bureau of 
Safety during much of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Family Collects Cow After 311 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A bunch of out-of-towners who think  
New Rochelle owes them something forced the city to round up an 
innocent farm animal to honor a 311-year-old real estate deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's the beef?'' William Rodman Pell III said Thursday  
before Mayor Timothy Idoni handed over a 6-month-old Holstein named 
Jessie, this year's payment on a never-ending debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pell is a descendant of Sir John Pell, Lord of the Manor of  
Pelham. Sir John sold 6,000 acres of his holdings in 1688 to French 
Huguenots who had escaped religious persecution. The parcel became 
New Rochelle, now a New York City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir John received the equivalent of $11,625 and was promised  
``one fatt calfe on every fouer and twentieth day of June yearly 
and every year forever, if demanded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are somewhat legally obligated,'' said Idoni.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor and various Pell descendants turned the occasion into  
a party and family reunion, coinciding with the centennial of the 
city's incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The cow-claiming ceremony was followed by a luncheon for 60  
relatives at the Bartow-Pell mansion, also named for the family, in 
the Bronx. Pells, including former Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode 
Island, came from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pells were major landowners in precolonial days, and the  
Manor of Pelham stretched from City Island, now in the Bronx, 
across a large portion of Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor told the assembled Pells that in selling New Rochelle,  
they had pretty much given away an asset now worth about $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``fatt calfe'' provision was ignored for centuries as New  
Rochelle grew from a rural outpost to a city of nearly 70,000. But 
in 1952, the Rev. Walden Pell, headmaster of a school for boys in 
Delaware, got word of the family rights and figured he could add to 
the school's herd of dairy cows. 
</P>
<P>
	So he put in the claim, which the city ignored until publicity  
forced its hand and a ritual was born. The calf has also been 
claimed in 1956 and 1988 and at least once was turned over in the 
form of a roast beef dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is wonderful,'' said Claiborne Pell. ``We don't have  
enough traditions of this sort, traditions handed down from the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As in the past, some of the Pells were not sure the payment was  
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The calf is very handsome, but I'm not sure it's fat,'' said  
Mary Leigh Pell Whitmer of Fairfield, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pell children who thought Jessie was unbearably cute were  
glad to learn she was borrowed for the day from a farm and would be 
nobody's roast beef dinner.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Bids $1.5B for Newsquest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British regional newspaper group Newsquest PLC  
said Thursday that U.S. media company Gannett Co. had made a 
``serious and fair'' buyout offer of about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsquest, which owns 63 daily and weekly newspapers across  
Britain, stopped short of urging shareholders to accept, however. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Newsquest board said it believed ``the offer  
does not represent such a compelling proposal that it could give an 
outright recommendation to shareholders that it is absolutely in 
their best interests to accept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the offer has already been approved by shareholders  
owning 51.7 percent of the group, including Newsquest executive 
directors. Two investment groups, KKR and Cinven, are major 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the offer, Gannett valued Newsquest shares at about $7.40,  
compared with Wednesday's close of $6.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Several foreign companies have significant publishing holdings  
in the United States although American company holdings of overseas 
publishers are more rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the big foreign players here are Australia's News Corp.,  
which owns the Fox Network and the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Bertelsmann owns the book publisher Random House and  
the magazines McCall's and Family Circle. Its entertainment arm 
owns numerous record labels including Arista and RCA. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett owns USA Today and 73 other American daily newspapers  
with a daily circulation of more than 6.7 million, as well as USA 
Weekend and 21 TV stations, and also cable television systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsquest's publications including major regional newspapers,  
including the Northern Echo, based in Darlington, north England, 
the Oxford Mail, the Evening Argus in Brighton, south England, and 
Westmoreland Gazette, in the Lake District in north England. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsquest had a pretax profit of $204.3 million last year on  
sales of $483.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gannett is a major media company and the prospect of Newsquest  
becoming part of Gannett represents a great opportunity for 
Newsquest and its employees,'' Newsquest executive chairman James 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett President Douglas H. McCorkindale said Newsquest was the  
``right opportunity to expand our international operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acceptance from 51.7 percent of shareholders is irrevocable  
unless a rival bidder offers more than $7.82 per share within seven 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said a counterbid was highly unlikely as since March the  
company had ``covered many possible buyers and at the end of the 
day Gannett offered the best price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsquest, which has 5,000 employees, will keep its name and  
existing management, the announcement said.

<HEADLINE> CMGI May Buy Compaq's AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frustrated in its bid to forge an Internet  
identity through Lycos, an emerging online power is now eyeing 
AltaVista as a flagship for its stable of little-known Web 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI Inc., which holds a stake in nearly 40 Internet businesses  
including Lycos, confirmed Thursday it has been talking with Compaq 
Computer Corp. about buying a controlling interest in AltaVista, a 
Lycos rival that offers an array of services and a portal to other 
Web destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, which came two days after the talks were  
disclosed by columnist Dan Dorfman on the JagNotes investment Web 
site, also said CMGI and Compaq might form a strategic alliance, 
suggesting that Compaq intends to retain a stake in AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., declined to provide more details  
or to comment on a report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal 
saying talks to buy the remainder of Lycos had unraveled due to a 
personality clash among top management. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of that friction, of course, might be that it was  
CMGI, with an 18 percent interest in Lycos, which recently scuttled 
Lycos' merger agreement with USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite its considerable muscle, which includes the wallop  
of minority backers Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., CMGI finds 
itself lacking an established lightning rod to draw visitors and 
direct them to other corners of its far-flung online empire. CMGI's 
holdings include stakes in Ancestry.com, CarParts.com, 
Furniture.com and Raging Bull, a financial investment forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what these deals are about is acquiring technology and  
money and ad revenues and Internet channels,'' said Jack Staff, 
chief economist for Zona Research. ``But the deals are also about 
acquiring highly specialized technical people in one fell swoop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But although Compaq may provide a friendlier partner for CMGI  
than Lycos, AltaVista might not provide an Internet hub quite as 
effective as Lycos would. 
</P>
<P>
	While considered by many a superior search tool with which to  
navigate the Web, AltaVista hasn't enjoyed the huge popularity of 
fellow Web portals Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three made their names by helping people sift through an  
ever-exploding number of Web sites for specific information or 
topics of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, however, those companies realized that the hordes  
of people passing through every day on the way to other Internet 
destinations might be valuable to advertisers if their visitors 
stuck around longer. 
</P>
<P>
	So to persuade people to stay, Yahoo! and the others have juiced  
up their Web sites with news, shopping, entertainment, free e-mail 
and chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The results speak for themselves. According to the latest  
rankings from Media Metrix, Yahoo! was the most popular Web site in 
May with 31.1 million visitors. Including affiliated sites, Yahoo! 
placed third after America Online Inc. and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast the Excite.com Web site placed eighth with 15.1  
million visitors in May, followed by Lycos.com with 14.9 million. 
AltaVista's Web site placed only 15th with 9.5 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	For Compaq, which issued a terse statement confirming the talks,  
a deal with CMGI would mark a sharp change of course for the 
computer maker, whose fortunes have spiraled downward since last 
year's acquisition of Digital Equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based company is now trying to chart a new direction  
after a rocky few months dominated by weak profits, layoff 
announcments and the ouster of top management. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past five months alone, Compaq has announced plans to  
spin off AltaVista through a public stock sale and spent more than 
$500 million to buy online retailer Shopping.com and Zip2, an 
online guide to different cities. Both purchases were folded into 
AltaVista and would likely be included in any deal with CMGI.

<HEADLINE> Fans Rush Gates at Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Police from several northern New  
Jersey towns converged on a hip-hop concert at the Meadowlands 
sports complex Thursday night to quell a disturbance by people who 
weren't allowed into the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Some concertgoers said fans without tickets rushed the gates at  
the Continental Airlines Arena, prompting security to shut the 
gates and bar anyone, even ticket holders, from entering. 
Authorities said those kept out didn't have tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police reported a few minor injuries but did not have  
information on arrests late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sold-out event at the arena featured Busta Rhymes, Missy  
Elliott, Q-Tip and Nas Escobar. The sports authority said 16,000 
people attended the concert, which was not canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people who didn't have tickets tried to get inside the  
gates, and they knocked over a fence and tried to get past some 
event people,'' said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey 
Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the complex. ``So the 
State Police shut it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raheem Abdulah of Newark said people crowded the gate to show  
their tickets, but were yelled at by State Police and told to back 
up. He estimated the crowd at the gate to be at least 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police said the situation was brought under control, but  
many officers and troopers remained on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Police departments from several northern New Jersey towns  
assisted State Police and New Jersey Transit Police.

<HEADLINE>  NASA To Use Female Space Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command a space  
shuttle mission, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, sees her flight 
next month as ``a great challenge'' in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being NASA's first female space commander, she has to  
make sure the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is delivered 
safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' she said during 
a break in countdown practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the 42-year-old Collins boarded Columbia for the  
final portion of the simulated countdown and, in doing so, became 
the first woman to take the commander's left front seat of a space 
shuttle. She has flown twice in space before, both times in the 
right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be the first woman to have the opportunity to  
command the shuttle. I don't really think about that on a 
day-to-day basis because I really don't need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying NASA's oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission originally was scheduled for last summer, but was  
postponed repeatedly because of problems with the telescope. NASA 
has yet to formally clear Chandra for launch because of the Air 
Force's ongoing investigation into the April failure of an 
upper-stage motor on a military satellite; Chandra has a similar 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Columbia takes off July 20 as planned, it will be 30 years to  
the day that man first landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a neat feeling to know that we're going to  
be part of that history and continuing on with the space program 
the way we are,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Softbank, Yahoo Plan Toys on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Softbank Corp. and Yahoo Japan Corp. will join six  
toy companies to sell toys over the Internet, the companies said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint-venture company, E-shopping! Toys Corp., will be  
established in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank will have a 52.5 percent stake in the venture, which  
will have capital of 200 million yen ($1.6 million). The second 
biggest partner, Japanese toy wholesaler Happinet Corp., will hold 
a 17.5 percent stake. Bandai Corp., the maker of Tamagotchi toys, 
also will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture is the second in recent weeks for Softbank that  
focuses on computer commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Softbank and Seven-Eleven Japan Co.  
announced they will form a joint venture to sell books online in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet toy venture also involve Seven-Eleven Japan. In  
both businesses, Seven-Eleven will take payments for orders from 
customers who prefer not to use credit cards online. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the convenience store is designed to overcome problems  
that have kept computer commerce from becoming popular in Japan: 
the low level of credit card use and concerns about security. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Softbank President Masayoshi Son confirmed that his  
company will establish a 230 billion yen ($1.89 billion) venture 
capital fund to invest in Internet start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 95 percent of the fund will be invested in U.S.  
companies, with the balance in Japanese firms. Softbank itself will 
supply 90 billion yen ($738 million) of the venture capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank, a software wholesaler and computer-magazine publisher,  
has become increasingly involved in Internet businesses.

<HEADLINE> Snyder Spinning Off Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marketing company Snyder Communications Inc.  
is spinning off its health care services business into a new 
publicly traded corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, Snyder Healthcare Services Inc., will be one of  
the world's largest providers of marketing services to 
pharmaceutical and medical companies, company officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Its customers include Abbott Laboratories, Bausch &AMP; Lomb,  
Baxter, Bayer, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, 
Merck, Pfizer and Upjohn. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was made to create two independent businesses and  
dissipate confusion in investors' minds, said Daniel Snyder, 
chairman and chief executive of Snyder Communications and also the 
new owner of the Washington Redskins NFL team. ``This confusion is 
now removed completely,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder Communications, based in Bethesda, Md., earned $22.8  
million last year on revenue of $815 million and has 9,400 
employees. Daniel Snyder founded the company in 1988 and took it 
public in 1996. It has grown in recent years through mergers with 
media and marketing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which sells market research and advertising  
campaigns tailored to specific audiences, has a roster of big 
clients including Bell Atlantic, British Telecom, Fleet Financial 
Group, GTE, IBM, McDonald's, Proctor &AMP; Gamble and Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
	As a subsidiary, Snyder Healthcare Services had revenue of  
$321.5 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan announced Wednesday, the separate Snyder  
Healthcare Services will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market while 
Snyder Communications shares will continue to trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Eran Broshy, a partner in the Boston Consulting Group, was named  
chief executive officer of Snyder Healthcare Services. Daniel 
Snyder will remain as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's $800 million offer to buy the Redskins was approved  
last month by the National Football League owners.

<HEADLINE> Help Wanted Advertising Rose in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Help-wanted advertising in major U.S. newspapers  
rose in May, and the nation's unemployment rate -- already at a 
nearly 70-year low -- could drop even farther this summer, according 
to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business research group, said  
its monthly help-wanted advertising index climbed to 89 last month. 
That is up two points from 87 in April, although it is below its 
reading of 91 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is used as a non-governmental gauge of changes in  
local, regional and national job supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Job growth slowed to a crawl in May,'' said Kenneth Goldstein,  
the Conference Board's economist. A net of 11,000 jobs were created 
in May, down sharply from 345,000 in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein expects job growth to stabilize at about 250,000 per  
month for the next several months. That could bring the nation's 
unemployment rate of 4.2 percent ``down to 4 percent, perhaps by 
Labor Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fom March through May, help-wanted advertising fell in seven  
regions and rose in two. The biggest increase was in New England, 
up 20.8 percent. The steepest declines took place in the Mountain 
region, which includes Colorado, Arizona and Utah, down 10 percent; 
and East North Central region, including Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, 
Indiana and Wisconsin, down 9.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
employment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Wins NHL MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr won the NHL's most valuable player  
award and Wayne Gretzky added to his trophy collection at the 
league's annual awards banquet tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The league scoring champion with 127 points, including 44 goals,  
Jagr edged out Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek and Ottawa center 
Alexei Yashin in voting by members of the Professional Hockey 
Writers' Association for the Hart Memorial Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Jagr was named MVP in balloting by the players,  
receiving the Lester B. Pearson award. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very special to me,'' Jagr said after accepting the  
Pearson award. ``It's a trophy voted on by the players -- the 
players you play against, the players you face every night. That's 
why it's special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr won out over Hasek, Yashin, Anaheim's Teemu Selanne and  
Toronto's Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Czech also received his third Art Ross Trophy as  
the NHL's scoring champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky won the Lady Byng Trophy as the NHL's most gentlemanly  
player for the fifth time. It was the last league award for 
Gretzky, 38, who will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 
the autumn after announcing his retirement from the New York 
Rangers after 20 NHL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect this,'' said Gretzky, who received a standing  
ovation from the more than 6,000 at the Air Canada Centre. ``I feel 
so young maybe I can come back and play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al MacInnis of the St. Louis Blues won the James Norris Memorial  
Trophy as best defenseman in a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek won the Vezina Trophy as top goalie in the eyes of the  
league's general managers for the third straight year and fifth 
time in six years. It was close. Curtis Joseph of the Toronto Maple 
Leafs got the most first-place votes, 10 to Hasek's eight, but 
Hasek had more total points. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Martin of the Ottawa Senators won coach of the year  
honors, besting Toronto's Pat Quinn and Dallas' Ken Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Drury of the Colorado Avalanche was an overwhelming pick  
for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in voting by the PHWA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen of the Dallas Stars won the Frank J. Selke Trophy  
as top defensive forward for the second year in a row in a PHWA 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cullen, who bested cancer to resume his playing career,  
then moved behind the Tampa Bay bench as an assistant coach, won 
the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and 
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Ray of the Sabres won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for  
humanitarian contributions to his community. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Maurice Richard Trophy for most goals was presented by  
The Rocket himself to Anaheim's Teemu Selanne, who scored 47 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goaltenders Ed Belfour and Roman Turek won the William M.  
Jennings Trophy for posting the lowest goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	The league also announced its all-star teams.  
</P>
<P>
	First team: Hasek in goal, MacInnis and Detroit's Nicklas  
Lidstrom on defense, and Colorado's Peter Forsberg between Jagr and 
Anaheim's Paul Kariya up front. 
</P>
<P>
	Second team: Boston's Byron Dafoe in goal, the Bruins' Ray  
Bourque and Philadelphia's Eric Desjardins on defense, and Yashin, 
Philadelphia's John LeClair and Selanne up front.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Review Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- U.S. aircraft maker Boeing Co. wants  
a review of Philippine Airlines' financial rehabilitation plan, 
saying its claim of $128.5 million was not addressed in the 
recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition today to Manila's Securities and Exchange  
Commission, Seattle-based Boeing said the airline's plan makes no 
provision for settling the cancellation of an order for eight 
747-400 jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight jets were part of an order of 12 Boeing 747-400s  
placed by PAL -- along with an order for 24 Airbus jets -- under a $4 
billion fleet modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline bought only four Boeing jets, which are used on its  
long-haul flights, and canceled the other eight orders because of 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing contends the airline breached the purchase agreement. The  
$128.5 million claim covers the cancellation of the eight jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing called on the SEC to have its claim included in the  
rehabilitation plan, which was approved by a slim majority of 
creditors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine Airlines is mired in $2.2 billion in debts owed  
mostly to U.S. and European creditors.

<HEADLINE> Great Western Forum Is Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Great Western Forum, which loses  
its two major tenants when the NBA's Lakers and NHL's Kings move to 
the Staples Center this fall, has been sold to the owners of the 
new downtown Los Angeles arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The L.A. Arena Co., a partnership that includes majority owner  
Philip Anschutz and the Fox Group, will assume responsibility for 
management and operation of the Forum upon completion of the sale, 
expected July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed. The Los Angeles Times,  
citing unidentified sources, reported Thursday that the deal was 
worth $25 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forum has been the home of the Kings and Lakers since  
opening on Dec. 30, 1967, but both teams will play at the Staples 
Center for their 1999-2000 seasons. They will share the arena with 
the Clippers, who are leaving the old Sports Arena in Exposition 
Park next to Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent hundreds of enjoyable hours there, rooting for the  
Lakers, the Kings and the Sparks as well as attending fights and 
concerts and so many other events,'' said Jerry Buss, owner of the 
Lakers and California Sports, which manages the Forum. ``It has 
been a lot of fun owning this great facility, and I think it is 
still great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Center officials said there were no plans to modify the  
Forum's current schedule of events, which includes the WNBA's 
Sparks regular season and the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey 
Circus on Aug. 4-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss bought the Forum in 1979 along with the Lakers and Kings  
for $67.5 million. The arena has bee the setting for numerous 
sporting events and concerts, and was the basketball venue during 
the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Staples Center, which is still under construction, is  
costing $350 million to build and will host the 2000 Democratic 
National Convention.

<HEADLINE> Out-of-Court Deal Ends Court's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday backed out of  
deciding a New York City case that asked whether people who are not 
U.S. citizens are protected by an anti-discrimination federal law 
on the right to enter into contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, who had granted review to the case in April and  
had been expected to decide it sometime in 2000, were notified the 
two sides had agreed to settle their dispute out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a labor union officer who was ousted from his  
job after it was discovered that he is a legal alien, not a U.S. 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Linden Anderson, a citizen of Jamaica who has lived and worked  
in this country since 1968, was elected in 1992 as business 
representative of a local chapter of the United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters and Joiners. 
</P>
<P>
	He was removed from that post in 1994 when the union's  
court-appointed overseer learned he is not a citizen. The union's 
constitution required officers to be citizens of the country in 
which the local was located. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson sued the union, accusing it of illegal discrimination.  
A federal judge threw out his case, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals reinstated it. The appeals court said an 1866 federal 
law bars the government from discriminating against non-citizens' 
contractual rights, and a 1991 law extends that protection to 
discrimination by private parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners vs.  
Anderson, 98-958.

<HEADLINE>  Peacekeepers Encounter Rogue Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 7,000-strong U.S. peacekeeping force will be  
fully deployed in Kosovo by late July, the commander of American 
forces patrolling the Serb province says. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, there were about 4,500 American troops there,  
said Army Brig. Gen. John Craddock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to danger from land mines and unexploded NATO bombs,  
the peacekeepers are beginning to encounter ``rogue elements'' 
among both Serbs and ethnic Albanians, Craddock told reporters at 
the Pentagon in a telephone interview from his headquarters near 
Urosevac in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview, the Army's new chief of staff, Gen.  
Eric K. Shinseki, said the risk of casualties in Kosovo is high. In 
a previous assignment, he commanded the NATO-led peacekeeping force 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``In places like Kosovo and Bosnia it's a requirement for us to  
pay attention to -- because of the kinds of risks that are there -- 
the safety of our soldiers,'' Shinseki said. He said the local 
population presents security risks because ``for them the war is 
fairly recent, fairly fresh, fairly emotional.''

<P>
	Shortly before Craddock spoke, a group of U.S. Marines was fired  
upon from a building near a Marine checkpoint. The Marines returned 
fire, surrounded the building and persuaded the assailants to 
surrender. Craddock said it was the second time this week that U.S. 
troops in Kosovo had been fired upon. The first involved U.S. Army 
soldiers; in neither incident were any Americans injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Craddock initially reported that two of the people who fired at  
the Marines were killed by return fire, but Pentagon officials 
later said one had been killed and two were wounded. The assailants 
were dressed in civilian clothes, but a NATO spokesman in Pristina, 
Jan Joosten, confirmed today that the attackers were Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have become the targets of violent acts,'' Craddock said.  
</P>
<P>
	Craddock said this was the kind of problem that he and NATO  
commanders had expected to encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next challenge is a rogue element that either does not  
know or refuses to acknowledge the fact that agreements have been 
made'' on ending the violence in Kosovo and demilitarizing the 
Kosovo Liberation Army, Craddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the peacekeeping operation gears up, the Air Force is winding  
down its involvement in the Balkans. The first of 11 B-52 bombers 
flew back to the United States on Wednesday from Fairford, England, 
where they had been based as they flew missions against Yugoslavia 
throughout the NATO air campaign. In all, the Pentagon is sending 
back nearly 400 aircraft no longer needed now that the war is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4,500 U.S. Army soldiers and Marines in Kosovo on Wednesday  
will be augmented by June 27 with a mechanized infantry battalion 
from the Army's 1st Infantry Division, the ``Big Red One,'' and by 
July 4 with a Polish parachute battalion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are part of a 50,000-strong peacekeeping force  
commanded by NATO and charged with pacifying the area so that 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees can return to 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1st Infantry Division tank battalion will arrive in mid-July  
to mark officially the handover of U.S. peacekeeping 
responsibilities from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Craddock 
said. By the third week in July, the full complement of American 
peacekeepers should be in place in the U.S. sector, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers' aim, he said, is to provide ``reassurance to  
all the people in the area here that we are here to maintain law 
and order.''

<HEADLINE>  Peacekeepers Encounter Rogue Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 7,000-strong U.S. peacekeeping force will be  
fully deployed in Kosovo by late July, the commander of American 
forces patrolling the Serb province says. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, there were about 4,500 American troops there,  
said Army Brig. Gen. John Craddock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to danger from land mines and unexploded NATO bombs,  
the peacekeepers are beginning to encounter ``rogue elements'' 
among both Serbs and ethnic Albanians, Craddock told reporters at 
the Pentagon in a telephone interview from his headquarters near 
Urosevac in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview, the Army's new chief of staff, Gen.  
Eric K. Shinseki, said the risk of casualties in Kosovo is high. In 
a previous assignment, he commanded the NATO-led peacekeeping force 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``In places like Kosovo and Bosnia it's a requirement for us to  
pay attention to -- because of the kinds of risks that are there -- 
the safety of our soldiers,'' Shinseki said. He said the local 
population presents security risks because ``for them the war is 
fairly recent, fairly fresh, fairly emotional.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Weather News Hurts Grains, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell in trading  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for more 
favorable Midwest weather. 
</P>
<P>
	July soybean futures plummeted 13 cents a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters, who had been calling for unusually hot temperatures  
next week, now say that a high-pressure ridge in the Midwest has 
weakened. Updated forecasts called for scattered showers, which 
would be beneficial for crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and spring wheat had risen in Wednesday's trading due to  
trader concern that hot, dry weather would damage newly planted 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures closed slightly lower Thursday, following the  
trend in corn and soybeans. Concern over the U.S. hard red winter 
wheat crop provided some support, limiting losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.50 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.12 1/2 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 13 cents to $4.52 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.32 cent to 63.15 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.43 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 2.00 cents to 50.70 cents a pound; and August pork 
bellies fell 1.25 cent to 43.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Becker Knocks Out Seeded Kiefer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Boris Becker knows he doesn't own  
Wimbledon anymore. That doesn't mean he won't ask Pete Sampras for 
his keys back. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Wimbledon champion Becker, who made the All England  
Club seem like his own private establishment before five-time 
titlist Sampras came along, shrugged off the distractions of 
semiretirement on Thursday to charge into the third round of this 
year's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He did it with a straight-set triumph over 15th-seeded Nicolas  
Kiefer, a fellow German Becker has barely spoken to since they 
clashed in a Davis Cup dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A full house on Centre Court saw some vintage Becker, powering  
sledge-hammer serves and punching away volleys. The only thing they 
didn't get from the 31-year-old star, who first won Wimbledon at 
age 17 in 1985, was one of his trademark sprawling dives across the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like I won the tournament, but unfortunately it  
was only the second round,'' Becker said after his 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 
victory over Kiefer. ``It was a great feeling to be back on Centre 
Court, and it brought the best out of me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't played for a long time on it and to be able to come  
back after my first round to play perfect grass court tennis was 
very pleasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his return to Wimbledon after two years, Becker came back  
from two sets down in his first-round match against Britain's Miles 
Maclagan to win in five. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Becker said he'd played his last Wimbledon. Now  
he says this is definitely his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the first round was much more than just a tennis  
match and, once I got that over with, I was very much as ease with 
myself and more relaxed today and, especially on Centre Court, 
which is my favorite court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that this is my place anymore. I used to own it,  
but Pete Sampras had taken over the keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker meets Australian teen-ager Lleyton Hewitt for a place in  
the last 16, and the 18-year-old rising star is delighted to share 
the stage with one of the biggest names in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be great. I suppose I'll get one of the big show  
courts now,'' Hewitt said after his 6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 victory over 
Karim Alami of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously playing great tennis to beat Kiefer in straight  
sets, and it's just a big thrill for me to be out there with Boris 
Becker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from serving eight double-faults, Becker made few mistakes  
on the court he used to call his ``living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer had three break points in the match, but Becker saved all  
three with aces. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time champion broke a 21-year-old opponent once  
considered his protege in the third game of the match, and Kiefer 
had to save three break points in his next service game to keep it 
at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-4, Becker found himself 0-30 down, but won the next four  
points to take the set. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker broke again in the third and seventh games of the second  
set. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker broke Kiefer in the fifth game of the third set, served  
two love games and, although Kiefer saved two match points, Becker 
earned a place in the third round when Kiefer hit a backhand return 
wide.

	Latest developments concerning Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	--The U.S. government puts up a $5 million reward for help in  
arresting and convicting anyone wanted by the U.N. war crimes 
tribunal for the Balkans. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is 
among those indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the Kosovo city of Pec, fires level Serb homes and much of  
the city's Gypsy quarter. Local Serbs blame ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Yugoslav parliament rescinds the state of war it declared  
after NATO bombing began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	--Deployment of 3,600 Russian peacekeepers is expected to begin  
as early as Friday alongside American, German and French soldiers. 
NATO's top civilian leader predicts coordination with the Russians 
will be as successful as it has been in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Aid officials say the West will have to feed Kosovo this summer  
and on into the winter because the devastation and disruption of 
war have left the region unable to help itself. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ethnic Albanians thronged NATO's civilian and military leaders  
in Kosovo's capital of Pristina, welcoming them with cheers and 
tears of gratitude for the 78-day bombing campaign that forced out 
Yugoslav troops.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Take Iowa Poll Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Dan Quayle is lining up Indiana college  
students for an Iowa ``poll the nation will see.'' Lamar 
Alexander's camp says the straw poll could be the ``last 
opportunity'' for his struggling campaign. George W. Bush has 
enlisted interest groups to bus in backers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12,000 or so activists who show up for the Iowa Republican  
straw poll Aug. 14 won't pick any delegates, but they could well 
narrow the field of serious candidates for the party's presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will give some structure to the field, deciding who is a  
contender and who is a pretender,'' said Brian Kennedy, who runs 
former Tennessee Gov. Alexander's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a do-or-die event for some candidates,'' said  
Greg Mueller, a consultant allied with publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengths candidates are going to are detailed in campaign  
memos leaked by rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. Bush is tapping various trade organizations to bring  
in Iowans to increase his showing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to students at Huntington College in Indiana, a Quayle  
supporter offers students from the former vice president's home 
state free travel to Ames, Iowa, 500 miles away, for the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``All presidential candidates will be there and the Quayles want  
you to be there also to show our support,'' says the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Iowans can vote, however, and state GOP executive director  
Dee Stewart said all IDs will be checked. Quayle spokesman Jonathan 
Baron said students would come as volunteer organizers, not voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Rodgers, a major Alexander supporter, sent out a  
fund-raising letter saying the campaign needs $1 million ``by the 
end of this month'' to compete in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last opportunity we will have to give Lamar a  
chance to prove a lot of people wrong,'' Rodgers wrote on campaign 
letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
	With a large and unruly field seeking the GOP nomination,  
there's some hunger for clarity. Those who fare poorly could find 
attention hard to get and money scarce as the contenders move 
closer to February caucuses that open the presidential nominating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaigns that finish in the top three are going to be the  
ones who are taken seriously as we move toward the caucus 
process,'' said Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The expectations game is under way, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush is high atop opinion polls and backed by much of the GOP  
establishment. But his aides initially sought to lower 
expectations, noting that rivals have been organizing in the state 
for months, if not years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush himself shattered that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a good test for our organization and it will be a  
good test for me,'' said Bush. ``I think we not only ought to 
compete, I think we ought to win the Ames straw poll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush has the most to lose,'' said Kennedy. ``He's set the bar  
at 50 percent and if he doesn't do that he's given new life to his 
competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conventional wisdom holds that Iowa's caucuses and straw  
polls demand painstakingly built organizations. If Bush wins the 
straw poll so soon after jumping in, it will be yet another sign of 
his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not lost on rivals.  
</P>
<P>
	``He clearly, basically, wants to end the race for the  
Republican nomination on Aug. 14,'' complained candidate Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	While many eyes are on Bush, others face even greater risks.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has languished in the polls, but remains credible  
because he has enlisted a cadre of talented organizers and 
convinced many he has a solid field organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of talk about what a great organization he has,  
but sooner or later it's put up or shut up,'' said Drake University 
political scientist Dennis Goldford. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for others who have been quietly  
organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are living off the land, but if they aren't able to come  
in in the top three, all of those campaigns go into cardiac 
arrest,'' Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the consequences won't be so dramatic. A similar  
straw poll in the last campaign saw Texas Sen. Phil Gramm tie 
eventual nominee Bob Dole, with no lasting damage to Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ended up being a three-day story,'' said Quayle campaign  
chairman Kyle McSlarrow. ``I view it as one step in the process.''

<HEADLINE> Labonte Looks To Keep on Rolling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bobby Labonte isn't nervous about a few  
right turns getting in the way of his recent success. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh off his second victory of the season, Labonte arrived in  
Northern California for the Save Mart/Kragen 350 on Sunday. In the 
rolling hills of the wine country, Sears Point Raceway is one of 
just two road courses on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something I'm as comfortable with as going to  
Charlotte Motor Speedway, say,'' he said. ``But it is something 
that's really neat and I enjoy doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is in the midst of his best season ever. Along with his  
two wins, he has claimed four poles. He has 12 top-10 finishes, 
including consecutive top-fives in each of his last seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	That has put him in second place in the Winston Cup point  
standings, 89 behind Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been creeping up on this thing over the past couple  
years, finishing seventh in points, sixth in points, just getting 
closer and closer,'' Labonte said. ``It just seems like things are 
clicking a little bit better right now. It's team chemistry and 
teamwork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent win came last weekend, when he beat Jeff Gordon  
by six-car lengths in the Pocono 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears Point poses a special challenge. In addition to those  
somewhat unfamiliar right turns, Labonte has just two top-10 
finishes on the road course. Last year, he had his best showing, 
placing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of notes, of course. We go back and look at  
what we did last year, and the year before, and the year before, 
then compile it all together and don't do the thing that we did 
wrong, and try to do what we did right an improve upon it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also be using a new road-course version of his Pontiac.  
The cars that have given him recent success on ovals won't be a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``A road course is awful tough,'' he said. '' I'd be pretty  
ecstatic to win on a road course, but I'll take whatever I can get. 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco to draw attention to this weekend's race,  
Labonte greeted drivers who stopped at a local gas station. An 
invited ``pit crew'' pumped gas and cleaned windows. 
</P>
<P>
	He was greeted by a small but loyal contingent of fans, who  
quickly clued into what was happening and pulled their cars into 
the station for a chance to meet Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanette Lucia had arrived from her home in Tracy, Calif., three  
hours before the event just to make sure she could meet her 
favorite driver. Labonte signed her Interstate Batteries jacket as 
she caught the moment on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote on me! He wrote on me and I got to shake his hand!''  
she exclaimed. ``I'm so excited!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was as ``pumped'' as the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's part of the deal,'' he said. ``We're awfully excited  
about what we're doing in NASCAR racing, and know that by doing 
what we're doing, we're helping the sport grow.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Readies New Prosecutor Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that  
the Justice Department will be ready to take on the job of 
appointing special prosecutors to investigate misconduct by high 
government officials when the independent counsel law expires next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the department is nearly finished crafting new rules  
it will follow in naming special investigators. ``Our regulations 
will be ready by July 1,'' she said at her weekly news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring any last-minute attempts to keep it alive, the  
independent counsel law, which spawned Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton and 20 other probes of 
high-level officials over the past two decades, will expire June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	A few lawmakers are drafting legislation to revive the law, but  
most believe the statute will be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	One key Senate Republican has urged Congress to seize some  
authority over the naming of special prosecutors by making Justice 
Department rules for their appointment, conduct and removal subject 
to the approval of Congress and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The department does not now need congressional approval to  
change its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee, said Tuesday that he plans to introduce the 
legislation in the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to comment on the proposal, Reno said she wanted to  
work with Thompson and other lawmakers ``to address the concerns 
that have been raised,'' but asserted that appointing and removing 
special prosecutors should be left to the attorney general alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general gets held responsible for it one way or  
another,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new rules crafted by the Justice Department, the attorney  
general would appoint a special prosecutor when he or she 
determines that the investigation of a top government official 
presents a conflict of interest for the department. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an outline of the new regulations submitted to a  
House subcommittee, the prosecutor would be subject to budgetary 
and investigative limitations that do not exist under the 
independent counsel law, including the following: 
</P>
<P>
	--An annual budget would be submitted for the attorney general's  
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	--A progress report would be required at the end of the first  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some indictments might need the approval of the attorney  
general. 
</P>
<P>
	--The investigation would be limited to the issue that led to the  
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the expiring independent counsel law, prosecutors had  
broad powers and no limits on how much they could spend.

<HEADLINE> Morning Is Hot New Time Slot in TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assigned to a 5:30 a.m. newscast on New York's  
WNBC-TV, anchorman Maurice DuBois thought, only half-jokingly, that 
it was ``the end of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who was going to watch him at an hour only farmers could love?  
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of people, much to his surprise. Early morning represents  
the new -- and perhaps only -- boom time for television viewership as 
programmers wake up to the fact that more Americans are climbing 
out of bed early these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news broadcasts are coming on earlier and earlier and more  
people are tuning in. A little later, at 7 a.m., ABC, CBS and NBC 
news shows are getting the special attention of network executives 
who suddenly see them as cash cows. 
</P>
<P>
	America is becoming a nation of early risers, as people get a  
jump on the morning commute, work out in a gym or get the kids off 
to school. A study by the National Sleep Foundation this year found 
51 percent of Americans say they get up at 6 a.m. or earlier, an 
increase of 5 percent over 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a whole sociological shift,'' says early riser Jeff  
Zucker, executive producer of NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We see it in 
the way people are getting their news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, for the first time, more people watched the first  
half-hour of ``Today'' than one of the evening news programs, in 
this case ``CBS Evening News.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as a decade ago, many local stations ran 30 minutes,  
maybe an hour, of local news before the network morning show. Some 
didn't even bother. That's changed. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of TV stations two years ago found that the  
fastest-growing time of day for viewership was 5:30 a.m., says Bob 
Papper, telecommunications professor at Ball State University in 
Muncie, Ind. He suspects that 5 a.m. has now supplanted that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if any stations are doing 4:30 news,'' Papper  
says, ``but I can guarantee that some are thinking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side, he says, is that ratings for local newscasts  
starting at 11 p.m. are slipping as people go to bed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research has no national statistics to measure  
early morning viewership, since most of the programming is turned 
over to local stations. But some of the regional trends are as 
eye-opening as a strong cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York in 1990, Nielsen found 772,203 households had TV  
sets on at 6 a.m. By early 1999, that number had gone up to 1.6 
million, a 120 percent increase. Viewership during other parts of 
the day, particularly prime-time, has slipped during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, WNBC-TV expanded its morning news show to 90 minutes,  
starting at 5:30 a.m. In September, the news will start at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you build it, they will come,'' says Paula Madison, WNBC-TV  
vice president and news director. ``If we air a local newscast 
early, we find there is an audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's WBZ-TV, a CBS affiliate, debuted a three-hour morning  
show starting at 5 a.m. a year ago, after its research showed this 
was the best time of day in which to invest, spokeswoman Michele 
Walsh says. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear whether these stations are responding to a demand  
or creating one. Why didn't they try this before? 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be something as simple as we didn't think of it,''  
says Phyllis McGrady, the ABC executive who oversees ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady, who worked on the show in the 1980s and recently  
returned, has noticed a difference in the audience. The morning 
shows used to be softer, considered strictly women's territory, but 
are now much newsier, she said. More men are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more in the habit of turning on the TV generally,'' Ball  
State's Papper says. ``Whether they are watching it is another 
issue. Maybe they're just listening to it, using it like a radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For TV executives, this trend has opened an important new source  
of revenue. It's virgin territory: Local stations can now sell ads 
for time periods not really used before. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same bright financial picture at the networks. Last  
month, when advertisers bought commercial time for the upcoming 
fall shows, all three network morning shows saw sharp increases in 
advertising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time the networks are scrambling to make money, ``Today''  
racked up an impressive $100 million in profits for NBC last year. 
That's why ABC and CBS are investing heavily to cut in to NBC's 
dominance for that time period. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson were brought in as ``Good  
Morning America'' hosts in January, and Bryant Gumbel starts at CBS 
in the fall. Both networks are also spending millions on new 
Manhattan studios. 
</P>
<P>
	``As prime-time television struggles for its identity,'' NBC's  
Zucker says, ``I believe the most competitive time slot in 
television is not 7 to 9 p.m., but 7 to 9 a.m.''

<HEADLINE>  Clapton Auctions Guitars for Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Clapton parted with 100 stringed beauties  
Thursday, including a beloved Fender guitar he called ``Brownie'' 
that went for a record $497,500 at a charity auction. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Christie's sale generated $5 million for a Caribbean  
drug and alcohol clinic the rocker founded in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton used ``Brownie,'' a 1956 sunburst Fender, to record his  
hit ``Layla.'' He played the guitar in other recording sessions and 
in concert. The amount paid for it -- by an unidentified telephone 
bidder -- surpassed the previous record paid at auction for a guitar 
-- $320,000 for one owned by Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it. I am totally overwhelmed,'' Clapton said  
in a statement released by Christie's after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to ``say thank you on behalf of all the  
patients who will get free treatment as a result of this sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton did not attend the auction.  
</P>
<P>
	Actor Michael J. Fox, bidding by telephone, bought a 1949  
Gibson-125 for $36,800 and a circa 1930s National Duolian for 
$42,500. Other buyers included Michael Malone, a Seattle music 
executive, and a Hard Rock Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other buyers were not identified.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Brownie,'' Clapton sold a 1954 Fender  
Stratocaster for $211,500 and a 1974 Martin 000-28 for $173,000. 
Both were widely used for recording and stage work as Clapton rose 
to stardom during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	A rare, 1958 Gibson Explorer with a solid-body design went for  
$134,500 and a red, 1991 Gibson Firebird given to Clapton by a fan 
went for $39,100. 
</P>
<P>
	A Christie's spokeswoman would not comment on reports that  
Clapton may have intended to secretly bid on at least one of his 
guitars after having a change of heart about parting with it. None 
of the buyers were identified by the auction house.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Merger of 3 Unions Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The proposed merger of the International  
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with the United 
Auto Workers and United Steelworkers of America has been put on 
hold, pending talks between the UAW and Steelworkers unions to 
merge first. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, the presidents of the three unions said  
the UAW and Steelworkers unions were more comparable in their 
organizational structures and would ``take the next step in the 
unification process by conducting immediate discussions to join 
their two unions together. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this process, the three unions will continue to meet  
and continue their ultimate goal of reaching unification of all 
three unions,'' concluded the statement, which was posted on the 
Machinists union Web site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists spokesman Robert Kalaski said Thursday that  
differences in how the three unions elect their leaders was a major 
factor in the decision to delay the merger of all three. The 
Machinists have direct elections of their officials; the UAW and 
Steelworkers unions do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski said leaders of all three unions realized at least a  
year ago that their initial goal to merge by 2000 was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks to merge all three unions began in July 1995; the merger  
originally was planned to be completed by 2000. With more than 2 
million members, it would have created the nation's largest union. 
The statement did not say when it might occur now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not dead,'' Kalaski said.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger was seen as a way to increase the unions' clout and  
eliminate duplicate efforts in organizing and lobbying. But it 
faced many difficulties from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	One issue is the UAW strike fund, which dwarfs those of the  
Steelworkers and Machinists unions. There also are differences in 
how the unions allocate votes to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't a simple process to merge three organizations this  
different,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the 
University of California-Berkeley. ``There are differences that 
span from the presidents down to the local unions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski denied that the larger size of the UAW strike fund was a  
factor in the decision to delay the merger. ``All three unions have 
very healthy strike funds in proportion to their membership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to UAW spokesmen in Detroit were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Acquire WR James McKnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys acquired receiver James  
McKnight from Seattle on Thursday and owner Jerry Jones insisted he 
made the deal to complement Michael Irvin, not to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	``McKnight will give Michael more opportunities,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, the Cowboys' career leader in receptions, yards and  
touchdowns, is upset that Jones has not offered to extend his 
contract, as he has done for almost all of the team's other star 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	With only this season remaining on his contract, Irvin could get  
a hefty up-front payment by re-signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was believed to also be upset with his dwindling role in  
second-year coach Chan Gailey's spread-the-ball-around offense, but 
the receiver shot that down last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still kind of working through it,'' Jones said. ``Our  
plans right now are for him to be on the team. I think that's the 
way it's going to turn out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player Dallas expected to have and finally will is  
linebacker Randall Godfrey. The restricted free agent missed a 
mandatory minicamp last week because he didn't want to sign the 
$429,000 contract Jones offered. His only other option was to sit 
out the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could've paid him a lot more money if he'd let us sign him  
for three or four years,'' Jones said, adding that Godfrey declined 
in hopes of testing free agency next year. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, who cost the Cowboys a third-round pick in next year's  
draft, is signed for this season and next. He'll count $800,000 
against this year's salary cap and $1 million in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems like a lot to pay a guy who caught just 21 passes for  
346 yards last year, but Jones said the Cowboys have been after 
McKnight for awhile because coaches and scouts believe he'll be a 
good fit in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at what he does after the catch, it's really  
impressive,'' Jones said. ``He just needs to have a lot of balls 
thrown his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 200-pound receiver played five years in Seattle.  
His best season was 1997, when he started five games and caught 34 
passes for 637 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, he's likely to be the third receiver behind Irvin and  
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, who was signed as a free agent. Other 
wideouts include veteran Ernie Mills, second-year player Jeff Ogden 
and draft picks Wane McGarity of Texas and MarTay Jenkins of 
Nebraska-Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys need plenty of players to choose from because Gailey  
likes having as many as five receivers on the field at once. It's 
not effective unless defenses consider each player a threat, and 
Dallas wasn't always able to do that last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Davis failed in the role as the No. 2 receiver and was  
cut. Patrick Jeffers came on late in the year, but was an 
unrestricted free agent and was lost when Jones opted not to match 
a big offer by Carolina.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Ultraviolet Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A NASA ultraviolet telescope  
rocketed into orbit Thursday on a three-year quest to learn what 
the universe was like moments after creation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, better known as  
Fuse, blasted off aboard an unmanned Delta rocket. An hour later, 
it reached its destination: a 480-mile-high orbit from which it 
will peer into the corners of the Milky Way and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns Hopkins University developed the telescope for NASA and  
will now control it. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuse will measure the abundance of deuterium, a heavy hydrogen  
created along with the rest of the universe in the Big Bang 12 
billion or more years ago. Every day, deuterium is consumed by 
stars and converted into helium. 
</P>
<P>
	By determining how much deuterium still exists and how much is  
regularly destroyed, astronomers can figure out the original makeup 
of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deuterium is a cosmic fossil,'' said Warren Moos, the lead  
scientist for the project at Johns Hopkins. ``If we knew the 
primordial abundance of deuterium, if we knew that, then we could 
figure out the average abundance of ordinary nuclear matter, the 
ordinary matter that makes up oceans, that makes up people, that 
makes up stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope's observations, expected to begin in about three  
months after the instrument is checked out and fine-tuned, also 
should help explain how stars and galaxies evolve and how the gas 
between galaxies changes over time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuse will expand on ultraviolet observations by NASA's  
Copernicus observatory, launched in 1972, as well as the Hubble 
Space Telescope and small instruments occasionally flown on the 
space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The $214 million mission will be operated entirely by Johns  
Hopkins, which also designed and made the 18-foot, 3,000-pound 
telescope. It is the most involved a university has ever been in a 
NASA mission.

<HEADLINE> Weather Takes Toll on Chili Plants / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATCH, N.M. (AP) -- An oasis in the southern New Mexico desert, a  
green patchwork of small farms splits the barren landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The plowed earth of the Hatch Valley is dotted with pecan  
orchards, onion tops, corn -- and what is left of the chili plants. 
Cool nights, gusting winds, insects and drought conditions are 
taking a toll on the valley's staple, from long hot green peppers 
to mild red peppers and paprika. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili stands in some fields along the twisting Rio Grande are so  
sparse farmers are considering plowing them under, said 88-year-old 
Alex Franzoy, whose father was the first farmer in the Hatch Valley 
to grow chili for market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's going to be very much chili this year,''  
Franzoy said. ``I think it's the worst that I've seen since I've 
been in the valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are still weighing the financial impact of a dismal  
growing season, but they estimate losses for farmers could reach 
$30 million, half the value of last year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to tell whether consumers will pay more for  
chili in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico provides 60 percent of base chili products -- powdered  
chili and paprika, for example -- to the rest of the country, said 
Bill Gomez, an economist with the New Mexico State University 
Cooperative Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many fields, stands are thin, and it's not economically  
feasible to harvest the crop,'' Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension service is seeking federal disaster aid for chili  
farmers across southern New Mexico. Nearly every farmer in the 
Hatch Valley grows some form of chili. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough conditions along the lower Rio Grande are nothing new to  
Hatch farmers. They have been growing their world-famous peppers 
for nearly a century, withstanding droughts, floods and insect 
invasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You fight something different every year,'' said Sherry  
Franzoy, who runs a 60-acre chili operation in Hatch with her 
husband, Ronnie. 
</P>
<P>
	The first chili crop in Hatch Valley was planted around 1920 by  
farmer Franzoy's father, Joseph, who emigrated from Austria. He 
planted about 10 acres of chili in Salem, about 5 miles north of 
Hatch, and sold his crop for 10 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed. Chili no longer goes that cheap -- a  
35-pound bag of green chilis now brings $10 to $18 -- and farmers 
now have to worry about everything from farm labor activists to 
chili farmers from elsewhere who try to pass their goods off as 
Hatch chili. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want New Mexico chili you're going to have to pay  
more,'' said Garfield farmer Dickie Ogaz. ``And buyers know that. 
If they don't give in, they know the poor farmer can't hold his 
crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 125 acres of chili on Ogaz's farm are faring well  
considering the withered plants to the south. But he still expects 
to lose about 25 percent by harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent rain over the southwestern corner of the state has  
helped. ``Last night we got about an inch. After that, the plants 
look like you would if you just had a good glass of cold tea,'' 
Ogaz said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rain isn't enough for some farmers. ``I've heard people  
talking about having little peppers on their plants at this time of 
year,'' Gomez said. ``But the plants are late and the stands are 
very thin. It's very devastating.''

<HEADLINE> EU, Latin America, Caribbean Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Leaders from the 15 European Union  
nations are trekking to Rio de Janeiro for a summit with almost 
three dozen Latin American and Caribbean nations in pursuit of 
closer political ties and -- a fuzzier, more distant prospect -- free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are rather substantial, as the EU accounts for 12  
percent of Latin American exports and 17 percent of its imports. 
For many countries, the EU is the second-largest trading partner 
after the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans face a traditional bind in these discussions: They  
would love more trade, but worry about cheap imports, especially 
agricultural imports. 
</P>
<P>
	South Americans, led by giants Brazil and Argentina, want to  
sell more grain and meat to Europe and will likely insist on 
discussing farm exports at the two-day summit, which opens Monday. 
If the EU doesn't want free trade with this region, Brazilians say, 
the United States does. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Europeans say they won't be dragged into a race with  
Washington, which seeks a Pan-American free trade area by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not competing with ... hemispheric negotiations on free  
trade which have their own logic,'' EU Latin American Affairs 
Commissioner Manuel Marin said ahead of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft of an economic communique, a copy of which has been  
obtained by The Associated Press, speaks of a ``strategic 
partnership,'' based on, among other things, respect for democracy 
and human rights, sustainable development and a determination to 
stamp out trade in illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it condemns Washington for legislation punishing Europeans  
for trading with Cuba, whose president, Fidel Castro, is expected 
in Rio, too. 
</P>
<P>
	On continent-to-continent free trade, however, the draft is  
noncommittal. ``It is tough to come to a meaningful free trade 
because Latin America and the Caribbean are vast regions with 
enormous economic disparities,'' said one EU official, who asked 
not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after the crumbling of communism, Cuba remains an  
outsider. Latin America has at least four economic alliances of 
which Mercosur -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and 
associates Chile and Bolivia -- is the most advanced.

	EU exports to Latin America reached $52.4 billion in 1997,  
double the 1987 amount, but well above EU imports of $38.1 billion.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Milwaukee Brewers reliever Valerio De Los  
Santos had surgery to remove a protruding disk from his lower back 
and is expected to make a full recovery, the team said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	De Los Santos, 23, has been on the disabled list since April  
after starting the season 0-1 with an 8.53 ERA in five relief 
appearances.

<HEADLINE> New ABA Plans To Start Play in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The red-white-and-blue balls of the American  
Basketball Association may be bouncing again in 12 cities next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league, known as ABA 2000, unveiled plans for a 40-game  
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis will be the headquarters, although organizers say  
they have no plans to locate a franchise here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been asked to compete with the Indiana Pacers, and we  
said, `No, we live here and we're Indiana Pacer fans''', said 
Indianapolis broadcasting executive Joe Newman, one of the league's 
founders. ``We're not looking to put a team here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said the league will use the red-white-and-blue  
basketball made popular by the old ABA, which disbanded in 1976 and 
sent four current NBA teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said one of the unique aspects of the league is that more  
than 50 percent of its ownership will be African-Americans with 
diversified backgrounds in sports, entertainment and business. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to have a New York team based on Long Island. The  
league declined to identify owners of the 12 franchises, which it 
said would include teams in Chicago, Anaheim, Calif.; Jacksonville, 
Fla.; Tampa, Fla.; Pittsburgh; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; New Orleans, 
the Tidewater area of Virginia; Hartford, Conn., Nashville and 
Memphis, Tenn.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 3,600 Russian troops expected to arrive in  
Kosovo as early as tomorrow are being welcomed by NATO officials, 
but those officials also acknowledge problems may arise. NATO 
officials say that discussions are now under way on how best to use 
the Russian contingent. The forces will operate in separate sectors 
controlled by the United States, French and German troops. Army 
Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, said today the 3,600 
Russians will join 55,000 troops already committed to the Kosovo

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department announced today a reward  
of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of persons -- including Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic -- wanted for war crimes in Bosnia and Yugoslavia. Also 
being sought are former Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and 
Ratko Mladic. Milosevic and four Yugoslav colleagues were indicted 
last month for crimes in the Kosovo conflict. The indictments 
against Karadzic and Mladic were handed down in connection with the 
massacre of 6,000 Bosnian Muslims in 1995.

nation's moral leadership is growing. That focus may help 
Republicans during the 2000 campaign, the poll indicated. 
Republicans have about a 20 percentage-point edge over Democrats 
when asked which party best represents the values of faith in God, 
personal responsibility, ethics and honesty and knowing right from

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite billions spent so far, current  
technology is not up to the job of cleaning contaminated soil and 
water at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons sites, a 
scientific advisory panel reported today. ``The technology that 
often is used to remediate contaminated sites is simply ineffective 
and unable to accomplish the massive job that needs to be done,'' 
said C. Herb Ward, chairman of the National Research Council 
committee that studied the issue. The department has spent between 
$5.6 billion and $7.2 billion per year on environmental management 
over the past several years, the report also indicated.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the third consecutive Congress, the House  
voted to amend the Constitution to allow legislation that would ban 
desecration of the flag. The 305-124 vote today was a comfortable

agenda, from Medicare and Social Security proposals to an increase 
in the minimum wage. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that Clinton 
will also open a new campaign to tighten gun control and adopt a 
patients' bill of rights. A centerpiece of Clinton's program is a

cutting edge agenda,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said 
yesterday. The agenda includes tax cuts that promote investment and 
research, removing barriers to Internet commerce, and reining in 
excessive federal regulations. House Democratic leader Dick 
Gephardt of Missouri said the package is motivated by the GOP 
desire to win a bigger share of the high tech industry's political

children who land on them. Dive sticks are hard, plastic 
cylinder-shaped objects that stand upright on the bottom of pools 
so children can dive down and retrieve them. The Consumer Product 
Safety Commission recommends that parents throw the toys away. The 
commission also said it is recalling an infant carrier because of 
the danger a child could fall out, and some new Star Wars 
lightsabers because they may cause burns to their users.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Mayor's Conduct Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mayor Susan Golding has been accused by a grand  
jury of improperly using her influence to secure a business group's 
backing for a new stadium for baseball's San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, which leveled its accusations on Wednesday, did  
not bring criminal charges. Instead, it recommended the district 
attorney pursue a civil misconduct case. 
</P>
<P>
	If Golding is found to have committed misconduct, the two-term  
mayor could be removed from office. However, term limits prevent 
her from running for re-election in 2000, when her term expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are groundless,'' the mayor said. ``I sleep  
very well at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury alleged that the mayor offered to support a $4  
million allocation for a hotel-motel association advertising 
program in exchange for the organization's support of a ballpark 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark project was approved by voters last November. The  
$411 million venture is to be financed in part with $225 million in 
municipal bonds secured by hotel-room tax revenue. The ballpark is 
set for completion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Paul Pfingst said Thursday he will decide  
within 30 days whether to bring a case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong, unfair and just plain jumping the gun to  
assume that because an accusation is made by a grand jury that it 
has been proved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only punishment for a public official found to have  
committed civil misconduct is removal from office. That could only 
occur after a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mansur, president of the hotel-motel association, said the  
grand jury was off the mark because his group does not market San 
Diego -- the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau does. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansur said his organization did ask Golding for an increase in  
marketing dollars for the bureau, but before the City Council voted 
to put the baseball stadium proposal on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury is trying to make it out like we hoodwinked  
everybody and got this big check,'' he said. ``That never happened. 
At no time did the mayor try to influence us. Our budget request 
and our support of the ballpark were never linked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The county grand jury term ends Wednesday. Since it was seated  
last year, the panel has criticized many public officials, and has 
itself been criticized for its reports. The grand jury has no 
recourse if the district attorney decides the case has no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wertz, the mayor's attorney, said he believes Pfingst will  
find that the grand jury jumped the gun and called the panel ``a 
rogue bunch of citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury foreman Peter DiRenza defended the panel, saying they  
were working in the best interests of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not directed at the mayor personally. It's directed at  
what the mayor did,'' he said, adding there was no political agenda 
on the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I voted for the ballpark,'' DiRenza said. ``If they build the  
ballpark, I'll go to it.''

<HEADLINE>  United States 7, Nigeria 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Now this is how to win fans. And World Cups.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States emphatically displayed why it is one of the  
world's best women's soccer teams with a 7-1 rout of Nigeria on 
Thursday before 65,080, the second straight sellout for the 
American squad in the Women's World Cup. The fans at Soldier Field, 
many decked out in red, white and blue clothes, hairdos or body 
paint, were treated to an astounding offensive display. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, following the Americans' 3-0 defeat of Denmark in  
the opener, virtually assured a spot in the quarterfinals and a 
berth in the 2000 Olympics. But North Korea's 3-1 victory over 
Denmark in Portland, Ore., prevented the United States from 
clinching advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play the Koreans in Foxboro, Mass., on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, which won its first game in Group A and promised it  
would not be intimidated by the highly ranked American squad, 
actually scored first, in the second minute. Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans responded with two goals in 58 seconds, both  
involving their biggest star, Mia Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first half was over, the United States added four  
more for a 6-1 edge, equaling the six goals the Americans scored in 
one half of an exhibition against Japan on April 29. It also tied a 
Women's World Cup record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm started the party with a free kick from near the left  
sideline that ricocheted in off defender Ifeanyichukwu Chiejine as 
Michelle Akers dived to get her right foot on it while falling. 
That made it 1-1 in the 19th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm hit the net less than a minute later as she was  
inexplicably left alone on right wing. Her rocket of a shot sailed 
over the right hand of goalkeeper Ann Chiejine. 
</P>
<P>
	As Nigeria's midfield continued pushing upfield, the Americans  
struck again. Tiffeny Milbrett easily beat Nigeria captain Florence 
Omagbemi on the right wing and centered, where Kristine Lilly's 
shot was blocked. But the ball bounced off Cindy Parlow directly to 
Milbrett, whose shot went in off Ann Chiejine's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	With three goals in four minutes, the United States could have  
relaxed. Instead, the hosts poured it on as the crowd chanted 
``U-S-A! U-S-A!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm's free kick from about 10 yards in front of her effort on  
the first goal was back-headed home by Lilly. Seven minutes later, 
Akers got her head on a cross by Julie Foudy as the defense stood 
and watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow finished the onslaught with a header off a header feed  
from Chastain set up by Milbrett's precise cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett added a late goal with a sliding left-footed poke on a  
gorgeous feed from Parlow. The seven goals tied a team record in 
the World Cup, set against Taiwan when the Americans won the 
championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American players left the field pumping their fists and  
slapping high-fives to resounding cheers, they were even more the 
darlings of the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Appears at Final Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee  
to be U.N. ambassador, defended his negotiations with Slobodan 
Milosevic on Thursday, saying he was trying ``to avoid war and 
bring peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiating with the Yugoslav president ``isn't fun. This isn't  
bridge or tennis,'' the often-blunt veteran diplomat told the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``This is tough slogging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 peace accords for Bosnia and a  
frequent emissary to Milosevic before the NATO airstrikes, was 
expected to win easy Senate confirmation to the long-vacant post at 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	This likelihood was signaled by the committee chairman himself,  
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who pointedly called Holbrooke ``Mr. 
Ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't hesitate to call you that, now,'' Helms told  
Holbrooke, the sole witness at a hearing that focused largely on 
U.S. Balkans policy and Holbrooke's role. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms scheduled a committee vote on Holbrooke for next  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at his third and final Senate confirmation hearing,  
Holbrooke defended his relationship with Milosevic after Helms 
noted that Holbrooke had ``spent more time with ... Milosevic than 
anyone else in this administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are neither friends nor partners,'' Holbrooke said. He  
characterized Milosevic as ``evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he ``no regrets'' negotiating with Milosevic, even  
though the Yugoslav leader had pulled the rug out from under the 
United States on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The highest goal here was to avoid war and bring peace,''  
Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he couldn't conceive of an American negotiating with  
Milosevic again, particularly in light of Milosevic's indictment as 
a war criminal by an international tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tribunal did the right thing,'' Holbrooke said. ``He's  
been indicted. He should face trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to draw comparisons between Bosnia and Kosovo, Holbrooke  
cited a series of mistakes he said were made in regard to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he ``deeply regretted'' that President Clinton had set  
two deadlines for removing U.S. peacekeepers from Bosnia after the 
1995 peace agreement -- deadlines that were missed and eventually 
had to be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not repeat that mistake'' with Kosovo, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said he also regretted that the West did not move  
quickly in bringing to justice Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko 
Mladic, wartime civilian and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs 
who have been indicted as war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, he said NATO should have acted more aggressively  
back in 1991 when it appeared that Milosevic was consolidating his 
Serb-based power in the aftermath of the breakup of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Holbrooke said that on the whole, U.S. Bosnia policy has  
been a success. ``Not one NATO soldier was killed or wounded from 
hostile action in Bosnia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former assistant secretary  
of state and ambassador to Germany. He has served as the 
administration's unpaid special envoy on the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	He negotiated the 1995 peace agreement with Milosevic in Dayton,  
Ohio, that ended the war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also negotiated an abortive cease-fire in Kosovo with  
Milosevic last October, and was the last Western diplomat Milosevic 
saw before NATO airstrikes began on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke made a last-ditch effort to get Milosevic to go along  
with NATO demands on March 23. Looking Milosevic in the eye, 
Holbrooke said he told the Yugoslav leader that NATO bombing would 
be ``swift, severe and sustained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic said he knew that the United States would bomb  
his country -- and that nothing could be done about it. Milosevic 
then asked, ``I wonder if we will see each other again,'' Holbrooke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke told the panel that Milosevic, by his actions, all but  
guaranteed that such a meeting would not take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a year's delay in the confirmation hearings, most of it  
caused by lengthy ethics investigations by the administration, 
Holbrooke seemed headed toward easy confirmation both in the 
committee and by the full Senate.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Koo Koo Roo Director Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former director of the restaurant company  
Koo Koo Roo Inc. was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of 
securities fraud involving allegations of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment was issued Tuesday, the same day Donald B. Wohl  
settled a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
concerning the same trading, the U.S. attorney's office said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on the four counts of security fraud, Wohl could be  
sentenced to up to 40 years in prison and be fined $4 million, said 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul J. Watford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohl, 68, of Los Angeles, purchased 50,000 shares of the  
restaurant company's stock March 27, 1998, when he learned former 
Ford and Chrysler executive Lee Iacocca was going to be appointed 
acting chairman of Koo Koo Roo. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the appointment was to be withheld until a  
contract termination was completed with the outgoing chairman, 
Kenneth Berg, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, when Iacocca's appointment was announced, the  
stock price doubled. Wohl sold 45,000 shares of the stock that same 
day, yielding a trading profit of $65,280, Watford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohl's attorney, Harriet Leva, said Wednesday that Wohl  
``categorically denies any intentional wrongdoing.'' She said he 
did not violate the law on insider trading, which she said involves 
acting on internal knowledge of a company -- knowing the information 
has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will admit that he did trade Koo Koo Roo stock on March 27  
and March 30. But when he bought that stock he believed honestly, 
in good faith, that the news about the change in Koo Koo Roo 
management had already become public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without admitting wrongdoing, Wohl agreed to pay about $133,000  
in SEC-imposed penalties. The SEC also alleged that Wohl violated a 
1978 order that barred him from acting as an investment adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohl resigned from the Koo Koo Roo board in late 1998, about six  
months before Koo Koo Roo merged with Prandium Inc., based in 
Irvine, said a Prandium spokesman, Robert L. Carl, who would not 
comment on the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca, famed for the Ford Mustang success in the 1960s and the  
financial rebound at Chrysler, has since left the restaurant 
company to head an electronic bicycle concern.

<HEADLINE>  Mariners' Tax Money Request Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners' request for more tax money  
to pay for their new ballpark was rejected Thursday by the state

	The resolution proposed by William P. Gerberding was adopted 6-0

<P>
	Under the development agreement signed by the Mariners and the

from special restaurant, bar, car rental and stadium admission 
taxes enacted to finance the $517 million project should be applied

<HEADLINE>  France Lifts Coke Production Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNKIRK, France (AP) -- France followed the lead of Belgium and  
lifted a ban on Coca-Cola products Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall that followed hundreds of reports of illnesses by  
people who drank Coca-Cola products is estimated to have cost at 
least $60 million, and could be much higher. But Coca-Cola's main 
bottler said ``the crisis is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Production in France will resume early Friday, said Henry A.  
Schimberg, president and chief operating offer of Coca-Cola 
Enterprises Inc., the world's leading bottler and distributor of 
Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Production had been expected to resume Thursday in Belgium, but  
was delayed as Coca-Cola worked to assure compliance with strict 
sanitary conditions imposed by the government on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Belgium we are taking very deliberate steps to ensure  
perfect quality. Production will begin in a matter of days,'' said 
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Jennifer McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 9, there had been 249 cases of illnesses reported in  
Belgium by people who drank Coca-Cola products. In France, hundreds 
of people who drank from cans produced in Dunkirk had reported 
illnesses in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, France ended its limited ban on production of  
Coca-Cola canned products here, saying government tests determined 
there no longer is a public health threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it seems that the product and its packaging are safe,  
so the sales can start up again,'' Finance Minister Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique Reiniche, president of Coca-Cola France, said the  
illnesses were caused by odors stemming from traces of disinfectant 
on the bottom of some cans. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the disinfectant, containing carbolic acid, or phenol,  
was used to clean pallets on which the cans were standing at the 
bottling plant. She said the contamination was due to ``logistical 
malfunctioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium announced on Wednesday it would allow Coca-Cola to  
resume operations at factories in Antwerp and Ghent, if new 
production safeguards are imposed. Without determining the cause of 
hundreds of illnesses reported in Belgium, the country's top health 
official termed them an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the crisis is over and we're happy with the French  
government's decision,'' Schimberg told a news conference at the 
Dunkirk bottling plant in northern France. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiniche acknowledged that Coca-Cola's image in Europe has been  
tarnished and said the company would launch a promotion campaign in 
France and Belgium this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman, has said it will take  
about two weeks to build up full distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Enterprises said the cost of the recalling 14 million  
cases, each containing 24 eight-ounce servings, was about $60 
million. In addition, it said there would be lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bottler said it was confident the health scare would not  
hurt financial results after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises,  
was ``still working on our assessment'' of the costs of the crisis, 
spokesman Rob Baskin said Thursday in Atlanta. ``It's premature for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola  
Enterprises fell 2.1 percent, or by 68 3/4 cents, at $31.68 3/4 a share, 
while Coca-Cola was up 1.5 percent, or by 93 3/4 cents, at $62.68 3/4 a 
share.

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Greene Top Track Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- In a meeting of speed versus strength, it's  
Maurice Greene against Michael Johnson at 200 meters, the world 
record-holder in the 100 meters facing the world record-holder in 
the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the main event of the 38 titles decided this weekend at the  
USA Track and Field Championships at the University of Oregon's 
Hayward Field. The showdown is Sunday at 3:52 p.m. EDT on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot lines are many.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene is coming off his world-record performance of 9.79  
seconds in the 100 last week at Athens, Greece, and now has the 
unofficial title of world's fastest human. He doesn't think that 
makes him the world's greatest sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do more than one event,'' he said Wednesday. ``You  
have to run the relays and the 200.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His coach, John Smith, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be the world's fastest sprinter, you have to run the  
furlong (200),'' Smith said. ``It may take him a year or two to get 
there, but he's only 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 31, already has established himself as the best  
200-meter runner in history. He has run the two fastest times ever, 
19.66 at the 1996 Olympic trials, then an astonishing 19.32 at the 
Summer Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's best is 19.86 at Stockholm, Sweden, in July 1997. The  
last time he faced Johnson at 200 meters was May 1998 in the 
Prefontaine Classic at Hayward Field, and Greene won decisively 
over his ailing opponent in a wind-aided 19.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances are different now. Greene is still celebrating  
his record run in the 100, and Johnson is healthy but competing for 
the first time since winning the 400 at the Prefontaine Classic 
nearly four weeks ago. He skipped one meet after that because of 
the death of his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knows Johnson will be prepared and Greene will have to be  
at his absolute best to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael doesn't compete unless he's ready,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-1, 175 pounds, Johnson is bigger and stronger than the  
5-9, 165-pound Greene. Johnson has an unusual but efficient style 
of running, staying erect and moving his hands up and down like a 
wooden soldier. Greene's manner more resembles the typical 
sprinter, head slightly bowed, a rolling motion and arms thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is much more experienced than Greene at the longer  
sprints. He also was the 1996 Olympic champion at 400 meters and 
has run the second-fastest time ever at that distance, 43.39, just 
off Butch Reynolds' world record of 43.29. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still learning the 200,'' Greene said. ``I want to run a  
phenomenal race Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 heats and semifinals are Saturday, and Greene thinks  
that will be to his advantage for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have run two 200 races in one day, which means I'll have  
run a total of 400 meters,'' he said. ``He's a 400-meter runner and 
used to running that distance. I'm not. But on Sunday, I'll have to 
run only 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 100, I'm a very strong finisher. I want to show that  
I'm a very strong finisher in the 200, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Greene is planning to double in the 100 and 200 at the  
World Championships in August at Seville, Spain, this is a very 
important race for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's now stepping into an area in which Michael is very  
comfortable, and it's very challenging,'' Smith said. ``Michael can 
run 20 seconds falling out of bed. If he doesn't run under 20 
seconds, people are disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has not run the 200 often, but he trained for it last  
year, and that helped his speed in the 100, Smith said. 
Surprisingly, Greene ran the 200 last week at Athens -- after his 
record in the 100 -- and finished second in 20.03 to teammate Ato 
Boldon's 1999 world-best 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needed that race for psychological reasons, because he's  
doing it here,'' Smith said. ``He said, `You can't keep me out.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes challenges. He doesn't rest on his laurels.''  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Johnson and Greene, the 200 field is loaded.  
There's also 1992 Olympic champion Mike Marsh; 1999 U.S leader John 
Capel, a Florida freshman who ran 19.87 in winning the NCAA title; 
1997 world indoor champion Kevin Little; defending champion Gentry 
Bradley; 1997 U.S. outdoor champion Jon Drummond; 1998 U.S. indoor 
champion Ramon Clay; Tyree Washington, ranked No. 2 in the U.S. 
last year, and Curtis Perry, the 1998 NCAA champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet began today with finals in the men's 10,000 and triple  
jump, and the women's discus throw, hammer throw and steeplechase.

<HEADLINE> Cowens Back To Talk With Cavs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers might be closer to  
hiring a head coach than they want to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Cowens arrived in town Wednesday for his second interview  
with the team, which is trying to keep its coaching search a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than a week remaining before the NBA draft, the Cavs  
are finding it difficult to hide their prospective coaching 
candidates from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	That difficulty heightened when the 6-foot-9, red-headed former  
Boston Celtics center and coach of the Charlotte Hornets was 
spotted at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really thrilled and hope everything works out,'' Cowens  
told WKYC-TV upon arrival. ``I'm just happy to be considered for 
the position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens appears to be the front-runner in a search the Cavs have  
conducted without much fanfare. Cowens was reportedly in for an 
initial interview with new Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson 
last week, but didn't get to meet with owner Gordon Gund. 
</P>
<P>
	A second visit seems to indicate the Cavs could be close to  
signing Cowens, who resigned unexpectedly as coach of the Charlotte 
Hornets last March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do it right,'' Gund said following a news  
conference for former GM Wayne Embry, elected Wednesday to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. ``That's why it's taking time. We want to 
do this right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who earlier this month was replaced by Paxson, was  
elected to the Hall of Fame along with Kevin McHale and John 
Thompson. All three played on NBA championship teams with the 
Celtics, as did Cowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who was to meet with the media today to discuss next  
week's NBA draft, didn't want to go into much detail about his 
coaching search. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say we're continuing and making some progress,''  
Paxson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, 50, and Minnesota assistant Randy Wittman are believed  
to be the only candidates brought in so far for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund, in New York earlier this week as a member of a special  
committee appointed by the NBA to study ways to improve play, said 
the Cavs' coaching search could still be ``a week or two'' from 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Hornets started last season 4-11, Cowens, who coached  
the team to their two most successful seasons, resigned in part 
because he was upset with being the lowest-paid coach in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens wants another shot as a head coach, but didn't get the  
job after interviews in Washington and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Raised in Cincinnati, he has a brother living in a Cleveland  
suburb and has enough familiarity with the city and the Cavs to 
know he'd be a good fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a good team and this is a great sports town,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Earnings Up 35 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. reported  
Thursday it earned $1.15 billion in the second quarter of its 
fiscal year, handily beating analysts' estimates and marking a 35 
percent increase over the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The big investment firm attributed the strong showing to healthy  
results across the broad range of its businesses, including equity 
underwriting, merger transactions, and overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were equivalent to $1.95 per share in the quarter  
ended May 31, easily surpassing the $1.54 per share expected by 
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. In the same period a year 
ago, the company earned $852 million, or $1.37 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues, not including interest expenses and provisions for  
loan losses, rose 23 percent to $5.66 billion from $4.60 billion a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley joined rivals Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs  
in announcing strong earnings for the second quarter. But the 
company's stock fell $1.31 a share to $91.31 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Thursday as investors grew increasingly uneasy 
about interest rates in advance of next week's meeting of the 
Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, while already expecting rates to go up at that  
meeting, are concerned that Morgan Stanley and other financial 
companies will see their earnings decline if the Fed undertakes a 
series of rate hikes over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	During the second quarter, Morgan Stanley's earnings from  
trading, selling and underwriting securities -- which makes up the 
vast majority of the firm's business -- soared 54 percent thanks to 
a strong showing in European and Asian markets, underwriting stock 
and handling mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's online Discover Brokerage Direct reported a 78  
percent jump in trading volume during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its fiscal year, Morgan Stanley  
earned $2.19 billion or $3.71 per share, compared to $1.54 billion 
or $2.47 per share in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 27 
percent to $11 billion from $8.63 billion.

<HEADLINE> Congress Warned of Hacker Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government agencies have left their Web sites  
and computer networks vulnerable to Internet hackers by failing to 
enforce security regulations, officials told a congressional 
committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most federal agencies continue to lack the ability to detect  
against and recover from cyber attacks,'' said Rep. Connie Morella, 
R-Md., chairwoman of the House Science subcommittee on technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Government security experts often find their advice isn't  
followed, said Raymond Kammer, director of the National Institutes 
for Standards and Technology, which recommends security measures 
for federal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, few employees have adequate training to defend  
government Web sites, and those who do seldom work in government 
for long, said Kammer and two other experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The security agencies ``train people at government expense, and  
the private sector waves a bigger paycheck and takes them away,'' 
said Keith Rhodes, technical director with the General Accounting 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacker attacks like the recent defacing of the Senate Web site  
are well documented, but information about attempts to access 
sensitive intelligence information is ``very sketchy,'' said 
Michael Jacobs, a deputy director of the National Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers are often nearly impossible to trace unless they boast  
of their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most common type of attack, hackers overwhelm Web sites  
with a flood of requests for information, causing the site to slow 
or shut down. Hackers can also redirect visitors to a fake Web site 
that appears to be the official site, as happened earlier this 
month to the Senate site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are clearly seeing an escalation in both the destructive  
nature and aggressive pace of these and other attacks,'' Jacobs 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Plane Makes Landing in L.A. Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The damage included a shattered plane,  
spilled fuel and two school buses with smashed front ends. It could 
have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary school students and the plane's pilot were unhurt  
Wednesday when the small plane crash-landed at a busy intersection, 
ripping away its fuel tanks as it barreled between the approaching 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 14 years on this job I have never seen a miraculous  
incident like this. There must have been divine intervention,'' 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. ``It was 
like passing through the eye of the needle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 2:45 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled for 1,500 
feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was uninjured, and more than 40 children emerged  
unscathed from the buses to sit on the curb and sip soft drinks 
before they were taken away to wait for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the plane wasn't going to hit us, but it hit us,''  
said Sasha Medina, a 10-year-old girl on the bus. ``I was like 
scared ... because I thought some of us were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student was treated at a hospital for a possible head  
injury, then released, and one bus driver was hospitalized in fair 
condition with back and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses carried 42 students from Parthenia Street Elementary  
School and six from Lassen Elementary School, said Socorro Serrano, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was alone in the plane, was questioned by  
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
National Transportation Safety Board. Authorities said he works for 
Sunshine Airlines, a Van Nuys charter firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time, with some  
children looking dazed and others among the mostly 6- to-10 year 
olds skipping and hopping. 
</P>
<P>
	They were later taken to their schools to be reunited with their  
parents. One unfazed child checked in via television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say `Mom, I love you,''' 9-year-old Luigi Escobar  
said. ``And I think you better come pick me up.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Pays for Admirals' Home Fixups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee is criticizing the Navy for  
diverting $5.5 million from its operational budget to refurbish the 
residences of three four-star admirals. The Navy defended the 
spending on Thursday, but suggested the diversion would not happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the dispute, the Senate voted to require the  
Pentagon to notify Congress in the future anytime it spends more 
than $25,000 on fixing up the quarters of an admiral or general. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee said the Navy's decision to  
spend the money from its ``operation and maintenance'' account 
instead of from housing funds appeared to be ``an attempt to 
circumvent congressional controls'' on spending on the quarters of 
admirals and generals. 
</P>
<P>
	It asked congressional auditors at the General Accounting Office  
to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy took money for repairs from the operation and  
maintenance budget because the houses are used for official 
functions such as receptions, a Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Lydia 
Robertson, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any of these houses, only a floor or two is actually used  
for the family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the three residences, that of the chief of naval  
operations at the Washington Navy Yard, is not being used as a 
residence by the current Navy chief, Adm. Jay Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two residences cited in the report were those of the  
superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and the 
Pacific Fleet commander at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism was included in an Appropriations Committee report  
that accompanied an $8.3 billion measure financing military 
construction in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel added to the bill a provision requiring the Pentagon  
to notify Congress about any future housing renovations to top 
officer's quarters in excess of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall measure was approved 97-2 on June 16. The House has  
yet to act on its version of the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned work includes new plumbing, an elevator for handicapped  
access, removal of lead paint and other repairs or upgrades that 
the government routinely makes to other public buildings, the Navy 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is complicated, and often made more expensive, by the  
age and historic value of the homes, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, when an internal audit early this year turned up  
the expenditures, Navy officials had second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Navy came forward and said, 'this is what happened. We  
don't think it's right and we're going to change it,''' Robertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Navy is using ordinary housing budgets to pay for  
the ongoing work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee report said that the use of ``operation and  
maintenance'' funds to renovate family housing was ``totally 
inappropriate, irrespective of the rank of the individual who 
occupies these quarters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Furthermore, the Navy has systematically failed to notify the  
Congress that these renovations and other family housing 
improvements were planned and ongoing,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time this month the Pentagon has come under  
fire from senators for heavy spending on the military's top 
commanders at a time when money for the armed services is tight. 
</P>
<P>
	During debate on military spending earlier this month, some  
senators complained that the Pentagon was leasing, for about $50 
million a year, six new business jets for the use of its top 
admirals and generals. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Elvis Stojko wants a fourth world championship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian figure skater said today he will continue competing  
as an amateur to try for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision is to compete again, going once again for the

	The 27-year-old has battled through injury the last year and a  
half, from a seriously pulled groin muscle that hampered his

in a practice spill 1 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko is a two-time Olympic silver medal winner, three-time

<HEADLINE> Average Rate on Mortgages Falls / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages, which has been rising for two months, edged 
down to 7.63 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.65 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb for the past two  
months and have fluctuated from their low for this year of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January to 7.65 percent last week, the 
highest level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.28 percent this week, up from the average of 7.26 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.93 percent, slightly down from 5.94 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Sun Reiterates Microsoft Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. reiterated  
accusations of copyright infringement Thursday in federal court 
against Microsoft Corp., arguing that the software maker distorted 
a popular Sun programming language so that it works only on Windows 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Granted, Microsoft has the money to pay a million monkeys to  
program for a million years, but they still wouldn't come up with 
something identical to our Java,'' said Sun's attorney Rusty Day. 
``This was massive, verbatim, literal copying of our code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer company, sued Redmond,  
Wash.-based Microsoft in Oct., 1997, claiming that the leading 
software maker had deceived customers and software developers into 
believing that Microsoft's version of the Java language was good 
for programs that ran on all computers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, attorneys for Microsoft and Sun argued their cases  
in U.S. District Court in San Jose. Sun is seeking a finding of 
copyright infringement without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Charles Quackenbush said his company simply  
used Java to innovate, and that they were allowed to develop an 
independent version. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a license to use their material in our products, and  
that's what happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If someone condensed factual information from a historical novel  
into a small pamphlet, that pamphlet would not be copyright 
protected, said Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that analogy holds up for the way Microsoft used Java,  
``taking a portion of the code and running it through a compiler to 
come up with a completely different output.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a tentative ruling issued in May, Judge Ronald Whyte said  
that several Microsoft Corp. products, including Windows 98, 
infringed Sun's copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, Microsoft can develop and distribute  
``independently developed'' tools that do not comply with a 
contract with Sun, so long as such products do not infringe any Sun 
copyright, patent or other intellectual property right. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte is expected to make a final ruling within the next few  
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Aerosmith Cancels Woodstock Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Aerosmith, one of the main acts scheduled to  
perform at Woodstock '99, has canceled its appearance at the rock 
festival because of scheduling conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The band -- Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton,  
and Joey Kramer -- said Wednesday it regretted the inconvenience to 
its fans and apologized to those who already had purchased tickets 
to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it came down to was scheduling conflicts and logistical  
problems with other gigs,'' said Ilene Marder, spokesperson for 
Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerosmith becomes the second headliner to cancel because of  
scheduling problems. Last month, former Yardbirds guitarist Jeff 
Beck also pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99 will be held July 23-25 at the former Griffiss Air  
Force Base. More than 120,000 tickets already have been sold, and 
promoters expect 250,000 music lovers to attend.

<HEADLINE> Congress Asked To Aid Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man suspected of shooting a Florida mother  
in the face, slitting her throat and leaving her four toddlers 
crawling in her blood is putting up a vigorous fight against 
extradition from Mexico, Clinton administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida prosecutors are frustrated with the delay, but each of  
Jose Luis Del Toro Jr.'s appeals and legal challenges must be heard 
in the Mexican courts, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mary Lee 
Warren and Jamison Borek, a State Department deputy legal adviser, 
told a House subcommittee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke after James Bellush, the victim's husband, asked  
Congress for help in pressuring the Mexican government to hand Del 
Toro over to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice at times quaking with emotion, Bellush said he and his  
children have waited since November 1997 to see Del Toro brought to 
trial in the death of his wife, Sheila Bellush, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not allow Sheila to have died in vain,'' Bellush  
asked members of the House Government Reform criminal justice, drug 
policy and human resources subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was angry about the delay, subcommittee Chairman John  
Mica, R-Fla., ordered the staff to write to the Justice and State 
departments asking what they had done on the case and urging them 
to do more. He said he might subpoena Attorney General Janet Reno 
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to testify before the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren and Borek said the extradition is working its way slowly  
through the Mexican court system. The Mexican legal system gives 
defendants many more opportunities for appeals and objections than 
the U.S. system does. But each of Del Toro's challenges so far has 
been rejected by the Mexican courts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Bellush brought subcommittee members close  
to tears as he told them how his 13-year-old stepdaughter 
discovered her 35-year-old mother lying dead on the kitchen floor 
of their Sarasota, Fla., home on Nov. 7, 1997. Her 23-month-old 
quadruplets were huddled together, crying. Police said they 
apparently had been alone with their mother's body for long as six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe she was killed by a hired murderer. Two  
people have been convicted for their roles in the crime, and 
authorities say they have compelling evidence against Del Toro, a 
U.S. citizen who was arrested in Monterey, Mexico, weeks after the 
slaying. He was in Mexico illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities first said they would deport Del Toro to the  
United States, local prosecutor Earl Moreland said. But the day he 
was supposed to be handed over at the Texas-Mexico border, the 
Mexican government said he had been taken to Mexico City instead 
and U.S. officials should seek extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Department of Justice informed me that the Mexican  
government would not extradite Del Toro unless I would give 
assurance that Del Toro would not receive the death penalty if 
extradited,'' Moreland said. ``We agreed to waive the death penalty 
after talking with Mr. Bellush and filed the necessary papers with 
the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellush said the quadruplets -- now 4 years old -- still remember  
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell Timmy, Joey, Frankie and Courtney that Mommy is in  
heaven with Jesus,'' he said. ``They ask me if she is still 
bleeding.''

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Radar Problems Surfacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Power outages, faulty computers and software  
glitches have caused at least six serious air traffic control 
outages from New York to Seattle since January. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, passengers have been stranded overnight at  
airports, as happened to 100 travelers in Minneapolis earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, in Philadelphia in May, controllers lost  
radio communication with six planes, leaving one to say, ``Helpless 
is a pretty good description.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government says a $13 billion upgrade of the nation's air  
traffic control system now under way should reduce problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The work includes replacing work stations at en route centers,  
which control airplanes during the cruise portion of their flight. 
The Federal Aviation Administration also is replacing radar scopes 
and upgrading software at centers controlling planes within 50 
miles of an airport. The overhaul will not be completed until 2005 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new computer systems and work stations will be more  
reliable and easier to maintain and upgrade than the current 
systems,'' said FAA spokesman William Shumann. 
</P>
<P>
	After an outage in Chicago on May 5, the union that maintains  
the FAA's equipment had a bleaker assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outage highlights the fact that the systems are  
deteriorating,'' said Tom Demske, a regional vice president for the 
Professional Airways Systems Specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis on Tuesday, radar scopes continued to show the  
position of an airplane, but they did not show the normal 
accompanying data, such as an aircraft's flight number and its 
airspeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers responded by cutting the number of flights landing  
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from 60 per hour 
to as few as 28. That caused the delay or cancellation of more than 
100 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumann said an investigation was under way, but preliminary  
information indicated there may have been a problem with connectors 
in the radar system as workers moved equipment from a smaller 
control room into a new, larger one. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 17, a faulty computer processor caused the control tower  
at Philadelphia International Airport to lose part of its 
jet-tracking data up to a dozen times. That caused a temporary halt 
to incoming and outgoing flights. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 6, computer problems at the air traffic control center in  
Ronkonkoma, N.Y., on Long Island caused delays at the airports in 
New York, Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Philadelphia tower lost radio contact with  
six planes in the middle of the night after a human error during a 
test of a new generator. A backup didn't turn on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on May 5, United Airlines had to cancel 25 percent of its  
afternoon flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
after software the FAA had installed at its regional air traffic 
control center in Elgin, Ill., started to display only partial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had to revert to older software that was reliable but  
not certified to handle the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The year started on an ominous note, when a power outage at the  
FAA's regional center in Auburn, Wash., on Jan. 15 disrupted air 
travel throughout the Pacific Northwest and delayed flights for 
about 8,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, a backup generator did not work as planned.  
</P>
<P>
	Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the National Air  
Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing 
controllers, said the problems highlight the existing system's 
Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is real susceptible to outside interference, power  
outages, traffic from other radio frequencies,'' Schwitz said.

<HEADLINE> Parents Seek Out Disease Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How much does it cost to find a cure for a  
disease? 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Patricia Furlong wanted to know. Her two young sons  
were dying of a rare disease that kills boys, usually before age 
20. Her doctors, even the National Institutes of Health, said there 
was nothing to help. 
</P>
<P>
	The Middletown, Ohio, woman was aghast. Why, she asked, when  
scientists had discovered the key gene in 1986, was there still no 
good treatment? 
</P>
<P>
	Furlong decided parents, armed with little more than desperation  
and bake sales, might speed research of treatments for Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy. She illustrates a fledgling movement: parents 
fighting rare childhood killers by personally seeking out 
scientists and paying for research that they -- laymen, not doctors 
-- find exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	Furlong's Parent Project has raised over $1 million, helped fund  
Duchenne research centers at two major universities, and prodded a 
New York hospital to open a special clinic for Duchenne-stricken 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were good at begging,'' says Furlong, whose sons, just  
teen-agers, died months after she started the Parent Project in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	With bake sales and local golf tournaments, parents' fund  
raising is tiny compared with professional health-funding groups 
like the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which is spending $6 
million this year on Duchenne and a related disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Parent Project raises difficult questions. What does a  
cure cost? How do scientists explain to distraught families when 
the government spends more money on other illnesses than the one 
killing their loved ones? When nonscientists buy research, how do 
they know their money goes where it's needed most? 
</P>
<P>
	The hard truth: While adequate funding is crucial, more money  
poured into one disease doesn't mean a cure will come faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a Manhattan project. It's not an engineering project  
where if we just had a little more money, then we'd know the right 
path to take,'' said Dr. Gerald Fischbach, head of the National 
Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In science, ``you 
never know when the crucial breakthrough will be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases that cause muscle  
weakness of varying severity. Duchenne muscular dystrophy strikes 
about one in 3,500 boys. First toddlers have trouble walking. By 
age 12, most victims are in wheelchairs. Eventually they can't lift 
a fork or turn a page, and their respiratory muscles finally give 
out. Only steroid drugs have proved significantly beneficial in 
slowing muscle loss, but they don't help for long. 
</P>
<P>
	The culprit gene is comparatively large, and working with muscle  
cells is so difficult that only recently have scientists figured 
possible ways around barriers to gene therapy. They're also newly 
optimistic because of work on different proteins and stem cells 
that might one day help muscle regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that work results from basic research funding by NIH.  
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists say the parents' money is vital, too. The  
NIH underfunds Duchenne, contends University of California, Los 
Angeles, researcher James Tidball. 
</P>
<P>
	He counts four times more NIH grants for cystic fibrosis, a  
comparable genetic killer, than for Duchenne. Parents just took 
that complaint to Congress, prompting the House Commerce Committee 
to question NIH. 
</P>
<P>
	And parents alone now are raising money for UCLA to begin  
testing a drug in about 20 Duchenne boys in hopes of suppressing 
certain immune cells that seem to help destroy their muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischbach insists no good work in Duchenne has gone unfunded,  
but says NIH is discussing ``new ways to stimulate research'' and 
he'd like parents' input. 
</P>
<P>
	But for parents, research money is just one battle. They're  
frustrated at everyday difficulties in care. Furlong bitterly 
recalls doctors balking when her sons needed dentistry or other 
quality-of-life care. ``They said, 'What difference does it 
make?''' 
</P>
<P>
	How can parents get that help? The Muscular Dystrophy  
Association just published a consumer-friendly parent's guide to 
each stage of Duchenne called ``Journey of Love.'' And the Parent 
Project, which this weekend brings international Duchenne experts 
to UCLA for parents to question in person, runs an Internet site 
full of information: http://www.parentdmd.org. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to give these little boys a voice,'' Furlong  
said.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Sidelined by Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra  
could be sidelined for several days by a strained leg muscle, 
although he insists the injury will not force him onto the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra strained his left quad running out a ninth-inning  
triple Tuesday night in Boston's 5-0 victory over the Baltimore 
Orioles. The injury occurred as he was rounding first base. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not start Thursday night, but manager Jimy Williams said  
the player was available as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how serious it is yet. Hopefully we won't need  
him tonight,'' Williams said Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has an 11-game hitting streak, going 21-for-38  
during the span. He has 13 hits in his last 18 at-bats, and can't 
wait to get back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be a DL thing. That's for sure,'' he said. ``I won't  
let it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra missed 19 games last year and nine in 1997. He was  
replaced in the starting lineup Thursday by Lou Merloni.

	House Backs Flag Amendment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today voted 305-124 to allow  
legislation that would ban desecration of the flag, 19 votes more 
than the two-thirds needed to amend the Constitution. The focus now 
moves to the Senate, which in the past has resisted what supporters 
say is needed to protect the nation's symbol but opponents call an 
infringement of First Amendment free speech rights. Both sides 
agreed that backers of the amendment are one or two votes short of 
the 67 Senate votes needed for approval.

Milosevic today, saying he was trying ``to avoid war and bring 
peace.'' Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 peace accords for Bosnia 
and a frequent emissary to Milosevic before the NATO airstrikes, is 
expected to win easy Senate confirmation to the long-vacant post at 
the United Nations. This likelihood was signaled by the committee 
chairman himself, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who pointedly called 
Holbrooke ``Mr. Ambassador.''

independent inspection panel examines the project. A statement 
released after the meeting of the bank's 24-member executive board 
said the project, which has three parts and a total value of $160 
million, was designed to benefit 1.7 million of the poorest people

pleaded guilty to capital murder today. In exchange for the plea, 
prosecutors said they will recommend a sentence of life without 
parole for Steven Eric Mullins rather than death in Alabama's

so children can dive down and retrieve them. The Consumer Product

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mayor Anthony Williams was fined $1,000 for  
failing to disclose $40,000 he received last year from two 
consulting contracts during his mayoral campaign and his transition 
into office. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' failure to report the earnings on his financial  
disclosure statement violated a District of Columbia code, 
according to an order issued Wednesday by the D.C. Office of 
Campaign Finance. 
</P>
<P>
	While the act ``mayor's failure to timely file his financial  
disclosure statement was not deliberate but due to 'an oversight 
(that occurred) during the whirlwind of his mayoral campaign,' the 
office cannot minimize this matter because of the strong public 
policy concerning disclosure,'' the order said. ``Therefore, the 
maximum penalties were imposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams issued a statement saying he was wrong not to disclose  
his earnings and would pay the $1,000 with his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have stated, my inadvertent failure to disclose the fact  
of my outside employment earlier than I did was wrong,'' he said. 
``I accept the decision of the director of the Office of Campaign 
Finance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who had to resign his $118,000-a-year post as the  
city's chief financial officer to run for mayor, has said he 
accepted the two contracts because he needed the money to ``put 
bread on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts in question were for work with Arthur Anderson  
Company and NationsBank. Both were transacting business with the 
District government at the same time that Williams received income 
for services rendered to them.

<HEADLINE>  NASA To Use Female Space Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command a space  
shuttle mission, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, sees her flight 
next month as ``a great challenge'' in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being NASA's first female space commander, she has to  
make sure the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is delivered 
safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' she said during 
a break in countdown practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the 42-year-old Collins boarded Columbia for the  
final portion of the simulated countdown and, in doing so, became 
the first woman to take the commander's left front seat of a space 
shuttle. She has flown twice in space before, both times in the 
right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be the first woman to have the opportunity to  
command the shuttle. I don't really think about that on a 
day-to-day basis because I really don't need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying NASA's oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.''

<HEADLINE>  NASA To Use Female Space Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command a space  
shuttle mission, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, sees her flight 
next month as ``a great challenge'' in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being NASA's first female space commander, she has to  
make sure the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is delivered 
safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' she said during 
a break in countdown practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the 42-year-old Collins boarded Columbia for the  
final portion of the simulated countdown and, in doing so, became 
the first woman to take the commander's left front seat of a space 
shuttle. She has flown twice in space before, both times in the 
right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be the first woman to have the opportunity to  
command the shuttle. I don't really think about that on a 
day-to-day basis because I really don't need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying NASA's oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission originally was scheduled for last summer, but was  
postponed repeatedly because of problems with the telescope. NASA 
has yet to formally clear Chandra for launch because of the Air 
Force's ongoing investigation into the April failure of an 
upper-stage motor on a military satellite; Chandra has a similar 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Columbia takes off July 20 as planned, it will be 30 years to  
the day that man first landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a neat feeling to know that we're going to  
be part of that history and continuing on with the space program 
the way we are,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key dates in the antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corp., the  
largest maker of personal computer software: 
</P>
<P>
	1975 -- Microsoft founded by Paul Allen and Bill Gates, friends  
who co-wrote a programming language for the Altair hobby-kit 
personal computer a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	July 1994 -- Microsoft in a consent decree agrees to change  
contracts with PC makers and eliminate some restrictions on other 
software makers, ending a Justice Department investigation launched 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	August 1995 -- Microsoft launches Windows 95.  
</P>
<P>
	December 1995 -- Gates details shift in Microsoft strategy to  
focus on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	September 1997 -- Microsoft launches Internet Explorer 4.0 in  
stepped-up challenge to Netscape Communications Corp., whose share 
of browser market slips to fewer than two-thirds of Internet users. 
</P>
<P>
	October 1997 -- Justice Department sues Microsoft, alleging it  
violated the 1994 consent decree by forcing computer makers to use 
its Internet browser as a condition of selling its popular Windows 
operating software. 
</P>
<P>
	December 1997 -- U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
issues preliminary injunction forcing Microsoft to stop, at least 
temporarily, requiring manufacturers who sell Windows 95 ``or any 
successor'' to install its Internet Explorer. Microsoft appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	May 1998 -- Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general sue  
Microsoft, charging it illegally thwarted competition to protect 
and extend its monopoly on software. One state later dropped out of 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	June 23, 1998 -- A three-judge federal appeals panel removes  
restrictions that Jackson imposed on Windows 95 software, saying 
there was adequate justification to bundle the Internet browser in 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 27, 1998 -- Two government lawyers begin questioning Gates  
for 30 hours over three days in a videotaped deposition. Excerpts 
are shown in the courtroom during the trial, and Gates appears so 
evasive and forgetful that even the judge is surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	Oct. 19, 1998 -- The antitrust trial begins, expected to last  
only six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nov. 24, 1998 -- America Online confirms it will buy Netscape in  
a deal ultimately worth $10 billion, weeks after testimony in the 
trial from senior executives at both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 13 -- Government rests its case after calling 12 witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 3 -- In one of the trial's most dramatic moments, the judge  
admonishes Microsoft over a seriously flawed video demonstration it 
used as evidence. The company admits it edited together video 
segments so it appeared a single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 26 -- Microsoft rests its case, also after 12 witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	June 1 -- The final, rebuttal phase of the trial begins, with  
each side allowed to call three more witnesses each. 
</P>
<P>
	June 24 -- All testimony ends. Judge instructs lawyers to submit  
written arguments Aug. 10, and sets the next courtroom appearance 
for Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Revives Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying to reassert his  
voice in America's political debate after the Kosovo conflict, 
goading Republicans to tackle issues ranging from Medicare and 
Social Security to an increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will speak up Friday, first in a speech at  
Georgetown University and later at his first full-scale news 
conference since March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is very much looking forward to returning the  
spotlight on some domestic issues and his domestic agenda,'' 
spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has had to struggle to be heard for about 18 months,  
given the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his impeachment ordeal, 
followed quickly by the showdown with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic and NATO's bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the presidential race in 2000 and lingering  
bitterness from the impeachment battle, the Republican-led Congress 
is unlikely to warm to the president's proposals. Even so, White 
House officials believe Clinton's agenda could give Democrats 
political ammunition for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sharply political note, Lockhart said it was ``somewhat  
disappointing'' that some in the Republican leadership feel ``it's 
time to call off our business, it's time to ... get into the 
business of scoring political points and we'll resume in the year 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed for an example, Lockhart cited Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott's prediction in April that Congress would not deal with 
Social Security this year because he doubted that Clinton ``will 
really honestly address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president disagrees,'' Lockhart said.  
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, spokesman for Lott, R-Miss., derided Clinton's  
planned speech as ``a second State of the Union address.'' He 
suggested the president is trying to drive the domestic agenda only 
because of Vice President Al Gore's lackluster trot out of the 
Campaign 2000 starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is ``obviously trying to micro-manage the one chance at  
a legacy he has and that's Al Gore,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton would open a new campaign for assuring the  
financial stability of Social Security and Medicare, raising the 
minimum wage, tightening gun control, curbing teen smoking, 
adopting a patients' bill of rights to help Americans deal with 
managed-care health programs, and proposals to revive economically 
depressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
	A major White House initiative will be announced next week to  
provide prescription drug benefits for the elderly under Medicare-- 
a proposal that could cost many billions of dollars. Most 
recipients would have to pay a monthly premium to help cover the 
costs, although the White House said the poorest people would not 
have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats repeatedly have used Medicare in election years to  
flog Republicans. Eager to avoid more harm, the GOP is looking for 
its own plan, likely to be less costly than Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has asked the Senate Finance Committee to consider a  
bipartisan proposal rejected by Clinton that would provide 
subsidized drug benefits only for those living near the poverty 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides also are planning a whirlwind of presidential  
travel to raise his profile. He will appear in New York and 
Connecticut on Monday for political fund-raisers and then travel to 
Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 5, he will begin a tour of poverty pockets across  
America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, 
Arizona and California.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Elvis Stojko wants a fourth world championship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian figure skater said today he will continue competing  
as an amateur to try for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision is to compete again, going once again for the  
world championship,'' Stojko said at a news conference this 
morning. ``I want to keep pushing myself as an athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko will go after another world title in Brisbane, Australia,  
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old has battled through injury the last year and a  
half, from a seriously pulled groin muscle that hampered his 
efforts at the 1998 Winter Olympics to a broken collarbone suffered 
in a practice spill 1 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko is a two-time Olympic silver medal winner, three-time  
world champion and five-time Canadian senior champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stojko finished fourth at the world championships in  
Helsinki three months ago, and dropped longtime coach Doug Leigh 
last month.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT HOPE, Ohio (AP) -- On a recent weekday, workers at the  
glass-and-steel headquarters of Wayne-Dalton Corp.took a break from 
their jobs and went outside: A mare was foaling in a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the company has annual sales of $300 million as a  
leading garage-door maker, CEO Willis Mullet keeps it close to the 
cultural and religious roots of his family's Mennonite background. 
One employee in four at the company's Mount Hope plant is Amish or 
Mennonite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Willis' way of giving back to the Amish-Mennonite  
community,'' said David Osso, spokesman for the family-owned 
company, a farming community about 60 miles southwest of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	That community is associated with horse-drawn buggies,  
traditional farming methods and simple, old-fashioned clothing, and 
yet more and more Mennonites are, like Mullet, working in 
multimillion-dollar businesses, said Conrad Kanagy, a Mennonite who 
is an associate professor of sociology at Elizabethtown (Pa.) 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Wealth can cause members of the religion that prizes a simple  
life to wonder whether they are following ``the biblical principles 
in their stewardship of money and possessions,'' as called for in 
the Confession of Faith adopted in 1990 by the Fellowship of 
Concerned Mennonites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a relatively new thing for Mennonites to be  
wealthy,'' Kanagy said. ``They're humble people and some feel 
uncomfortable having so much money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Mennonites in general take Jesus' life very  
seriously and try to live that life. Christ didn't exhibit a lot of 
wealth and didn't even have a place to live. We're taught to be 
responsible with our wealth and be sure to use it to serve man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mennonite Church is an outgrowth of the Protestant  
Reformation and takes its name from Menno Simons, a Catholic priest 
in Holland who joined the Anabaptists in 1536. His work was so 
influential that those who followed his faith were called 
Mennonites. The group splintered in 1693 when a Swiss bishop named 
Jacob Amman left, and his followers became known as Amish. 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries, the two groups quietly made their living through  
farming. But as land becomes more expensive and scarce, some 
Mennonites are leaving the farm and entering the business world. 
Unlike the Amish, the Mennonites do not shun modern conveniences 
such as electricity, cars and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, rich Mennonites clashed with church leaders who were  
concerned that the business world was eroding their principles, 
Kanagy said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Herr, 75, was something of a pioneer among Mennonite  
businessmen. When his Pennsylvania potato chip business, Herr Foods 
Inc., started taking off in the 1950s, he said he tried not to let 
reaction from some church members bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to overcome whether I could be in business and be a good  
Christian,'' he said. ``The church grew in that area, too. The 
church now recognizes that they need business people as well as 
farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herr said he is still amazed by the success of his company,which  
he bought in 1946 for $1,750. The company now employs 1,250 people 
and generates about $150 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Thomas, marketing director and Herr's son-in-law, said  
Herr regards the business in the context of his faith, ``as a means 
to a greater end. It's a way to serve his community. At the same 
time, he continues to spread the gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other successful Mennonite businesses include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sauder Woodworking Co., Archbold, Ohio: maker of  
ready-to-assemble furniture; 3,200 employees, $500 million annual 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	--Palliser Furniture, Winnipeg: Canada's largest household  
furniture manufacturer; 3,600 employees, $325 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Dutch Corp., Walnut Creek, Ohio, owner of eight  
restaurants, two hotels and several gift shops; $33 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Charity among wealthy church members fits with church tradition.  
Mennonite Mutual Aid based in Goshen, Ind., is a major beneficiary. 
It distributed $25 million in grants last year, mostly to needy 
Mennonite congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really want to give back to the church and believe in  
living out their faith every day,'' said Judy Martin Godshalk, 
spokeswoman for MMA in Goshen, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	They live it in other ways, too. The religion teaches abstinence  
from alcohol and tobacco, and so Mennonite retailers typically 
don't sell these products. Their stores are closed on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	A group called Mennonite Economic Development Associates helps  
its members bridge the gap between business and faith, said John 
Longhurst, communications director of the Winnipeg-based group. It 
helps Mennonites handle business decisions that carry an ethical 
component, such as whether to lay people off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,600 MEDA members donate money so the organization can make  
loans to low-income entrepreneurs worldwide. Their efforts create 
or sustain 10,000 jobs every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're running the businesses not to make themselves rich but  
because they have a responsibility to the community, to the poor 
and to the environment,'' Longhurst added.

<HEADLINE> Real Quiet Favorite in Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Real Quiet, who came within a nose of  
winning the Triple Crown last year, drew the No. 2 post position 
Thursday and will face three rivals in Sunday's $1 million 
Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet was installed as the 7-5 morning-line favorite for  
the 1 1/4-mile race. Probable favorite Old Trieste was scratched 
Tuesday due to a foot abscess. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, second to Skip Away in last year's Gold Cup, was  
made the 2-1 second choice, followed by Budroyale at 5-2 and Malek 
at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet will be ridden Sunday for the first time by Jerry  
Bailey. He takes over for Gary Stevens, who is riding in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert dismissed Real Quiet's third-place finish to  
Behrens in the Massachusetts Handicap on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got into a little bit of a speed duel and was racing  
between horses,'' Baffert said. ``He didn't like that. The 
mile-and-one-quarter of the Hollywood Gold Cup, he'll like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Richard Mandella said he would add blinkers on Puerto  
Madero to get the 5-year-old Chilean-bred more focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had to get after him a little in his recent races,''  
jockey Kent Desormeaux said. ``The blinkers will make him do it on 
his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Cup field with jockeys: Malek, Alex Solis; Real Quiet,  
Bailey; Budroyale, Garrett Gomez; and Puerto Madero, Desormeaux. 
All starters will carry 124 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Steel Shipments Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports to the United States jumped 30  
percent in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday, two days 
after the Senate rejected a quota bill partly on grounds that 
imports were headed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the May numbers will give new life to quotas is unclear.  
Commerce Secretary William Daley, who had argued that quotas could 
start an international trade war, said the latest figures should 
not be cause for worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``One month is not reason to suddenly believe it's a trend,'' he  
told reporters. ``We didn't gloat on the month-to-month basis when 
a one-month statistic showed a drop in imports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the House steel  
caucus, said of the report, ``This just demonstrates that 
predictions that the steel crisis is over were premature at best. 
... I hope the White House now understands that relief is 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May's increase was the second in seven months. The Commerce  
Department said it was driven primarily by shipments from Brazil, 
Mexico and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign countries shipped 3 million metric tons of steel to the  
United States in May, according to the preliminary figures. That is 
30 percent higher than the final 2.3 million figure for April, but 
still 18 percent below November's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	From Jan. 1 through May, steel imports totaled 12.4 million  
metric tons, only a slight increase from the 12.3 million metric 
tons imported during the same period in 1997, before the Asian 
economic crisis lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to find outlets in a healthy U.S. economy. In the same 
period of 1998, the imports totaled 13.2 million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel mills buy some foreign steel as raw material for  
higher-value products. Such imports totaled 931,000 metric tons in 
May, more than twice the April level. They represented nearly a 
third of all imports last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and their steelworkers have blamed low-priced  
imports for bankruptcies at three U.S. companies and for thousands 
of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed numerous trade complaints accusing Japan  
and other countries of illegally pricing products in the U.S. 
market below production costs. The industry already won punitive 
tariffs on shipments of the industry's core product from Japan. 
Other cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that shipments from Japan,  
Russia and Brazil, the three targets of the initial round of 
complaints, all posted one-month increases in May -- Russia by more 
than six times. Steel shipments from Indonesia and South Korea also 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry sought stronger sanctions, such as quotas, but the  
Senate rejected that Tuesday, voting 57-42 against a motion to 
restrict debate on the quota bill, effectively killing any chances 
for passage. Supporters said afterward they had no plans to try 
again.

<HEADLINE> 'Puffy' Apologizes To Record Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap impresario Sean ``Puffy'' Combs has  
apologized to the record executive who claimed he suffered a broken 
jaw and arm in a beating by Combs and two other men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was embarrassed,'' the Grammy-winning rapper said Wednesday  
about the April 15 incident. ``That's not a normal action for me. I 
thought, `How could you be so stupid? This is not like you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs, 29, said he has ``talked everything out'' with the  
executive, Steven Stoute. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Combs, Stoute has approached the Manhattan district  
attorney about dropping the charges. Stoute's attorney, Thomas 
Puccio, issued a statement Wednesday: ``The matter has been 
amicably resolved to the satisfaction of the parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said no money was paid to Stoute to resolve the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	Combs, whose 1998 earnings of $53.5 million ranked him 15th on  
the Forbes magazine list of wealthiest entertainers, was due in 
court today to face charges of assault and criminal mischief. He 
could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said the incident was blown out of proportion: ``His arm  
was never broken, his jaw was never broken. I went in to argue, and 
I handled myself in the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said he was irate that Stoute let MTV air a music video  
with a possibly controversial scene that showed Combs nailed to a 
cross.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Lamb Imports Decision Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from the American sheep  
industry, the Clinton administration is in the uncomfortable 
position of deciding whether to impose stiff tariffs on lamb 
imports just months before World Trade Organization negotiations 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton may make an announcement soon within the next  
two weeks, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said 
Wednesday. A decision had been due June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are weighing what is the most appropriate and least trade  
restrictive policy,'' Barshefsky told a House Agriculture Committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate pits the U.S. against Australia and New Zealand,  
longtime trade allies. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the U.S. International Trade Commission, an  
independent trade regulator, ruled in favor of U.S. sheep farmers 
that low-priced lamb products from abroad had hurt their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	All six commissioners have recommended at least some level of  
protection, ranging from quotas to tariffs, for the four-year 
period sought by the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheep producers have said that during the first nine months of  
last year, 76.9 million pounds of imports entered the United States 
-- 19 percent more than the first nine months of 1997. Australia and 
New Zealand supply 95 percent of imported lamb, which now accounts 
for almost one-third of the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question Australia and New Zealand are critical  
allies,'' Barshefsky said. ``There is no question U.S. policy has 
been one substantially favoring free trade. In this case. . . I 
think it's incumbent upon the administration to think carefully 
through the remedy options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met  
with Barshefsky, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and 
members of Congress during a two-day visit, saying U.S. officials 
``don't want to kick sand in the eyes of their friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This delay is really weakening the confidence in our trade  
laws,'' said Cathy Cummins, spokeswoman for the American Sheep 
Industry Association. ``We feel we played by the rules. ... We 
don't think the U.S. government should sacrifice its domestic sheep 
industry simply to satisfy the requests of another government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who represents  
thousands of Texas sheep growers, introduced legislation Wednesday 
that would accelerate procedures for addressing import surges, 
saying the Clinton administration ``has dragged its feet in 
enforcing our current trade laws.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers to be on their  
guard against some of these common marketing techniques used to 
make false health claims about products: 
</P>
<P>
	--The product is advertised as a quick and effective cure-all for  
a wide range of ailments.

<P>
	--The promoters use words like ``scientific breakthrough,''  
``miraculous cure,'' ``exclusive product,'' ``secret ingredient'' 
or ``ancient remedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The text is written using impressive-sounding terminology to  
disguise a lack of good science.

<HEADLINE> Grenada Telephone Monopoly Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) -- A judge on Thursday upheld Cable &AMP;  
Wireless Grenada's telephone monopoly as it confronts new 
competitors offering cheap calls between the Caribbean and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Brian Alleyne ruled Spycecom, a ``callback'' service,  
had infringed on the monopoly guaranteed under a 1989 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Public Telecommunications Act unequivocally supports Cable  
&AMP; Wireless' exclusive rights to provide both national and 
international telecommunications services in Grenada,'' Alleyne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the company has ``preemptive rights'' over  
communications methods that haven't been introduced to the island 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	With Spycecom, customers dialed a local number to a computer  
that in turn contacted a computer in the United States. The U.S. 
computer then returned the call so that customers could enjoy the 
U.S. rates -- usually a fraction of the $1.20 per minute or more 
charged by Cable &AMP; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar callback companies have proliferated in Jamaica,  
Dominica, St. Lucia and other Caribbean countries where the British 
telecommunications giant has legal monopolies. The company has sued 
many of its competitors and is also attacking new Internet 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dominica, a judge recently ruled the company's monopoly was  
illegal. Cable &AMP; Wireless is appealing the decision.

<HEADLINE> Source: AOL, MicroWorkz in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is in talks with MicroWorkz  
Computer Corp., a maker of $200 personal computers, in a move to 
try to sell its Internet service to the millions of Americans who 
haven't bought computers because of the cost, a source close to the 
negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, while described as preliminary, could have important  
implications in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial in Washington, 
as MicroWorkz's inexpensive desktop machines don't use Microsoft's 
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, as the last witness finished testifying Thursday, a  
news report about the talks was introduced as last-minute evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its defense, Microsoft, which sells the operating  
system that runs 85 percent of the world's personal computers, has 
argued that AOL's $10 billion purchase of rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. illustrates that the high-tech industry is 
sufficiently robust that federal intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one possible result of the talks, AOL could offer MicroWorkz  
computers at easily affordable prices or even give them away to 
people who agree to subscribe to its service. That could vastly 
expand AOL's subscriber base, currently at 17 million, and make AOL 
machines an important new rival to computers running on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's service is currently available on Apple Macintosh  
machines, another non-Windows computer, but Apple only has about 10 
percent of the personal computer market share, according to the 
research firm PC Data. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL-MicroWorkz talks were first reported Thursday by the  
MSNBC Internet news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said AOL  
initiated the talks regarding MicroWorkz's inexpensive PCs as a way 
to try to sell its Internet service to the millions of Americans 
who haven't yet bought computers because of the expense. The 
negotiations come amid a major ``AOL Anywhere'' initiative to bring 
the online service to a range of computers and electronics gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Latman, chief executive of MicroWorkz, said the company was  
talking with AOL about a potential cross-marketing arrangement, but 
declined to elaborate. AOL spokesman Jim Whitney would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations comes two days after Seattle-based  
MicroWorkz introduced its iToaster computer at the PC Expo trade 
show in New York. The desktop computer uses a non-Windows operating 
system made by Be Inc., includes non-Microsoft word processing, 
spreadsheets and other programs, and easily jumps users to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to AOL possibly offering PCs to its subscribers,  
another scenario would involve AOL being prominently promoted in 
computers sold by MicroWorkz, aiming to entice users to sign up for 
its offering of information, news, chat and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL deal could help Microsoft bolster its argument that the  
Internet and new technologies represent a major threat to its 
software business. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL agreement to offer PCs to its subscribers also could seem  
to contradict statements by an AOL executive in trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial's final phase, Microsoft called as a hostile  
witness AOL executive David Colburn and questioned him about his 
company's plans to develop an ``AOL PC'' that won't use Microsoft's 
flagship Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn testified that plans for ``building a PC-type  
functionality that really is an alternative to Windows are largely 
dead. I don't know of any current ones (plans) going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara on Thursday noted Colburn's  
testimony and then showed the judge a news report about AOL's talks 
with Microworkz. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson raised 
his eyebrows and appeared to take notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current'' on industry  
developments, Jackson told Microsoft's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Klein insisted outside the  
courtroom that news of the discussions between AOL and Microworkz 
will not adversely affect the Justice Department's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no dent in the case, that's clear,'' Klein said,  
noting that Microsoft's own economics expert testified this week 
that the nation's largest computer makers have no viable 
alternative to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Microsoft lawyers labored long and hard to try to invent a  
threat from AOL,'' said Stephen Houck of the New York attorney 
general's office, the lead lawyer for the 19 states suing Microsoft 
with the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Mom in Switched Babies Case Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- The mother of one of two newborns switched  
at birth has filed a lawsuit against the maker of the 
identification bands used at the hospital, claiming the product was 
defective. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson filed the suit Wednesday in Los Angeles against  
Precision Dynamics Corp., the San Fernando, Calif.-based maker of 
the bands. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims the bands were so loose they slipped off the  
wrists and ankles of the two blue-eyed, blond newborns in June 
1995, and that nurses inadvertently switched the bands when they 
put them back on the babies. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were sent home from the University of Virginia Medical  
Center with the wrong parents, who did not learn about the mistake 
until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ms. Johnson filed a $31 million lawsuit against the  
state, the hospital and its staff. The latest suit sets no amount 
for damages, but claims the bands were designed so they could not 
be firmly attached around an infant's wrist or ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Precision Dynamics called the suit ``totally groundless.''  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear-cut case where the hospital staff failed to  
follow well-established procedures to ensure that identification 
bracelets are properly applied and monitored for snugness,'' Walter 
Mosher Jr., the company's president, said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch was discovered last summer when DNA testing conducted  
for a dispute over child support between Ms. Johnson and her former 
boyfriend showed the couple were not the biological parents of 
Callie Marie Conley, the child Ms. Johnson was raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Further testing showed Ms. Johnson and Carlton Conley were the  
parents of Rebecca Grace Chittum, a child being raised by two sets 
of grandparents because the couple that brought her home three 
years earlier had been killed in a car accident before the 
discovery of the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal maneuverings  
by Ms. Johnson, who also has filed a petition in Stafford County 
Juvenile Court to gain custody of her birth daughter, Rebecca. She 
is also seeking to legally adopt Callie.

<HEADLINE> Drought Emergency Declared in Ari. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- With grazing lands parched from the state's  
third-driest winter in a century, Gov. Jane Hull declared a 
statewide drought emergency aimed at gaining tax breaks for 
struggling ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of snow last winter and too little rain since then has  
stunted grazing grass and dried up ponds and other surface water 
sources, meaning many ranchers have had to haul feed and water to 
their livestock or take the animals to market early. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same dilemma facing farmers in the East, where a long  
spell of dry weather has officials and farmers worried about what 
the rest of the season will bring. 
</P>
<P>
	Portions of the South, Midwest and Northeast also are being  
slowly strangled by a spotty, but tenacious, drought that has been 
spreading for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	In New England, crops are withering in the fields or simply  
failing to sprout, while firefighters keep an eye out for brush and 
forest fires. The Southeast is suffering its second-driest spring 
in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull's declaration, issued Wednesday, is aimed at helping  
ranchers qualify for reduced taxes on livestock sales forced by the 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy summer rains would be a better solution, said Jeff Menges,  
whose family has ranches near Clifton and Safford in southeastern 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the relief right now,'' said Menges, whose family has  
already sold 15 percent of its herd. ``We didn't get any growth in 
the spring and winter because it is just too dry. We're hoping that 
the summer monsoon will just bail us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's winter precipitation this year was the third lowest  
since 1995, ``with an alarming pattern of below normal winter and 
early spring rain'' for much of the state, according to the Eastern 
Arizona Counties Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Streams have run dry or low in stretches, while lakes have dried  
up or are at dramatically low levels. Lyman Lake near Springerville 
is only at 2 percent of capacity, while the state's reservoirs 
overall are below 50 percent of capacity, the counties organization 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the East, farmers from Maine to Georgia are in a similar  
bind. East Tennessee cattle farmers, with rainfall nearly 4 inches 
below normal, are selling off stock because their grass is dying. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this dry spell continues, pastures dry up and farmers have  
to feed baled hay to their cows in the summer, we could really run 
into a hay shortage and problems this winter,'' said Gary Bates, a 
University of Tennessee forage specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather is a continuation of what many dubbed the ``Drought  
of the Century,'' which began last summer and caused $700 million 
in crop damage in Georgia alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of Georgia are 11 inches below average rainfall for the  
year and North Carolina's Piedmont region endured the driest May on 
record. New England states have had about a third of their usual 
rainfall for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	At Maxwell's Farm in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, manager Bill Bamford  
is irrigating 90 acres of fruit and vegetables with several farm 
ponds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have stuff that I planted that hasn't come up yet and stuff  
that's wilting in the midday heat,'' he said. ``I feel like I'm 
losing ground, because I can't keep up with the irrigation that 
needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As ever, the dry weather means an increased risk of fires. In  
New Hampshire, firefighters already have battled more than 1,000 
brush and forest fires since late March, compared to the average 
495, said Paul Leary, a forest ranger with the Bureau of Fire 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, there are an estimated 155,000 homes at risk from  
forest fires, the county group's report said, quoting Forest 
Service estimates.

<HEADLINE> Suit Says Trooper Fired Over Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Roberts, a former South Carolina state trooper, wanted to  
take time off to care for his newborn daughter. But his bosses not 
only opposed the idea, they eventually fired him over it, a federal 
lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit on behalf of Lance Cpl. Roberts marks the second sex  
discrimination case under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the 
1993 federal law that allows workers unpaid leaves to care for new 
babies or sick family members. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit Tuesday in  
U.S. District Court in Greenwood, S.C., charges that Roberts was 
prevented from taking a leave due to his gender, then fired for 
trying to take the leave. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first such case, a Maryland state trooper won $375,000 in  
damages in February after a four-year legal battle against bosses 
who denied him a parental leave. The Maryland state police's motion 
to set aside Kevin Knussman's victory will be heard July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases illustrate how men increasingly desire time off from  
work to spend with their children, yet how they face substantial 
pressures -- both perceived and real -- to continue to put work 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a case where a father's trying to take responsibility  
for a child, but being told ... 'Men don't do that,' '' said Andre 
Brumme, staff counsel of the ACLU in South Carolina. ``Men should 
have the same rights as women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU filed suit against the South Carolina Department of  
Public Safety, the agency that oversees the South Carolina Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts sued the Public Safety agency in July 1998, about 18  
months after he was ridiculed for applying for a parental leave to 
care for his newborn daughter. That suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	His commander told him that '' 'The man is the breadwinner and  
it is the man's responsibility to work, not to stay home with the 
kids,' '' according to the ACLU. Under pressure, Roberts retracted 
his request for a leave. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving several reprimands -- the first in his career --  
he was fired in the spring of 1997 for ``consistent failure to 
follow standard procedures and policies,'' the ACLU reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the birth of my first little girl and I wanted to be  
there,'' said Roberts. ``Looking after a newborn is not a vacation 
and I wanted to pull my fair share and give my wife the opportunity 
to get back to her new job and continue her career as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In countering Roberts' claim, South Carolina state attorneys  
have called into question the constitutionality of the Family and 
Medical Leave Act, saying that the federal government doesn't have 
the right to mandate states comply with the act. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 20 million people have taken leave under the federal  
law, which says all employers with 50 or more workers must allow up 
to 12 unpaid weeks off to care for a new baby or sick family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.4 million women take the leave each year, compared with  
500,000 men.

<HEADLINE> Father of the Iditarod Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Joe Redington, a plainspoken  
homesteader who was the chief organizer of the Iditarod Trail Sled 
Dog Race in its early days, died of cancer of the esophagus 
Thursday afternoon at his home in Knik. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Redington's name was synonymous with dog mushing in Alaska, and  
his devotion to the sport ran so deep that he will be buried in the 
basket of a dogsled, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his last words concerned the Iditarod's future.  
</P>
<P>
	```You keep the Iditarod going. I love the Iditarod.' That's  
about the last thing he said to me,'' Redington's son, Raymie 
Redington, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redington teamed with Dorothy Page to promote a race in 1967  
called the Centennial Iditarod Sled Dog Race, a two-day event 
covering about 50 miles around Big Lake near Wasilla. 
</P>
<P>
	He got more ambitious in 1973, announcing a race from Anchorage  
to Nome and promising a purse of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Redington worked to raise the purse up until the last minute. He  
sent the mushers off to Nome with a promise there would be money at 
the end of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Redington didn't run in the first race, but missed only one from  
1974 until 1992 and was on the Iditarod Trail Committee, the race's 
governing board. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his dog mushing work, Redington worked as a  
commercial fisherman and a miner. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Vi, sons Raymie, Joee, and Tim and  
daughter Shelia. 
</P>
<P>
	A commemoration of Redington's life will be held Saturday at  
Iditarod Headquarters in Wasilla from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The burial 
service will be private.

<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You ain't seen nothing yet. Vice President Al  
Gore says it. The stock market proclaims it. University studies and 
the Commerce Department confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet buying and selling is heading to the stratosphere, just  
as share prices of some Internet companies already have. One study 
estimates worldwide online sales might reach $1 trillion next year. 
</P>
<P>
	If perhaps you aren't impressed, consider that the same study  
estimated this year's purchases of online goods and services at a 
``mere'' $200 billion, and that there were none just a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And that Gore believes that in seven years, nearly half  
America's jobs will to one extent or another be related to 
information technology, of which the Internet is the core. 
</P>
<P>
	And further doubts about the growth of information technology  
and the Internet should finally be dispelled by the urgency with 
which the nation's revenuers are getting ready to impose taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-member Federal Commission on Electronic Commerce is now  
studying the situation, acutely aware of the huge possibilities for 
creative taxation and the necessity for acting swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
	As matters stand, states have little power to obtain revenues on  
out-of-state e-commerce purchases, their primary weapon being a 
warning that buyers must calculate sales taxes and forward same. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it what you will -- the technology, e-commerce, information  
or Internet age -- what was a seedling five years ago has rooted its 
way into every area of business and into millions of households. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by zealous entrepreneurs and users who, in retrospect,  
seem to have been awaiting their day in the sun, it has generated 
unstoppable momentum. For survival's sake, scorners become joiners. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Commerce Department study released this week says the  
broadly based industry generated one-third of the nation's economic 
growth between 1995 and 1998. That's past. The future: With nearly 
half U.S. workers in Internet-related jobs by 2006, there will 
hardly be a family unaffected by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact already is pervasive, and to some extent confounding.  
Economists, for example, had expected that by now inflation would 
have undermined the long expansion. But it can barely be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	There is only one likely explanation, conceded even by Alan  
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and chief 
inflation-spotter: Technology has enormously boosted output per for 
each hour worked. 
</P>
<P>
	It has changed the savings and investing pattern of households.  
It has created fabulous individual wealth. It has raised the skills 
and paychecks of millions of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It has flooded Washington and statehouses with revenue  
surpluses. It has bankrupted or left far behind businesses that 
refuse to join. It has changed the way students think and study. 
</P>
<P>
	It has created fears as well as hopes. Oldtime merchants with  
high-quality goods are threatened by upstarts that have yet to make 
a profit. Downtown merchants and mall-dwellers are equally fearful. 
</P>
<P>
	And we haven't seen anything yet.

<HEADLINE> Charges Against Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major allegations in the government's antitrust case against the  
Microsoft Corp. and the company's response: 
</P>
<P>
                         *BROWSER BUNDLING   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: Microsoft realized it had fallen behind in the  
market for Internet browser software, dominated by rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. To compete, Microsoft decided to include its 
browser within its popular Windows operating system, an example of 
illegal ``tying'' because a customer who buys one product is then 
forced to use the other. 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: It decided to ``integrate'' the browser into Windows  
because of consumer demand and technical advantages. The company's 
dramatic gains in browser market share came about because of 
superior software and missteps by Netscape. In a setback for the 
government, a federal appeals court ruled in June 1998 that 
Microsoft's decision to bundle its browser with Windows 95 was a 
``genuine integration.'' 
</P>
<P>
                         *NETSCAPE MEETING   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: In an illegal attempt to divide the market,  
Microsoft met with Netscape in June 1995 and offered not to develop 
a rival browser for operating systems aside from Windows if 
Netscape agreed to stay out of the Windows market. Netscape 
refused. Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen afterward compared the 
meeting to ``a visit by Don Corleone; I expected to find a bloody 
computer monitor in my bed the next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: Chairman Bill Gates calls the charge ``an outrageous  
lie.'' He said the meeting, a form of ``co-opetition'' by rivals, 
``was to discuss various technologies Microsoft proposed sharing 
with Netscape, so that Netscape's browser could take advantage of 
the cool new features we were developing for Windows 95.'' He also 
notes that Andreessen later wrote to a Microsoft employee: ``Good 
to see you again today -- we should talk more often.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *EXCLUSIONARY AGREEMENTS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: Microsoft, with its significant influence due to  
Windows, forced computer makers to sell its Internet browser as 
part of Windows. It also signed restrictive agreements with some 
Internet service providers to distribute its browser over 
Netscape's. And it encouraged other Internet companies to design 
content for its browser, but not Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: Computer makers were always free to sell PCs with  
Netscape installed, but they couldn't remove Microsoft's browser. 
The agreements with Internet service providers didn't preclude them 
from offering Netscape if customers requested it, but required that 
at least 75 percent of browsers they distributed be Microsoft's. 
Microsoft voluntarily waived the agreements this year. 
</P>
<P>
                           *'FIRST BOOT'   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: To force computer makers to help sell its Internet  
browser over Netscape's, Microsoft prohibited them from altering 
the Windows opening screen, which prominently featured an icon for 
the Microsoft browser. This deprived computer makers of customizing 
the PCs they sell to improve and differentiate their machines from 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: Computer makers are free to add other icons to  
Windows opening screen, including one for Netscape's browser. 
Restrictions on changing the opening screen help customers by 
giving them consistency. In addition, in the past, some PC makers 
had made changes that unintentionally disabled parts of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
                       *JAVA &AMP; SUN MICROSYSTEMS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: Gates was ``scared to death'' of the potential for  
Java, a programming language for software developed by Sun 
Microsystems Inc. that runs even on non-Windows computers, and he 
set out to ``pollute'' Java and distribute an altered, Windows-only 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: Microsoft's version of Java, which requires Windows,  
allows programs to run better and faster than Sun's version, and 
Microsoft's changes to Java were permitted under a contract between 
the two companies. Microsoft employees who referred to attempts to 
``pollute'' Java were using ``humorous shorthand'' to distinguish 
Microsoft's version from Sun's. 
</P>
<P>
                              *INTEL   	
</P>
<P>
	--Government: Microsoft successfully discouraged Intel Corp. from  
developing a new technology called native signal processing, a 
technique to use instructions from Intel's chips, rather than 
Microsoft software code, to run multimedia and communications 
programs more quickly. An Intel executive has said Gates was also 
``livid'' about Intel's investment in the Internet and wanted it 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	--Microsoft: Intel's NSP technology was designed for an earlier  
version of Windows and didn't work properly with Windows 95. 
Microsoft calls it ``absurd to imagine that Microsoft could bully 
Intel, a large, successful company with almost twice the annual 
revenues.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Euro, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro and other major  
currencies Thursday ahead of a meeting of the Fed's interest rate 
board next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0397, up  
from $1.0330 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.78 
Japanese yen, down from 121.92 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar followed stocks and bonds lower Thursday as fears  
that the Fed will raise interest rates at its meeting next Tuesday 
cast a pall over U.S. financial markets. Bonds and stocks have been 
declining all week after Fed chairman Alan Greenspan hinted last 
week that rates could be heading higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5336 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5469, and 1.4722 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4716. The British 
pound rose to $1.5888 from $1.5795. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8811 German 
marks, down from 1.8933; 6.3091 French francs, down from 6.3500; 
and 1,862.20 Italian lire, down from 1,876.23.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Revive Domestic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Returning to political battles after the  
conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton will use a speech Friday to 
try to revive his domestic agenda, from Medicare and Social 
Security proposals to an increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is very much looking forward to returning the  
spotlight on some domestic issues and his domestic agenda,'' 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will push his agenda in a speech at Georgetown  
University, his first public appearance since returning from a 
weeklong trip to Europe. In Colonge, Germany, the president and 
allies celebrated the formal end to the Kosovo battle with the 
departure of the last Serb troops from Kosovo. Even before that, 
Clinton had declared victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has been distracted from domestic priorities for  
about 18 months, beginning with the Monica Lewinsky scandal and 
then the impeachment battle, followed quickly by the showdown with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and NATO's 78-day bombing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, in a brief preview of the address, said Clinton ``will  
talk about the importance of getting things done this year and not 
falling prey to the idea that because of the political environment, 
we can't get important things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton would open a new campaign for overhauling Social  
Security and Medicare, raising the minimum wage, tightening gun 
control, adopting a patients' bill of rights to help Americans deal 
with managed-care health programs, and proposals to revive 
economically depressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
	With accelerated calendar for the 2000 presidential race and  
Republicans in control of Congress, it is uncertain how many of 
Clinton's proposals might be enacted. But even if his proposals are 
shelved, they still will arm Democrats with a political platform 
for the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of Clinton's program is a plan to provide  
prescription benefits for the elderly under Medicare -- a new 
proposal that will cost billions of dollars. Recognizing the 
political attractiveness of such a plan, Republicans are planning 
their own proposal but with less generouos benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is expected to announce details of his Medicare  
plan early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides also are planning a whirlwind of presidential  
travel. He will appear in New York and Connecticut next Monday for 
political fund-raisers and then travel to Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 5, he will begin a tour of poverty pockets across  
America, stopping in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, 
Arizona and California.

<HEADLINE> Report: Haskins Agrees To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins, at the center of allegations of  
academic fraud at Minnesota, has agreed to quit after 13 seasons as 
basketball coach, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Clem today and he believes that the president  
(Mark Yudof) would feel more comfortable if the program continued 
on under other leadership,'' athletic director Mark Dienhart told 
WCCO radio on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported that Haskins has agreed to  
quit amid allegations of academic fraud and other improprieties in 
the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story for Friday's editions, the newspaper said the details  
of Haskins' departure were still being negotiated Thursday night. 
But it said the main framework of the deal, which calls for Haskins 
to receive a buyout of more than $1 million, was finalized earlier 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof, who visited the coach at his home on Wednesday, was  
scheduled to brief the university's board of regents on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference was planned after the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemette Haskins, the coach's daughter, would neither confirm  
nor deny the newspaper report when contacted at her father's home 
Thursday night by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between university general counsel Mark Rotenberg and Ron  
Zamansky, Haskins' lawyer, which began more than two weeks ago, 
were continuing into the night to hammer out minor details, the 
Pioneer Press said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof had authorized Rotenberg to begin talks about a possible  
buyout of the coach's contract three weeks ago. The Star Tribune 
reported a buyout package could cost the university about $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof declined to discuss the substance of the discussions,  
saying only he feels ``sad about the whole situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began after the Pioneer Press reported in  
March that Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the academic 
counseling unit, said she did more than 400 pieces of course work 
for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. The probe 
widened to include allegations of improper payments and travel 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to alumni leaders Wednesday, Yudof promised ``some  
self-imposed sanctions'' would result from the investigation. If 
the university's investigation shows ``slam dunk'' wrongdoing, 
Yudof said, ``it's much better for us to act before we pass the 
file over to the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has three years remaining on a 10-year contract he  
signed in 1994 that was retroactive to the start of the 1992-93 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract entitles him to about $423,000 if he is fired with  
just cause. If he is fired without cause, he is entitled to about 
$1.3 million plus benefits, and also could sue for defamation of 
character and for revenue lost from his camps and athletic-shoe 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota hired Haskins away from Western Kentucky in 1986. He  
was widely praised for resurrecting the program, leading the 
Gophers to the NCAA tournament in 1989, his third season as coach, 
and to the Big Ten title and NCAA Final Four in 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Female Commander Set To Lead Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command a space  
shuttle mission, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, sees her flight 
next month as ``a great challenge'' in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being NASA's first female space commander, she has to  
make sure the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is delivered 
safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' she said during 
a break in countdown practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, when she boards space shuttle Columbia for the  
final portion of the simulated countdown, the 42-year-old Collins 
will be the first woman to take the commander's left front seat of 
a space shuttle. She has flown twice in space before, both times in 
the right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be the first woman to have the opportunity to  
command the shuttle. I don't really think about that on a 
day-to-day basis because I really don't need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying NASA's oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission originally was scheduled for last summer, but was  
postponed repeatedly because of problems with the telescope. NASA 
has yet to formally clear Chandra for launch because of the Air 
Force's ongoing investigation into the April failure of an 
upper-stage motor on a military satellite; Chandra has a similar 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Columbia takes off July 20 as planned, it will be 30 years to  
the day that man first landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a neat feeling to know that we're going to  
be part of that history and continuing on with the space program 
the way we are,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors' Group Votes To Form Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Leaders of the American Medical Association say  
the national labor union they are forming for doctors will give 
them back the autonomy that managed-care companies are taking away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physicians can't earn an honest return on an honest day of  
work,'' said Dr. Edmund Donoghue of Chicago. ``Doctors are taking 
orders from all kinds of people who have no medical training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA's 494-member House of Delegates voted Wednesday to back  
the formation of a union to give the profession more leverage over 
health insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies quickly predicted higher costs for all  
consumers: The move could add 2 million people to the list of the 
uninsured and push premiums up by more than 10 percent, warned Chip 
Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors favoring unionization portrayed themselves as  
saviors in an industry they say is increasingly dominated by 
bureaucratic bean counters instead of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My profession is being crushed under the rocks of rules and  
regulations, government influence, HMOs,'' said Dr. Jack Summers of 
Akron, Ohio, adding that labor organization is necessary ``to 
protect the rights of American physicians and to protect their 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, on the final day of the AMA's policy-making convention,  
the delegates: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Recommended that women in their 40s should get annual breast  
cancer screenings. Previously, the AMA had recommended that women 
ages 40 to 50 be screened every year or every other year, depending 
on whether they had other traits that put them at risk for breast 
cancer, such as a family history. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Declined to take a more active role in strengthening federal  
regulations for dietary supplements and instead affirmed a 
6-month-old policy in which the AMA pledged to work with Congress 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Resolved to study the effectiveness of antibiotics in consumer  
products, such as lotions, deodorants and household cleaners, to 
see if they promote drug-resistent bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars doctors who are not employees from forming  
unions in the traditional sense. Self-employed doctors would not be 
covered by the AMA's vote unless Congress approves pending 
legislation that gives them collective-bargaining rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who work full-time for health maintenance organizations  
or hospitals already can unionize, and have been doing so at an 
increasing rate. The AMA vote essentially puts the organization's 
stamp of approval on the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-employed doctors have faced the threat of antitrust charges  
of conspiring in restraint of trade if they tried to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky told the House  
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that creating an antitrust exemption 
could lead to price-fixing and boycotts by physicians, dentists and 
pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there are serious problems concerning the  
relationship of HMOs and other health plans to doctors and patients 
that deserve to be addressed, this proposal is the wrong 
approach,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the vote sought to reassure wary observers  
that the Hippocratic oath would still rule and that doctors would 
never abandon sick patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors will not strike or endanger patient care,'' said Dr.  
Randolph Smoak Jr., chairman of the AMA board of trustees. ``We 
will follow the principles of medical ethics every step of the 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, an estimated 38,000 to 45,000 doctors belong to  
unions, up from only about 25,000 two years ago, and experts 
predict the numbers will continue to grow. Those numbers are 
roughly 6 percent of the nation's 600,000 practicing doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now 25 states with private labor unions for  
physicians, and if the AMA does not involve itself now, with those 
that exist and those that will exist, ... then the AMA will lose 
its credibility,'' Dr. Michael Connair, a surgeon in New Haven, 
Conn., said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many unionized doctors are interns and residents and all work  
full-time for hospitals or health maintenance organizations. Their 
contracts cover wages and working conditions, much like other 
workers' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the nation's doctors now work in these type of  
salaried positions, with 80 percent of recent graduates taking such 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing AMA President Nancy Dickey said physician pay is  
typically a ``tiny'' part of contract considerations with managed 
care companies. The bulk of the agreements cover which drugs a 
doctor is allowed to prescribe, whether he can refer patients to 
specialists, how long he can keep patients hospitalized and whether 
treatments are medically necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we're going to be dealing primarily with issues  
other than ones that traditional unions deal with, and therefore, 
it's appropriate for us to go through a professional 
organization,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many delegates objected to the proposal because they said it  
would undermine their professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not mere laborers. We are not strikers,'' said Dr.  
Susan Wynn of Fort Worth, Texas. ``The banner we must carry is not 
the union label. It is the sacred oath we took when we became 
physicians.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Battling Internet Health Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of Americans relying on the  
Internet for health information, the government wants to ensure 
companies are not exploiting consumers with claims about miracle 
cure products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission announced efforts Thursday to crack  
down on fraudulent health products and encourage consumers to be 
careful when looking for medical advice on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope Americans continue to use the Internet for truthful  
information, but we also want them to have their antennas up to be 
careful about those claims that are exaggerated,'' said Jodie 
Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has tracked down about 800 sites that contain  
questionable promotions for disease cures. More than a quarter of 
those sites targeted by the FTC in the past year have either 
removed their claims or have been taken down, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said that as of December, more than 22 million U.S.  
adults had searched online for health and medical information. 
Twenty-nine percent of Americans use the Internet for medical 
information, with 70 percent of that group doing so before visiting 
a doctor's office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers most frequently search for information regarding  
cancer, followed by heart disease. A quarter of those who use the 
Internet as a medical resource join an online support group, 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FTC also has evidence that consumers are coming up with  
less-than-credible medical advice. 
</P>
<P>
	In cases announced Thursday, companies used the Internet to make  
false claims about a cure for arthritis made from beef tallow; a 
shark cartilage remedy to treat cancer and AIDS/HIV; and magnetic 
therapy devices that can alleviate high blood pressure and liver 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a veritable minefield of false and misleading  
claims,'' says Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group. He believes the FTC 
needs to put out regulations on acceptable wording for Internet ads 
for dietary supplements and other health products. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has received reports of some companies advertising  
health products on the Internet, even when those supplements have 
been deemed unsafe by the Food and Drug Administration and ordered 
off store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services is encouraging  
people to use the federal consumer health information gateway at 
www.healthfinder.gov as a reliable resource. The FDA has its own 
site -- www.fda.gov-- that consumers can search for additional 
information.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Prepare for US Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- Arber Halimi gave the correct answer to  
the question from his English teacher. Unfortunately, it was the 
wrong language: Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year-old Kosovo refugee was among nearly two dozen  
refugees who gathered around wooden picnic tables at the 
resettlement village Wednesday for English language classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arber, a star pupil, quickly gave the correct answer in English.  
He sat attentively during the class and, when teacher Carole Gavin 
asked if he was tired, promptly answered, ``No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary classes are offered day and night for refugees who  
want to learn or improve their English skills. The goal is to 
prepare for them for life in the United States when they leave Fort 
Dix. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to give them some basic survival skills they  
can use wherever they go,'' said Kitty Mizuno, who teaches English 
as a second language in Camden. ``It must be scary to be in a new 
place and not know what's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not an easy transition from Albanian, which has 36 letters  
in its alphabet compared to the English's 26, Gavin said. The 
refugees have difficulty with some vowel concepts, such as ``awe'' 
and silent letters that are common in English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So Gavin used simple exercises with pictures and words to teach  
her group vocabulary such as ``boring'' and ``fun.'' She changed 
activities to keep their interest and encouraged the refugees to 
practice saying the words aloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have had to be flexible. We as teachers have had to be  
flexible also,'' she said. The classes Wednesday were informal -- 
when refugees left to eat lunch or take a nap, others assumed their 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 of the 4,000 ethnic Albanians airlifted to the  
United States from camps in the Balkans have moved to communities 
across the country. About 1,300 remain at the military post. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it expects to place all of the refugees  
by the end of July and phase out Fort Dix as a housing center. With 
the conflict apparently over in Yugoslavia, the refugees eventually 
will have the option of returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Others choose to stay. Gavin, surrounded at one table by adults  
and children, taught them a little about life in the United States 
as well as its language by reading a story about a beautiful, 
millionaire model. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not normal. She is rich!'' a smiling Gavin told them.  
</P>
<P>
	A few feet away, a group of younger children learned how to  
count in English and write their names. An interpreter occasionally 
explained the question in Albanian when they appeared puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many girls?'' the teacher asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chica. Chica,'' they enthusiastically said, giving the word  
for girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters picked up the English vocabulary very quickly,  
while the adults occasionally struggled over the pronunciations. In 
Kosovo, the youngsters said, they began studying a second language 
at age 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by his two daughters, Adem Mehmeti, 40, a forklift  
operator, sat hunched over a donated language book. He carefully 
wrote words on yellow lined paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to learn English, but it is very hard,'' said his  
oldest daughter, Alberta, 13, who has amassed an extensive 
vocabulary in only three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizuno said initially the refugees learn to say their names and  
where they live, and how to ask for directions or tell someone if 
they're ill. They're also being taught about money, food, shopping 
and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they go out ... it's still going to be hard,'' predicted  
Gavin, a professor at Burlington County College in Pemberton. ``No 
matter what, it will be difficult for them.''

<HEADLINE>  Female Commander Set To Lead Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command a space  
shuttle mission, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, sees her flight 
next month as ``a great challenge'' in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being NASA's first female space commander, she has to  
make sure the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is delivered 
safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' she said during 
a break in countdown practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, when she boards space shuttle Columbia for the  
final portion of the simulated countdown, the 42-year-old Collins 
will be the first woman to take the commander's left front seat of 
a space shuttle. She has flown twice in space before, both times in 
the right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be the first woman to have the opportunity to  
command the shuttle. I don't really think about that on a 
day-to-day basis because I really don't need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying NASA's oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission originally was scheduled for last summer, but was  
postponed repeatedly because of problems with the telescope. NASA 
has yet to formally clear Chandra for launch because of the Air 
Force's ongoing investigation into the April failure of an 
upper-stage motor on a military satellite; Chandra has a similar 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Columbia takes off July 20 as planned, it will be 30 years to  
the day that man first landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a neat feeling to know that we're going to  
be part of that history and continuing on with the space program 
the way we are,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE>  Haiti Orphanage Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Gunmen demanding jobs seized an  
orphanage run by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide Thursday, 
holding it for more than 12 hours before surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fired tear gas over the wall of the Family is Life  
center, home to about 300 children, to bring the standoff to an 
end. Officers arrested about 30 of the attackers as they fled the 
fumes, but some suspects escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of any serious injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	The takeover began when a small group of young men who had  
graduated from the orphanage entered the center around midnight, 
armed with hand grenades, pistols and machetes, said a security 
guard, speaking on condidtion of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The assailants were demanding jobs and accusing Aristide of  
making money off their misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hour later, about 40 other protesters entered the  
orphanage, in midtown Port-au-Prince, the guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the protesters threw stones and bottles at passing  
vehicles, when police responded by firing tear gas. One police 
officer and four youths were injured in the hail of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lied to us!'' some of the protesters shouted to  
reporters, saying they had been promised work after graduation at 
18. Eighty percent of Haiti's 7 million people are unemployed or 
underemployed and there are about 4,000 homeless children in Port 
au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aristide is making money off us,'' they said, referring to  
local and international aid that Aristide receives to help run the 
center, which he founded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``The graduates are gangsters,'' Aristide spokesman Dany  
Toussaint responded on Radio Metropole. 
</P>
<P>
	He said they had been ``paid to create problems'' and smear  
Aristide's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials say the protests are aimed at creating unrest  
in the runup to November legislative elections that could help 
resolve a 2 1/2-year power struggle between opponents of Aristide 
and the man he hand-picked to succeed him, President Rene Preval.

	War Crimes Reward Offered  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department announced a reward of up  
to $5 million Thursday for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and other 
suspected war criminals indicted by an international tribunal. 
Milosevic was indicted by the tribunal in the Netherlands for 
alleged crimes by Serb forces against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
Meanwhile, NATO leaders basked in a jubilant reception in Pristina 
provided by ethnic Albanians, but noted that Kosovo's people face a 
long, difficult struggle to free themselves from the hatreds that 
grip the Serbian province.

	House Votes on Property Seizures  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police would have a tougher time seizing  
private property with suspected links to crime under a bill the 
House passed Thursday. House members voted 375-48 to set new rules 
for how the federal government seizes houses, cars, boats, cash and 
securities. Police have used civil asset forfeiture for such things 
as shutting down drug houses quickly by taking possession of them 
or hitting drug traffickers in the wallet even before charges are 
filed.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair laid out Friday his new strategy for breaking the deadlock 
that has thrown the Northern Ireland peace accord into crisis. In a 
detailed column in The Times newspaper, Blair said that a new 
Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland -- the central 
but long-stymied goal of the accord -- would depend on the outlawed 
Irish Republican Army committing itself to a fixed timetable of 
disarmament. Blair, who is scheduled to meet Irish Prime Minister 
Bertie Ahern in London before they both fly to Belfast to push 
together for compromise, has set next Wednesday as a final deadline 
to get the government formed.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In response to possible surveillance by  
suspicious individuals, the U.S. on Thursday temporarily closed six 
of its embassies. The embassies are to be shut down until June 27 
as a precautionary measure, an anonymous State Department source 
said. The embassies are in Gambia, Togo, Madagascar, Liberia, 
Namibia and Senegal. The department has received no specific 
threats targeted at American citizens overseas. But the 
spokesperson said they should continue to exercise caution while 
abroad.

	Protective Flag Amendment OKd

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to amend the  
Constitution to protect the U.S. flag, but the measure is likely to 
die in the Senate. The 305-124 vote was 19 more than the two-thirds 
needed, with supporters saying the flag can be safeguarded 
constitutionally without violating free speech rights. This was the 
third time in four years that the House has passed the measure. If 
the Senate does pass the amendment, it must also be ratified by 
three-fourths of the states.

	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- The sanctuary for mountain gorillas in the  
rolling foothills of northwestern Rwanda will reopen for visitors 
July 15, two years after Hutu rebel attacks forced the government 
to close it, the National Tourism Office said Thursday. The Volcano 
National Park that straddles Rwanda's mist-shrouded border with 
Congo and Uganda, is home to an estimated 300 rare mountain 
gorillas. The Volanco National Park, home to the largest number of 
the remaining mountain gorillas, was made famous in the 1988 film 
``Gorillas in the Mist'' about the activities of gorilla researcher 
Dian Fossey.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Brazil was less than brilliant Thursday in  
advancing to the second round of the Women's World Cup with a 2-0 
victory over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacking the crispness and finishing touch that is a Brazilian  
trademark, the South Americans got two goals from Sissi and some 
sterling saves by goalkeeper Maravilha. It was enough to clinch a 
spot in the quarterfinals and, with it, a berth in the 2000 
Olympics. China and Norway also have secured spots in the Sydney 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling, but it's not quite there yet,'' coach  
Wilson de Oliveira said. ``We still have another phase to complete. 
We're going to look forward to Sydney, and keep playing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in their opening rout of Mexico, the Brazilians started  
quickly. Sissi, who scored three times in the previous 7-1 victory, 
took a perfect pass from Nene and blasted a 15-yard left-footed 
shot into the top of the net just two minutes in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians continued to press the attack, but it stalled  
midway through the first half as their passes went astray and their 
shots were well off target. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 33rd minute, with Brazil's frustration at its own  
sloppiness mounting, team captain Elane tripped Patrizia Panico in 
the penalty area. Antonella Carta took the penalty kick, but the 
Italian captain sent it right at Maravilha, who made a hand save. 
Rita Guarino then headed the rebound over the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Maravilha twice collided with opponents in the rugged game, but  
both times the defense came to the rescue. And her teammates woke 
up in the second half to put away the Italians, who lost Carta to a 
head injury in a collision in the 58th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi got her second goal on a weak shot from 18 yards that  
fooled goalie Giorgia Brenzan, who was out of position for the 
twisting, slow shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to have qualified for the Olympics,'' said  
Sissi, who then looked ahead to the final round-robin game against 
the Germans. ``Germany should be the ones to be worried. We're 
going to play our game and shoot for first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy did find the net early in the second half, but Panico was  
ruled offside. The Italians didn't mount much of a threat the rest 
of the way and almost certainly will need to beat Mexico in its 
Group B finale to have a chance to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disillusioned,'' Brenzan said. ``We thought we could tie,  
if not win. Missing the penalty kick weighed heavily on us.''

Rita Guarino then headed the rebound over the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Maravilha twice collided with opponents in the rugged game, but  
both times the defense came to the rescue. And her teammates woke 
up in the second half to put away the Italians, who lost Carta to a 
head injury in a collision in the 58th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi got her second goal on a weak shot from 18 yards that  
fooled goalie Giorgia Brenzan, who was out of position for the 
twisting, slow shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to have qualified for the Olympics,'' said  
Sissi, who then looked ahead to the final round-robin game against 
the Germans. ``Germany should be the ones to be worried. We're 
going to play our game and shoot for first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy did find the net early in the second half, but Panico was  
ruled offside. The Italians didn't mount much of a threat the rest 
of the way and almost certainly will need to beat Mexico in its 
Group B finale to have a chance to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disillusioned,'' Brenzan said. ``We thought we could tie,  
if not win. Missing the penalty kick weighed heavily on us.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Plan for Penguins Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Penguins will stay in Pittsburgh under the  
ownership of former star Mario Lemieux under a plan approved 
Thursday by a U.S. Bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL had threatened to sell or fold the franchise if Judge  
Bernard Markovitz had not supported the plan. The decision makes 
Lemieux the first pro sports player of recent vintage to acquire a 
majority stake in a franchise he once played for. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan calls for converting $20 million of the $32.5  
million the team owes him for his years as its star into an 
ownership stake in the team. He will get a $5 million payment and 
forgive the other $7.5 million. Lemieux also said he would have $50 
million in new money to operate the team and satisfy some debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux would be the managing director, overseeing the franchise  
and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors but leaving day-to-day 
operations to management. He is expected to retain highly regarded 
general manager Craig Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he was reserving judgment for now on whether  
Philadelphia-based SMG Inc. would continue as the team's landlord 
at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan calls for removing SMG, which leases the Civic  
Arena from the Public Auditorium Authority for $350,000 a year, and 
subleases it to the Penguins for more than $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux argues the lease terms could make it impossible for the  
team to dig out of its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz said the two sides should continue negotiating and try  
to work out a new lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux saga began in October, when the Penguins became the  
first franchise in a quarter-century in any of the four major 
American pro sports leagues to file for federal bankruptcy 
protection. They also were the last team do so in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' financial problems began not long after former  
Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991 from 
Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., whose family also owns the San Francisco 
49ers. DeBartolo estimated he lost $25 million building the team's 
1991 Stanley Cup winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of cash, Baldwin relied upon a $24 million payment from  
the arena's management company, then known as Spectacor and now 
called SMG, to complete the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It was this $24 million, which apparently was written into the  
sales agreement as a lease to satisfy NHL requirements, that would 
later come back to haunt the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins won consecutive Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992 and  
the Presidents' Trophy in 1993. But there was trouble ahead as 
Baldwin lavished millions on players such as Lemieux, who signed a 
$42 million deal in October 1992; Kevin Stevens, Ron Francis and 
Tom Barrasso. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay the big contracts and keep the team competitive, Baldwin  
leveraged nearly every source of revenue. He reworked the lease 
with SMG several times and obtained upfront money from TV rights 
holder Fox Sports Pittsburgh, then called Prime Sports Pittsburgh, 
after losing a reported $20 million during the lengthy NHL lockout 
in 1994-95. He also sold off the team's merchandising rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin began easing himself out of the ownership picture after  
bringing in multimillionaire Boston businessman Roger Marino in 
February 1997. Marino pumped about $40 million into the team, 
keeping it afloat financially but alienating civic leaders, SMG, 
Lemieux and fans with a shoot-from-the-hip style. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino angered the city by signing a 10-year lease extension in  
exchange for nearly $12 million in arena improvements, only to 
secretly open relocation talks with several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux sued after Marino stopped payment on his renegotiated  
contract, which called for Lemieux to be paid even if he chose to 
quit early. He did just that in the 1996-97 season. Lemieux's $27.5 
million in unpaid wages made him, by far, the team's largest 
unprotected creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux began to quickly line up investors who kicked in an  
estimated $60 million. Marino agreed to pay Lemieux about $5 
million to settle the dispute over back pay and also joined what 
became known as Team Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL, fearful Thursday's hearing would come and go without a  
settlement, also filed a reorganization plan calling for the team 
to be sold and relocated -- or, as a last resort, to be folded and 
its players disbursed throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
	But NHL commissioner Gary Bettman repeatedly spoke in favor of  
Lemieux's plan, emphasizing the league plan was not to oppose 
Lemieux's, but to protect the NHL in the event of a last-minute 
breakdown in the Lemieux plan. NHL lawyers even sat in on the 
Lemieux negotiations with the creditors, SMG and TV rights holder 
Fox Sports Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's effort got a boost when Markovitz earlier this month  
threw out the Civic Arena lease, which was draining the Penguins of 
$6 million a year to play in the league's oldest building. He also 
ruled that SMG's deal with Baldwin was a loan rather than a lease, 
meaning Lemieux could free himself of all financial obligations to 
SMG simply by paying off the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also agreed on a  
renegotiated TV deal worth about $10 million a year to the 
Penguins. Under the deal, Fox Sports pulled out of a reorganization 
plan it had filed with SMG, leaving creditors to choose between 
either the Lemieux plan or the NHL backup plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations went down to the wire Wednesday night as Lemieux  
tried to forge an agreement with SMG that would keep the Penguins 
in the Civic Arena until a new arena can be built, possibly by 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux group sought the deal in part to prevent costly and  
lengthy litigation with SMG.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Makes Hockey Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	During his hockey career, Wayne Gretzky scored points like he  
couldn't wait. Now in retirement, he didn't have to wait long to 
make the Hockey Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two months after leaving the game, Gretzky was voted  
Wednesday into the Hall of Fame, which waived the standard 
three-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Gretzky were former referee Andy Van Hellemond, and Ian  
(Scotty) Morrison in the builder category. The three will be 
officially inducted on Nov. 22 in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously overwhelming,'' Gretzky said, ``it was a  
wonderful phone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's selection was no surprise. NHL commissioner Gary  
Bettman retired his famous number 99 after his last game with the 
New York Rangers. Not long after, the Hall of Fame's selection 
committee voted to waive the usual waiting period in Gretzky's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gretzky had some doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, it was a relief,'' the greatest player in hockey  
history said. ``Stranger things have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky is the 10th player in NHL history allowed to bypass the  
waiting process for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players who didn't have to wait the required three  
years: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay 
(1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuck (1971), Jean Beliveau 
(1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979) and Mario Lemieux 
(1996). 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, speaking at a conference call with the media, said he  
had fond memories of the hall as a boy. Gretzky lived in Brantford, 
Ontario, not far from the Hall in Toronto when it was located on 
the Canadian National Exhibition grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to stare for hours,'' Gretzky said. ``I never had  
enough of it. I never thought I'd be a part of it. I'm not sure too 
many kids think they'll be part of the Hall. It was beyond my 
wildest dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all his accomplishments, he has been the NHL's Michael  
Jordan -- an almost mythical figure who fans of all teams admired 
and packed arenas to see. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky had 894 goals and 1,963 assists for 2,857 
points -- 1,007 more than runner-up Howe scored in his Hall of Fame 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky also scored 122 goals in the playoffs and 56 in the old  
World Hockey Association to give him 1,072 in all, one more than 
Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who owns 61 NHL records, was a 10-time scoring champion  
and a nine-time MVP. He also helped the Oilers win four Stanley Cup 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with some great teams, great players,'' Gretzky said.  
``When you win, you get recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season in New York was one of frustration for the  
38-year-old Gretzky as he struggled through injuries and ``feeling 
more fatigue than I ever felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his retirement, Gretzky said he has had ``peace of mind. I  
miss the game, but I know in my heart I made the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said his major priority now involves moving his family  
back to California, where he has had a home since his years with 
the Los Angeles Kings, ``and maybe be an assistant coach on my 
boys' hockey team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has two sons and a daughter with his wife, Janet.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond was an on-ice official for 25 years in the NHL,  
officiating in 19 Stanley Cup finals. Morrison was president of the 
Hockey Hall of Fame from 1986-93 and also served as chairman before 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy and overwhelmed,'' Morrison said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond was not present for the conference call.

<HEADLINE> A Look at 1999 Hoop Hall of Famers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The combative John Thompson and the  
laid-back Kevin McHale are ending up in the same place: the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The outspoken Thompson said Wednesday he felt slighted when he  
was nominated and passed over twice before. ``It is something I 
wanted -- make no bones about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his strong political stands apparently hurt his chances  
in the past. ``I'll probably be remembered for all the things that 
kept me out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the 
things that got me into it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's other hall of famers are Cleveland Cavaliers  
executive Wayne Embry; Billie Moore, who made history by winning 
national championships at both Cal State-Fullerton and UCLA; and 
the late Fred Zollner, an NBA pioneer and Detroit Pistons owner. 
The inductees announced Wednesday enter the hall in Springfield on 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who endured racial taunts when he first fielded a  
predominantly black team in his early days at Georgetown, became 
the first black coach to win an NCAA title in 1984. Not one to shy 
from a fight, he boycotted two games in protest of NCAA Proposition 
42 in 1989, saying its financial limits hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Julius Erving, the Philadelphia hall of famer, seconded  
Thompson's complaints Wednesday about his delayed entry. But he 
added that Thompson didn't always fight his battles ``in terms of 
the standards of the Hall of Fame -- he didn't turn the other 
cheek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who was the Boston Celtics' backup center for Bill  
Russell on the 1965 and 1966 championship teams, arrived as 
Georgetown's coach in 1972 and inherited a 3-23 program. He quickly 
hired an academic adviser for his players and preached classroom 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next 27 seasons, his Hoyas teams went 596-239 as  
Thompson became an NCAA fixture, stalking courtside with a towel 
draped over his husky torso. Under Thompson, Georgetown made the 
NCAA tournament 14 straight times, played in three Final Fours and 
beat Houston for the national championship in 1984. Patrick Ewing, 
Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo went on to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	He surprised the basketball world in January, when he retired in  
midseason for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale established himself as a Celtics star for 13 seasons with  
Robert Parish and Larry Bird. With that trio forming one of the 
best NBA frontcourts ever, the team won championships in 1981, 1984 
and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale acknowledged Wednesday that his election had something to  
do with his teammates. ``If I had played for team `Y' out there 
that had never won a championship, I wouldn't be standing before 
you right now,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale's low-key style provided relief from Bird's intensity.  
Red Auerbach, vice chairman of the Celtics, said McHale was ``kind 
of easygoing, even though he was a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Parish, McHale at first came  
in as the sixth man. The 6-foot-10 forward, whose long arms helped 
him to shoot over the top of defenders, made his early impact in 
the pivot. But he developed an array of nimble offensive moves that 
eventually helped set a standard for big men and reach the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any doubt in my mind he would make it,'' said  
Bird, who now coaches the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds  
and shot 55 percent from the field. He made seven All-Star teams 
and three All-NBA defensive teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now vice president of basketball operations for the  
Minnesota Timberwolves.

<HEADLINE> Report: Compuware Founder Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two women who worked at Compuware Corp.,  
including a former human relations executive, have claimed that 
founder Peter Karmanos Jr. sexually harassed them, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine said in its July 5 issue that the  
company's board of directors fired the executive, Sheila McKinnon, 
in May 1998 after a report by an outside attorney could not verify 
her allegations. The other employee, Troy Strong, quit and claimed 
Karmanos pressured her to drop her complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmanos denied the allegations to the magazine. ``You sit here,  
running a company for 26 years, and then this,'' he told Business 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Compuware said Thursday that the company had  
not seen the story and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McKinnon sued Compuware and Karmanos after she was fired,  
the magazine said. Ms. Strong, who had been Karmanos' secretary, 
left Compuware a few months after Ms. McKinnon and filed her own 
suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company settled with Ms. McKinnon in April, but Ms. Strong's  
suit is still pending, Business Week said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmanos, 56, has guided the computer network and software  
company from a $9,000 bet with two friends in 1973 to sales of $1.6 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmanos has been hailed for donating more than $20 million to a  
cancer center named for his first wife, Barbara Ann, who died of 
breast cancer. Karmanos also owns the Carolina Hurricanes National 
League Hockey team.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Take Issue With Truckers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 250 members of Congress want the  
Clinton administration again to delay allowing Mexican truckers the 
unfettered access inside the United States spelled out in the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and labor leaders said Thursday many Mexican trucks  
remain unsafe and there are not enough inspectors along the 
U.S.-Mexico border to check all the vehicles carrying goods for the 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want to be driving in Michigan or Colorado or New York  
with your family and have an unsafe truck come up behind you with a 
16-year-kid at the wheel making $6 a day?,'' said James Hoffa, the 
Teamsters president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 pact that drew the United States, Canada and Mexico  
into a new trade alliance gave Mexico trucks unrestricted access to 
the United States, beginning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But that timetable twice has been pushed back, amid pressure  
from organized labor in the United States and concerns about the 
safety of Mexican trucks. Federal officials say Mexican trucks 
frequently do not meet U.S. weight, driver and insurance standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new date now is January, but 253 members of Congress have  
sent Clinton a letter urging more delay. The lawmakers say not 
nearly enough progress has been made to bring Mexican trucks in 
line with U.S. regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We write to urge you to maintain U.S.-Mexican border trucking  
restrictions,'' the lawmakers wrote Clinton. ``They are essential 
to our ability to protect the safety of the traveling public and 
our commercial drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers want current safeguards to ``remain firmly in  
place'' until the two countries can agree on safety standards, 
enforcement programs and adequate staffing levels for inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico has protested the U.S. reluctance to allow its truckers  
access, saying the delays violate NAFTA. Both countries have been 
engaged in talks, with the United States pressing Mexico for more 
aggressive truck inspections before the vehicles enter the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a  
telephone message left Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report last year by the Transportation Department's inspector  
general found inspections for only 17,332 of the 3.5 million trucks 
entering the United States from Mexico in fiscal year 1997. Some 44 
percent of those vehicles inspected were taken out of service due 
to serious safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found staff shortages at the 28 crossings on the  
southern border. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 13 federal, 55 full-time state and 42 part-time state  
inspectors were assigned to conduct truck inspections from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. border enforcement programs have not significantly  
improved and Mexican enforcement programs are still virtually 
nonexistent,'' said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Testimony Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testimony ended Thursday on the 76th day of  
the landmark Microsoft antitrust trial, a courtroom drama that 
offered a unique look at the nation's booming high-tech industry 
and the software giant that dominates it. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's final witness, economist Richard Schmalensee of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued forcefully that 
Microsoft Corp., with 1998 revenues of $14.5 billion, isn't the 
entrenched monopolist that illegally wields extraordinary 
influence, as portrayed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft was clearly engaged in a broad pattern of illegal  
behavior,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein told 
reporters on the courthouse steps. ``They used every trick in the 
monopolist's book. ... You name it, they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck of the New York attorney general's office, the  
lead lawyer for the 19 states suing Microsoft with the Justice 
Department, described the company to reporters as a ``malignant 
despot'' and said its behavior ``will justify a very significant 
remedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee buttressed his claim that Microsoft isn't a monopoly  
by describing a raft of competitors on the company's horizon -- the 
$10 billion alliance between rivals America Online Inc. and 
Netscape Communications Corp., handheld computers and a new 
generation of software running across high-speed Internet 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	But in what became routine during the trial, the company's  
witness was challenged again Thursday in a piercing 
cross-examination by David Boies, the Justice Department lawyer 
whose tough questioning has sometimes appeared to inflict upon 
Microsoft the courtroom equivalent of a computer system meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies produced handwritten notes from Microsoft's files quoting  
billionaire Chairman Bill Gates -- ``BillG'' -- in December about the 
prospective threat from the new AOL-Netscape alliance, announced 
just weeks earlier along with an important agreement with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL doesn't have it in their genes to attack us in the  
platform space,'' said Gates, his comments outside the courtroom 
once again seemingly undermining what his lawyers were telling the 
judge in court. ``If you want to lose sleep tonight, worry about 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee said he assessed the AOL threat from secret  
documents produced by America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara cited a news report --  
published just hours earlier -- that AOL was in early negotiations 
Thursday with a small company that makes computers that don't use 
Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current'' on industry  
developments, said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Thursday was the last day of testimony, the judge may  
not issue a final verdict until early next year. And the case could 
wind through appeals courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial started, the sides have met at least twice in  
unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement. Future talks are 
anticipated this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Using tens of thousands of pages of e-mails and other documents,  
the government sought to portray Microsoft as a cunning industry 
titan that illegally used its heft to undermine competing 
technologies and to discourage other companies from supporting its 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft responded that it competes roughly, but fairly, in a  
bare-knuckles industry with billions at stake. And it returned 
again and again to its argument that the government has failed to 
prove its actions hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence seemed to bear out both views, and also provided an  
intriguing -- and sometimes embarrassing -- glimpse beneath the 
veneer of the flashy high-tech industry. E-mails, handwritten notes 
from meetings and other paperwork revealed a take-no-prisoners 
business world where alliances are proposed, sealed and dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-founder of Netscape, Marc Andreessen, proposed combining  
forces with AOL in 1995 to ``kick the (expletive) out of the beast 
from Redmond,'' a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in 
Washington state. Sun's top executive, Scott McNealy, told 
employees to use his company's Java technology to ``charge, kill HP 
(Hewlett-Packard), IBM, Msft and Apple all at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates complained in e-mail that IBM executives were ``rabid Java  
backers,'' and in another message asked an employee bluntly: ``Do 
we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine 
Sun?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when AOL's chairman, Steve Case, wrote to Netscape's James  
Barksdale about an alliance in 1995, the two portrayed themselves 
as Allied powers during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, of course, was the Axis.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we fight them together we can win, and what a victory it  
would be -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' Barksdale wrote to 
Case, calling him ``Franklin D.'' Barksdale was ``Josef Stalin,'' 
but he complained, ``I don't like playing this part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although more than two dozen experts and executives took the  
stand, the witness most likely to be remembered never set foot in 
the courthouse: Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates -- shown by government lawyers in a videotape of a  
pre-trial deposition last summer -- appeared so forgetful and 
evasive in that tape that even the judge told lawyers in a private 
meeting, ``I think it's evident to every spectator that, for 
whatever reasons, in many respects Mr. Gates has not been 
particularly responsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With testimony finished, lawyers left the courthouse blocks from  
the U.S. Capitol to rest and to submit their written arguments -- 
expected to span hundreds of pages each -- on Aug. 10 in the next 
phase of the trial.

<HEADLINE> The Kosovo Kid Makes His Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Kosovo Kid is a fighter whose ``weapons'' are boxing gloves.  
</P>
<P>
	Elvir Muriqi wanted to return to his native land and join the  
Kosovo Liberation Army as his father, Ramiz, and his sister, 
Elinda, have done, but he was told he could call attention to the 
ethnic Albanian cause through boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional and amateur boxers long have been seen, and used,  
as standard bearers for countries and causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Soviet bloc nations for many years used major  
international boxing competition such as the Olympics as a 
propaganda vehicles. Cuba still does. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that if the Soviet bloc had remained intact,  
Muriqi would be a rising international amateur star as a member of 
the Yugoslavia national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Muriqi boxed as an amateur, but never had a chance to become  
known outside Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs didn't give us an opportunity to fight on the  
national team,'' said Muriqi, who lives in New York's Bronx, where 
his father owned a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	There was knot of vocal supporters waving Albanian flags last  
Saturday night when the 20-year-old Miriqi, a light heavyweight, 
boosted his professional record to 8-0 in a scheduled four-round 
preliminary bout in The Theater at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Muriqi has the stuff of champions -- and it doesn't take  
as much stuff as used to -- remains to be seen. He is in the capable 
hands of trainer Teddy Atlas, who helped develop Mike Tyson and who 
guided Michael Moorer to the IBF heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	If Muriqi, who turned pro June 19, 1998, has the talent to  
progress, there is no doubt he will be a saleable fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a taller Thomas Barker (1-1-1) in his last fight, Muriqi  
was the aggressor from the outset, and the fight ended at 2:03 of 
the second round shortly after Barker went down to a knee after 
taking a punch to the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is an entertaining fighter,'' said Lou DiBella,  
senior vice president of HBO Sports. ``He has a straight-ahead 
style. He's a great story. If he can continue to win, he will 
become an attraction. He has the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muriqi's father and mother and two brothers immigrated to the  
United States in 1994. The father then got the papers for Muriqi 
and his sisters to come to the United States on May 13, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiz Muriqi sold the cafe and returned to Kosovo 18 months ago  
to join the KLA, and sister Elinda returned to join it 4 1/2 months 
ago, according to Muriqi. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I retire, I will go home,'' the younger Muriqi said,  
obviously not contemplating an early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of East European fighters have done well since  
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Henry Maske, an Olympic champion 
from East Germany, became a star in the united Germany by winning a 
light heavyweight title. Konstantin Tzyu, a Russian living in 
Australia, won the junior welterweight title and is in position to 
again win a championship in that division. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are heavyweight contenders Oleg Maskaev and Vitali  
Klitchko of Ukraine, Zeljko Mavrovic of Croatia and Andrew Golota 
of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	These fighters, however, honed their skills as state-sponsored  
amateurs in international competition. Muriqi will have to learn in 
the chaotic world of professional boxing.

<HEADLINE> Weather News Pinches Grain, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid word that 
forecasts for a Midwest heatwave were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, July soybean futures fell more than 7  
cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and spring wheat rose had risen in the previous day's  
trading due to trader concern that hot, dry weather would damage 
newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters, who had been calling for unusually hot temperatures  
next week, now say that a high-pressure ridge in the Midwest has 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to  
$2.49 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; July 
oats fell 2 cents to $1.12 1/4 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 7 1/4 
cents to $4.58 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.05 cent to 63.42 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle broke even at 77.55 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
fell 0.98 cent to 51.72 cents a pound; and August pork bellies fell

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar inched down against the yen in Friday  
morning trading, erasing initial gains caused by speculation that 
the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates. Japanese stocks 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.88 yen by late morning, down 0.02 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 121.78 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 64.88 points,  
or 0.37 percent, to end the morning session at 17,563.44. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 41.57 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar started out slightly higher on expectations that the  
Fed's Open Market Committee, meeting next Tuesday, might raise its 
benchmark short-term rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also got a slight temporary boost from a comment by  
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international 
affairs, that seemed to show Tokyo supports a weaker yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no change in our foreign exchange policy. Our resolve  
is very firm,'' Sakakibara told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But by late morning, the dollar was little changed from late  
Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened four times over the past  
two-week period to halt recent gains by the yen, which will hamper 
the Japanese economy's ability to recover from its worst recession 
since World War II. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.90 yen, up from  
126.30 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were mixed, despite the  
decline on Wall Street. In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones 
industrial average fell 132.03, or 1.2 percent, to 10,534.83, as 
blue-chip shares dropped on fears of an increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is holding up well in spite of New York's fall,''  
said Toshiyuki Higashi, manager of investment information at 
Taiheiyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Exchange of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.11 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,413.24. The 
TOPIX closed up 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7350 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6950 percent, driving 
its price down to 100.56 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Oswald's Russian Files To Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Archives rather than intelligence  
and defense agencies should get first crack at KGB files on Lee 
Harvey Oswald recently turned over to President Clinton, says an 
advocate of public access to government documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oswald files -- a surprise gift from Boris Yeltsin to  
President Clinton -- will first be reviewed for material sensitive 
to national security concerns, while also taking into account 
privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The interagency review set up by the White House will consist of  
officials from the CIA, the National Security Council and the State 
and Defense Departments, NSC spokesman David Leavy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Martin, a lawyer for the National Security Archive, a  
private research group and library, believes the papers should go 
to the National Archives, which oversees assassination records and 
makes them publicly available. 
</P>
<P>
	``This procedure they are talking about is very troubling to  
us,'' she said. ``It's very hard to imagine any real national 
security considerations for withholding these documents from the 
American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While officials said there is no estimate when the public might  
see the material, Leavy said the White House expects ultimately to 
make the documents public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our approach would be to declassify and make public as much as  
possible,'' he said. He could not specify how long it would take. 
</P>
<P>
	About 85 papers, all in Russian, were turned over by Yeltsin on  
Sunday when he met with Clinton during the Group of Eight summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, a former Marine, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959  
and renounced his American citizenship. That attracted the 
attention of the KGB, which bugged his apartment in the Belarus 
capital city of Minsk, paid neighbors to inform on him and kept 
Oswald and his Russian wife Marina under constant surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB amassed a six-volume file on Oswald's activities in  
Minsk. It was sent to Moscow after the assassination but returned 
to Minsk after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents handed over by Yeltsin are thought to be the KGB  
files compiled in Moscow, said John Tunheim, former chairman of the 
government's Assassination Records Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, which went out of business last year, was created to  
locate, gather and eventually make public all known assassination 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim said the documents could shed light on what the KGB knew  
about Oswald and how top-ranking Soviet officials reacted when they 
learned that Oswald was the suspected gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KGB had sophisticated intelligence at the time. They could  
have uncovered facts that we didn't get,'' said Tunheim, who was a 
member of a board delegation that tried but failed to get the 
documents from Russia in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian newspaper published three documents from the files on  
Wednesday, the Washington Post reported. One was a handwritten 
letter Oswald sent to Soviet authorities seeking asylum in 1959. 
Another discussed the Soviet reaction to the assassination and the 
third described plans for attendance at the Kennedy funeral.

<HEADLINE> Tektronix To Split Into 2 Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILSONVILLE, Ore. (AP) -- Tektronix Inc. plans to split into two  
separate, publicly traded companies and sell its video and 
networking division. 
</P>
<P>
	One company will be based on the electronic and scientific  
measurement equipment that has been Tektronix's core product since 
it was founded in 1946 to make oscilloscopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The other will be based on the color printers and imaging  
equipment that has fueled expansion for Tektronix during the growth 
of the desktop computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to split came as Tektronix announced fourth quarter  
earnings of $24.9 million, or 53 cents per share, down more than 41 
percent from the $42.5 million, or 83 cents per share, earned 
during the fourth quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales also declined slightly, falling to $541.3 million for the  
quarter, compared with $557.9 million for the same period last 
year. For the fiscal year, sales declined 14 percent to $1.9 
billion from $2.1 billion in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tektronix chairman Jerry Meyer said the split was necessary to  
remain competitive in each market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, both businesses compete for management focus and  
investment dollars,'' Meyer said. ``This plan will allow each 
business to concentrate on its strengths and to respond with 
greater flexibility and speed to the needs of its customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new measurement company will be based in Beaverton and keep  
the ``Tektronix'' name. 
</P>
<P>
	The new color printing and imaging company, which has not yet  
been named, will be based at the current company headquarters in 
Wilsonville, just south of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tektronix is considering an initial public offering for about 15  
percent of the new color printing and imaging company prior to the 
end of its current fiscal year. The remaining shares would be 
distributed, on a tax-free basis, to Tektronix shareholders at some 
time after the offering. 
</P>
<P>
	After the companies are separated, Meyer will become chief  
executive officer of the new color printing and imaging company. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Neun, senior vice president and chief financial officer of  
Tektronix, will become chief executive officer of the new 
measurement company.

<HEADLINE> Salinger's Daughter Writing Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.D. Salinger has spent a lifetime obsessively  
guarding his privacy. This time, the intrusion is an inside job: 
His daughter is writing a book about her childhood with the 
reclusive author. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what Peggy Salinger plans to say is a closely guarded  
secret. The book is tentatively titled ``The Dream Catcher,'' a 
play on her father's novel ``Catcher in the Rye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Philip M. Cowan, said Thursday that it will be  
``an interesting book and I'm looking forward to reading it 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Salinger received an advance of at least a quarter-million  
dollars, The New York Observer reported. The memoir is scheduled 
for publication in the fall of 2000 by Simon &AMP; Schuster's Pocket 
Books. 
</P>
<P>
	The promised insights prompted the Observer to call the  
daughter's memoir ``Snitcher in the Rye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, a yen for privacy is a genetic trait in the Salinger  
clan. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney for Salinger's 43-year-old daughter wouldn't say  
where she lives. (``Let me put it this way, she doesn't live in 
Tibet.'') Cowan said he doesn't know what she does for a living or 
whether she is married. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect her privacy,'' her lawyer said. In any case, he  
said, he is not privy to what her relationship with her 80-year-old 
father is or was. 
</P>
<P>
	Pocket Books president Judith Curr has called Ms. Salinger ``a  
fabulous writer.'' ``She has a particular turn of phrase. I would 
call her lyrical, and I would call her insightful,'' Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Salinger barely escaped another breach of his privacy  
when letters he wrote to onetime lover Joyce Maynard were auctioned 
off. The 14 letters from the early 1970s sold for $156,500 Tuesday 
to a retired California software millionaire who promised to return 
them to the author. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger lives in Cornish, N.H., and has not published in 34  
years.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cub Santo in Chicago Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs radio commentator and former player  
Ron Santo returned to Chicago on Thursday and is receiving further 
treatment at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a mild heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs spokesman Javier Bedolla said Santo checked out of Denver's  
Rose Medical Center, but did not know Santo's condition. The 
hospital declined to release any information. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, a nine-time All-Star third baseman, admitted himself  
to Rose Medical Center on Monday after experiencing chest pains in 
his hotel room. He later showed improvement and was given 
medication for abnormalities in his heart's rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, a five-time Gold Glove winner with the Cubs, became the  
team's radio announcer 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo has a history of diabetes and recently underwent an  
angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one artery.

<HEADLINE> Speidel To Cut Nearly Half Its Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hirsch Speidel Inc., a maker of  
watchbands and jewelry, is cutting nearly half its work force 
because of lagging sales. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 of Speidel's 420 jobs at sites here and in neighboring  
East Providence are being eliminated, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Foley, Speidel's director of human resources, said  
there were a ``multitude of reasons'' for the action, including ``a 
lack of business and being competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a reduction in orders,'' Foley said. She said she  
couldn't disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
	Speidel makes metal and leather watchbands, along with chains,  
identification bracelets and children's jewelry. Speidel sells to 
more than 10,000 retail jewelry stores and mass merchandise stores 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes 18 months after Hermann Hirsch USA Inc.,  
an affiliate of an Austrian firm, acquired Speidel from Textron 
Inc. of Providence. After the deal was closed in January 1998, 
Hirsch transferred a New Jersey sales-and-distribution center to 
East Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	But labor problems erupted last August over contract issues  
involving unionized toolmakers, die casters and machine operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Speidel also faces competitive pressures. The U.S. jewelry  
industry has long protested that foreign jewelry makers pay 
relatively low tariffs to sell in the U.S., while domestic 
producers must pay high assessments when trying to sell in places 
such as Southeast Asia or South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Speidel U.S.A. was formed in 1904 by the Speidel family, jewelry  
makers based in Pforzheim, Germany. It was acquired by Textron in 
1964.

	Marines Kill One Assailant in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. Marines killed one person and  
wounded two others after coming under fire Wednesday night. No 
Marines were injured, but the shooting underscored the risks facing 
the NATO troops who are trying to restore security after 17 months 
of ethnic war. Meanhwile, foreign and defense ministers of Britain, 
France, Italy and Germany inspected mass graves and other sites 
Wednesday, seeing first-hand evidence of the brutality that raged 
across Kosovo until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted 
an international peace plan for the shattered province.

	Fieldrest Cannon Workers OK Union  
</P>
<P>
	KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- Textile workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon  
plants in the state voted in favor of union representation on 
Wednesday. Of about 5,100 workers, 2,270 voted for joining the 
Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, or UNITE, 
and 2,102 voted against. One weaver said she felt the union would 
give workers job protection in the face of plant modernizations. 
Another employee, Susie Lyerly, said, ``I don't feel we need 
someone to speak for us. I've been with this company for 30 years 
and I've fought this union for the last 25 years.'' Fieldcrest 
Cannon workers rejected organizing efforts four times beginning in 
1974.

closed as judicial officials opened an investigation to determine 
why hundreds of people who drank from cans produced there fell ill.

computers, cellphones, pagers and handheld organizers. In a speech 
at the National Press Club, Zarb -- the chairman of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the electronic 
Nasdaq Stock Market -- said officials are examining a number of 
structural shifts to allow it to compete in the market of the 
future.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency will likely  
order Credit Suisse Group to close its Japanese operations as early 
as next month for obstructing a probe into whether it helped 
Japanese companies hide losses, a newspaper said Thursday. The 
agency, which oversees Japan's financial industry, may also revoke 
the operating licenses of some member companies of the Swiss 
financial group, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported. An official

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Closing with a 10-5 run, the San Antonio Spurs  
defeated the New York Knicks 96-89 Wednesday night to take a 3-1 
lead in the NBA Finals. No NBA team has ever recovered from such a 
deficit in the finals. This was a true team effort, not just a 
bunch of guys riding along on the coattails of Tim Duncan and David 
Robinson, who scored 28 and 14 points, respectively. Mario Elie had 
18, Avery Johnson and Sean Elliott scored 14 apiece as all of San 
Antonio's starters reached double figures.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Owens and Reggie Sanders hit consecutive  
home runs in the fifth inning as San Diego beat the Los Angeles 
Dodgers 6-2 Wednesday night for the Padres' fifth straight victory. 
San Diego, which won the series opener 4-1, will go for a 
three-game sweep Thursday night. The Padres already are assured of 
winning their first road series of the season. Woody Williams 
pitched eight-plus innings, giving up two runs and five hits. 
Trevor Hoffman, who entered in the ninth with runners on first and 
second, got the final three outs for his 17th save.

<HEADLINE> Flockhart Returns to Stage Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before there was Calista Flockhart, star of  
television's ``Ally McBeal,'' there was Calista Flockhart, stage 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Now on summer hiatus from her hit TV show, Flockhart has  
returned to the theater in ``Bash,'' a trio of grim monologues 
written by Neil LaBute, director of such disturbing films as ``In 
the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plays, on view at off-Broadway's Douglas Fairbanks Theater,  
are a long way from sweet, insecure ``Ally'' -- and not nearly as 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	These three one-acts are short, superficial studies of evil with  
pretensions of Greek tragedy. The stories are horrific, but not all 
that compelling, primarily because they seem more like acting 
exercises than plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet give Flockhart and her two cohorts, Ron Eldard and Paul  
Rudd, credit for working hard during the star's vacation. Under Joe 
Mantello's astute, sensitive direction, they make the most of the 
works' theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart is up first, in a piece entitled ``Medea Redux.''  
You've guessed the plot already. It's police interrogation time, 
and a chain-smoking woman is giving the facts of her murderous deed 
to authorities. She details her affair, as a 13-year-old, with one 
of her high school teachers, a man who left town as soon as he 
found out she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman -- blue-collar and as she puts it, ``never the queen of  
education'' -- raises the boy herself. Loyal to a fault, she refuses 
to reveal the father's identity, but then, nearly 15 years later, 
goes to visit her long-lost love with their teen-age son in tow. 
The results are more than unsettling, but don't ring true. Wouldn't 
she have developed a bond with the youngster during the intervening 
years? 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart slums credibly, projecting a realistic low-class  
demeanor. She is not afraid to put herself out on a limb, even to 
the point of transforming herself physically into one scary-looking 
woman, haunted and almost demonlike in her appearance. Her tale is 
not nearly as riveting. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar story of loss, this time the death of a baby girl,  
anchors the equally uncomfortable ``Iphigenia in Orem.'' Eldard 
plays a twangy traveling businessman, talking to an unseen woman he 
has picked up in a hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The man talks about his young daughter's suffocation, which  
supposedly occurred while he was asleep in the living room. 
Intertwined with this tragedy is his employment history, spotty at 
best, which figures prominently in his story and provides one of 
the evening's few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Eldard captures the folksiness and ingratiating style of a good  
ol' boy slowly going to seed. He is a man who, underneath the 
smiles and handshakes, is misogynistic, especially toward the women 
who work with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet this story's horror also appears contrived, inserted into  
the story more to shock than explain. 
</P>
<P>
	After intermission, Flockhart returns, this time with Rudd, for  
``Bash (A Gaggle of Saints),'' dual monologues whose title has a 
double meaning. Two college sweethearts from Boston are in New York 
City for a big bash with some friends. While the girls celebrate in 
a ritzy hotel, the guys go to Central Park where they participate 
in a gay-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the most effective of the three pieces, primarily because  
of Rudd. He plays the vicious ringleader, initially with a boyish 
likability that turns sharply into something else. His sudden 
change, after getting laughs and support from the audience, makes 
the piece all the more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBute alternates between stark, matter-of-fact descriptions of  
the attack and details of a fun weekend in New York. The contrast 
is effectively pulled off by Flockhart, here buoyantly girlish, and 
Rudd, who finds the right degree of chilly banality to describe the 
man's evil deeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the considerable appeal of its actors, ``Bash'' offers  
an unconvincing look at the dark side of human nature.

<HEADLINE> Textile Union Claims Southern Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- A union claimed the biggest organizing  
victory ever in the Southern textile industry Thursday after an 
election to represent 5,000 workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent victory came in a state and an industry that have  
long been hostile to organized labor. Twenty-five years ago, a 
woman's organizing efforts at a textile mill 200 miles away 
inspired the movie ``Norma Rae.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it eventually would happen, but I didn't think it would  
happen in my lifetime,'' said Fieldcrest employee Tracy Moody. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fieldcrest Cannon workers voted Tuesday and Wednesday to be  
represented by the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile 
Employees. Four previous attempts in the past 25 years to unionize 
the workers had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Labor Relations Board still must validate the  
2,270-2,102 outcome. Both the company and union challenged about 
285 votes each. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history, it really is,'' said a disappointed Chuck  
Hansen, president of Pillowtex Corp., Fieldcrest's parent company. 
``Someone who writes history will add another paragraph to the 
book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney said it was the largest union  
victory in a Southern textile mill in history. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has one of the lowest percentages of unionized  
workers in the nation, 4.2 percent of wage and hourly employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unions, when it came to North Carolina, used to say, `Why  
bother?''' said University of South Carolina history professor Tom 
Terrill, who has written about labor issues in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has more textile jobs than any other state,  
166,800, a number that has been steadily dropping for six decades 
because of modernization, increased imports and the shifting of 
jobs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, UNITED won the right to represent 2,200 workers at the  
Tulex Corp. in Martinsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	This election was the first since Fieldcrest was bought by  
Dallas-based Pillowtex, and lacked the rancor of the earlier union 
drives dating to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor experts said the state's tight labor market might have  
been a big factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been talking to a lot of clothing manufacturers and one  
of the problems they bring up all the time is the shortage of 
skilled labor,'' said Ian Taplin, a Wake Forest University 
professor who studies labor-management issues. ``This could make 
management more tolerant about considering a union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taplin said UNITE did a good job of sizing up what it needed to  
do to win this time, including picking young, college-educated 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These ones are good at alerting the public about what is  
happening,'' he said. ``And they let the government know when there 
are violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1979 movie ``Norma Rae'' depicted the resistance that  
organizers faced while trying to unionize North Carolina textile 
workers. The movie, starring Sally Fields, was based on the real 
story of Crystal Lee Sutton's efforts to organize a J.P. Stevens 
plant in Roanoke Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	The top election issues here were $50 million in modernization  
and job changes that have occurred since Pillowtex purchased 
Fieldcrest in 1997 for $700 million. Union organizers said change 
was displacing workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon makes towels, sheets and comforters under the  
names Royal Velvet, Cannon, Touch of Class and Charisma. Pillowtex 
makes bed pillows, mattress pads, blankets and down comforters 
under the Ralph Lauren, Disney and Martha Stewart names.

<HEADLINE> Court Sets Aside Disability Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set aside a ruling Thursday  
that said New York officials had discriminated against a law school 
graduate who failed the state's bar examination five times. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling  
in light of their decisions this week limiting the reach of the 
federal Americans With Disabilities Act, which bans discrimination 
against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	In three rulings Tuesday, the justices narrowed significantly  
just whom the 1990 law protects. People with physical impairments 
that can be treated with medication or devices such as eyeglasses 
or hearing aids generally are not protected by the law, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York case acted on Thursday, the law school graduate  
had argued, successfully in lower courts, that her reading disorder 
qualified her for protection under the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
agreed with Marilyn Bartlett, a college instructor who earned a 
Ph.D. in educational administration from New York University 
despite her disability but has flunked the New York bar exam five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower courts ruled that the board of examiners, which  
administers the state bar exam, had discriminated against Bartlett 
by failing to accommodate her and now must pay her monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett, a teacher, had wanted additional time to complete the  
test and the right to mark answers for the multiple-choice portion 
in a question book rather than on a computerized answer sheet. Her 
requests were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law bans discrimination against a ``qualified  
individual with a disability'' because of that disability. A 
disability is defined as a condition that substantially limits a 
major life activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling last September, the appeals court said Bartlett's  
disability affects reading and learning, major life activities, and 
was entitled to some accommodations the first four times she took 
the bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reasonable accommodation of this disability will enable her to  
compete fairly with others in taking the examination so that it 
will be her mastery of the legal skills and knowledge that the exam 
is designed to test -- and not her disability -- that determines 
whether or not she achieves a passing score,'' the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge had ordered the board of examiners to pay  
Bartlett $12,500 in damages, but the appeals court told the judge 
to recalculate the damages in a way that will award her no more 
than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett, a graduate of the Vermont Law School, began taking the  
New York bar exam in 1991. She sued in 1993, and in July of that 
year was permitted to take the test with the accommodations she 
sought. She nevertheless failed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages award, however, was aimed at compensating Bartlett  
for the four times she was forced to take the test without the 
accommodations she had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Thursday, New York Attorney General Eliot  
Spitzer argued that a person ``suffering from a reading impairment 
who has developed self-accommodating techniques which allow her to 
read at a speed and in a manner comparable to that of an average 
person'' should not be covered by the federal anti-bias law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Bartlett urged the justices to reject the appeal,  
saying that it does not conflict with the ruling of any other 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is New York Board of Law Examiners vs. Bartlett,  
98-1285.

<HEADLINE> Childs Sits, Suffers at NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Childs bounced the basketball casually  
Thursday, first with one hand, then with the other, occasionally 
tossing it toward the hoop. As long as he didn't have to run after 
it, he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Land of Wounded Knee also known as the New York Knicks  
roster, Childs was the latest casualty with sprained ligaments in 
his left knee. He was able to play just seven mostly ineffectual 
minutes in Game 4 of the NBA Finals against San Antonio and may not 
be able to even do that in Friday's Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get treatment all day and all night,'' Childs  
said, ``Ice, heat, pray, whatever I need to be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One helpful fan suggested crystal oil. Childs seemed dubious  
about that idea. Still, at this juncture, he may be willing to try 
just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	On an already short bench, with Patrick Ewing sidelined by a  
partial Achilles tear, Larry Johnson already playing on a sprained 
right knee and Chris Dudley nursing a hyper-extended right elbow, 
the Knicks can hardly afford another injury 
</P>
<P>
	With Childs sidelined, point guard Charlie Ward was forced to  
play a grueling 41 minutes in Game 4 , far more than his usual work 
load. He scored 11 points, but just one after the first quarter, 
and missed a clutch free throw that would have tied the score down 
the stretch of a game the Knicks eventually lost 96-89. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie did a great job, but he wore down,'' Childs said. ``I  
need to be out there. It's disappointing not to play in any game 
but even more in the Finals. That was a must game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday now becomes the really must game for the Knicks, trailing  
the best-of-7 series 3-1 and facing elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the team's already slim eight-man rotation, Childs comes off  
the bench to spell Ward. He brings instant energy with him, as long 
as he can run. On Thursday, instead of running, he was walking. 
Slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Childs was hurt when he tried to overtake Tim Duncan on a  
breakaway following a New York turnover in Game 3. He tumbled on 
the play, landing heavily on his knee. He sat out the third quarter 
but played the fourth with the knee taped and the leg wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wrap kept it warm and loose,'' he said. ``It's the next  
day that it stiffens up and you're not able to practice or get a 
good warmup. It's like turning a car off and back on. Usually I can 
fight through pain. But the strength just was not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childs tried to play with a cumbersome brace protecting the knee  
in Game 4 but could not move freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to go,'' he said. ``I just couldn't move like I wanted  
to defensively. I couldn't slide. I didn't want to hurt the team by 
being out there and not being able to play defense. That is what I 
felt I was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he sat down next to Ewing and became a cheerleader. It was  
not a role he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mentally drained,'' he said. ``I wanted to play but I  
couldn't play. Now I see what Patrick goes through all year. He's 
done it for a number of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Childs grabbed a ball and stepped gingerly toward the  
basket, his mind racing if his body wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody got some crystal oil?

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks Hispanic Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Improving education and reducing poverty go  
hand-in-hand, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said in a call for unity 
and a bid for Hispanic support. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in  
Detroit's Mexicantown, Bush cited his proposals for charter schools 
and school vouchers in Texas as an example of how high education 
standards and accountability can work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they aren't learning, we ought to blow the whistle on  
failure,'' he said. ``It's important to free parents to make 
choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush arrived to the sound of Mexican folk music as he waded  
through about 300 people packed in a small park in a predominantly 
Hispanic neighborhood on Detroit's south side. 
</P>
<P>
	He began in Spanish, then abruptly changed to English.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you address education, you address poverty. The two go  
hand-in-hand,'' Bush said. ``I know if schools fail, the economy 
fails as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of the 30-minute visit posing for snapshots and  
autographing signs that read ``Viva George Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the Hispanic vote will be important next year, and  
equality and unity will lead to his success on that front. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message has got to be, 'The American dream has got to  
stand for you as well,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Elena Rodriguez, president of the Mexicantown Community  
Development Corp., said she was surprised Bush accepted her 
invitation to visit the area so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fully aware of the fact that demographics are changing in  
this country,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said later. ``That he has come here 
is significant because he knows we're on the way up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner in  
Livonia, Bush elaborated on the need for better education, saying 
he wants to give more authority to states to regulate and set 
standards for their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He also talked about the importance of the presidential office.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear not only to  
uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the dignity and 
honor of the office,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer  
called Bush's campaign of ``compassionate conservatism'' a cover-up 
for a ``right-wing, extremist agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's school voucher plan would ``rob public schools of  
valuable resources.''

<HEADLINE>  Heptathlon Leader Flops in High Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Shades of Dan O'Brien?  
</P>
<P>
	DeDee Nathan, the world heptathlon leader, didn't think the same  
fate that befell O'Brien in the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials would 
happen to her after failing to clear a height in the high jump in 
the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Nathan said after three misses at 5 feet,  
7 1/4 inches. ``I'll finish (the two-day, seven-event competition) and 
be in the top three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's far from where O'Brien finished seven years ago, when he  
went in as the favorite in the decathlon, failed to clear a height 
in the pole vault, wound up 11th and did not make the American 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are the qualifier for the world  
championships at Seville, Spain, in August, with the top three 
finishers in each event making the team -- provided they have met 
the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will work in Nathan's favor, even if she doesn't  
finish in the top three after Friday's final three heptathlon 
events. That's because she is one of only of two Americans -- Shelia 
Burrell is the other -- who have met the qualifying standard of 
6,000 points, and the eventual top three aren't expected to reach 
that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Nathan, the 1999 world indoor pentathlon champion,  
would be added to the team. She registered a career-best 6,577 
points at Gotzis, Austria, on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic,'' the smiling, confident Nathan said after her  
surprising flop in the high jump. ``I'm not discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high jump was the second event of the heptathlon  
competition. Nathan opened with the fastest time in the 100-meter 
hurdles, 13.23 seconds, worth 1,090 points. 
</P>
<P>
	She quickly went from first place to last with her high jump  
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her faith was rewarded in Thursday's final two events, the shot  
put and 200 meters. Nathan had the best shot put, 47-0 1-4, and ran 
the second-fastest 200, 24.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she still was in last place in the field of 11 with  
2,866 points, she trailed third-place Nicole Haynes by only 634 
points. That, she figured, would not be an insurmountable total to 
overcome in Friday's final events, the long jump, javelin and 800 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell was the leader with 3,585 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, who has cleared 6-1 in the high jump, was puzzled by her  
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue what happened,'' she said after passing at the  
first seven heights. ``I was lethargic for some reason. My bounce 
wasn't on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's finals, LaMark Carter won his second consecutive  
men's triple jump title, soaring a wind-aided 56-3 1/4 inches; Alan 
Culpepper, runnerup in the 5,000 meters the past two years, won the 
10,000 in 28:22.46; Dawn Ellerbe took her fourth women's hammer 
throw title in five years, setting a meet record of 212-5 on the 
final attempt of the competition; UCLA's Seilalu Sua, three-time 
NCAA champion in the women's discus, won her second straight 
national title at 203-8; and Elizabeth Jackson took the women's 
3,000 steeplechase at 10:07.23, the second-fastest ever by an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first five events of the decathlon, Chris Huffins, the  
defending champion, led Stephen Moore by 245 points with 4,523. 
Huffins ran the fastest 100, 10.45; had the best long jump, 25-1 1/4; 
was second in the shot put at 50-1 3/4; tied for first in the high 
jump at 6-11 1/2 and ran the 400 in 49.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five events -- the 110 hurdles, discus, pole vault,  
javelin and 1,500 meters -- will be contested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's victory completed a 1999 sweep of the U.S. indoor and  
outdoor titles. He also was third in the World Indoor Championships 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't competed in two months,'' Carter said. ``I've just  
been preparing for this meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper's triumph put pressure on his wife, Shayne, for a  
family sweep when she runs the women's 1,500 Saturday. Brad Hauser, 
the 1998 NCAA champion, finished second, and Abdi Abdirahman, a 
native of Eritrea who became a U.S. citizen this year, finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for the other guys, I didn't take any of the  
lead duties, which was selfish of me,'' Culpepper said. ``But as 
far as speed in the whole group, I knew I'd be the better one. That 
last 100 meters was the longest 100 of my life. I was tying up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel any pressure on the final throw,'' Ellerbe, the  
American record-holder at 230-2, said after breaking Windy Dean's 
meet record of 210-4 set last year. Runnerup Tamika Powell also 
surpassed Dean's old record, throwing 210-10. Dean finished third 
at 210-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was now or never,'' Ellerbee added. ``It was a  
matter of pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sua wasn't happy with her winning throw. She said she was  
bothered by the wind, but was delighted at making the world 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and thrilled at the opportunity to travel ... to  
Spain,'' she said. ``It's my first time, but I'm not looking at it 
as my last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400, was a late  
withdrawal because of a hamstring injury. Kym Carter Begel, the 
1994 heptathlon winner and a member of four world championship 
teams, also was a late scratch after straining a calf muscle while 
warming up.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Lansing To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing, out  
since May with back pain, is scheduled to have surgery next week to 
repair a bulging disc. He likely will miss the remainder of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that I think needs to be done,'' Lansing  
said Thursday, ``because then I take care of it, and I don't have 
to worry in the back of my mind next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The setback is the latest for Lansing since he was traded to  
Colorado from Montreal on Nov. 18, 1997. He played through the pain 
last season and hit a disappointing .276 with 12 homers. Lansing 
also had a bout with Bell's Palsy in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook appeared better in 1999 as Lansing hit .310 with  
four homers and 15 RBIs in 35 games. He showed more range at second 
base before the bulging disc compressed a nerve, causing loss of 
feeling in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to look at everything before I decided this -- the big  
picture and everything,'' Lansing said. ``I may not come back this 
year, and that could be the worst thing that happens. But I could 
be 100 percent next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing, 31, is in the second season of a $23.25 million,  
four-year contract. He also had back surgery in 1988 while playing 
at Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a different disc,'' he said. ``The MRI showed that my  
disc that I had previous surgery on is fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lansing's absence, the Rockies have used Lenny Harris, Kurt  
Abbott, Terry Shumpert, Chris Petersen and Chris Sexton at second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen and Sexton are playing at Triple-A Colorado Springs,  
while Shumpert and Abbott have combined for seven homers and 22 
RBIs in 31 games. The pair figure to get the bulk of the playing 
time as Lansing goes through his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Rockies decided not to place right-handed  
reliever Jerry Dipoto on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Dipoto has been battling back problems for the past two weeks,  
but an MRI and a bone scan were negative. He will miss Friday 
night's game in San Diego and plans to throw on the side Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Lawyer Examines Ex's Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer defending former Housing Secretary  
Henry Cisneros on conspiracy and obstruction charges sought 
Thursday to show the government's chief witness is motivated to 
cooperate with prosecutors to cut short a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness, ex-Cisneros mistress Linda Jones, said Thursday the  
government's special prosecutors have pledged to support reducing 
her 3 1/2-year prison sentence if she cooperates fully. But she denied 
that she had gotten prison furloughs, fancy hotel rooms, visitors 
or other special benefits since coming to Washington on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones signed an agreement earlier this year with Independent  
Counsel David Barrett's office in which she promised complete and 
truthful cooperation in the government's prosecution of Cisneros 
and two former aides. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Barrett has pledged to file a recommendation with a  
federal judge in Texas supporting a reduced sentence. He also will 
consider dismissing two remaining charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, questioned her about the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to do your best to cooperate with them in order  
to ensure this agreement remains effective, am I correct?'' 
Sullivan asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Ms. Jones answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from prosecutor Mark Jackowski, Ms. Jones said  
the agreement requires truthful testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who previously went by her married name Medlar, is  
serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a federal medical facility 
in Fort Worth, Texas. She pleaded guilty last year to 28 counts 
involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction after 
becoming a target of Barrett's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her earlier immunity was revoked after prosecutors caught her in  
a series of lies about evidence, including her false claim that 
tapes she secretly made of telephone conversations with Cisneros 
and provided to the government were originals. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified for four days this week at a pre-trial hearing to  
determine whether the tapes can be used at Cisneros' September 
trial on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing justice and 
making false statements to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor who headed the Department  
of Housing and Urban Development from 1993 to 1996, has pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	He was indicted in late 1997 on charges he conspired with Ms.  
Jones to conceal more than $250,000 in payments to her before and 
during his service in the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the stand this week, Ms. Jones had to admit repeatedly  
that she lied often during the investigation and in the legal 
proceedings involving her breach-of-contract lawsuit against 
Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the lies dealt with the authenticity of the 88 tapes she  
made as her relationship with Cisneros soured and she scrambled to 
obtain proof of his verbal commitment for financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	All 88 are copies, even though she represented the tapes as  
originals to FBI and agents of the Internal Revenue Service; the 
originals were destroyed long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified that as many as 10 tapes were edited to delete  
passages where she threatened to go public with what she later 
conceded was ``hush money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contends the tapes are inadmissible because they  
constitute ``tampered'' evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from prosecutor Jackowski, Ms. Jones said she  
never fabricated conversations by splicing together different 
sections of tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that was done was words were taken out,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros told the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet background  
check that he had given Ms. Jones financial support. But 
prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he never paid Ms. Jones 
more than $2,500 at one time or more than $10,000 annually. The 
indictment alleges that he paid her more than $264,000 between 1990 
and 1993, in installments as high as $15,000.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros' Ex-Lover Admits Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense lawyers are charging that the  
government's chief witness in the conspiracy case against former 
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros is lying from the witness stand 
during a pivotal pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' former lover, Linda Jones, has admitted over three  
days of testimony that she lied repeatedly in the past to federal 
agents investigating the former Clinton Cabinet member, as well as 
under oath during civil proceedings in Texas, to her lawyers and 
various media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the litany of lies hasn't stopped, Cisneros lawyer Barry  
Simon charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to bring in witnesses to say she is lying today  
from the witness stand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``From '94, in every way, shape or form, the witness has  
committed perjury, committed obstruction of justice, lied 
repeatedly to the FBI, lied repeatedly to the IRS and is in jail 
for lying,'' Simon said, adding sarcastically, ``and the government 
offers us this witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who previously went by her married name Medlar, has  
acknowledged a pattern of lies revolving around the authenticity of 
tapes she secretly recorded during phone conversations with 
Cisneros as their relationship foundered. 
</P>
<P>
	But she testified she had no choice but to repeat those lies to  
successive waves of questioners after her first misrepresentation 
of the recordings as unaltered originals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had gotten myself into a box and didn't know how to get  
out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she altered ``five or six'' of the 88 recordings  
to erase threats she made against Cisneros. After learning from her 
attorneys that the passages could prove legally troublesome, she 
said she edited out the threats -- and then had to lie again and 
again about the tapes' authenticity to protect herself. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, who must rule on the tapes'  
admissibility, expressed amazement at the web of lies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm astounded when I sit here and listen to what has happened  
in this case. I guess there are people in this country who don't 
know how to tell the truth,'' he said. But, he added, ``What I have 
to determine is: Is she telling the truth in front of me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' current credibility is key as the government presses  
to introduce 34 of the 88 tapes at Cisneros' September trial on 
charges he conspired with her and others to conceal from the FBI 
the scope of his payments to her. Sporkin's ruling will follow the 
hearing, which continues through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are key, prosecutor Mark Jackowski conceded Wednesday.  
``They are evidence out of the defendant's own mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cisneros' team contends the tapes are inadmissible because  
they are copies that have been ``tampered'' with, not originals, 
and because Ms. Jones had an unlawful intent in making them. 
</P>
<P>
	She admitted Wednesday that although she didn't initially  
consider Cisneros' financial support ``hush money,'' she later came 
to see it as that. ``I do believe now that, at the end, it was 
(hush money) because I was threatening him,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros acknowledged to the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet  
background check that he had given Ms. Jones financial support. The 
payments began after their affair was widely publicized, ending her 
marriage and career as a political fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors contend Cisneros falsely told the FBI that he  
never paid Ms. Jones more than $2,500 at one time or more than 
$10,000 annually. The indictment alleges that he paid her more than 
$264,000 between 1990 and 1993, in installments as high as $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996, pleaded  
innocent after being indicted in December 1997 on 18 felony counts 
of conspiracy, obstructing justice and making false statements to 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' misrepresentation about the tapes landed her in hot  
water with the special prosecutors, who had initially provided her 
immunity. She pleaded guilty last year to fraud, conspiracy, money 
laundering and obstruction, and is serving a 3 1/2-year prison 
sentence at a federal medical facility in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on her cooperation at trial, she could be freed early from  
prison.

<HEADLINE> Justices Rule for NY Public School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to  
require a public school in New York to rent its building to a 
church congregation for Sunday worship services. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which lawyers  
for the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Far Rockaway, N.Y., argued the 
school unlawfully discriminates against religion by allowing its 
building to be used after hours for non-religious purposes but not 
for worship. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation sought to rent an elementary school's  
auditorium, classrooms and cafeteria for worship services each 
Sunday in June 1994 after deciding it needed more room for its 
growing membership. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials refused to rent to the congregation, citing its  
policy and a state law that bar religious worship services in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The school allows community groups such as the American Legion  
to rent space for after-hours activities. School officials also 
said religious services were mistakenly allowed several times 
before late 1994, when officials revised approval procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Full Gospel Tabernacle sued in federal court, saying school  
officials violated the church's right to free speech and free 
exercise of religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled against the church, relying on a 1998  
decision in which the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to 
force a Bronx public school to rent its building for worship 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said excluding worship services was reasonable and did  
not violate the church's free-speech rights. The 2nd Circuit court 
upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Thursday, the church's lawyers said the  
policy amounted to ``blatant anti-religious discrimination,'' 
adding that the Constitution requires government to be neutral -- 
not hostile -- toward religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district's lawyers said adoption of the church's  
argument would mean that a school that opened its doors to public 
discussion of any subject also would have to allow religious 
services.

<HEADLINE> CDC Sees Fewer Anonymous HIV Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fewer Americans are choosing to remain anonymous  
when tested for HIV at federally funded clinics, hospitals and 
prisons -- a sign that the stigma attached to AIDS may be waning, 
the government reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states, people can get tested for the AIDS virus without  
giving their names. But the number of federally funded anonymous 
tests declined nearly 27 percent between 1995 and 1997, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons perhaps is that people are beginning to see  
HIV as more of a treatable condition and perhaps less of a 
stigmatizing disease,'' said Robert Janssen, deputy director of HIV 
and AIDS prevention at the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline coincides with the emergence of powerful drugs that  
have allowed HIV patients to live longer, more normal lives. Also, 
new laws and regulations have been designed to protect the 
confidentiality of people who give their names when tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The study period also includes the arrival of the home AIDS  
test, which went on the market in 1996 and gave people another 
option for checking their HIV status anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC looked at 6.3 million HIV tests conducted at health  
clinics, hospitals, drug treatment centers and prisons. Those sites 
conduct about 15 percent of HIV tests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Federally funded HIV tests declined 8 percent overall, from 2.5  
million tests in 1995 to 2.3 million in 1997. The drop could 
reflect the wider options available for testing and a growing 
population that has been tested and doesn't feel the need to do it 
again, Janssen said.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Plant Stakes Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. and New York  
State Electric &AMP; Gas Corp. are selling their interests in the Nine 
Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear plants to an international power 
conglomerate for $163.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Once ranked among the nation's worst-run plants, the two Nine  
Mile Point plants have operated at record levels in recent years. 
Both reactors are located on Lake Ontario, about 45 miles north of 
Syracuse, in a complex that also includes the state-owned James A. 
FitzPatrick nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
	AmerGen, a partnership between British Energy PLC and PECO  
Energy Co. of Philadelphia, will pay Niagara Mohawk $63.6 million 
for its 41 percent ownership share of Nine Mile 2 and NYSEG will 
receive $27.9 million for its 18 percent ownership share. Three 
other utilities that own a part of Nine Mile 2 were not involved in 
the sale that was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Niagara Mohawk also will receive $71 .7 million for Nine Mile 1,  
which it wholly owns and operates. 
</P>
<P>
	AmerGen chief executive officer Dickinson M. Smith said the  
company will continue to run both Nine Mile Point plants, which 
employ 1,330 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale will protect customers and shareholders from  
unforeseen operating and decommissioning costs. In addition, the 
sale to AmerGen puts the plants in the hands of a proven operator 
committed to pursuing growth in the nuclear generation business,'' 
said William E. Davis, Niagara Mohawk's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	AmerGen was formed in 1997 as a joint venture by PECO Energy,  
one of the nation's largest utilities, and the Edinburgh, 
Scotland-based British Energy, the United Kingdom's largest power 
generator, to purchase and operate nuclear plants in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia-based AmerGen also has deals pending to buy  
three other nuclear plants: Clinton Power Station in Illinois, 
Vermont Yankee in Vermont and Three Mile Island Unit 1 in 
Pennsylvania. AmerGen's goal is to buy about 20 nuclear plants in 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said it would take six to nine months to receive the  
necessary regulatory approval for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Niagara Mohawk and NYSEG, the other Nine Mile 2  
co-owners are Long Island Power Authority (18 percent), Rochester 
Gas and Electric Corp. (14 percent) and Central Hudson Gas &AMP; 
Electric Corp. (9 percent). Options available to the co-owners 
include matching the AmerGen offer, participating in the sale, or 
retaining their ownership interest. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deregulation of the power industry in New York,  
both Niagara Mohawk and NYSEG decided last year to get out of the 
energy production business and energy suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Laws Don't Reduce Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reducing by one drink the alcohol it takes to  
become legally drunk doesn't conclusively reduce the number or 
severity of alcohol-related crashes, according to a new government 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding challenges statements by President Clinton last year  
in advocating 0.08 percent blood alcohol content as a nationwide 
standard for legal drunkenness rather than the 0.1 percent limit in 
effect in two-thirds of the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all states lower their BAC (blood-alcohol content) to .08,  
it will result in 600 fewer alcohol-related deaths each year,'' 
Clinton said, citing a 1996 university study. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, an investigative arms of  
Congress, said in a report Wednesday that such claims cannot be 
supported. Research to date has used flawed methodology or ignored 
other factors that could contribute to a lower fatality count, the 
congressional auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A .08 BAC law can be an important component of a state's  
overall highway safety program, but a .08 BAC law alone is not a 
`silver bullet,''' the GAO wrote. ``Highway safety research shows 
that the best countermeasure against drunken driving is a 
combination of laws, sustained public education and vigorous 
enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Data from the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board indicates that  
the lower standard for many people translates into having one less 
drink before reaching legal drunkennesss. It defined a drink as 
1.25 ounces of 80-proof liquor, 12 ounces of beer or 5 ounces of 
table wine. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Marcelline Burns of the independent Southern California  
Research Institute says several factors beyond the number of drinks 
determine blood-alcohol content: a person's size, sex, body, the 
time over which drinks were consumed and how much food was taken 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no easy answer,'' Burns warned. If people are worried  
about hitting the blood alcohol limits, ``they need to eat and to 
pace their drinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebuttal to the report, the Transportation Department said  
a series of studies ``provided positive, if not conclusive, results 
and formed a reasonable basis for supporting .08 BAC laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department also said it has consistently supported a broad  
approach to combating drunken driving, including public education 
and stricter law enforcement in addition to a lower blood-alcohol 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading drunken driving group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving,  
said the GAO report supported its call for a comprehensive approach 
to fighting drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``All research is equivocal and, by definition, inconclusive,''  
said MADD President Karolyn Nunnallee. ``The fact is, all research 
to date points in the same direction: .08 laws are effective in 
reducing alcohol-related traffic fatalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia have laws making  
it illegal for people to operate an automobile if their blood 
contains 1/10th of 1 percent alcohol. Sixteen states have a 
stricter limit: 0.08 percent. Two states, Massachusetts and South 
Carolina, have blood-alcohol limits, but they also require that a 
person show visible signs of drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report grew out of last year's debate about a $203  
billion national highway bill. Drunken driving opponents got the 
Senate to support a provision saying that states that did not lower 
their blood-alcohol limits to 0.08 percent would risk losing their 
federal highway funds. The president argued in favor of the 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	The House did not support the measure and ultimately it was  
thrown out of the bill, which Clinton signed. The bill did include 
a provision asking the GAO to gauge the effectiveness of state 0.08 
BAC laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of stricter limits point out that a 120-pound woman  
having two glasses of wine over two hours could be branded a 
drunken driver. Supporters say a 170-pound man wouldn't reach the 
limit unless he downed more than four beers in an hour.

<HEADLINE> Reno Announces Anti-Violence Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abused and neglected children are the most  
likely to commit crimes, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday 
in announcing a $1.3 million grant to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who grow up being abused by family members ``come to  
accept violence as a way of life,'' Reno told more than 150 child, 
health and legal experts here at the close of a three-day national 
summit on children's exposure to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only must communities protect children by counseling abusive  
parents and caretakers, but, she said, ``We have to start teaching 
children ways to resolve conflict without using guns, knives and 
fists. We do not have to be such a violent nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yale University's Child Study Center will receive the money to  
study the link between abuse and neglect victims and later criminal 
acts and to help communities nationwide come up with ways to 
prevent children from being hurt, protect those who are abused and 
steer them away from committing violence later in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Justice Department reported, 2.8 million teens were  
victims of violent crimes such as rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also issued guidelines on how police and  
prosecutors can work with community centers and schools to counsel 
and interview young victims and prepare them for court testimony, 
and how to fight Internet users who try to solicit sex from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit -- called by President Clinton last fall -- mostly  
addressed the issue of child abuse, but the department also 
released figures Thursday showing that a childhood of abuse can 
lead to a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, children who were abused or neglected were:  
</P>
<P>
	--50 percent more likely to have a juvenile record.  
</P>
<P>
	--40 percent more likely to become violent adult offenders.  
</P>
<P>
	--33 percent more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
	The summit also covered children's exposure to media violence.  
</P>
<P>
	William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications  
Commission, announced that 11 newspapers and TV Guide will join 
hundreds of other newspapers in publishing program ratings in their 
television listings. Kennard said these ratings, along with the 
v-chip technology to block programming, would help parents screen 
shows they think are inappropriate for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Summit participants, such as child psychologists, police  
officers, educators and social workers, produced an ``action plan'' 
that called for grassroots prevention programs, tougher gun control 
and crime legislation and more funding for child protective 
services and mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Senate's Democrat leader on education,  
asked participants to help Congress come up with ways to make 
schools safer, adding that child violence was a problem long before 
this spring's school shootings in Colorado and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still losing 13 children a day'' to gun violence, said  
Kennedy, D-Mass. ``They are 25 percent of the population, but 100 
percent of our future. We ought to get it right.''

<HEADLINE> Sobrero Questionable After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As U.S. women's coach Tony DiCicco drew up his  
roster for the World Cup, he spent days going over every possible 
what-if. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens if the United States has to play a woman down? What  
happens if this player gets hurt? How about that one? Who plays in 
her place? 
</P>
<P>
	Now DiCicco might have to use one of those disaster plans.  
Defender Kate Sobrero, who started all but one game she's played 
this season, has a sprained ankle and is questionable for tonight's 
game against Nigeria at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some options,'' DiCicco said Wednesday. ``The  
reserves are ready to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobrero landed awkwardly on a bumpy practice field Wednesday  
after jumping to head a ball. She had to be carried off the field, 
but Dr. Mark Adams, the team doctor, didn't rule her out for 
tonight's game. 
</P>
<P>
	With more treatment Wednesday night and again today, her playing  
status depended on how she responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge loss,'' forward Tiffeny Milbrett said of the  
possibility of Sobrero not playing. ``Her experience, all the games 
she's played, is invaluable. (But) everyone's played so many times 
together. At any given time, I believe he (DiCicco) could take one 
player off and put another on and we'd be just as good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as if the U.S. reserves are scrubs. This isn't like  
high school, where the reserves sit on the bench, praying for just 
a few minutes of playing time so they'll get their varsity letter. 
These backups can play. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan and Tisha Venturini were starters on the 1996  
Olympic team that won the gold medal. Many won at least one 
national championship in college. 
</P>
<P>
	And Milbrett, Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy weren't on the field the  
entire time as the United States went 15-2-1 in pre-World Cup 
matches. The reserves got plenty of minutes, and everyone on the 
roster started at least one game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident whoever plays will do well,'' forward Cindy  
Parlow said. ``That was one of the keys throughout the lead-up. We 
do have tremendous depth. All nine of our reserves can step up at 
any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Sobrero can't go, Tiffany Roberts, Christie Pearce, Lorrie  
Fair or Sara Whalen are the likely replacements. Another option is 
a return to the 3-4-3 formation that the United States used for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have options, based on the athleticism and speed of the  
Nigerians, that we can use,'' DiCicco said. ``If we need to, we'll 
certainly reach into our athletic players to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having Sobrero is preferred. Though she's made only 27  
appearances with the national team, compared with more than 100 for 
seven of the other starters, the 22-year-old plays like a veteran. 
She quickly worked her way into the starting lineup after being 
invited to the national team's training camp in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the fastest, most physical players on the team, she  
excels at tracking down opponents who've managed to break free. In 
Saturday's 3-0 victory over Denmark, she had two impressive plays 
in front of the net, including one early in the game when it was 
still scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kate's been playing great and I'd feel badly if she's not able  
to play,'' DiCicco said. ``She deserves the chance to continue 
playing in the World Cup and establishing herself as one of the 
best defenders in the world. And I think she's well on her way to 
doing that.''

<HEADLINE> Justices Reject Pakistani's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pakistani man sentenced to death for the  
1993 fatal shootings of two CIA employees outside the spy agency's 
headquarters lost a Supreme Court appeal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which Mir  
Aimal Kasi argued he should be allowed to challenge his seizure by 
FBI agents in Pakistan after a global manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his FBI arrest in his homeland violated the  
Constitution's ban on unreasonable seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ended its 1998-99 term Wednesday when the justices  
left the bench and began a summer recess, but the court's clerk 
Thursday issued scores of orders from the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kasi opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle  
outside CIA headquarters in Virginia during the Jan. 25, 1993 
morning rush hour. CIA employees Frank Darling and Lansing Bennett 
were killed as they sat in their cars at a stop light, and three 
other men were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi had been living in Virginia but returned to Pakistan the  
day after the shootings. His roommate soon reported him missing to 
police, who searched Kasi's apartment and found the weapon used in 
the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi eluded FBI agents for over four years before they seized  
him in a hotel room in Pakistan and returned him to the United 
States. He confessed to the slayings during the return flight, 
saying he was angry over CIA meddling in Muslim nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi was tried and convicted in a Virginia state court in  
November 1997, and was sentenced to death. The Virginia Supreme 
Court upheld his convictions and sentence last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasi's lawyers said his seizure violated his constitutional  
rights and an extradition treaty between the United States and 
Pakistan, and that Virginia courts failed to force the government 
to produce evidence that might weigh in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Attorney General Mark L. Earley urged the justices to  
reject Kasi's appeal, saying the justices ruled in 1990 that the 
Fourth Amendment does not restrain government agents' actions 
against non-citizens outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Kasi vs. Virginia, 98-1812.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Fell in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $2.03 billion in the latest week to $862.56 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $286.5 million to $716.56 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
June 23, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. The 
tax-exempt fund assets fell by $1.75 billion to $146.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of the institutional money market funds increased by  
$2.77 billion to $592.03 billion for the same period. Among 
institutional funds, taxable money market fund assets rose by $3.42 
billion to $544.36 billion; assets of the tax-exempt funds fell by 
$647.8 million to $47.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.455 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.454 billion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.28 percent from 4.31 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield held steady at the previous week's 4.30 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.37 percent from 4.40  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield was 
unchanged at 4.39 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
58 days, down from 59 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.03 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.04 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts fell to 0.87 percent from 0.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.15 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.14 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.48 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.45 
percent; 4.68 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.66 percent; and 
4.85 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.81 percent.

<HEADLINE> North Korea 3, Denmark 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Jo Song Ok scored her second goal in two  
games as surprising North Korea dominated Denmark 3-1 Thursday 
night and put itself in position to advance from Group A into the 
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's quick, physical play frustrated Denmark from the  
first minute of play. The North Koreans scored twice in the first 
half and then held on for their first World Cup victory after 
building their lead to 3-0 late in the game. North Korea lost 2-1 
to Nigeria in its opening match and plays the United States Sunday 
in Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea scored first when Jin Pyol Hui left-footed the ball  
into an untended goal in the 15th minute of the match. Danish 
keeper Dorthe Larson left the box in an attempt to intercept a pass 
by Sol Yong Suk, who set up Jin perfectly on the left side a few 
yards inside the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Jo Song Ok's second goal of the tournament was a beauty, putting  
North Korea ahead 2-0 in the 38th minute. Just outside the penalty 
box she spurted past one defender, slipped the ball between the 
legs of a second and drilled a left-footed shot past Larson into 
the left top corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea led 3-0 in the 72nd minute when Kim Kum Sil  
left-footed a loose ball in front of the goal into an empty net 
after Larson fell down in traffic. The ball came Kim's way after a 
corner kick had bounce off one of her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark, which opened with a 3-0 loss to the United States,  
scored its first goal of the tournament in the 74th minute off a 
mistake by keeper Kye Tong Sun, who punched a shot on goal instead 
of catching it. The ball bounced at the feet of Janni Johansen, who 
slipped the ball past a defender and into the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark had two near-goals in the first half. Jane Rasmussen's  
header off a cross hit the near-post just below the upper angle in 
the 31st minute. Just before the half, Louise Hansen hit the top of 
the bar just over the hand of keeper Kye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes appeared upset by the wet field, which was inundated  
after a downpour occurred for about an hour before the game began. 
Two Danes slipped while kicking the ball during the first minute of 
play, including forward Marlene Kristensen, who appear to injure 
her right knee and was taken from the field by ambulance.

<HEADLINE> Senate Remains Deadlocked on HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a third straight day, Democrats stymied  
action Thursday on an agriculture spending bill, trying to add 
pieces of their patients' bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott set a series of votes for  
Monday that would end the debate. He needs 60 votes to move ahead, 
but will not get them if all 45 Democrats stick together. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from both parties expressed frustration, saying they  
had compromised again and again only to have the other side refuse 
to be reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Republicans were unwilling to vote on their  
amendments strengthening a GOP bill giving patients new rights when 
dealing with their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel all we ought to do is pass this shell bill they've  
got and call it a day,'' said the Senate's top Democrat, Tom 
Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said Democrats would never agree to anything because  
Democrats really want to use the issue in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I begin to wonder, do we want to address this issue or do we  
just want the issue?'' said Lott, R-Miss. ``I've been through that 
before.''

<HEADLINE> France Lifts Coke Production Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNKIRK, France (AP) -- France followed the lead of Belgium and  
lifted a ban on Coca-Cola products Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall that followed hundreds of reports of illnesses by  
people who drank Coca-Cola products is estimated to have cost at 
least $60 million, and could be much higher. But Coca-Cola's main 
bottler said ``the crisis is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Production in France will resume early Friday, said Henry A.  
Schimberg, president and chief operating offer of Coca-Cola 
Enterprises Inc., the world's leading bottler and distributor of 
Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Production had been expected to resume Thursday in Belgium, but  
was delayed as Coca-Cola worked to assure compliance with strict 
sanitary conditions imposed by the government on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Belgium we are taking very deliberate steps to ensure  
perfect quality. Production will begin in a matter of days,'' said 
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Jennifer McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 9, there had been 249 cases of illnesses reported in  
Belgium by people who drank Coca-Cola products. In France, hundreds 
of people who drank from cans produced in Dunkirk had reported 
illnesses in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, France ended its limited ban on production of  
Coca-Cola canned products here, saying government tests determined 
there no longer is a public health threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it seems that the product and its packaging are safe,  
so the sales can start up again,'' Finance Minister Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique Reiniche, president of Coca-Cola France, said the  
illnesses were caused by odors stemming from traces of disinfectant 
on the bottom of some cans. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the disinfectant, containing carbolic acid, or phenol,  
was used to clean pallets on which the cans were standing at the 
bottling plant. She said the contamination was due to ``logistical 
malfunctioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium announced on Wednesday it would allow Coca-Cola to  
resume operations at factories in Antwerp and Ghent, if new 
production safeguards are imposed. Without determining the cause of 
hundreds of illnesses reported in Belgium, the country's top health 
official termed them an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the crisis is over and we're happy with the French  
government's decision,'' Schimberg told a news conference at the 
Dunkirk bottling plant in northern France. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiniche acknowledged that Coca-Cola's image in Europe has been  
tarnished and said the company would launch a promotion campaign in 
France and Belgium this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman, has said it will take  
about two weeks to build up full distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Enterprises said the cost of the recalling 14 million  
cases, each containing 24 eight-ounce servings, was about $60 
million. In addition, it said there would be lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bottler said it was confident the health scare would not  
hurt financial results after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises,  
was ``still working on our assessment'' of the costs of the crisis, 
spokesman Rob Baskin said Thursday in Atlanta. ``It's premature for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola  
Enterprises fell 2.1 percent, or by 68 3/4 cents, at $31.68 3/4 a share, 
while Coca-Cola was up 1.5 percent, or by 93 3/4 cents, at $62.68 3/4 a 
share.

<HEADLINE> Kopp Indicted in Death of NY Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A county grand jury today indicted James  
Kopp for the slaying of the abortion provider who was gunned down 
through his kitchen window as he was heating soup. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-count indictment charges Kopp with the second-degree  
murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, first-degree reckless endangerment 
and criminal possession of a weapon. The state charges supersede 
murder charges filed in May by local police. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury continues to hear evidence in the Oct. 23  
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Kopp was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted  
List. As one of the country's most sought-after alleged criminals, 
his name and picture now appear in post offices and police stations 
all over the world and on the FBI's Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said investigators had received  
numerous leads since Kopp was added to the most-wanted list, but 
none had panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident one day we will get the right tip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the state charges, Kopp is charged in a federal  
complaint with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances 
Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-degree murder charge against Kopp carries a potential  
prison term of 15 years to life. There is no evidence to warrant a 
first-degree murder charge, Erie County District Attorney Frank 
Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Driver Kills Baby in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 71-year-old woman who drove home on an  
expired license after flunking her driver's test struck and killed 
a baby in a stroller hours later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who has not been charged, made a wide turn at a  
crosswalk, almost going up on the sidewalk, police Inspector Mike 
Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been issued a temporary license that expired June 18,  
Mahoney said. She failed her exam that day because she went 
straight when the instructor told her to turn left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Motor Vehicles instructor told the woman that  
she had failed and would have to return. The instructor did not 
specifically tell the woman she could not drive home, Mahoney said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the woman drove home and parked her car, then went  
to move it to a different spot about five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten-month-old Yusuf Khouja was dragged in his stroller beneath  
the car and later died at a hospital. His 2 1/2-year-old brother 
suffered minor injuries. Their mother was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver told investigators that her brakes failed, Mahoney  
said. A mechanical inspection was being done Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Hall of Famer Ivan Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Blackhawks vice president Thomas N. Ivan,  
who won Stanley Cups as both a coach and general manager in a Hall 
of Fame career that spanned nearly 60 years, has died. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan died Thursday at Lake Forest Hospital in suburban Chicago  
several days after being admitted for treatment of a kidney 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Toronto, Ivan never played in the National Hockey  
League. His playing career ended with an injury in the 1930s while 
playing on a junior amateur team in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	After coaching amateur hockey, he scouted and coached junior  
hockey for the Detroit Red Wings, then coached Omaha in the Central 
League, which had a young player named Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, Ivan was named head coach of the Red Wings. In seven  
seasons, he coached Detroit to six first-place finishes and three 
Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	He also coached the NHL All Stars to victory over the Stanley  
Cup champion Toronto Maple Leafs in the first official All Star 
Game in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Hired as general manager of Chicago, Ivan rebuilt the  
Blackhawks' farm system and skillfully drafted players. He was 
responsible for bringing future Hall of Famers Bobby Hull, Stan 
Mikita and Glenn Hall to the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Chicago won the Stanley Cup, and from 1962 to 1973 the  
Blackhawks reached the Stanley Cup finals four more times. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, after serving as Blackhawks' general manager for a  
quarter century, Ivan was named vice president and alternate 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan is survived by four children, eight grandchildren and four  
great grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Mayor Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Mayor Joe Serna said Thursday he has  
cancer and won't seek a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life I have been beating the odds and I intend to work  
hard against beating this one,'' Serna, 59, told reporters. ``I am 
now dedicating myself to my healing, my family, and continuing to 
serve the city of Sacramento.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors expect Serna to finish his term, which ends in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's illness is a recurrence of the kidney cancer he was  
first diagnosed with nine years ago. The kidney was removed and 
doctors found no evidence the cancer had spread, Serna said. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor who examined Serna for pneumonia in mid-February  
discovered that the cancer had spread to the lungs. He has been in 
treatment since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna was first elected mayor in 1992 and won a second term in  
1996.

<HEADLINE>  Piazza Out Today With Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza will have to wait at least another  
day to start a new hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza's career-long 24-game hitting streak, which tied a Mets  
record, ended Wednesday night against the Florida Marlins after the 
New York catcher left the game with a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza sat out Thursday's game against the Marlins and hopes to  
be back in the lineup for a weekend showdown in Atlanta against the 
first-place Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just one of those things that happen,'' Piazza said.  
``At this point, we just want to give it a day. I feel a lot better 
than I did last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza received treatment for the injury. He iced his neck and  
spent time in the whirlpool to relieve the feeling of whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was hit under his helmet by Bruce Aven's backswing in the  
seventh inning. He remained in the game and fell over while trying 
to catch a foul pop in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I forgot who it was, but I'll have to watch the tape before we  
play them next time,'' Piazza said of being hit by the bat. ``It 
made a sick sound. I was a little bit slow after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza left the game after grounding out in the eighth inning.  
He finished 0-for-4 and tied with Hubie Brooks for the longest 
hitting streak in Mets history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the streak was that big of a deal,'' Piazza  
said. ``I didn't worry about it. I thought it was flattering to be 
associated with Hubie Brooks. It was fun while it lasted, but it is 
probably good it is over so we can get back to concentrating on 
winning games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pratt, who has only 79 at-bats this year, got a rare start  
at catcher in Piazza's place. Pratt has had little playing time 
since Piazza returned from a knee injury April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Todd could be getting a lot more playing time on another  
team,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I have empathy for that, 
because there were lots of times when I thought that was the case 
in my career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good defensive catcher, calls a good game and can hit.  
Of the 30 teams, a lot don't have one of those guys, much less 
two.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped slightly against the yen today  
when expected action by Japan's central bank to support the 
greenback failed to materialize. Japanese stocks rebounded 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.90 yen at late afternoon, down from 121.98  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also marginally lower than its late 
New York level of 121.92 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 41.57 points,  
or 0.24 percent, closing at 17,628.32 points. On Wednesday, the 
average fell 190.87 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar drifted in a narrow range  
against the yen as traders remained cautious over possible further 
intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Finance Minister for International  
Affairs at the Finance Ministry, reiterated that Japanese finance 
authorities' were determined to prevent the yen from rising 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened four times over a two-week  
period to stem the yen's rise, with the latest action taken Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan fears a strong yen would make its exports more expensive  
abroad and thus potentially hamper the economy's ability to recover 
from its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Some short-term speculators bought the U.S. currency aiming to  
ride it higher if the central bank were to sell yen today. But 
those expectations were not realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ wasn't in the market today, so the dollar's topside  
was limited,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign 
exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved in a range between 121.80 yen and 122.13 yen in  
today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.30 yen, up from  
126.06 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, foreign investors continued to buy Japanese  
stocks, while domestic institutional investors took profits and 
unwounded some cross shareholdings, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained in a narrow range in the absence of fresh  
incentives for much of today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's advance, overall, declines outnumbered  
advances 801 to 422, with 103 issues unchanged. Volume on the 
exchange's first section was estimated at 554 million shares, down 
from Wednesday's turnover of 627 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,411.13. The 
TOPIX fell 16.46 points, or 1.15 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6950 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7400 
percent, driving its price up to 100.91 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Makes Hockey Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	During his hockey career, Wayne Gretzky scored points like he  
couldn't wait. Now in retirement, he didn't have to wait long to 
make the Hockey Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two months after leaving the game, Gretzky was voted  
Wednesday into the Hall of Fame, which waived the standard 
three-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Gretzky were former referee Andy Van Hellemond, and Ian  
(Scotty) Morrison in the builder category. The three will be 
officially inducted on Nov. 22 in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously overwhelming,'' Gretzky said, ``it was a  
wonderful phone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's selection was no surprise. NHL commissioner Gary  
Bettman retired his famous number 99 after his last game with the 
New York Rangers. Not long after, the Hall of Fame's selection 
committee voted to waive the usual waiting period in Gretzky's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gretzky had some doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, it was a relief,'' the greatest player in hockey  
history said. ``Stranger things have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky is the 10th player in NHL history allowed to bypass the  
waiting process for the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players who didn't have to wait the required three  
years: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay 
(1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuck (1971), Jean Beliveau 
(1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979) and Mario Lemieux 
(1996). 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, speaking at a conference call with the media, said he  
had fond memories of the hall as a boy. Gretzky lived in Brantford, 
Ontario, not far from the Hall in Toronto when it was located on 
the Canadian National Exhibition grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to stare for hours,'' Gretzky said. ``I never had  
enough of it. I never thought I'd be a part of it. I'm not sure too 
many kids think they'll be part of the Hall. It was beyond my 
wildest dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all his accomplishments, he has been the NHL's Michael  
Jordan -- an almost mythical figure who fans of all teams admired 
and packed arenas to see. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky had 894 goals and 1,963 assists for 2,857 
points -- 1,007 more than runner-up Howe scored in his Hall of Fame 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky also scored 122 goals in the playoffs and 56 in the old  
World Hockey Association to give him 1,072 in all, one more than 
Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who owns 61 NHL records, was a 10-time scoring champion  
and a nine-time MVP. He also helped the Oilers win four Stanley Cup 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with some great teams, great players,'' Gretzky said.  
``When you win, you get recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season in New York was one of frustration for the  
38-year-old Gretzky as he struggled through injuries and ``feeling 
more fatigue than I ever felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his retirement, Gretzky said he has had ``peace of mind. I  
miss the game, but I know in my heart I made the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said his major priority now involves moving his family  
back to California, where he has had a home since his years with 
the Los Angeles Kings, ``and maybe be an assistant coach on my 
boys' hockey team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has two sons and a daughter with his wife, Janet.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond was an on-ice official for 25 years in the NHL,  
officiating in 19 Stanley Cup finals. Morrison was president of the 
Hockey Hall of Fame from 1986-93 and also served as chairman before 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy and overwhelmed,'' Morrison said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Hellemond was not present for the conference call.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Property Seizures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police would have a tougher time seizing  
private property with suspected links to crime under a bill the 
House passed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	House members voted 375-48 to set new rules for how the federal  
government seizes houses, cars, boats, cash and securities. Police 
have used civil asset forfeiture for such things as shutting down 
drug houses quickly by taking possession of them or hitting drug 
traffickers in the wallet even before charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
	During an afternoon of debate, both Democrats and Republicans  
criticized current federal laws that allow law enforcement officers 
to seize property simply because they suspect it was involved in 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil asset forfeiture is a powerful anti-crime tool, but it  
also is a seductive opportunity for abuse, they said, especially 
for law enforcement agencies hungry for money to supplement tight 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many jurisdictions it has become a monetary tail wagging  
the law enforcement dog,'' Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many innocent citizens have been deprived of the use of  
their cash or possessions without due process, said Rep. Henry 
Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it took landscaper Willie Jones of Nashville,  
Tenn., 2 1/2 years to recover the $9,000 Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents confiscated from him after an airline ticket 
agent became suspicious when he paid for a round-trip ticket to 
Houston with $267 in cash in 1991, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to convict you. They don't even have to charge  
you with a crime. But they have your property,'' Hyde said. ``This 
is a throwback to the old Soviet Union, where justice is the 
justice of the government and the citizen doesn't have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about that -- 80 percent of those whose property are  
seized are never even charged with a crime,'' said Rep. William 
Delahunt, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	House members disagreed, however, on how to change the law.  
</P>
<P>
	A bill introduced by Hyde and the Judiciary Committee's senior  
Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, would require the federal 
government to prove with ``clear and convincing'' evidence that the 
property was eligible for forfeiture if an owner files a legal 
challenge. In addition, officers must prove criminality, not simply 
allege it. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law requires property owners to prove they are not  
connected with the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would require the government to provide  
notice to owners before seizing property. Owners would have 30 days 
-- compared with the current 10 days -- to challenge a seizure in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow a judge to release property to the owner if  
continued government possession would pose a substantial hardship. 
Judges would be allowed to appoint counsel for poor defendants, and 
owners would be allowed to sue the government for negligence if 
their property is lost or damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, owners of seized cash would receive interest if a  
judge orders the government to return the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would apply only to civil asset forfeitures, not  
criminal ones, although civil forfeitures often are involved in 
criminal cases. It also would not affect state forfeiture laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, about $449 million in seized property in both civil and  
criminal forfeiture cases went to the federal government. Some of 
the money is sent to state and local law enforcement agencies who 
helped in investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 268-155 to reject an alternative that would have  
allowed police to seize property based on a lower standard of proof 
-- a ``preponderance'' of the evidence rather than ``clear and 
convincing'' evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the Hyde-Conyers bill said the alternative was  
too weak and would end up expanding the federal government's power 
to seize property rather than curbing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supported the alternative, saying the  
Hyde-Conyers bill ``would have a serious negative effect on the 
federal government's ability to combat drug trafficking, alien 
smuggling, terrorism, consumer fraud and many other criminal 
offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No companion bill has been introduced in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Semiconductor Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices  
led semiconductor stocks lower Thursday after Micron posted 
disappointing results and AMD warned of weak profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron reported late Wednesday that it lost $27.8 million, or 10  
cents per share, on sales of $864 million in its third quarter 
ended June 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Micron lost $109 million, or 51  
cents a share, on sales of $613 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also late Wednesday, AMD warned that it will post an operating  
loss of about $200 million for the quarter ending next week because 
it sold only 3.7 million of its flagship K6 microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD said it also expects less than $600 million in operating  
revenues, leaving the company in a weak position just as it begins 
shipping its newest chip, previously called the K7 but now dubbed 
the Athlon microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Micron's  
shares finished down $4.56 1/4 to $39.37 1/2 in heavy trading. AMD closed 
down $1.12 1/2 at $17.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron said profit margins in the latest quarter fell amid a 27  
percent decline in prices for 64-megabit SDRAM chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty drastic drop for the average selling price on  
the chip,'' said Sherry Garber, an analyst with Semico Research 
Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz., noting the growing consumer demand for 
sub-$1,000 personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron has lobbied Congress to prevent the International  
Monetary Fund from handing over tax dollars to its competitors in 
South Korea, accusing them of dumping below-cost chips on the 
slumping market. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron, which recently stopped work on a radio frequency  
identification product to focus solely on chips, Micron will record 
a $12 million pre-tax charge for expenses related to halting 
operations at its majority-owned Micron Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD, meanwhile, said its quarterly sales suffered because  
frustrated potential customers didn't return to the fold once AMD 
solved manufacturing problems that plagued the K6 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip maker is facing enormous losses  
at a time it needs to invest research and development funds to push 
its technology ahead -- something it cannot afford, said Keith 
Diefendorff, editor-in-chief of Microprocessor Report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' he said. Once the company  
starts losing huge sums of money, the research squeeze ``only gets 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``AMD is living on the edge, there's no question about it,''  
said Charles Boucher, a semiconductor analyst with Credit Suisse 
First Boston in San Francisco. Still, Boucher said, Wednesday's 
release of the super-fast Athlon is a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
	``If AMD executes the Athlon well, it could start to build an  
R&AMP;D war chest to keep the fight going,'' said Boucher. ``But if the 
company stumbles again, they will be really challenged to produce 
any next generation technology.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Manager Recovers at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker's recollection of his last trip to  
the Astrodome is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dierker's trademark Hawaiian shirt offered a clue Wednesday  
of the mental state that doctors want the Houston Astros manager to 
have for the next few months following brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be quiet for a few weeks and not do very much,''  
Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	He donned a baseball cap to cover his shaved head as he checked  
out of Methodist Hospital, eight days after undergoing the 
operation a day after suffering a grand mal seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, and I'm going to be fine,'' said Dierker, smiling  
and joking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, 52, is forbidden from driving for six months and must  
take anticonvulsant medication indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon who performed the operation to remove a tangled mass  
of blood vessels from the front of Dierker's brain said he expected 
the manager to make a full recovery and return to the dugout after 
next month's All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming along fine, but at this point it's hard to say how  
much more time he's going to need,'' Dr. Rob Parrish said. ``He's 
going to continue the medication, and we'll continue to evaluate 
how he responds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout June 13 with the grand mal  
seizure. He underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery June 15 to remove the 
tangled vessels that caused the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I don't know what happened'' at the game,  
Dierker said. ``I heard a lot of people talking, but I don't 
remember much more than that. It was all like a blur. From the time 
I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I have felt lucid and I 
have had my coordination and balance. I have been very much amazed 
at that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how it could have been a lot worse, so I feel very  
fortunate that the malformation wasn't in an area that was as 
complex as it could have been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker suffered from arteriovenous malformation, a condition in  
which people are born with malformed, sometimes tangled, arteries 
or veins in the brain. Over time, the vessels can dilate, 
pressuring tissue or even bursting and bleeding into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After the surgery, an angiogram showed Dierker no longer had any  
of the clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill this  
season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of 
an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker said he continued to keep track of the game through his  
ordeal and now will convalesce at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had the problem of getting emotionally stressed  
watching on television as I have sitting in the dugout,'' he said, 
joined by his wife Judy and Parrish at a news conference. ``I 
haven't had a problem relinquishing control or power; it's probably 
a function of my managerial style.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Recommends Yearly Mammograms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Changing its stand on one of the most contentious  
issues in medicine, the American Medical Association recommended 
Thursday that all women ages 40 to 50 get annual mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision puts the AMA at odds with the government and the  
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which say an 
interval of one to two years is adequate. But the AMA now agrees 
with the American Cancer Society and the American College of 
Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has pitted those who argue that routine mammograms are  
not cost-effective in younger women against those who say that the 
tests are needed and that the insurance industry should be 
pressured into paying for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA had previously advocated the one-to-two-year timetable  
for women in their 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	``One in six breast cancer deaths in 1995 were attributable to  
women diagnosed with breast cancer during their 40s,'' Richard B. 
Reiling, a spokesman for the American College of Surgeons, argued 
before the AMA's 494 policymaking delegates voted in favor of the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the issue was Dr. Scott R. Karlan of the  
American Society of General Surgeons, who noted a 10-year study of 
25,000 Canadian women found no benefit to mammography for women in 
their 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the studies that have been in favor of mammography have  
pointed out that the incidence of breast cancer is so low, and the 
sensitivity of mammography is so low in women between the ages of 
40 and 50, that you would have to screen more than 250,000 women to 
find, perhaps, one curable case of breast cancer,'' Karlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's vote does not affect AMA guidelines for women over 50  
-- which call for annual mammograms -- nor the recommendation that a 
manual breast exam by a doctor be part of any physical exam in 
either age group. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs said the  
cost-effectiveness of screening younger women is in line with that 
of other diagnostic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	But others argued that annual screening will drive up insurance  
and HMO costs without proven benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one in this room who would object to women having  
proper care. The issue involves the interpretation of data,'' said 
Dr. David M. Rosenthal of San Jose, Calif., a delegate who opposed 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Debra R. Judelson of Beverly Hills, Calif., a representative  
of the American Medical Women's Association, which supports annual 
screening, said managed-care companies have refused to pay for 
mammograms at less than two-year intervals for women under 50. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters, AMA delegates voted:  
</P>
<P>
	--To investigate whether the increasing practice of putting  
antibiotics into products such as lotions, deodorants and toys is 
promoting drug-resistance in bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	--To look into the practice of doctors' prescribing drugs over  
the Internet and develop guidelines governing the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	--To reaffirm a 6-month-old policy on dietary supplements that  
calls for the AMA to work with Congress to strengthen federal law 
so that even supplements already on the market would be required to 
pass tests for safety and effectiveness and meet drug standards for 
strength, quality and purity.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Nuclear Cleanup Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite billions spent so far, current  
technology is not up to the job of cleaning contaminated soil and 
water at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons sites, a 
scientific advisory panel reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology that often is used to remediate contaminated  
sites is simply ineffective and unable to accomplish the massive 
job that needs to be done,'' said C. Herb Ward, chairman of the 
National Research Council committee that studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means DOE's cleanup efforts won't meet federal and state  
regulatory standards unless the agency shifts its focus to both 
developing and implementing new methods,'' Ward, a professor of 
environmental science at Rice University in Houston, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The department agreed with the ``general findings'' and intends  
to use them ``to improve our technology development efforts,'' 
James M. Owendoff, acting assistant secretary for environmental 
management, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this report as part of our ongoing process to improve  
our cleanup efforts, particularly with respect to protecting water 
resources,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has spent between $5.6 billion and $7.2 billion  
per year on environmental management over the past several years, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee noted the Energy Department agency responsible for  
developing innovative cleanup technologies had its budget cut from 
$82.1 million in 1994 to $14.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget rose to $25 million this year but the committee said  
that it was not enough to pay for a significant number of field 
tests of new cleanup technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report urged the agency, known as the Surface Contaminants  
Focus Area, to concentrate on the most promising new technologies 
and to work with private companies developing cleanup methods. 
</P>
<P>
	At most DOE sites, contaminated soil is excavated and polluted  
ground water is pumped out, treated and stored, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said excavation can increase the likelihood of  
human exposure and may damage local ecosystems while pump-and-treat 
systems often are ineffective at removing persistent contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	The department should expand use of some new technologies that  
it developed, such as the use of electricity to attract a remove 
metal contaminants from soil. Injecting steam into polluted areas 
can also remove contaminants, which then can be removed through 
recovery wells, the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee did note that the department had developed a  
method to successfully treat chromium-contaminated water by 
injecting chemical agents that immobilize the chromium. That system 
is being used at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington 
state.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Secret Recording Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The news media can be sued for infiltrating  
a workplace and secretly recording an employee, the state Supreme 
Court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a unanimous decision, the justices ordered a lower court to  
reconsider damages awarded to a psychic hotline employee whose 
conversations with a reporter posing as a co-worker were broadcast 
nationally on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court had overturned the $1.2 million in damages  
and legal fees awarded to employee Mark Sanders. It said the 
clandestine taping could not have violated his privacy because his 
conversations were in an open area of the workplace and could have 
been overheard by others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state Supreme Court disagreed, saying employees in a  
private office have a right to expect that private conversations 
with co-workers will not be secretly taped and broadcast to others. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not order Sanders' damages reinstated, saying the  
appellate court must still consider other issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar did say a news  
organization may be able to defend a secret recording by showing 
that it was necessary for news coverage. The recording may also be 
easier to defend if the workplace is open to the public, Werdegar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was videotaped by ABC News reporter Stacy Lescht, who  
had answered a want ad for a business advertising telephone psychic 
advice for $3.95 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a hidden camera and microphone, she recorded two  
conversations with Sanders at their work cubicles in a large room 
divided by partitions. Six seconds of the tape were shown on ABC 
News's ``Prime Time Live.''

<HEADLINE> Renaming the Superdome Sparks Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- What's in a name? Millions of dollars if it's  
attached to a stadium, and that is sparking debate about adding 
former Gov. John McKeithen's name to the Superdome's official 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by the Legislature to rename the Superdome after the  
late governor, at a time corporations are willing to spend millions 
to add their names to stadiums, could be costly and possibly 
endanger retaining the city's NFL franchise, the New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints owner Tom Benson told the Superdome Commission Thursday  
that renaming the stadium could mean a loss of corporate revenue 
and, consequently, the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not against McKeithen,'' Benson said. ``Certainly he was a  
great governor and was a main source of getting this built. But 
they could have thought that through a little further as far as I 
was concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeithen, who died earlier this month at the age of 81, was  
popular enough to convince reluctant voters in central and north 
Louisiana to go along with the New Orleans project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission asked Gov. Mike Foster to hold off signing the  
bill to allow time to study the impact of the move so they can make 
a recommendation. Under the law, the governor must act within 20 
days from the time he receives it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing to remember is that once you put Governor  
McKeithen's name on the Dome, you limit yourself,'' said Doug 
Thornton, dome manager. ``You take away the flexibility of ever 
being able to sell it unless McKeithen's name is taken away 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Superdome is currently operating in the black and does not  
need the additional revenue, said Dome spokesman Bill Curl. But the 
money generated by adding corporate names to stadiums is frequently 
used as an inducement to lure or retain professional sports 
franchises. If the Superdome is prohibited from doing so in the 
future, it would lose a bargaining chip with the NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If at some point you want to enhance further inducements to  
the Saints' lease, will you have the flexibility of possibly doing 
it by selling the naming rights or does it come out of public 
money?'' asked Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to link a corporate name to the Superdome would be  
worth $30 million to $40 million over a 10-year period, marketing 
experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may even be on the conservative side,'' said Fred Fried  
of Integrated Sports International, a marketing company that 
negotiated corporate sponsorships, including 3Com Park in San 
Francisco and Ericsson Stadium in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few venues that have the kind of visibility the  
Superdome has and are virtually guaranteed of having the Super Bowl 
and Final Four regularly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints raised ticket prices this year and have hinted that  
they need more financial incentives to their lease that runs 
through 2018. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials also scheduled a series of meetings with business  
and political leaders to demonstrate how the Saints' finances 
compare with those of other teams in the league. The Saints have 
not released their financial figures, but said they ranked 21 out 
of 31 NFL teams in total revenue in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who met with Gov. Mike Foster  
and Mayor Marc Morial last summer to discuss difficulties faced by 
small market teams, said that without sufficient earnings the 
Saints would suffer competitively. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Forbes analysis showed the Saints with the 12th-highest  
revenue in the league and the fourth-highest operating profit. The 
report, based on 1997 data, showed the Saints generated operating 
profits of $18.5 million, almost three times the league average of 
$5.3 million, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints dispute those figures and have repeatedly stated  
their need for more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints would like to renegotiate four items in their lease  
that could produce another $6 million. Included in those items is a 
request that they get all money produced by selling the naming 
rights of the Superdome. Saints officials said NFL teams are 
getting an average of $2 million a year through such arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Dixon, who worked with McKeithen to see the Dome built,  
believes the late governor deserves to be honored for it, but also 
acknowledges the problems naming it for him can create. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any of this creates a situation that makes it difficult for  
a small market city to compete with large cities to keep the 
Saints, it should be carefully thought through,'' Dixon said. 
``Perhaps it would be better to have a statue in front of the Dome 
or something inside honoring Governor McKeithen. I know he wouldn't 
want anything done that would hurt the Dome.''

<HEADLINE> Teamsters, Anheuser-Busch Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The long and often bitter dispute between  
Anheuser-Busch and its largest union is apparently over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and the St. Louis-based maker of Budweiser,  
Michelob and other beers Thursday announced a tentative agreement 
on a five-year contract. The deal must be approved by the union's 
8,000 members. Mail-in voting is expected to take about a month. 
The union covers workers ranging from bottlers and brewers to truck 
drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new contract, when ratified, would keep our employees the  
best-paid in the brewing industry and provide job security in the 
highest-paying production jobs in American industry,'' 
Anheuser-Busch spokesman John E. Jacob said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would end nearly two years of failed negotiations.  
Frustrated by the impasse, Anheuser-Busch last year imposed its 
final offer, a contract that would have paid the average Teamster, 
with overtime, about $66,000 annually by the end of the contract in 
early 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	But union members were unhappy because the contract did not  
guarantee job security. In September, union workers walked off the 
job in St. Louis for about a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement includes gains over the imposed contract that  
address the most critical concerns for our members and their 
families, including unprecedented job security measures and wage 
and benefits increases,'' said Jack Cipriani, director of Brewery 
and Soft Drink Workers Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch spokesman Steve LeResche said the new deal would  
guarantee that none of the 12 domestic breweries would be closed 
during the life of the contract ``barring some major, unforeseen 
negative impact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokesman Chip Roth lauded the company for the job  
security provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not aware of any other Teamster members who enjoy that  
kind of commitment from their employer,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract would be valid through February 2004, a year  
longer than the deal the brewery had implemented over the union's 
objection. LeResche said other provisions of the contract would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Boost the average pay, with overtime, to $68,000 by the end of  
the contract; 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase pension benefits and continue no-cost healthcare  
coverage; 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide a lump-sum payment for each worker based on performance  
of the company's stock; 
</P>
<P>
	--Offer incentives for workers who meet certain safety and  
attendance guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch operates breweries in  
Baldwinsville, N.Y.; Cartersville, Ga.; Columbus, Ohio; Fort 
Collins, Colo.; Houston; Jacksonville, Fla.; Los Angeles and 
Fairfield, Calif.; Merrimack, N.H.; Newark, N.J.; and Williamsburg, 
Va.

<HEADLINE> GM, Gov't To Study Anti-Crash System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and the federal  
government announced Thursday a $35 million project to study and 
create high-tech crash avoidance systems for cars in the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``smart-car'' systems will use radar, cameras and computer  
chips to ``see'' slower cars and other objects on the road ahead 
and warn the driver if he gets too close and could crash, said Ron 
Colgin, GM's manager for the project. If the driver is also using 
cruise control, the car will start to brake for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash-avoidance system is intended for distracted drivers  
who are not paying full attention to the road as they talk on a car 
phone, tune a radio or try to settle a fight among siblings in the 
back seat, Colgin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The research project focuses on reducing rear-end collisions.  
The Transportation Department says about one-fourth of all injuries 
in motor vehicle crashes result from rear-end collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best crash protection we can provide is to help people  
avoid the collision altogether,'' said Lawrence D. Burns, a GM vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen prototype cars with these systems of the future will be  
developed in the next 2 1/2 years, GM said. Then about 100 drivers in 
southeast Michigan will be selected to drive the prototype vehicles 
for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most comprehensive field operation test under  
real-world conditions that has ever been conducted,'' Colgin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the research will be shared with other  
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Transportation is providing about 61 percent  
of the funding because federal officials are interested in learning 
about the systems and encouraging other automakers to build them. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is interested in the joint research because engineers want to  
learn how motorists react as the car ``sees'' problems and warns 
them, and they want feedback on how marketable the system will be. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also would benefit from standardization among automakers of  
certain sounds or flashing indicators that could be universally 
understood as warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will use radar to determine the distance to the next  
car ahead on the road and how fast it is going. A computer chip in 
the so-called smart car will monitor the speed of the motorist's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	If a motorist uses the system's new type of cruise control and  
does not see vehicles ahead slowing or stopped, the smart system 
would sound an alarm and an indicator button would flash, telling 
the driver the car must slow down, Colgin said. The cruise control 
system also would automatically apply the car's brakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In instances in which very hard braking was required, the driver  
also would have to step on the brake pedal to stop the car in time, 
he said. If the cruise control system was off, the car would only 
warn the driver but not brake, Colgin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system would also use a camera to ``see'' the road ahead and  
``understand'' when vehicles were turning along a curved road. That 
way, the smart car would be able to figure out which car is ahead 
of it in a lane, even when the lane is not straight ahead, Colgin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fully automatic system which sorts out which is the  
most threatening vehicle ahead,'' he said. ``It is meant to solve 
the problem of the inattentive driver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM is developing the crash-warning system with Delphi Automotive  
Systems, and the two companies are sharing the other 39 percent of 
the cost. The University of Michigan Transportation Research 
Institute will conduct the field testing over 10 months using 
drivers recruited through the mail with help from the state 
driver's license department. 
</P>
<P>
	The prototype vehicles are being build at the GM Technical  
Center in Warren, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Cam Projects JFK Assassination View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The view from the sixth-floor warehouse window  
where Lee Harvey Oswald shot President Kennedy was transmitted live 
Thursday on the Internet to the chagrin of Kennedy's survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera panned and zoomed in all directions, capturing images  
for viewing at www.jfk.org. The camera is mounted in the window of 
the old Texas Schoolbook Depository Building, where Oswald fired 
his fatal shots on Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth-floor has been a Kennedy museum for years. Oswald's  
perch is preserved, complete with stacked wooden crates near the 
window, but the corner is behind glass and off-limits to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who guided the original creation of The Sixth Floor  
Museum made a substantial effort to prevent the exploitation and 
commercialization of President Kennedy's death, and their efforts 
were a great credit to the people of Dallas,'' said Melody Miller, 
a spokeswoman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat 
and Kennedy's only surviving brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that their accomplishment is now being  
undermined in this insensitive and tasteless manner,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff West, executive director of the museum, said he was  
``surprised, and disappointed'' by Kennedy's remarks and defended 
the decision to install the Internet camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received countless requests for access to the view of  
Dealey Plaza from the sniper's perch. The installation of this 
camera affords us the opportunity to honor those requests without 
disrupting the solemnity of the museum experience,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the population of the world was born after the  
assassination. We're talking about a view of a national historic 
landmark, and I don't think that's ever in bad taste,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald shot Kennedy during a parade. Gov. John Connally, riding  
in the same car, was seriously wounded. Oswald was shot and killed 
two days later by nightclub operator Jack Ruby.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear State Lawsuit Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after giving state governments sweeping  
new protections against lawsuits, the Supreme Court said Thursday 
it will decide whether people can sue a state they accuse of 
cheating the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear Vermont's argument that the  
Constitution and federal law bar such lawsuits against states. 
Lower courts rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case Thursday, the court set aside a ruling that  
let bankrupt debtors sue the state agencies that try to collect 
from them. The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its 
ruling in a Georgia case that would have allowed such lawsuits when 
the debtors allege that a state agency violated their federally 
protected civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Vermont case, Jonathan Stevens, then a lawyer for the  
state Agency of Natural Resources' water supply division, sued the 
agency in 1995. He alleged that the agency had submitted false time 
records in connection with federal grant programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets  
private citizens file lawsuits on the government's behalf alleging 
that someone committed fraud against the government. Private 
citizens whose lawsuits are successful can collect a share of any 
damages awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont officials asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit,  
saying a state is not a ``person'' who can be held liable under the 
False Claims Act. They also invoked the protection of the 
Constitution's 11th Amendment, which the court has interpreted to 
generally bar states from being sued by individuals in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge refused to dismiss the case, and the 2nd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The 11th Amendment does not 
protect states against lawsuits by the federal government, which is 
the actual plaintiff in lawsuits such as the one filed by Stevens, 
the appeals court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said states can be held liable under the False  
Claims Act, noting that states also are allowed to sue under the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	In three decisions Wednesday, the court extended the ``sovereign  
immunity'' states enjoy against lawsuits by businesses and private 
citizens in federal and state courts, and enhanced the states' 
power in relation to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Thursday, Vermont's lawyers said the  
state should not be subject to lawsuits filed by people ``motivated 
solely by a bounty.'' Such lawsuits interfere with the state's 
exercise of its authority, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Stevens and the Clinton administration said the  
lower courts ruled correctly. But they urged the justices to grant 
review, saying federal appeals courts have split on whether states 
can be sued under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight states filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting  
Vermont's appeal. Allowing such lawsuits against states would 
expose them to ``very significant financial liability,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. U.S.,  
98-1828.

<HEADLINE> 19 Million Pool Toys Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today said it was recalling  
more than 19 million pool ``dive sticks'' because they can impale 
children who land on them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was  
recalling an infant carrier because of the danger a child could 
fall out, and some new Star Wars lightsabers because they may cause 
burns to their user. 
</P>
<P>
	Dive sticks are hard, plastic cylinder-shaped objects that stand  
upright on the bottom of pools so children can dive down and 
retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety commission said that at least six children have been  
rectally or vaginally impaled by the toys, which have been sold for 
about 20 years at various retail stores. In another case, a child 
suffered cuts just below her eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the number of reported incidents is relatively low,  
the severity of the injuries that have occurred is very 
significant,'' the commission said in a statement. In four of the 
six incidents documented, the children required surgery and 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends that parents throw the toys away. The  
commission's staff is also recommending that the commission itself 
ban the future production and importation of the toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety commission announced two other recalls today:  
</P>
<P>
	--Snugli Front &AMP; Back Packs with vertical ``T'' straps. At least  
13 children have slipped through the leg openings of the carrier, 
including one who suffered a fractured skull. 
</P>
<P>
	These soft infant carriers have model numbers beginning with 075  
and 080. The model number is on a tag inside the carrier which 
reads, ``SOFT CARRIER'' and the model number. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately stop using these carriers and call  
Evenflo at 800-398-8636 anytime to receive instructions on how to 
exchange their carrier for a free, new carrier with smaller leg 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Star Wars Lightsabers. CPSC received 38 reports about such toys  
with batteries that overheated. Three users suffered minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two models subject to the recalls are the Darth Maul  
Double-Bladed Lightsaber, which has retractable red plastic ``light 
blades'' on both sides of a metallic-gray hand grip. When the 
blades are fully extended, the toy is 5 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is the Qui-Gon Jinn Lightsaber, which has a single  
retractable ``light blade'' made of green plastic that extends from 
a metallic-gray hand grip to about 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using these Lightsabers immediately and  
call Hasbro at 888-690-6141 to get a free repair kit.

<HEADLINE> 2 Special Olympics Athletes Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Police searched Thursday for two Special  
Olympics basketball players from the Dominican Republic who 
apparently slipped away during a group outing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maximo Martinez, 21, and Jose Gallardo, 20, were reported  
missing Wednesday during a trip to a shopping mall with 21 other 
athletes. A cab driver reported taking two men matching their 
description to the bus station in Charlotte 80 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The two apparently had planned the getaway by devising a way to  
conceal from chaperones that they were in possession of their 
passports, police Capt. Jim Scifres said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were following a lead Thursday night that the two had  
gone to New York state. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Strike Called at Greek Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Unions at Olympic Airways on Thursday  
called a 24-hour strike for July 1 after a subsidiary of British 
Airways took over management at Greece's troubled state airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leader Michalis Perros described the deal as a  
``gravestone'' for Olympic by placing it in the hands of a 
competitor. ``It's like asking a wolf to tend to the sheep,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic staff staged a demonstration outside parliament,  
demanding that the deal be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Wednesday, the BA subsidiary  
Speedwing will run Olympic for 30 months, overseeing a financial 
rescue plan for the airline long plagued by debts and labor 
disputes. British Airways will be allowed to buy a stake in the 
airline of up to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argues Olympic cannot survive unless it forms  
partnerships with major airlines and insists the deal will not lead 
to job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Transport Minister Tassos Mandelis described the deal as a last  
ditch attempt to turn around the money-losing carrier. ``Olympic 
Airways was the only airline left in Europe ... without a strategic 
partnership and now it has found the best partner, British 
Airways,'' Mandelis told state-run NET television.

<HEADLINE> Colangelo: Game Will Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jerry Colangelo, one of the most influential  
owners in the NBA, promised a gathering of sports editors from 
newspapers around the country Wednesday that professional 
basketball will change for the better next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, owner of the Phoenix Suns and managing general  
partner of baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks, made the remark in a 
question and answer session during the keynote luncheon address at 
the Associated Press Sports Editors annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The game can be made more entertaining by enforcing rules that  
are already in place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to open it up,'' Colangelo said. ``We're going to  
clean up the game. We're going to insist that it be called the way 
basketball was meant to be called, because basketball was meant to 
be played showing athleticism, showing an open-court situation, 
getting away from the mugging that's taking place, giving a little 
more emphasis to offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo returned Tuesday night from New York, where he  
attended a meeting where the league discussed ideas about improving 
the deteriorating quality of play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at videotapes of 20 years ago, 15, 10, five  
years ago to what the game is today, there has been an evolution of 
what we've allowed to take place in terms of mugging, chucking, 
forearm shivers, etc.,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would enforce the rules that we have, you'd see a  
different game, but we've allowed it to go a particular way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo has been involved in the NBA since 1966, when he  
helped found the Chicago Bulls. Two years later, he moved to 
Phoenix as general manager of the expansion Suns. Later, he bought 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He said coaches who want to control the game have made every  
possession so important ``you end up with a half-court, post-up 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given too much liberty to defense. ... We've taken the  
offense out of the game. Shots are down. Scoring is down. 
Percentages are down. You can track it. We're going to make some 
real changes, and they'll be in effect this coming year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said he is one of the leading voices for the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like I said yesterday,'' he said. ``The media expects it, the  
fans demand it and it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo also spoke about his recently published book, ``How  
You Play The Game,'' which recounts his rise from an Italian 
neighborhood in Chicago to one of the leading sports figures in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated a theme of his book, that young athletes are too  
coddled and pampered, leading to some of the image problems that 
players have once they get to the professional level. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo defended his tactics in bringing major league baseball  
to Phoenix and disputed the widely held notion that he was behind 
the moves that led to the construction of Bank One Ballpark 
primarily with public money without a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That legislation was passed 2 1/2 years before he was asked to lead  
an effort to bring baseball to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had absolutely zero to do with it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Initially, he didn't think much of the baseball offer, then  
changed his mind after studying the idea and deciding it would 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo spent $118.9 million on free agents during the  
offseason, and as a result the Diamondbacks are contenders in just 
their second season. 
</P>
<P>
	But acceptance from other baseball owners has been slow in  
coming, especially at a time when there is little contact between 
the owners and the major league hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, in the NBA, I'm involved in every decision, with all  
the major committees that I participate on,'' Colangelo said, ``so 
you feel very much more involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thus far that hasn't been the experience in baseball. That  
probably will change to some degree as we continue to pay our dues, 
I guess.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Urges More Education Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- If Texas Gov. George W. Bush wins the  
Republican presidential nomination, he won't make abortion a litmus 
test for finding a running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his first criteria would be: ``Can that person be  
president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I would want to know if the person will help the  
ticket,'' Bush said Wednesday. But he added, ``I think it's a 
little presumptuous for somebody who doesn't even have the 
nomination to talk about a running mate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP rival Gary Bauer seized on Bush's non-comment to criticize  
him for refusing to exclude as possible running mates anyone who 
supports a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he were truly pro-life, he would rule out selecting a  
running mate who will not defend innocent children,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has taken the same position when asked if abortion would be  
an issue in picking Supreme Court nominees, saying ``there will be 
no litmus tests, except for whether or not the judges strictly 
interpret the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former President George Bush has said he opposes  
abortion and would support a constitutional amendment making the 
procedure illegal -- except in cases of rape, incest and when a 
woman's life is jeopardy. But he also has said Americans don't 
support the measure and he, thus, sees no need to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning a two-day fund-raising trip around Pennsylvania, Bush  
espoused giving state and local governments more control over 
education, including curriculum, disciplining students and 
punishing juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust local people to make decisions for their schools,'' said  
Bush, who has 17-year-old twin daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke to about 120 business people at a $1,000-a-plate lunch.  
Bush hoped to raise $700,000 at the Bethlehem event and subsequent 
events in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge introduced Bush as ``my good  
friend'' and ``my friend from Texas.'' Bush returned the favor, 
calling Ridge a ``good buddy'' and ``one of the best governors in 
all of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge was accompanying accompany Bush during his Pennsylvania  
campaign, which includes a scheduled breakfast today in Harrisburg 
and a luncheon in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Bethlehem, Bush and Ridge spoke about the  
importance of education to 40 elementary-aged students in the 
library at the Visitation BVM School in Philadelphia. Just a few 
children raised their hands when Bush asked how many of them read 
more than they watched TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can read, you can learn. And if you learn a lot, you  
can realize your dreams in this country,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a student asked him a question in Spanish, Bush rattled an  
answer back without taking a breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked if I could speak Spanish. As she can tell, not very  
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bethlehem, Bush didn't mention either President Clinton or  
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, 
but made veiled jabs at both. ``I will not use my office as a 
mirror to reflect public opinion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a proposal eerily similar to his father's ``thousand points  
of light,'' Bush championed an ``army of compassion.'' These 
private-sector ``compassion soldiers'' would offer help to unwed 
mothers or job training to welfare recipients with economic 
incentives but no direct aid from the government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot put a sense of purpose in our lives. ...  
Government can rally the armies of compassion to make sure no one 
is left behind,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Graf Escapes Against De Swardt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The serve came at Steffi Graf faster  
than she expected and whizzed past. She looked at the scoreboard 
and rolled her eyes: 116 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only bad news for Graf early in her second-round  
match Wednesday at Wimbledon. She lost five of the first six games 
to pesky Mariaan de Swardt, but then rallied to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wondering a little bit out there,'' Graf said. ``I felt  
like a spectator in the beginning, the way she was hitting those 
serves. There wasn't much I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt slammed four aces on her way to the early lead, but  
she was unable to pull off the second big upset in as many days at 
the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf became the tournament favorite when top-ranked Martina  
Hingis lost Tuesday to 16-year-old qualifier Jelena Dokic. But Graf 
grimaced when asked about her chances of winning Wimbledon for an 
eighth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is the biggest tournament around and the one I enjoy  
the most,'' she said. ``But if I win it or not, it's nothing that I 
worry right now about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Hingis' defeat and the absence of rain, the first  
three days of play produced few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles, Venus Williams, Anna Kournikova and 1998 runnerup  
Nathalie Tauziat joined Graf in the third round with straight-set 
victories. Hingis remained the only seeded woman eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Courier advanced beyond the second round at Wimbledon for  
the first time since 1993, when he lost in the final to Pete 
Sampras. Courier outlasted 12th-seeded Carlos Moya 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 
(7-1), 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, who has still never reached the third round in four tries  
at Wimbledon, was the first seeded man to lose. Fellow Spaniard 
Felix Mantilla, seeded 16th, was later eliminated by American Paul 
Goldstein, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-time champion Sampras, again looking almost invincible on  
grass, swept Sebastien Lareau 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good start,'' Sampras said. ``The fact that I've  
won here a couple of times gives me confidence. I don't feel the 
pressure, because I've proved myself here. If I don't win another 
Wimbledon, I'm sure I would be happy with five, but I'd love to win 
six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing were Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Mark Philippoussis, Greg  
Rusedski, Karol Kucera and Tommy Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseeded losers included Jennifer Capriati and French Open  
runnerup Andrei Medvedev. 
</P>
<P>
	With Graf coming off her French Open victory earlier this month,  
de Swardt appeared unlikely to mount a challenge. The stocky South 
African, ranked 38th, lost 10 of her first 12 matches in 1999 and 
has just one tournament title in 13 years on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graf brings out the best in de Swardt. They met twice  
previously, with Graf surviving a tough three-setter at Wimbledon 
in 1992, and de Swardt winning in 1995 at Brighton when Graf was 
ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt played almost flawless tennis in the first set  
Wednesday, belting aces and repeatedly winning points with 
acrobatic shots at the net. But she double-faulted twice to lose 
her serve in the first game of the final set, and Graf pulled away 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience helps a lot, and concentrating on what you know you  
can do,'' Graf said. ``You try to hang in there. The way she 
started the match, if she had continued like that, there would have 
been very little I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone suggested that the tough test might help Graf as she  
advances deeper into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always easy to say, `Yeah, I like to have  
three-setters,''' she said with a smile, ``if you come out as a 
winner.''

<P>
	Ever since David Letterman had defender Brandi Chastain on the  
show two weeks ago, ``The Late Show'' host has been an on-air 
supporter for the U.S. women's team. Letterman talks about the 
team's exploits in his show and there's even a rumor of a Letterman 
producer following the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is reveling in the attention, watching Letterman's show  
and wearing the T-shirts Letterman gave Chastain to give to her 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's having a lot of fun with the tournament and the team,''  
said U.S. coach Tony DiCicco. ``It looks like they want to do 
something more with us during the event, but as much as I would 
like to meet David Letterman, we still have to stay focused on 
winning games.''

<P>
	Shalala will be watching the first- round doubleheader as  
Germany meets Brazil and Nigeria faces Denmark on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The second match Shalala will attend will be on July 1 in the

	 *THIRD HAT TRICK:* China captain Sun Wen scored the third hat  
trick of the tournament in a 7-0 win over Ghana on Wednesday. Sun 
put the Chinese on track with her first goal in the ninth minute. 
She scored again in the 20th minute, giving China 3-0 lead going 
into halftime. In the 54th minute, Sun got her third goal when she 
grabbed a missed shot off the crossbar and left-footed it into the 
top of the net for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last minutes of the game, the Chinese dominated Ghana,  
scoring another three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team's fighting spirit was the one thing that helped us  
win the game,'' Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two hat tricks of the tournament were scored by  
Brazil's Pretinha and Sissi, who each scored three goals in a 7-1 
win over Mexico last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE NAKED TRUTH:* After a revealing photograph of defender  
Brandi Chastain appeared in a recent issue of Gear magazine, coach 
Tony DiCicco wasn't worried about the image of the United States 
women's team. Chastain was shown in a side shot wearing nothing but 
a strategically placed soccer ball at her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was interesting,'' said DiCicco. ``You've got to  
know Brandi. Brandi's got as big a heart as anyone on this team and 
she'd never do anything to undermine how this team is viewed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco added he didn't think the picture was a blemish on the  
team's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she kept it in a context that did promote women as  
fit, athletic, strong and still beautiful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The picture did get Chastain some media exposure. David  
Letterman invited her to his show and showed the picture on the 
air.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Crush Dems 17-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOWIE, Md., (AP) -- Democrats gave up eight unearned runs in the  
top of the first inning, enabling their Republican colleagues to 
take home a 17-1 blowout Thursday night in the annual baseball game 
among members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP pitcher Steve Largent struck out eight batters for his  
fourth win and the 25th victory for Republicans in the 38 years of 
partisan play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the biggest margin, but it wasn't the most  
exciting,'' Largent, a former wide receiver for the Seattle 
Seahawks and now an Oklahoma congressman, said as he signed 
autographs on the field after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	With bases loaded and two outs, Rep. Kenny Hulshof of Missouri  
and Largent crossed home plate to start the scoring on an error by 
Minnesota Democratic Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, who was blinded by the 
setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first inning shows how important defense is,'' said  
Hulshof, R-Mo., who was two for three with two runs and a stolen 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	The only home run of the night was a solo by Tennessee  
Republican Rep. Zach Wamp that netted $25,000 for prostate cancer 
research. Wamp also hit a double and drove in three runs for the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' star was New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, who scored  
their only run, twice slid headfirst into base and stole a base. 
Pitcher Mel Watt, D-N.C., struck out only one Republican. His team 
lost to Largent's last year, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored annually by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the  
charity game netted an estimated $100,000 for the Washington 
Literacy Council, the Metropolitan Police Boys and Girls Club and 
the Bowie Health Center Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made an appearance, the first  
time in 10 years the sport's top official has come to the game.

<HEADLINE> Nancy Lopez Has Successful Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Nancy Lopez had arthroscopic surgery  
Thursday morning to remove torn cartilage from her right knee, and 
is expected to be out for about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Craig Morgan of the Morgan Kalman Clinic said the procedure  
took 25 minutes and went according to schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez is expected to stay in the hospital until Saturday before  
returning home to Albany, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	She was in tears Wednesday afternoon when she announced she  
would have to withdraw from the LPGA Championship, which she has 
won three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything major,'' she said. ``Besides being  
disappointed, I'm fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Se Ri Pak, who opened with a 68, said she was  
going to visit Lopez in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak was paired with Lopez in the first two rounds last year, and  
Lopez immediately took an interest in the 21-year-old South Korean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sad, too,'' Pak said. ``I wanted to see her this  
week. We talked about this week, if we can have practice round 
together. But she started with pain in the knee, so that was kind 
of sad. But I hope she will feel better.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Claim Safer Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tobacco companies have worked for years to make  
their products safe by lowering tar and nicotine, an industry 
lawyer said Thursday during closing arguments in the first 
class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Collectively, this industry (employed) over 1,000 scientists  
to work on the problem of improving this product to make a safer 
cigarette,'' R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. attorney Benjamine Reid 
said. ``These companies did not sit idly by while this debate was 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said that levels of tar and nicotine in all brands of  
cigarettes have been reduced 68 percent since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers or their  
survivors are seeking at least $200 billion from Philip Morris, 
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and other cigarette makers and industry 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said that companies never intended to target children as  
the plaintiffs accused them of doing with Joe Camel cartoon 
advertising. The lawyer said that Joe Camel was targeted at 18- to 
24-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the sick smokers will address the jury Friday.

biggest and the best at everything. When it comes to sports these 
days, they're exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas team just won the Stanley Cup, another is close to  
wrapping up the NBA championship and one more is off to a perfect 
start as it seeks a third straight WNBA crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of baseball's reigning division winners are from Texas and  
both are in first place again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's best college football player played for Texas'  
biggest school and the state's NFL team is coming off its sixth 
division title in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot streak extends to athletes with Texas ties, from hot  
golfers to the world's best women's soccer player to one of the 
world's fastest runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, even WWF superstar ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin is a Texan.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading back in the right direction,'' said Tom Hicks,  
owner of the NHL champion Dallas Stars and first-place Texas 
Rangers, and a member of the University of Texas board of regents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Randy Galloway said the Texas  
sports scene is as strong as he's seen in 33 years of covering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absoutely the best of times to be a sports fan in this  
part of the world,'' Galloway said. ``I don't think there's ever 
been a bad time, this just happens to be the very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this roll so special is that many of the winners are  
tasting success for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars moved south in 1993 after 26 championship-less  
seasons in Minnesota. Six years later, they're atop the hockey 
world, having beaten the Buffalo Sabres for the NHL title early 
Sunday. (Interestingly, the Stars weren't even the first Texas team 
to win a hockey championship this month. On June 5, the Houston 
Aeros became champs of the International Hockey League, one of the 
highest minor leagues.) 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars waited 32 years for the first title in franchise  
history, eight years longer than any other NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs are one victory from ending a similar  
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	They've spent 26 seasons in the Alamo City without winning a  
championship. That could end as soon as Friday as the Spurs hold a 
3-1 series lead over the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of Texas is rooting for the Spurs,'' Gov. George W. Bush  
said Thursday during a campaign stop in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	With up to three chances to win the title, the Spurs appear  
likely to become the first franchise from the defunct ABA to stand 
atop the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	A Spurs-Stars double would make pro sports history for Texas. No  
state has ever won NBA and NHL titles in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if it happens, Texans will surely savor the fact that their  
teams did it by beating teams from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes the point even better,'' Hicks said. ``I've got a  
ton of friends in New York and an office in New York, but the 
reality is that it's fun to be on the outside and disappoint them 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Spurs victory would give Texans another interesting claim:  
three straight NBA titles not won by Michael Jordan. The Houston 
Rockets were league champs in 1994 and '95 during Jordan's hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs bid to be NBA kings, the Houston Comets are the  
proven WNBA queens. The Comets won the first two league titles and 
were the only undefeated team this season going into a game 
Thursday night in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are giving the state's  
baseball fans reason to dream once again of an Interstate 45 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston won the NL Central the last two years and is nipping at  
the Atlanta Braves' heels for the top record in the NL this season. 
The Rangers are charging toward a third AL West crown in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the Stanley Cup out there last night and the players in  
the dugout were all rubbing it for good luck,'' Hicks said. 
``Hopefully some of it will wear off on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Texas team has ever made it to the World Series. Many  
Texans haven't noticed, though, because by October they're focused 
only on football. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a lot to cheer about last fall as Ricky Williams won  
the Heisman Trophy, setting all sorts of records as he led the 
Texas Longhorns back from misery. Texas and Texas A&AMP;M played in 
major bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys did a nice turnaround, too, improving to 10-6  
from 6-10. They were the first team ever to go undefeated in the 
NFC East as they won the division for the 19th time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When society gets fired up over their team and is anxiously  
awaiting the next game, that helps everybody,'' Cowboys owner Jerry 
Jones said. ``The bottom line is it creates a lot of pride, no 
matter if people are really into that sport or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big news in golf is Payne Stewart winning the U.S. Open.  
Around here he's known as ``Former SMU golfer Payne Stewart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first family in golf these days in the Kuehne clan of  
Dallas. Hank Kuehne, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, was the 
low amateur in the Open. Two weeks before, little sister Kelli 
followed her first LPGA victory with a third-place finish in the 
U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's World Cup is being played throughout the United  
States and all eyes are on American superstar Mia Hamm, a native of 
Wichita Falls, Texas. She lived up to her hype in Saturday's 
opener, scoring the first goal and assisting on one in a 3-0 
victory over Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the track world's spotlight will be on the  
200-meter showdown between Maurice Greene and Dallas' Michael 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	As for ``Stone Cold,'' the folks in his hometown of Edna, Texas,  
knew him as Steve Williams. The quiet, reserved kid they knew is 
now considered one of wrestling's baddest dudes, but he's also one 
of the most popular.

<HEADLINE> Aretha Franklin Honors Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The ``Queen of Soul'' took some time to  
honor Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of U.N. employees and passersby watched Aretha Franklin  
and a choir tape ``The Lord's Prayer'' on Thursday as part of a 
millennium celebration honoring the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Franklin and the choir did the taping on the lawn outside  
the United Nations, in front of the peace bell which was a gift 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute will be inserted into a program called ``Prodigal  
Son.'' The program will be broadcast on Italian television June 29, 
to honor the pope's 79th birthday which was May 18, said Franklin's 
publicist, Barbara Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Franklin also sang for the pontiff in person in 1987 when he  
visited Detroit.

<HEADLINE> CBOT Members OK Alliance With Eurex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Board of Trade members chose technology  
over tradition Thursday, overwhelmingly approving a broad alliance 
with an all-electronic rival exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's members voted 750-126 in favor of the deal with the  
Frankfurt, Germany-based Eurex. The combination will allow the two 
exchanges to cross-trade their contracts electronically starting in 
the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote marked a change of heart for the membership, which  
narrowly rejected a similar alliance in January. Members had been 
hesitant to stray from the Board of Trade's 151-year-old tradition 
of open outcry, which lets traders yell and gesture to set the 
prices for everything from corn to U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance will secure our global leadership position,  
strengthen our world-class trading system for open outcry and 
electronic markets and bring global business opportunities to our 
members,'' Board of Trade Chairman David P. Brennan said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan urged a go-slow approach to an alliance with Eurex in  
December during his campaign for the board's chairmanship. That 
platform helped him edge out incumbent Patrick Arbor, a vocal 
supporter of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brennan reversed course this spring after a power struggle  
within the leadership ranks left his position weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trading firms have migrated to computer-based trading,  
saying it is easier and cheaper because they no longer have to keep 
expensive staff at individual exchanges. Board of Trade competitors 
have moved quickly to profit from the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision brings us another step forward in our endeavor  
to build a bridge across the Atlantic together with our American 
colleagues,'' Eurex CEO Jorg Franke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Brennan urged approval of the Eurex alliance and said  
a decision to ultimately abandon the exchange's own electronic 
trading platform, known as Project A, would save money. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal between the two exchanges will cost $50 million over the  
next 18 months, but developing a new screen-based system by itself 
would cost far more, Brennan said.

<HEADLINE> Tips To Improve Sleep Patterns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Having trouble getting to sleep at night, or awakening too early  
in the morning? Experts have these tips, based, in part, on a new 
study: 
</P>
<P>
	--Maintain a regular sleep-wake cycle, even on weekends. Staying  
up late, with the lights burning, tends to reset the brain's sleep 
clock, making the body cry out for more sleep when the alarm sounds 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	--If awakened during the night, try to remain in bed, with the  
lights out and your eyes closed. This will help sleep return and 
will not affect your normal sleep-wake cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you must get up, keep the lights as dim as possible. Bright  
lights tend to reset the brain's sleep clock. One hour of bright 
light exposure at night shifts the clock forward by about 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid alcohol, tobacco and caffeine before bedtime.  
</P>
<P>
	--If sleeplessness is caused by a disorder, treat that disorder  
specifically instead of trying to force sleep with pills. 
</P>
<P>
	--Afternoon or early evening naps may make it harder to fall  
asleep at the regular time. 
</P>
<P>
	--American travelers who fly overnight to Europe should try to  
nap immediately upon arrival. After a few hours of sleep, get up 
and walk in the sunlight. This will help reset the body clock to 
European time.

	CHARLES CITY, Iowa (AP) -- St. John Evangelical Lutheran Church  
is offering more than prayers to protect children. It is offering 
trigger locks that prevent a gun from firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal here is to keep children safe. And what can be more  
appropriate for a church to be doing?'' said Mark Anderson, St. 
John's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers from the church were to hand out the locks at a  
shopping mall, show how to install them and talk about gun safety. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Columbine High School killings in  
Colorado, Anderson said, ``a debate on national gun control policy 
is not as effective as handing out trigger locks. You can go home 
and say there are 100 guns out there that are safer.''

 *Protestants meet in Havana's main plaza    	
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro was in the front row when  
the secretary general of the National Council of Churches in Christ 
USA asked Protestant worshippers to pardon the American people for 
their government's embargo against the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The rare Protestant religious service was part of the Cuban  
Evangelical Celebration in Havana's broad Plaza of the Revolution. 
The council is an interdenominational, cooperative body that 
includes most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox religions in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask you to forgive the suffering that has come to you by  
the actions of the United States,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown 
Campbell, who has spoken out against the three-decade embargo in 
the past. ``For people of faith there are no embargoes, there are 
no barriers,'' she said.

 *Bishop's title eludes gay priest    	
</P>
<P>
	BATH, N.Y. (AP) -- The Episcopal Church's Diocese of Rochester  
has elected the Rev. Jack McKelvey as its next bishop, narrowly 
bypassing a candidate who had hoped to become the church's first 
openly gay bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	The polling took place at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in  
Bath, 60 miles south of Rochester. After five ballots, McKelvey 
defeated the Rev. V. Gene Robinson and three other nominees to 
succeed retiring Bishop William G. Burrill at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The election still must be approved by a majority of the  
dioceses and bishops in the 2.5 million-member church, which is 
based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	McKelvey, 57, an assisting bishop of the Newark (N.J.) Diocese  
for nine years and a priest since 1967, supports same-sex marriages 
and ordination of openly gay ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the church is going to have to be ready for it  
eventually,'' he said. ``When that is I don't know, but gay and 
lesbian people to be sure are human beings under God's care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Robinson, he said, ``We would not differ theologically  
and perhaps in anything that I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 52, assistant to Bishop Douglas Theuner of the Diocese  
of New Hampshire and a priest for 25 years, was married with two 
children when he acknowledged he was gay in 1986. He now lives with 
his partner, Mark Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it was an issue in this election,'' Robinson said,  
``and I applaud the people of the diocese in being quite open in 
asking me about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he would seek to become bishop in another diocese.  
``I believe God is calling me ...,'' he said.

 *American Baptists expel four churches    	
</P>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Four California churches were expelled  
by the board of the American Baptist Churches USA on the eve of the 
church's nationwide biennial meeting. The offense was ``welcoming 
and affirming'' homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	American Baptist congregations are autonomous. The denomination  
is a voluntary association with no authority except to withhold its 
affiliation. Churches join by affiliating with a region; the five 
churches were dismissed from their regions but appealed to the 
General Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to win on appeal were Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church in  
Oakland; First Baptist Church of Berkeley; New Community of Faith 
in San Jose; and San Leandro Community Church in San Leandro.

 *Reformed Church retains ties    	
</P>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Delegates of the Reformed Church in  
America defeated proposals to sever ties with the United Church of 
Christ over UCC acceptance of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill that failed would have led to efforts to determine  
whether the UCC has lost belief in the full divinity of Jesus 
Christ and has become unitarian in its theology. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year four denominations -- the Reformed Church, the UCC,  
Evangelican Lutheran Church of America and Presbyterian Church 
(USA) -- entered a close fellowship, but not full organizational 
merger, involving some 10.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The more conservative Reformed Church had initiated a dialogue  
with the UCC on homosexuality. Talks ended last January with each 
denomination urging the other to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We admonish the UCC to repeal its official positions that  
sanction homosexual practice,'' the Reformed Church panelists said. 
But UCC negotiators said stands like the Reformed Church's help 
foster ``virulent voices of prejudice.''

<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- The more than 4,000 Muslims in the  
Waterloo area now have a cemetery that conforms to their customs 
and burial practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim community grew in large part with the arrival of more  
than 3,000 Bosnians since 1996 and had been without a cemetery 
until the city's Board of Adjustment approved zoning of 4 acres of 
farmland near two other cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims bury their dead in the direction of the holy city of  
Mecca and in rows in the order in which they pass away. They do not 
use a coffin or concrete vault and have relatively small 
headstones.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign DB Tremain Mack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Tremain Mack, a kick returner and defensive  
back who landed in jail last season because of drunken-driving 
arrests, signed a new two-year contract Thursday with the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals, who drafted Mack in the fourth round in 1997 from  
the University of Miami, reinstated him two weeks ago. NFL 
officials still have not said whether he will face league 
discipline, which could involve a suspension, this season because 
of his alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	This would have been the final season of his original three-year  
contract with the Bengals, but the new contract secures him through 
the 2000 season. Terms weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was primarily a kick returner last season before missing  
the final four games because of his latest drunken-driving arrest. 
He served jail time for a probation violation and has been 
undergoing an NFL-mandated alcohol evaluation program. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a history of drinking problems when the Bengals drafted  
him. He had been arrested six times in less than four years, with 
at least three of the arrests related to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	He is listed as the backup at left cornerback to rookie Charles  
Fisher, although he has played mostly at strong safety his first 
two years. Mack set team records in kickoff return average (25.9) 
and yards (1,165) in the first 12 games last season, with one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He was jailed in Clermont County, east of Cincinnati, beginning  
in December after violating his probation stemming from a 
drunken-driving arrest Oct. 13, 1998, in the Cincinnati area. He 
underwent a mandatory two-month treatment program and was evaluated 
by the NFL under its substance-abuse program.

<HEADLINE> Repsol Clinches $13.1B Bid for YPF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Spanish oil giant Repsol  
joined the ranks of the world's top 10 oil companies on Thursday 
when it clinched a $13.1 billion takeover bid for Argentina's YPF. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol said a preliminary count of the all-cash offer showed  
that stockholders representing more than 83 percent of the 
company's shares voted for the deal. That means Repsol will move 
ahead to take control of YPF, the energy conglomerate that is 
Argentina's biggest corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, Repsol bought nearly 15 percent in YPF for $2.01  
billion from the Argentine government. With the latest development, 
it now controls 98.2 percent of YPF. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historic moment for Repsol. Following the  
acquisition of YPF, Repsol has made a giant leap forward, becoming 
a larger, better balanced corporation with an increased growth 
potential,'' Repsol Chairman Alfonso Cortina said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The high market acceptance of this acquisition has been based  
on the complementary nature of both companies' business 
portfolios,'' added Cortina. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the takeover has succeeded, Repsol will have a number  
of additional strategic moves to make, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 2, Repsol will complete an offering of 240 million new  
shares, expanding its capital by nearly 27 percent, to finance part 
of the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's management.  
</P>
<P>
	Repsol hasn't said what it will do with Roberto Monti, the  
talented but occasionally abrasive head of YPF, and his fellow 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The YPF executives all backed the Repsol offer, although Monti  
earlier in the year opposed Repsol's attempts to change company 
bylaws to allow Repsol to increase its stake in YPF beyond 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortina made a vague reference to current management in his  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new company will need all the management and technical  
skills offered by both corporations to fulfill the program we have 
designed for future growth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts emphasized that YPF is already well run and lean.  
</P>
<P>
	Repsol will also have to decide whether it's going to hold onto  
all 98 percent of YPF, whether it will sell back some on the Buenos 
Aires stock exchange, whether it will offer its own shares on the 
Argentine market, or whether it will simply delist YPF. 
</P>
<P>
	YPF-Repsol will have about 18 months to meet antitrust  
conditions laid out by the Argentine government. In addition to 
YPF, Repsol owns a majority stake in another Argentine energy 
company, Astra CAPSA. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last week said Repsol-YPF will be required to cut  
its natural gas market share, trim refining capacity and sell off 
service stations, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding another wrinkle, the Argentine Senate late Wednesday  
approved an antitrust bill that included three key modifications to 
an earlier version -- two of which are directly linked to the 
YPF-Repsol deal. The bill must be passed by the lower Chamber of 
Deputies before becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the revised bill, any merger creating a company with gross  
annual sales of $100 million or more would be subject to scrutiny. 
Thus, the Repsol-YPF merger may be subject to a review, legislative 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the (purchase) process will be reversed,'' said  
Jose Costa Buck of the Flemings brokerage in Buenos Aires. ``But if 
the law is approved it could have some say over the divestments.''

<HEADLINE> Man Bought Gun Just Before Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- A 30-year-old man who died in a  
shootout with police purchased a 9 mm handgun for $374 hours before 
he apparently killed his three young daughters, investigators said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Gonzales' wife had obtained a temporary restraining order  
that required him to stay away from the family. But he had not been 
served with the documentation, so that information did not turn up 
in the required background check, the district attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales was killed by police in a pre-dawn shootout Wednesday  
after he pulled a pickup truck up in front of the police station 
and fired through a plate-glass window, narrowly missing an officer 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, police found his daughters, Rebecca, 10;  
Katheryn, 8, and Leslie, 7, dead inside the bullet-riddled truck. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy on Thursday confirmed that the girls died of gunshot  
wounds sometime prior to the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Gonzales picked the girls up near their house in  
Castle Rock after Mrs. Gonzales gave him permission to take them 
out Tuesday evening.

<P>
	Around 6 p.m. Gonzales called a gun dealer who had advertised a  
handgun in a newspaper for $375 dollars, said police. The 
background check took about one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the girls were shot in the truck. Gonzales' wife,  
Jessica, 33, her son, Jessie, relatives and friends struggled to 
understand what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't conceive it. It can't even be real to us now,  
because you can't do that to kids,'' said Tommy Rivera, Mrs. 
Gonzales' sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gonzaleses were married in 1990, separating last year,  
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In an application for a restraining order filed last month, Mrs.  
Gonzales said her husband tried hang himself in front of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gonzales called police twice in the hours before the  
shootout because she was concerned about the children's welfare. 
She said her husband had suicidal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales had worked for the past year maintaining computer  
systems at Natural Balance, Inc. in Castle Rock, a dietary 
supplement company where supervisors said he was a valued employee 
who had shown no signs of personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He had served in the Navy and received a monthly disability  
payment.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, seeking to bolster  
his credentials as a unifier, offered a forceful defense of 
affirmative action and paid tribute to a gay and lesbian community 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	He faced a skeptical audience at the gay center, where Javier  
Garcia asked, ``I want to know exactly why you're here.'' Garcia 
said later he was ``suspicious'' that Gores appearance was purely 
political. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's tour of the center Thursday came exactly one week after  
his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley, 
visited it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to learn and to pay honor to this place,'' Gore said,  
adding the Gay and Lesbian Center of Los Angeles was ``helping to 
change attitudes and abolish some irrational discrimination that is 
all too common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He granted his only interview of the day to the Advocate, a  
national gay and lesbian news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has a longtime commitment to bringing our  
country together,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``He strongly 
believes that we're much stronger as a country when all aspects of 
our community work together and come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he supports federal legislation that would outlaw  
discrimination against homosexuals at the workplace, and bills 
criminalizing certain hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Byler, 22, said she didn't find Gore convincing.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't really speak to me or say anything to impress me,''  
said Byler, who said she left the Army after acknowledging her 
homosexuality. She added that she had met Bradley a week earlier 
and found Bradley equally unimpressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in the affluent Bel Air section of Los Angeles, Gore  
told a largely black audience that while the nation has made some 
progress in shrinking the racial divide, much work remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The wage disparity between blacks and whites is narrowing, and  
black and white graduation rates are ``just about even,'' he said, 
speaking poolside at the home of Jerry Florence, an auto and music 
executive. Unemployment for blacks and Hispanics is the lowest in 
the nations history, he said, taking partial credit on behalf of 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But average family wealth among black families is one-tenth that  
of whites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we have our work cut out for us,'' Gore said. ``We need to  
bring our nation together as one America, not just in rhetoric 
alone, but in our hears and in reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sharply partisan speech Thursday evening to a mostly  
Hispanic audience, Gore said the GOP had sought to divide 
Californians with ``demagogic tactics designed to turn one group 
against each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an apparent reference to the states Proposition 187, the  
successful ballot measure five years ago that sought to bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving most forms of state aid.

<HEADLINE> VoiceStream, Omnipoint To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- VoiceStream Wireless is buying Omnipoint  
Corp. in a deal worth $2.04 billion, and the merger that could 
create a behemoth licensed to provide cellular phone service to 
some 175 million people from New York to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Wednesday, each share of Omnipoint will  
be exchanged for 0.825 share of VoiceStream, plus $8 a share in 
cash. Additionally, VoiceStream will invest $150 million in 
Omnipoint before the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a Hong Kong-based  
telecommunications provider, will invest $957 million in the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnipoint, based in Bethesda, operates cellular-phone service in  
the New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami and Detroit markets. The 
company had 1998 revenue of $172.5 million and 375,000 subscribers 
by the end of 1998. It has been struggling to find an investor for 
a year after running up huge debts to build wireless networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless Corp., a  
regional cellular-phone provider in Issaquah, Wash. VoiceStream 
operates in 13 western states.

<HEADLINE> Claudia Lonow Mines Past for Laughs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In Showtime's ``Rude Awakening,''  
actress-turned-writer Claudia Lonow fearlessly tells all (or close 
enough) about a woman derailed by life in the Hollywood fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
	At this moment, however, she's distracted from the series'  
sophomore season and is being coy about telling why. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to know what I was doing right now. You  
wouldn't believe how stupid it is,'' she says. Then, living up to 
the bold honesty of ``Rude Awakening,'' she 'fesses up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm single and young and ... good-looking, but I never have  
time to meet anybody,'' she says. ``I signed up for this dating 
service, someone wrote me, and me and the other writers on the show 
are sitting and composing a funny e-mail back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the straight-talking Lonow who, as personified by  
fictional Billie Frank, makes ``Rude Awakening'' such a bracing 
slap in the face of timid television and TV's shrinking-violet 
female characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I wanted to do with this character is have a woman  
who really says what's on her mind. Girls are expected to always be 
good, and I just hate that,'' Lonow says. 
</P>
<P>
	Billie is an angry young woman with a drinking problem and a  
knack for making things tough for herself and her friends. That her 
life manages to be the stuff of truth and humor is due to Lonow, 
who knows both the dark terrain and the mechanics of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, starring Sherilyn Fenn (``Twin Peaks'') as Billie,  
returns to Showtime 10 p.m. EDT Saturday with 22 new episodes. Lynn 
Redgrave, Jonathan Penner and Rain Pryor co-star, with Roger E. 
Mosley (``Magnum, P.I.'') joining as a series regular. 
</P>
<P>
	Also appearing this season will be Karen Black, Michelle  
Phillips and rocker Roger Daltry. 
</P>
<P>
	A true ``dramedy,'' mixing comedy and tragedy in the half-hour  
format and minus a laugh track, the series chronicles the struggle 
of former child star Billie to conquer her alcoholism and assorted 
demons. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother (played by Redgrave) isn't much help. When Billie  
announces she has attended her first recovery group meeting, dear 
mom cheerily pours champagne for both to toast the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	So how much of Lonow's life is in ``Rude Awakening''?  
</P>
<P>
	``I like to say 60 percent is true and 40 percent is fictional,  
and it's up to you to figure out which,'' she replies. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's some help:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billie is an alumna of a primetime soap opera, ``Emerald  
Isle''; Lonow played Michele Lee and Don Murray's wayward daughter, 
Diana Fairgate, on CBS' ``Knots Landing'' from 1979-84 and in the 
series' final year, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Billie is working, reluctantly, on her alcohol addiction  
problem; Lonow did the same, eventually embracing the sober life in 
her 20s. (Her age now? ``You can put down 34.'') 
</P>
<P>
	-- Unlike Billie, Lonow has a ``very good relationship'' with her  
parents. And, unlike Billie, she managed to channel her energy away 
from acting and into what has turned out far more rewarding: 
writing and, with ``Rude Awakening,'' producing. 
</P>
<P>
	If she had any inclination to continue as an actress, taking  
part in the ``Knots Landing'' reunion movie in 1997 cured her of 
the impulse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be there. All I could think was, 'The last  
time I did this I was 21.' I didn't want to be this person 
anymore,'' Lonow says. She also concluded, ``I was a very good 
actress as a teen-ager, but perhaps not so great as a grown-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the cast and producers of ``Knots Landing'' were  
supportive, the pressure of working so young on a project in which 
so much money was at stake contributed to her addiction, Lonow 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it's an unusual person who can deal with that kind  
of stress and not have it affect them. It was hard for me,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Would she let her daughter, now 5, act? ``No way,'' Lonow  
replies, firmly. ``When you're a teen-ager, you should work in a 
clothing store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for a new career, she struck out in a direction that  
was, partly, a return to her roots. As the stepdaughter of Mark 
Lonow, co-owner of the Improvisation comedy club chain, Lonow had 
written and performed routines beginning in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying screenplay writing, she began job-hunting -- very  
unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was Mark's daughter, a drunk, who used to be on 'Knots  
Landing,' and I was never fabulous as a comic. ... It took me a 
while to figure out that if I'm gonna get into this, I've got to 
pursue people who don't know me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, she was grateful for a job as a Hollywood  
assistant. Then came jobs writing comedy CD-Roms, then an Internet 
show called ``Claudia Boulevard'' and, finally, luck. 
</P>
<P>
	A pilot she was hired to polish for producer Joe Voci didn't  
sell. But when Lonow mentioned her idea for a comedy drawing on her 
life, Voci told her to write it; Showtime bought ``Rude 
Awakening.'' Most critics liked it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one of just constant surprise. I'm just  
beginning to recover from it now,'' Lonow says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	IN THE SOUP: Stand-up comedian Hal Sparks is the new host of E!  
Entertainment Television's ``Talk Soup.'' Sparks, a Los Angeles 
comedy club regular and guest star on series including ``Dr. Quinn, 
Medicine Woman'' and ``Lois &AMP; Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman,'' will take over July 5. John Henson, current host of the 
show that takes a lighthearted look at talk show highlights, is

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall, Pushing Yield Up / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bonds fell for a fifth straight  
session Thursday, pushing interest rates farther above 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32  
point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, rose to 6.16 percent from 6.14 
percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys have been in a steady decline since Friday, when the  
market began reversing the rally spurred by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. With the Fed 
expected to raise interest rates next week to slow the economy, 
potential bond buyers aren't stepping in even though many see 
current yields as attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to up 1/32 point, while intermediate maturities were 
between unchanged and down 1/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Thursday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
were 4.72 percent as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 
4.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.03 percent, as the discount rose 0.01  
percentage point to 4.84 percent. One-year yields were 5.16 percent 
as the discount was unchanged at 4.90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.88 percent from Wednesday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/2 to 118 3/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.56 percent, up from 5.53 percent late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Skateboarders, cyclists, street lugers and  
other fringe athletes with a need for speed hit the uncommonly 
steep streets of this city Thursday for ESPN's annual X Games. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 athletes from around the world are competing for  
nearly $1 million in prize money in the 10-day extreme sports 
competition, which has become a huge draw for advertisers seeking 
to tap into the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitive events include sportclimbing, skateboarding, street  
luge, bicycle stunt riding, aggressive in-line skating, 
wakeboarding, and skysurfing, set against a background of 
alternative music concerts and merchandising events. 
</P>
<P>
	The skysurfing competition finished Monday over the Monterey Bay  
with the two-man team of Eric Fradet and Alex Iodice of France 
taking the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	In skysurfing, competitors leap from a plane with a snowboard  
strapped to their feet, and make a series of high-speed spins, 
flips and surfing-styled moves, all recorded by a parachuting 
cameraman. The descents are judged on technical execution and 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN expects about 200,000 spectators along the city's  
waterfront, where many of the skateboarding and bicycling events 
will take place. The street luge will take advantage of a 
particularly steep hill that runs past the city's Cliff House next 
to the Pacific ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the event has been held in San Francisco.  
Despite the city's reputation for skateboarding, skating down a 
sidewalk in the city is illegal and can incur fines up to $100.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Webb Having Dream Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- When Karrie Webb says she is having a  
dream year on the LPGA Tour, she's not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Australian is building on her modern LPGA record  
of 16 consecutive finishes in the top 10, has already won five 
times this year and is on the verge of becoming the first woman to 
go over $1 million before July. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the eve of the LPGA Championship, Webb revealed she has  
had some ``really weird dreams'' the last couples of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent one involved her in a playoff with fellow Aussie  
Rachel Hetherington. Tournament officials made them walk up and 
down a steep hill before they could hit their tee shots, and Webb 
was out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I woke up,'' she said. ``I woke up before I had the  
playoff because I didn't want to know who won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that would have been a big surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	Webb isn't winning every week on the LPGA Tour, it just seems  
that way. In 13 tournaments this year, she has won five times and 
been in contention on Sunday in all but three of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, two of those happened to be majors. She was among  
those in the wake left by Dottie Pepper in her record-setting 
victory in the Dinah Shore, and she finished 10 strokes behind Juli 
Inkster in the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	At 24, Webb has already accomplished more than she could have  
dreamed with 14 victories and already enough earnings to rank 12th 
on the career money list. All that remains is that first major, and 
she will certainly be one of the favorites at Dupont Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that she would consider herself a failure if it doesn't  
happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if I was 40 years old and heading on the way out,'' she  
said. ``But I'm still on the way. I know I have a lot of golf ahead 
of me. Three and a half years ago, if someone told me I had won 
this many times out here, I would never have believed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just living the dream now.''  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest dream of all this week belongs to Inkster.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning two major championships as a rookie 15 years ago -- the  
Dinah Shore and du Maurier Classic -- only made Inkster hungry to 
win them all. Perhaps that's why the LPGA Championship means more 
to her now than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Having won the U.S. Open at Old Waverly three weeks ago, Inkster  
could join Pat Bradley as the only women to complete the modern 
LPGA career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to have another great week to do it,''  
Inkster said. ``It's been a little hectic in my lifestyle, and I 
just have to focus on my golf game. But I think I can do it. I 
think I have as good a chance as anybody else out there right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Wright, whose swing Ben Hogan said was the best he ever  
saw, is the only other woman to win all four majors, which from 
1955-66 consisted of the U.S. Open, the LPGA Championship, the 
Titleholders and the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty difficult task,'' Bradley said. ``You're dealing  
with majors, which aren't your everyday, ordinary tournaments. But 
I think if anybody has the savvy to do it, Juli is perfectly 
qualified for that task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, Inkster isn't the only player capable of winning  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion is Se Ri Pak, who won last week in  
Absecon, N.J., for the first time this year. All four of Pak's 
victories in 1998, when she became the first rookie since Inkster 
to win two majors, came during a 10-week stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a good feeling to this week,'' Pak said.  
</P>
<P>
	And Webb seems to have good feelings every time she tees it up.  
She is coming off a memorable victory two weeks ago in Rochester, 
where she birdied the last three holes to win by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb decided to take last week off -- as hot as she is, she  
probably could have made a fortune in the casinos of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my schedule up around the majors,'' she said. ``I'm  
trying to peak at the right time. I feel my game is in pretty good 
shape. I have never had as much confidence as I have right now on 
the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only place her confidence seems to be lacking is in her  
dreams.

<HEADLINE>  Israel Bombs Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israel's warplanes bombed power stations  
and bridges Thursday in retaliatory strikes that left at least six 
people dead. The escalation in hostilities came as guerrilla 
attacks in northern Israel killed two Israelis and injured 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five people in Lebanon were wounded in nine Israeli  
airstrikes, three of which targeted a power facility on a hill 
overlooking Beirut and left much of the city in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were among the heaviest by Israel since a 1996  
Israeli bombing blitz in Lebanon left 175 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Warplanes also hit a power substation in the eastern city of  
Baalbek and four airstrikes targeted bridges on the main coastal 
road to southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army said in a statement that air force planes  
carried out the bombings in response to Hezbollah rocket attacks on 
northern Israel earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Israelis were killed as Katyusha rockets rained down on the  
Israeli border city of Kiryat Shmonah. At least 13 people were 
injured, one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men who were killed -- the first Israelis to die in a  
rocket barrage since 1995 -- had apparently been standing in front 
of city hall when a Katyusha scored a direct hit on the building.

<HEADLINE>  Israel Bombs Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israel's warplanes bombed power stations  
and bridges Thursday in retaliatory strikes that left at least six 
people dead. The escalation in hostilities came as guerrilla 
attacks in northern Israel killed two Israelis and injured 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five people in Lebanon were wounded in nine Israeli  
airstrikes, three of which targeted a power facility on a hill 
overlooking Beirut and left much of the city in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were among the heaviest by Israel since a 1996  
Israeli bombing blitz in Lebanon left 175 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Warplanes also hit a power substation in the eastern city of  
Baalbek and four airstrikes targeted bridges on the main coastal 
road to southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army said in a statement that air force planes  
carried out the bombings in response to Hezbollah rocket attacks on 
northern Israel earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Israelis were killed as Katyusha rockets rained down on the  
Israeli border city of Kiryat Shmonah. At least 13 people were 
injured, one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men who were killed -- the first Israelis to die in a  
rocket barrage since 1995 -- had apparently been standing in front 
of city hall when a Katyusha scored a direct hit on the building. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rains Threaten Midwest Wheat Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, Kan. (AP) -- Spreading like a golden wave across the  
nation's heartland, millions of acres of winter wheat began 
ripening a few weeks ago, drawing crews from across the country and 
the world to harvest it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rains began.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the fields are too soggy for the 27,000-pound combines to  
move in, and the wheat is too wet to harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the stalks will fall over, making the crop even harder to  
bring in. And soon, too, the wheat heads will shatter, destroying 
the crop's commercial value for anything but animal feed. Winter 
wheat is used primarily to make bread. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``custom cutters'' who follow the ripening crops and  
streamed into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas from as far away as 
Australia and South Africa are waiting out the weather in hotel 
rooms in sleepy rural towns, doing little but sleeping, eating and 
hoping for the rain to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said that's not likely anytime soon. Rain and  
thunderstorms are expected to continue into next week in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is in the same boat -- sitting and waiting,'' said  
Robert Wawrzyniak, who hauled his combine from Missouri into Kansas 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain could mean big losses for farmers, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is too soon to say it is a national disaster, but  
obviously the acres harvested are going to be down quite a bit,'' 
said Mark Simmons of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 2 percent of the winter wheat crop has been harvested in  
Kansas, compared with 31 percent by this time last year, Kansas 
Agricultural Statistics reported this week. Oklahoma farmers have 
harvested 51 percent of their crop, compared with 79 percent at 
this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, where the wheat has been ripe much longer, many  
farmers have already abandoned their crops. In southern Kansas, 
especially around Medicine Lodge, reports of shattered wheat heads 
are also coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	The unseasonable rains hurt wheat in a number of ways. Wet wheat  
can rot during storage, and even once it dries out, the heads tend 
to shrivel up, lowering the weight per bushel and affecting the 
price farmers get. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas and Oklahoma account for about one-third of all winter  
wheat grown in the United States. So far, commodity prices that 
could ultimately lead to higher bread prices in the supermarket 
have not been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are reaching a strong concern about the  
national production,'' said Kansas state statistician Eddie Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much damage the rains have done to the wheat crop won't  
be known until the combines can get back into the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In northwestern Kansas -- where wheat is just beginning to ripen  
-- the crop is still in mostly good condition. But farmers fear that 
with all of Kansas ready to harvest at the same time -- and with 
nearly half of the Oklahoma fields still uncut because of rain 
there-- there won't be enough crews and combines to get the crops in 
fast enough once it dries up. 
</P>
<P>
	Wawrzyniak, who came here from Maitland, Mo., with his wife and  
son, said he has worked just 6 1/2 hours in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is costing me money,'' he said. Many cutters are moving on  
in search of drier fields. That could pose a problem for some 
farmers, who rely on the crews to harvest about 60 percent of the 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really going to put us in a bind, but it's happened  
before,'' said Marsha Carothers, whose family will use its own 
three combines to finish harvesting its 3,300 acres near Anthony, 
Kan. ``We're used to it.''

<HEADLINE> Cities Fear Gunmaker's Ch. 11 Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A California gunmaker targeted in lawsuits by  
cities seeking to recoup the costs of gun-related violence has 
filed for bankruptcy protection, raising concerns that other 
weapons manufacturers named in the lawsuits will follow the same 
path to escape big payouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Industries, a Chino, Calif.-based company that produces  
small, cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, filed for 
Chapter 11 protection in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has alarmed attorneys representing cities that have  
sued Davis and more than a dozen other gunmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a no-win situation for everybody. The industry would  
basically be run by a bankruptcy judge and our suits would be put 
on hold until the industry is reorganized by the court,'' said 
lawyer John Coale, who sued gunmakers on behalf of New Orleans, 
Cincinnati, Cleveland and Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	A call seeking comment from Davis Industries was not returned  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities including Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans filed the  
suits, accusing gunmakers of failing to equip weapons with adequate 
safety devices, and marketing them in ways that allow firearms to 
fall into the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are patterned after lawsuits that forced cigarette  
makers to pay some $246 billion over the next 25 years to reimburse 
states for the costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Painter, executive director of the Washington-based  
National Shooting Sports Foundation, said there has been no 
indication that gun companies are collectively considering 
bankruptcy as a legal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never has it been brought up by any of our member companies,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of a California gunmaker, however, said bankruptcy  
would provide the firearms industry with some clear advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what Davis is doing is probably a good idea,'' said  
Jim Waldorf of Lorcin Engineering, a Mira Loma-based company. 
``When you have a multitude of things that have no merit on the 
evidence, it's best for it to be decided in a federal arena rather 
than in several jurisdictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once a defendant files for protection, the lawsuits move into  
federal bankruptcy court where the judge ultimately approves a 
reorganization plan for the company and decides where to allocate 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs who win their lawsuits join other creditors in trying  
to collect. Even if the company wants to offer a settlement, the 
other creditors and the bankruptcy judge typically have a say in 
whether it will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldorf said Lorcin won't file for bankruptcy. The company  
emerged from Chapter 11 protection only six months ago after being 
hit with two dozen product liability suits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure from the lawsuits has prompted the National Shooting  
Sports Foundation to hold talks with the municipalities and their 
attorneys about technical issues, such as the viability of safety 
technologies that the lawsuits advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not settlement talks; it's opening discussions to clarify  
what we believe is a tremendous amount of misinformation and 
misunderstanding in the lawsuits themselves,'' Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Painter referred to ``smart'' gun technologies  
that the lawsuits accuse gunmakers of refusing to adopt. Such guns 
would fire only after recognizing the owner's voice or palm prints. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has been able to make such a device small or  
rugged enough to fit inside a handgun, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coale did not believe the talks would lead to a settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pessimistic now that the moderates in either camp are  
going to prevail,'' he said. ``We're probably going to go to war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies entered their legal battle with the states as  
a unified, prosperous industry. Gun companies, by contrast, don't 
have as much money and have failed to reach a united legal 
strategy. Aside from the foundation-sponsored discussions, they 
have chosen to deal with the cities' lawsuits individually. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun industry comprises mostly small companies with annual  
revenues in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. The only publicly 
traded company, Sturm Ruger &AMP; Co. Inc., reported earnings of $8.4 
million on revenues of $62.9 million for the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun sales fell sharply after peaking in 1993, when Americans  
responded to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and proposed gun-control 
laws by buying thousands of new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But industrywide sales in 1999 are on the rise, Waldorf said,  
because of new restrictions being considered in the wake of the 
Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun control always spurs sales,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Smothered Infant Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- Haunted by the image of his dead baby's  
distorted face, a man walked into the Johnson County Jail and 
allegedly confessed to killing his infant son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he begged me to shoot him,'' Sheriff's Maj. Terry  
Nichalson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Shanabarger, 29, was held without bond and was expected  
to be charged today with killing Tyler Shanabarger, who was less 
than 8 months old. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told authorities he wrapped plastic wrap around  
Tyler's head Saturday night and walked away. He said he returned 20 
minutes later, removed the wrap and placed his dead son face-down 
in a baby bed for his wife, Amy, to discover. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shanabarger thought the baby was asleep and didn't realize  
anything was wrong until the child failed to wake up Sunday 
morning, Nichalson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials thought the baby died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  
Franklin Police Chief Harry Furrer said an autopsy did not reveal 
evidence of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichalson said Shanabarger, with his wife, came to the sheriff's  
office Wednesday morning, saying he decided to confess because his 
conscience got the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son died of SIDS on Sunday. But that's not what happened,''  
Shanabarger told a jail officer, according to police. ``I killed 
him. I killed my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he kept seeing the baby's face,'' Nichalson said. ``It  
was not a pretty sight, because the baby laid dead all night and 
the blood had collected under the skin and it looked pretty bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichalson said the killing was an act of revenge ``against  
someone other than the victim,'' but did not explain further.

<HEADLINE>  Plane Makes Landing in L.A. Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The damage included a shattered plane,  
spilled fuel and two school buses with smashed front ends. It could 
have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary school students and the plane's pilot were unhurt  
Wednesday when the small plane crash-landed at a busy intersection, 
ripping away its fuel tanks as it barreled between the approaching 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 14 years on this job I have never seen a miraculous  
incident like this. There must have been divine intervention,'' 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. ``It was 
like passing through the eye of the needle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 2:45 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled for 1,500 
feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was uninjured, and more than 40 children emerged  
unscathed from the buses to sit on the curb and sip soft drinks 
before they were taken away to wait for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the plane wasn't going to hit us, but it hit us,''  
said Sasha Medina, a 10-year-old girl on the bus. ``I was like 
scared ... because I thought some of us were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student was treated at a hospital for a possible head  
injury, then released, and one bus driver was hospitalized in fair 
condition with back and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses carried 42 students from Parthenia Street Elementary  
School and six from Lassen Elementary School, said Socorro Serrano, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was alone in the plane, was questioned by  
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
National Transportation Safety Board. Authorities said he works for 
Sunshine Airlines, a Van Nuys charter firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time, with some  
children looking dazed and others among the mostly 6- to-10 year 
olds skipping and hopping. 
</P>
<P>
	They were later taken to their schools to be reunited with their  
parents. One unfazed child checked in via television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say `Mom, I love you,''' 9-year-old Luigi Escobar  
said. ``And I think you better come pick me up.''

<HEADLINE> Stock-Market Fever Hits China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Sitting in rows of plastic seats facing a  
flashing wall of numbers, the crowd at Great Wall Securities is 
watching the most exciting show in town: soaring stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started buying stocks last year. I don't have many, but  
they're up about 20 percent,'' said Sun Xialong, a 37-year-old 
businessman. Without taking his eyes off the flickering prices, he 
said, ``I'm staying in the market. I think it will go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China is in the grip of stock market fever. After two years in  
the doldrums, its two exchanges have risen more than 50 percent in 
the past month. Shares change hands in record numbers as millions 
of new investors pile into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new enthusiasm is fueled not by higher corporate profits,  
but by explicit official steps. The government, which wants the 
markets to finance economic reform, has cut interest rates and 
called for stock prices to rise. Even the ruling Communist Party 
newspaper People's Daily is talking up the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers say that in a heavily state-dominated economy, official  
policy counts as much as profits and other economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the government has made up its mind to take steps to  
boost the market, a lot of people have regained confidence,'' said 
Gary Liu, a trader for Paribas SA's China unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom is taking place against a backdrop of economic  
uncertainty. Reforms of unprofitable state industry are costing 
millions of jobs. Economic growth is targeted for 7 percent this 
year, but only because of massive government deficit spending to 
stimulate consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock markets in Shanghai and the southern city of Shenzhen  
exemplify the split personality of a Chinese economy that is still 
only partly capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
	The government owns all securities firms and banks, as well as  
large stakes in most publicly traded companies. Investment arms of 
provincial and city governments have been major speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners are barred from trading most stocks and allowed to  
buy only dollar-denominated ``B'' shares issued by a handful of 
companies. But most foreigners have pulled out because of low 
profits, leaving ``B'' shares to Chinese investors who can get 
their hands on dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Investing in China's stock markets has never been for the  
fainthearted. Trading is dominated by speculative binges and wild 
swings in price. Complaints of insider trading and abuses by 
brokers are widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	After making some speculators rich in the mid-1990s, stocks  
plunged in 1997 as corporate profits weakened and officials warned 
that markets were overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the government has taken steps to lure back  
investors. Regulators cut taxes on trading and say foreigners will 
be allowed for the first time to buy shares in private companies -- 
the most profitable, attractive part of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks in early June slashed interest paid on savings accounts to  
encourage Chinese families, which save an average of 40 percent of 
their incomes, to move money into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom has boosted the total value of Chinese stocks to $289  
billion, according to the state newspaper, Shanghai Securities 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The main index for the Shanghai market is up 51 percent since  
mid-May and hit an all-time high this week, while Shenzhen is up 54 
percent. ``B'' shares are up 113 percent in Shenzhen, and 78 
percent in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	People's Daily added to the frenzy last week with an  
extraordinary front-page editorial crowing over rising stock prices 
and saying they should go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Shanghai Stock Exchange, traders who recently spent much  
of their day reading or knitting are frantically filling orders at 
computer stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Once-empty brokerage branches are filled with customers. At the  
Great Wall Branch in central Shanghai, customers gather around 
automated terminals to buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Shanghai are pawning watches, jewelry and deeds to  
houses to raise money, the official Xinhua News Agency said today. 
It said the number of personal loans taken out at one unnamed bank 
has doubled since March to 2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that most of the new loans have flowed into the  
stock market,'' an official of the bank was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite official enthusiasm, an influential government journal  
is warning that this boom can't drive growth as rising technology 
stocks did in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Market Weekly, in its June issue, said a market  
driven up by speculation wouldn't produce steady profits necessary 
for growth. An improved economy, it said, will drive up stock 
prices -- not the other way around.

<HEADLINE>  Plane Makes Landing in L.A. Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The damage included a shattered plane,  
spilled fuel and two school buses with smashed front ends. It could 
have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary school students and the plane's pilot were unhurt  
Wednesday when the small plane crash-landed at a busy intersection, 
ripping away its fuel tanks as it barreled between the approaching 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 14 years on this job I have never seen a miraculous  
incident like this. There must have been divine intervention,'' 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. ``It was 
like passing through the eye of the needle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 2:45 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled for 1,500 
feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was uninjured, and more than 40 children emerged  
unscathed from the buses to sit on the curb and sip soft drinks 
before they were taken away to wait for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the plane wasn't going to hit us, but it hit us,''  
said Sasha Medina, a 10-year-old girl on the bus. ``I was like 
scared ... because I thought some of us were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student was treated at a hospital for a possible head  
injury, then released, and one bus driver was hospitalized in fair 
condition with back and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses carried 42 students from Parthenia Street Elementary  
School and six from Lassen Elementary School, said Socorro Serrano, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was alone in the plane, was questioned by  
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
National Transportation Safety Board. Authorities said he works for 
Sunshine Airlines, a Van Nuys charter firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time, with some  
children looking dazed and others among the mostly 6- to-10 year 
olds skipping and hopping. 
</P>
<P>
	They were later taken to their schools to be reunited with their  
parents. One unfazed child checked in via television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say `Mom, I love you,''' 9-year-old Luigi Escobar  
said. ``And I think you better come pick me up.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in N.C. From Carbon Monoxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Four people were found dead today at a  
townhouse complex, apparently overcome by carbon monoxide fumes 
from a car left running in an attached garage. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified victims were found in two units at the Cedar  
Mill Apartments in downtown Charlotte, city Deputy Fire Chief David 
Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead included a man and a woman in a three-story townhouse  
where the car was running and another couple in an adjacent 
townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were treating the deaths as accidental.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two were asleep. Two of them may have been trying to get out  
because they were found near stairs,'' said Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
Police Department spokesman Keith Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other residents in a third adjacent townhouse were  
sickened by the carbon monoxide and treated at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that someone drove the car into a garage attached to  
the complex Wednesday night and left it running. The garage 
apparently filled with carbon-monoxide fumes, which then filtered 
into the townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters found the bodies shortly after 7:50 a.m. when heat  
from the car set off sprinklers. The car did not catch fire.

<HEADLINE> Craig McCaw To Invest in Nextel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Craig McCaw, his family and ex-wife plan  
to exercise options for 17 million shares in Nextel Communications, 
investing about $315 million more in the wireless calling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCaws originally agreed to invest up to $1.16 billion in  
Nextel in 1995. The options they plan to exercise are part of that 
purchase agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Craig McCaw plans to reduce his holdings by about 7  
percent of his Nextel shares through an independent trustee, 
selling 15,000 shares on each of the next 200 trading days, 
regardless of the price. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw is the founder of McCaw Cellular, which was sold to AT&AMP;T  
in 1994 for $11.5 billion. He sits on Nextel's board of directors 
and is chairman of the company's operating committee. He is also

<HEADLINE>  Astros Manager Pays Surprise Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros got a pleasant surprise  
Thursday when manager Larry Dierker showed up at practice, just one 
day after he checked out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Well ahead of schedule, Dierker paid a brief visit to the  
Astrodome, delighting his players just 10 days after brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told to come here and be like a fan and not like a  
manager,'' Dierker said. ``So I guess I'll leave about the third 
inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upbeat Dierker wasn't expected until later in the week or  
next week. He showed up a day after leaving Methodist Hospital, 
where doctors removed tangled blood vessels that caused him to have 
a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	He still doesn't plan to return to the dugout until after the  
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering what he went through, he looks great,'' second  
baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He does have a nasty zipper (scar) on 
his head but he looks great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a small brimmed straw hat that covered his scar and a  
flowery yellow Hawaiian shirt that has become his trademark, 
Dierker met with his coaching staff and talked with players at 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood for interviews and chatted near the batting cage for  
about 40 minutes before Thursday night's game against the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has said he's OK, but to see him come through that  
door and shake our hands wearing that shirt makes us feel better,'' 
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker said his doctor approved the visit. He promised to  
follow medical instructions and won't try to return to the dugout 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of us who are Type-A personalities, once they know  
they are OK, try to get things going again and get things done,'' 
Dierker said. ``But I'm not going to give myself stress. I'm going 
to do what the doctors tell me to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really changes your perspective,'' Dierker said. ``The  
first day I was able to get out of bed and sit at a table, have a 
cup of coffee and read the newspaper, it's the first thing people 
do and don't give it a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me it was like a miracle.''

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Brennan Settles Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan, facing  
trial on racketeering and fraud charges, has reached settlements 
with New Jersey regulators, state lawyers told a judge on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No details of the deals will be made public until Monday, when  
they are to be filed with Superior Court Judge Philip M. Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
	If they stick, the settlements avert a non-jury trial that was  
expected to last two to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, a longtime Monmouth County resident who now lives in  
Juno Beach, Fla., made no comment to reporters after the deal was 
announced. His bankruptcy lawyer, Gerald Gline, who had come aboard 
in recent days to assist in settlement talks, also declined to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 55, became nationally known in the 1980s through  
television commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc., in 
which he would step from a helicopter and tell investors to ``come 
grow with us.'' The company has been inactive since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on his legal entanglements, he chose the name ``Due  
Process'' for his stable of thoroughbred racing horses in Colts 
Neck. He also had a riverfront home in Brielle. 
</P>
<P>
	State authorities charge that after closing First Jersey,  
Brennan secretly controlled two now-shuttered brokerages, Hibbard 
Brown and L.C. Wegard &AMP; Co. Inc., which pushed stocks he controlled 
onto unwitting investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The state accused Brennan, six others and the brokerages of  
making $300 million in illegal profits at the expense of individual 
investors from 1988 to 1995 by using illegal ``boiler room'' sales 
tactics and manipulating the prices of the low-cost securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought full restitution for investors, and $900  
million in penalties. Since it is a civil case, the defendants face 
no prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had been scheduled to start early in the month, but  
Freedman adjourned it until June 16 so defense lawyers could take 
depositions from three other former associates of Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	That trio -- Richard Brown, former president of Hibbard Brown;  
Leonard B. Greer, owner of Wegard; and Michael McDermott, Wegard 
sales director -- recently settled charges against them and agreed 
to testify against their former patron.

<HEADLINE> North Korea 3, Denmark 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Song Ok Jo scored her second goal in two  
games as surprising North Korea dominated Denmark 3-1 Thursday 
night and put itself in position to advance from Group A into the 
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's quick, physical play frustrated Denmark from the  
first minute of play. The North Koreans scored twice in the first 
half and then held on for their first World Cup victory after 
building their lead to 3-0 late in the game. North Korea lost 2-1 
to Nigeria in its opening match and plays the United States Sunday 
in Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea scored first when Jin Pyol Hui left-footed the ball  
into an untended goal in the 15th minute of the match. Danish 
keeper Dorthe Larson left the box in an attempt to intercept a pass 
by Sol Yong Suk, who set up Jin perfectly on the left side a few 
yards inside the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Song's second goal of the tournament was a beauty, putting North  
Korea ahead 2-0 in the 38th minute. Just outside the penalty box 
she spurted past one defender, slipped the ball between the legs of 
a second and drilled a left-footed shot past Larson into the left 
top corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea led 3-0 in the 72nd minute when Kim Kum Sil  
left-footed a loose ball in front of the goal into an empty net 
after Larson fell down in traffic. The ball came Kim's way after a 
corner kick had bounce off one of her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark, which opened with a 3-0 loss to the United States,  
scored its first goal of the tournament in the 74th minute off a 
mistake by keeper Kye Tong Sun, who punched a shot on goal instead 
of catching it. The ball bounced at the feet of Janni Johansen, who 
slipped the ball past a defender and into the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark had two near-goals in the first half. Jane Rasmussen's  
header off a cross hit the near-post just below the upper angle in 
the 31st minute. Just before the half, Louise Hansen hit the top of 
the bar just over the hand of keeper Kye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes appeared upset by the wet field, which was inundated  
after a downpour occurred for about an hour before the game began. 
Two Danes slipped while kicking the ball during the first minute of 
play, including forward Marlene Kristensen, who appear to injure 
her right knee and was taken from the field by ambulance.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Lobbies for Farm Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pardon Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura if he was  
milking his fame again. A hearing on federal dairy policy, the kind 
of event reporters and lawmakers alike avoid, was packed as the 
governor showed up Thursday to weigh in on behalf of his state's 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	An admitted city slicker who says he's mystified by the  
government's dairy program, Ventura urged a House subcommittee to 
kill the Depression-era system or else back an Agriculture 
Department plan to narrow the regional disparities in wholesale 
milk pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is inexcusably inconsistent in pushing for  
deregulation of other parts of agriculture, but not dairy,'' said 
Ventura, the first Reform Party governor. ``If market forces are 
good enough for corn and wheat, why not cows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, the ex-pro wrestler quipped to reporters that  
the House Agriculture livestock subcommittee had better heed him. 
``If I come back, they'll deal with me then. Today I'm in a good 
mood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full Agriculture Committee is to vote next week on  
legislation that would block the USDA plan from taking effect 
because of the impact it would have on producers in the Northeast 
and South. The bill is cosponsored by more than 220 lawmakers -- a 
majority of the House. They favor keeping a system close to the 
current one. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  
for fluid milk are lowest in Minnesota and Wisconsin and highest in 
the South and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some 
places. The system was designed to spur production in areas where 
it had been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from Minnesota and Wisconsin, the region that would  
benefit the most from the USDA plan, hoped Ventura would draw 
publicity -- and momentum -- to their side of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more attention today focused on this issue than we've  
had in five years,'' said Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is Ventura's celebrity status in Washington that the  
subcommittee's staff barred spectators from bringing cameras into 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA plan's leading opponent knew he was outdone, at least  
as far as the publicity battle was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I've seen of the governor, I don't want to take  
him on in any physical or mental feat,'' Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., 
told the panel.

<HEADLINE> Stock-Market Fever Hits China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Sitting in rows of plastic seats facing a  
flashing wall of numbers, the crowd at Great Wall Securities is 
watching the most exciting show in town: soaring stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started buying stocks last year. I don't have many, but  
they're up about 20 percent,'' said Sun Xialong, a 37-year-old 
businessman. Without taking his eyes off the flickering prices, he 
said, ``I'm staying in the market. I think it will go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China is in the grip of stock market fever. After two years in  
the doldrums, its two exchanges have risen more than 50 percent in 
the past month. Shares change hands in record numbers as millions 
of new investors pile into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new enthusiasm is fueled not by higher corporate profits,  
but by explicit official steps. The government, which wants the 
markets to finance economic reform, has cut interest rates and 
called for stock prices to rise. Even the ruling Communist Party 
newspaper People's Daily is talking up the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers say that in a heavily state-dominated economy, official  
policy counts as much as profits and other economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the government has made up its mind to take steps to  
boost the market, a lot of people have regained confidence,'' said 
Gary Liu, a trader for Paribas SA's China unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom is taking place against a backdrop of economic  
uncertainty. Reforms of unprofitable state industry are costing 
millions of jobs. Economic growth is targeted for 7 percent this 
year, but only because of massive government deficit spending to 
stimulate consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock markets in Shanghai and the southern city of Shenzhen  
exemplify the split personality of a Chinese economy that is still 
only partly capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
	The government owns all securities firms and banks, as well as  
large stakes in most publicly traded companies. Investment arms of 
provincial and city governments have been major speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners are barred from trading most stocks and allowed to  
buy only dollar-denominated ``B'' shares issued by a handful of 
companies. But most foreigners have pulled out because of low 
profits, leaving ``B'' shares to Chinese investors who can get 
their hands on dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Investing in China's stock markets has never been for the  
fainthearted. Trading is dominated by speculative binges and wild 
swings in price. Complaints of insider trading and abuses by 
brokers are widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	After making some speculators rich in the mid-1990s, stocks  
plunged in 1997 as corporate profits weakened and officials warned 
that markets were overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the government has taken steps to lure back  
investors. Regulators cut taxes on trading and say foreigners will 
be allowed for the first time to buy shares in private companies -- 
the most profitable, attractive part of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks in early June slashed interest paid on savings accounts to  
encourage Chinese families, which save an average of 40 percent of 
their incomes, to move money into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom has boosted the total value of Chinese stocks to $289  
billion, according to the state newspaper, Shanghai Securities 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The main index for the Shanghai market is up 51 percent since  
mid-May and hit an all-time high this week, while Shenzhen is up 54 
percent. ``B'' shares are up 113 percent in Shenzhen, and 78 
percent in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	People's Daily added to the frenzy last week with an  
extraordinary front-page editorial crowing over rising stock prices 
and saying they should go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Shanghai Stock Exchange, traders who recently spent much  
of their day reading or knitting are frantically filling orders at 
computer stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Once-empty brokerage branches are filled with customers. At the  
Great Wall Branch in central Shanghai, customers gather around 
automated terminals to buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Shanghai are pawning watches, jewelry and deeds to  
houses to raise money, the official Xinhua News Agency said today. 
It said the number of personal loans taken out at one unnamed bank 
has doubled since March to 2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that most of the new loans have flowed into the  
stock market,'' an official of the bank was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite official enthusiasm, an influential government journal  
is warning that this boom can't drive growth as rising technology 
stocks did in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Market Weekly, in its June issue, said a market  
driven up by speculation wouldn't produce steady profits necessary 
for growth. An improved economy, it said, will drive up stock 
prices -- not the other way around.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Ala. Gay Death Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- One of two men accused of beating a gay  
man to death with an ax handle for allegedly making a pass at them 
pleaded guilty Thursday to murder in hopes of avoiding the electric 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Fred Thompson said that in return for the  
guilty plea, he will recommend life without parole for Steven Eric 
Mullins, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge will make the decision after a trial-like hearing set  
for Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day, co-defendant Charles M. Butler Jr., 21, will go  
on trial on capital murder charges in the slaying of Billy Jack 
Gaither, 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The textile warehouse worker was abducted Feb. 19, stuffed into  
his car trunk and later beaten to death. His body was burned on a 
pyre of old tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Mullins and Butler confessed to plotting Gaither's  
slaying for two weeks after he allegedly made a sexual advance on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mullins told the court in a barely audible voice  
that he kidnapped and killed Gaither. As he spoke, Gaither's 
parents stood less than 10 feet away, their arms around each other. 
Mullins gave no explanation for the killing and no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins is an unemployed construction worker known for bullying  
people in bars and wearing combat boots and racist T-shirts. His 
hand is tattooed with Nazi-style lightning bolts worn by some white 
supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	During a separate hearing, Butler withdrew an insanity defense  
he asserted earlier, but maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton compared Gaither's murder to the dragging  
death of a black man in Texas and the fatal beating of Matthew 
Shepard, a homosexual Wyoming college student who was lashed to a 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victim's brothers, William Gaither, said he would  
like to see both men get the death penalty. But his father, Marion 
Gaither, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the death penalty,'' he said. ``I think it  
will be harder for them in prison.''

<HEADLINE> Sex Curriculum in Church To Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The Presbyterian Church's sex education  
curriculum will likely be revised to include a more 
abstinence-based stance, church leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 560 commissioners of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)  
general assembly voted Wednesday in support of revising the 
curriculum, which teaches abstinence but also offers 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure means some of the teachings phased in gradually  
since 1989 could be stricken altogether, particularly the option of 
contraceptive use, which some literature mentions prominently. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal that passed was somewhat less radical than an  
original measure, which would have eliminated all references to 
contraceptives and stopped the distribution of all sexual material 
until the wording was modified. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who proposed the changes said preaching anything but  
abstinence sends the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lacks biblical integrity,'' said Katherine Goyette of San  
Joaquin, Calif., a youth advisor to the assembly. ``We can teach 
the joy of sexual relationships, but we are called to live a life 
that proclaims Jesus. We cannot conform any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some said teaching only abstinence is no longer practical.  
With teenagers exposed to so many sexual images, they said, failing 
to provide education will cause bigger problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think an abstinence-only curriculum doesn't respond to  
reality,'' said Donna Riley of Princeton, N.J. ``The church has a 
responsibility to protect teenagers from things like unwanted 
pregnancies, not to mention (sexually-transmitted) diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congregations, parents and some church schools within the  
denomination widely use the church's sex curriculum, but it's not 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The curriculum must now be modified and submitted to a committee  
for approval within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this week at the assembly, the issue of gay and lesbian  
ordination is expected to resurface. By Friday, the general 
assembly was expected to tackle a measure that strikes language 
from the church constitution, which could open the door to 
homosexual ordination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has about 3 million members.

<HEADLINE> Plan for Penguins Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Lawyers for the Pittsburgh Penguins' landlord  
told a bankruptcy judge today that Mario Lemieux's plan to save the 
bankrupt team is unsatisfactory, even though the retired player has 
offered to pay the landlord in full. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz, however, was  
unconvinced by Philadelphia-based SMG Inc.'s arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that you have an agenda other than being paid,''  
the judge said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Lemieux and SMG, which subleases the Civic Arena to  
the Penguins for more than $6 million a year, ended talks Wednesday 
night without an agreement that could have given Lemieux a better 
chance of buying the team. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan calls for removing SMG as the landlord. SMG leases the  
Civic Arena from the Public Auditorium Authority for $350,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz today is expected to choose Lemieux's plan or one from  
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's agent, Tom Reich, said he still hoped Markovitz would  
confirm Lemieux's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the negotiators failed to decide on either a new  
lease for the team or a buyout of the SMG lease, said SMG attorney 
Daniel Shapira. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux lawyer Doug Campbell told Markovitz on Wednesday that  
Lemieux could not buy the franchise if the Penguins owe more than 
$10 million to SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling last week, Markovitz said SMG's lease with the  
Penguins was actually ``a financing device masquerading as a 
lease.'' The judge said the deal had been set up as a cover for a 
cash infusion for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz found that SMG paid $24 million to Penguins owner  
Howard Baldwin for the rights to manage the arena and sublease it 
to the team. Baldwin used that money to buy the team from Edward 
DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a retired Penguins center who is owed money by the  
team, is leading a group that is trying to buy the team and has the 
endorsement of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County officials and the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the NHL also has a fallback plan that could fold the  
franchise and sell it out of town if Markovitz does not approve a 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Lemieux proposal is not approved, the NHL deal will be  
the only plan on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has set a deadline for Sunday to resolve the bankruptcy  
so that the league can schedule games for the upcoming hockey 
season. The player draft is to start on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bronx Zoo Opens Gorilla Habitat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's primate chic: Some cocktail guests nibble  
crabcakes and fried artichokes from silver trays, while others 
stuff their mouths with tufts of grass. 
</P>
<P>
	And everyone is positively charmed -- both humans and gorillas  
divided by glass at the Bronx Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exhibit of human beings -- for the gorillas,'' joked  
William Conway, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society that 
operates the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ape and human hands high-fived against the pane Wednesday to  
celebrate the long-awaited Congo Gorilla Forest -- a 6.5-acre, $43 
million wildlife habitat with 300 animals that sets a new world 
standard for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was a private viewing for hundreds of contributors  
before the exhibit opened to the public today. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the soaring windows, the 19 lowland gorillas didn't act  
as if they were the exhibit in this primal encounter. The gorillas 
planted themselves atop rocks and stared, bemused, at the 
two-legged wonders. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on either side of a glass ``tunnel'' protected by a  
1.5-inch pane, wine-sipping humans gazed deep into apes' eyes as 
both species chewed on their respective hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia, a 19-year-old with attitude, stuck out her tongue. She's  
often shy, but for the big night, the passive-aggressive ape got a 
``comfort blanket,'' a small scuffy tire she clutched. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, though: this was serious business for  
the Bronx Zoo, which is marking its centennial this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The simulated African rain forest also marks the gorilla  
troupe's move from the old Great Apes Building with a roof to their 
fabulous new forest and breeding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Home to 75 species of animals, it replicates the tropics of  
Uganda, Congo and Rwanda, complete with waterfalls, mist (emitted 
from machines), jungle sounds and nests in trees -- both for birds 
and gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're seeing wildlife better than you would see it in a real  
rain forest,'' said Amy Vedder, director of the wildlife society's 
Africa projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 exhibit entry fee -- on top of the $7.75 zoo admission --  
will allow visitors to vote on which kind of conservation the money 
goes to; the society has more than 50 projects in Africa. The votes 
are registered on interactive computer screens at the end of the 
trek. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, one can vote to save the rare okapi, whose numbers  
have been diminished in part because of the civil war in Congo, 
where they were eaten by fleeing refugees. At the zoo, the 
giraffelike creature with zebra-colored legs peeks through 
vegetation. Its footprints are pressed into the concrete path, 
which is sprinkled with other surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can dung tell a story?'' asks one sign next to a dried-up  
specimen on a rock. The answer: It's ``one way to discover who eats 
whom.'' In this case, the evidence shows that a leopard had eaten 
an okapi. 
</P>
<P>
	Congo, a decade in the planning, is filled with 15,000 trees and  
plants. It's so real one can also spot elephant dung, water buffalo 
skulls and termite mounds amid the black-and-white colobus monkeys 
swinging gracefully from limb to limb under open sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most zoos, these animals fill the space, with visitors  
walking through like ``privileged interlopers,'' said exhibit 
designer Lee Ehmke. 
</P>
<P>
	An indoor exhibit also features interactive displays about the  
need to preserve Africa's rich ecosystem. And the exhibit presents 
the zoo's research on subjects like how much space an elephant 
needs to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Designing this was like choreography, like writing a play,''  
he said. ``We were trying to evoke emotions: Awe, a sense of 
wonder, curiosity and care for animals and places. And a sense of 
alarm for the rain forest in danger.''

<HEADLINE> Study Tracks Elderly Insomnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most theories about why millions of elderly  
suffer insomnia are wrong, according to a new study that says the 
brain clock regulating sleep ticks as accurately for the old as for 
the young. Experts say the groundbreaking study could help 
researchers find new treatments for sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its major findings, the study revealed that the brain  
clock regulating sleep is on a 24-hour schedule, not a 25-hour 
cycle that researchers long believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to rethink all of the explanations we  
have been giving for insomnia,'' said Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of 
Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
``All of the textbooks indicate that humans have a 25-hour day 
instead of a 24-hour day. We now know that is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Czeisler is lead author of the study appearing Friday in the  
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew A. Monjan, chief of neurobiology at the National  
Institute of Aging, said the new study changes fundamental 
assumptions about the causes of sleeplessness among the elderly and 
will prompt researchers to find new solutions for a sleep disorder 
that affects more than 10 million elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know now that poor sleep is not a function of being old by  
itself,'' said Monjan. ``We also know now that you don't treat 
insomnia by just taking a sleeping pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers need to look at such things as exposure to room  
light, illness and genetics to explain why insomnia has become a 
troublesome part of the lives of millions of people, particularly 
the elderly, Monjan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard E. Kronauer of Harvard University, a senior author of  
the study, said the research emphasized how exposure to artificial 
light during nighttime hours can reset the body's sleep clock, 
making it difficult to get up on time in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been finding that people young and old are more  
sensitive to light than we suspected,'' said Kronauer. ``Light in 
the evening is a strong influence on shifting the clock toward a 
later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tendency of many sleepless people to push bedtime later and  
later, particularly on the weekends, has been blamed on what 
researchers thought was a natural adjustment to the cumulative 
effect of a 25-hour brain clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the new study shows the clock is actually 24 hours,  
researchers now think that exposure to light is a much more 
important factor than previously believed in resetting the clock 
and disrupting sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, two dozen men and women endured a month of living  
in subdued light, with no clues to the passage of time, while 
researchers monitored body chemistry and temperature that mark the 
action of body clock. Eleven of the subjects were young men, with 
an average age of 23.7 years, and 13 (nine men and four women) 
subjects were older, with an average age of 67.4 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were placed on a 28-hour cycle, so their wake-sleep  
cycle was four hours longer than the rest of the world's. 
</P>
<P>
	Czeisler said this elongated cycle disconnected the patients'  
natural clock from outside influences that usually control a 
person's day, such as work or school schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then measured changes in temperature and  
chemistry to detect when the body clock, or circadian pacemaker, 
turned on. Earlier studies had shown that the clock is centered in 
the brain's hypothalamus. For most people, the impulse to sleep 
peaks around 10 p.m. when the body temperature starts dropping. The 
temperature rises about 4 a.m., increasing the chances of 
awakening, but two hormones, melatonin and cortisol, help the body 
remain asleep for the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Czeisler said the measurements showed that the human sleep clock  
operates on a schedule of 24 hours, 11 minutes, not the 25 hours 
that earlier studies had shown. It also showed that for people over 
65, the clock ticked at almost exactly the pace of people in their 
20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies that concluded humans were on a 25-hour cycle may have  
been affected by light exposure, Czeisler said. Even though earlier 
researchers used elaborate precautions to avoid outside influences 
-- such as putting subjects in caves or wrapping rooms with copper 
wire to block any influence from the rotation of the Earth -- 
Czeisler said there was no control for light. Test subjects in 
those studies routinely used strong artificial lights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light is the most powerful synchronizer of the biological  
clock,'' said Czeisler. When test subjects in the earlier studies 
switched on lights, it was ``giving them the equivalent of a drug 
that reset the clock. That's what resulted in the apparent 25-hour 
period that is published in textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to light pushes forward the body's schedule for  
releasing melatonin and cortisol, said Kronauer. When these 
hormones are released at the wrong time, it can arouse a person in 
the middle of the night or cause drowsiness during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stay up four or five hours, with artificial light, then  
you have shifted the cycle by 40 to 50 minutes,'' he said. ``You 
pay the price because when you get up on the real clock your 
circadian rhythm is saying, 'No, you've got to sleep more.'''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Gets Big East Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Tech, which rose into college  
football's upper echelon as a two-time Bowl Alliance representative 
of the Big East Conference in the mid-1990s, has been offered full 
membership in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech and Big East officials both confirmed the offer  
Thursday, though neither the school nor the conference would say 
when the Hokies might join. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a positive step forward for the university and  
Virginia Tech athletics,'' Tech President Paul Torgersen said in a 
release. ``There are some conditions contained in the proposal that 
will require evaluation and thoughtful ... consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies, who haven't been an all-sports member of one  
conference for more than 30 years, are a member of the Big East for 
football only, and they have used that affiliation to push their 
football team into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, they advanced to the Sugar Bowl and earned arguably  
their biggest victory ever, 28-10 against Texas. The following 
year, they again represented the Big East in the alliance and lost 
41-21 to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from football, the Hokies are members of the Atlantic 10  
Conference in 19 sports and they wrestle in the Eastern Wrestling 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials declined to say what conditions were under  
discussion. Big East spokesman Rob Carolla, however, said that any 
time a school joins a conference, there are issues like revenue 
sharing, membership fees and a phase-in schedule that have to be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies last single-conference affiliation was with the  
Southern Conference, from 1921-1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech, West Virginia, Rutgers and Temple were offered  
football-only membership in the Big East in 1990, joining 
all-sports members Syracuse, Boston College, Miami and Pittsburgh 
to form the conference's football league. Those four all-sports 
members had threatened to leave the conference if football was not 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the conference invited West Virginia and Rutgers to  
become all-sports members, leaving Virginia Tech and Temple as the 
only football-only schools. Last year, Notre Dame joined the 
conference in all sports except football and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the Big East included Connecticut, Georgetown,  
Providence, St. John's, Seton Hall and Villanova.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican officials have found lead poisoning  
in more than 4,000 children living near a northern silver refinery, 
double the number reported in a study in 1998, newspapers reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Undersecretary Jose Narro told a Senate subcommittee that  
56 children were so severely poisoned they required hospital 
treatment, the newspaper Reforma reported. Television reports said 
that only 26 are still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Children living near the Met-Mex Penoles plant in Torreon, 500  
miles north of Mexico City, have been shown to have abnormally high 
levels of lead in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the government announced a plan to evacuate a 20-block  
area surrounding the plant, demolish 393 homes, bury lead-tainted 
soil under asphalt and establish a $6 million fund to help sick 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead can cause digestive problems, mental disturbances and  
paralysis. In extreme cases, it can cause muscular collapse, 
convulsions and brain disease. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- More than 5,000 students and faculty of  
Mexico's largest public university demonstrated Thursday against a 
student-led strike that has kept the school closed for more than 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Barnes de Castro, rector of the National Autonomous  
University of Mexico, said the protest was to ``demand the return 
of our university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes sparked the strike with a March 15 decision to raise  
annual tuition from 2 cents to $145 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since agreed to make those fees voluntary, but that  
concession failed to persuade radical students to end the strike, 
begun in April. They say the constitution guarantees a free 
university education. 
</P>

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Traces of the cancer-causing chemical dioxin  
were found in 128 tons of powdered milk imported from Belgium and 
destined for a food program feeding poor schoolchildren, Peruvian 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Alberto Fujimori assured Peruvians late Wednesday that  
none of the contaminated powdered milk had been distributed and 
would be returned to Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru banned Belgian meat and milk imports on June 16 for 90 days  
after reports emerged that a Belgian firm had supplied 
dioxin-contaminated animal feed to farmers raising pigs and cows. 
</P>
<P>
	Peruvian health authorities have not determined the level of  
dioxin in the powdered milk, imported by the Peruvian company IGASA 
in March before the ban was implemented. IGASA officials said the 
milk is not a health threat.

<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Hugh Alton Carter Sr., a former state  
senator and first cousin of former President Carter, died Thursday 
from complications of pneumonia. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was a retired Army colonel and a veteran of World War II.  
For many years, he owned and operated Carter's Worm Farm. He also 
operated the Plains's Mercantile, later an antiques store.

	COTO DE CAZA, Calif. (AP) -- Norman B. Hirsh, an engineer and  
aerospace executive who oversaw development and production of the 
Army's Apache attack helicopter, died June 8 of a heart attack. He 
was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, Hirsh supervised production and sale of  
hundreds of AH-64A Apaches to U.S. and European forces as vice 
president and general manager of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. 
in Mesa, Ariz. The company is now part of Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The tank-killing Apache, first flown in 1983, was developed to  
counter the Warsaw Pact's numerical advantage in armored forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirsh worked in the aircraft division of Hughes Tool Co. in  
Culver City, rising from mechanical engineer to deputy program 
director for Hughes Helicopters. The company later became part of 
McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	After his years at McDonnell Douglas, Hirsh was a president of  
Rogerson Hiller Corp. and Rogerson Aircraft Corp. Flight Structures 
Group in Port Angeles, Wash.

president who won Stanley Cups as a coach and general manager in a 
career that spanned nearly 60 years, died Thursday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan rebuilt the team's farm system and skillfully drafted  
players. He was responsible for bringing future Hall of Famers 
Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita and Glenn Hall to the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Chicago won the Stanley Cup. From 1962 to 1973, the  
Blackhawks reached the Stanley Cup finals four more times. Ivan was 
inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974.

</P>
<P>
	Writing under the pen name K. Surangkhanang, her biggest selling  
novel was ``Baan Sai Thong,'' or ``House of Golden Sand,'' which 
was adapted for the screen and turned into a television soap opera.

campaign to spare Davis-Monthan Air Force Base from closure, died 
Tuesday of brain cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith became a consultant to the city after ending a 35-year Air  
Force career in 1988, when he retired as commander of the 836th Air 
Division at Davis-Monthan. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Keith lobbied lawmakers to support a $42 million  
proposal to extend the base's runway and build a parallel runway 
away from residential areas. He said the plan would ease 
encroachment problems and keep Davis-Monthan off the list of 
federal base closings in 1995.

<P>
	Mrs. Kryzak received many awards and citations for her work  
involving senior citizens, including five from former Gov. Mario

<P>
	She was chosen New York State Senior Citizen of the Year in 1986  
by the state Legislature and was inducted into the National Women's

</P>
<P>
	She first came to the public's attention when she complained at  
a federal hearing in 1976 that utility companies should not charge 
senior citizens for facilities under construction. The commission 
disallowed the charge and The New York Times attributed it to the 
``Kryzak Problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also helped organize senior citizen groups throughout the

seniors pay for prescription drugs, worked to eliminate mandatory 
retirement laws and was vocal on increasing state supplements for 
Social Security.

esophagus. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Redington will be buried in the basket of a dogsled, his family  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He teamed with Dorothy Page to promote a race in 1967 called the  
Centennial Iditarod Sled Dog Race, a two-day event covering about 
50 miles around Big Lake near Wasilla. 
</P>
<P>
	He got more ambitious in 1973, announcing a race from Anchorage  
to Nome and promising a purse of $50,000. Redington didn't run in

<HEADLINE> Proposed Merger of 3 Unions Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The proposed merger of the International  
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with the United 
Auto Workers and United Steelworkers of America has been put on 
hold, pending talks between the UAW and Steelworkers unions to 
merge first. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, the presidents of the three unions said  
the UAW and Steelworkers unions were more comparable in their 
organizational structures and would ``take the next step in the 
unification process by conducting immediate discussions to join 
their two unions together. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this process, the three unions will continue to meet  
and continue their ultimate goal of reaching unification of all 
three unions,'' concluded the statement, which was posted on the 
Machinists union Web site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists spokesman Robert Kalaski said Thursday that  
differences in how the three unions elect their leaders was a major 
factor in the decision to delay the merger of all three. The 
Machinists have direct elections of their officials; the UAW and 
Steelworkers unions do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski said leaders of all three unions realized at least a  
year ago that their initial goal to merge by 2000 was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks to merge all three unions began in July 1995; the merger  
originally was planned to be completed by 2000. With more than 2 
million members, it would have created the nation's largest union. 
The statement did not say when it might occur now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not dead,'' Kalaski said.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger was seen as a way to increase the unions' clout and  
eliminate duplicate efforts in organizing and lobbying. But it 
faced many difficulties from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	One issue is the UAW strike fund, which dwarfs those of the  
Steelworkers and Machinists unions. There also are differences in 
how the unions allocate votes to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't a simple process to merge three organizations this  
different,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the 
University of California-Berkeley. ``There are differences that 
span from the presidents down to the local unions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski denied that the larger size of the UAW strike fund was a  
factor in the decision to delay the merger. ``All three unions have 
very healthy strike funds in proportion to their membership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to UAW spokesmen in Detroit were not returned.

<HEADLINE> American Studying Safety Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines CEO Donald Carty said Thursday  
that the airline is looking at safety issues involving its pilot 
training and other procedures in the wake of a crash in Arkansas 
this month which killed 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty also welcomed an ongoing probe of the accident by the  
National Transportation Safety Board. ``It would be really 
irresponsible of us and the NTSB not to ask the questions,'' he 
said following a speech to the British American Commerce 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, American has had two fatal crashes killing 171  
people and four accidents causing minor injuries, more accidents 
than any other U.S. carrier in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators are focusing on procedures and training and  
the corporate culture at the Fort Worth-based American. The agency 
expects to examine the frequency of pilot training at American, 
whether standard operating procedures are emphasized enough in 
training and if pilots are granted too much discretion in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1994, American Airlines changed its training practices  
with captains receiving 20 percent fewer hours of training each 
year. Before the changes, American Airlines' captains would get 10 
hours of simulator training annually during two visits to the 
flight school in Fort Worth. That was changed to eight hours during 
one visit to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to this point there have been no problems that we're aware  
of,'' American spokesman John Hotard said of the training 
reduction. ``Obviously as we go through the review that will be 
something we look at because we'll be looking at everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration and the airline,  
along with outside consultants, will review safety and training 
programs. The evaluation is the first part of a nationwide effort 
to look at all airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has already begun its own investigations into  
training and attitude at the company, said Carty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be irresponsible not to ask the questions,'' said Carty,  
who is chairman at American's parent company, AMR Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB investigation into American's safety record is similar  
to all that are done following any accident, according to agency 
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every investigation we look into the operations of an  
airline and what role they may have played in an accident,'' 
Lopatkiewicz said, adding that the probe is in the early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the MD-80 crash during a thunderstorm in Little Rock  
on June 1, other accidents contributing to the analysis of 
procedures at Fort Worth, Texas-based American include the crash of 
an American jet en route to Cali, Colombia, in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said four other American planes had mishaps while  
landing, causing minor injuries. The planes were damaged, but the 
accidents attracted little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent of these, on June 14 a Boeing 757 hit the  
airport fence in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, during an approach that was 
too low. None of the 190 people aboard was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	A former NTSB official said the string of accidents since 1993  
is something the airline should worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be irresponsible not to step back and see whether  
your accident prevention program was working,'' said C.O. Miller, 
who headed the NTSB's Bureau of Safety during much of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> 3 Union Cavalrymen Finally ID'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Something compelled James Harris to  
answer the bugle's call a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Missourian had seen more than his share of  
action in the Civil War during his 10 months as a Union cavalryman. 
But perhaps Harris felt he'd left the job unfinished. Maybe he 
missed the camaraderie of his old outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the family story, he just got on his horse and  
ran away without telling anybody,'' said Katie Findlay of Poplar 
Bluff, Mo., the wife of Harris' great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	Months after re-enlisting in 1864, Harris died in battle in  
Alabama and was buried for more than a century as an ``unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, his and two other ``unknown'' markers are scheduled  
to be replaced with headstones identifying their graves -- the 
culmination of sleuthing by an author who documented their 
sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
	David Evans, a writer from Athens, Ga., followed the trail of  
military documents to find Harris; William Britt, a 38-year-old 
volunteer from Paris, Tenn.; and Pvt. David Sage, 20, of Bellevue, 
Neb., at the Marietta National Cemetery in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans gathered the evidence while researching his 1996 book  
``Sherman's Horsemen,'' which recounts Union cavalry raids around 
Atlanta in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officers who set up the national cemeteries knew they were  
going to have an awful lot of unknown soldiers on their hands,'' 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept very precise notes. They knew at some point someone  
might come along with enough information to identify some of these 
unknown soldiers. I don't think they thought it would take 134 
years, but that's how this worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1861, the 5th Iowa Cavalry began as the Curtis Horse  
Regiment near St. Louis, Mo. Two of its leaders were from Iowa and 
it included soldiers from throughout the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris had joined the Osage County Independent Mounted Rifles,  
which became the Cavalry's Company M. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a month after the regiment was formed, a 16-year-old  
from Nebraska joined. David Sage was the eldest son born to Selah 
and Mary Ann Sage, who were among the first settlers of Sarpy 
County in southeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1863, the 5th Iowa Cavalry became part of the  
Army of the Cumberland and eventually moved to Tennessee. Around 
that time, William Britt joined the regiment. Britt, an illiterate 
Irish immigrant, was married and working as a day laborer when he 
decided to enlist. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the regiment was selected for its most prestigious  
duty to date. Union Gen. William T. Sherman was ready to advance on 
Atlanta. But before he did, Sherman wanted to cut lines of 
communication and transportation to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 18, 1864, the 5th Iowa Cavalry was ordered to destroy a  
line of railroad trestlework west of Loachapoka, Ala., outside 
Auburn. But as the cavalrymen worked, they were surprised by a 
train carrying Confederate soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the skirmish that followed, the Union forces were driven  
back. Harris and Sage died and later were buried where they fell. 
Seven other men, including Britt, were wounded and left behind. The 
wounded were taken to the Confederate hospital in nearby Notasulga. 
Britt died on Aug. 8 and was buried on the hospital's grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war ended, Army officials began the grim business of  
collecting and cataloging the dead. Finding the bodies of Britt, 
Harris and Sage was easy enough, but there was no way to identify 
them when they were exhumed and moved to the Marietta cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't uncommon,'' said Steve Meyer, a Civil War  
historian. ``There were no Social Security cards, no driver's 
licenses. And in a situation like this, where the Union forces were 
overwhelmed, they had to leave their dead and wounded behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Evans found casualty lists that named Harris and Sage as the  
only Union soldiers killed at one of the battle scenes, while Britt 
was identified as the only Union fatality from the battle who died 
at the Confederate hospital at Notasulga. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans also found Britt's death certificate at the University of  
Texas at Austin. He cross referenced information in the cemetery's 
original burial register with 1869 notes from the U.S. Army about 
where the bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the new tombstones being unveiled Friday, only Britt's will  
bear his name. Harris and Sage will receive headstones bearing 
their unit numbers. James Wallace, the cemetery's administrator, 
said with both dying on the same day in the same place, officials 
cannot determine which grave belongs to which man. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Harris' descendants are thrilled he has been found.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is quite a surprise. We had no idea where he was  
buried,'' said his great-grandson, Floyd Findlay, who once traveled 
with his wife to Alabama to try to find Harris' grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was able to get word of Friday's scheduled ceremonies to  
Britt's descendants in Ireland. At Killadriffe Cemetery in 
Kilmolyer, Ireland, they dug up soil from the grave of his parents 
and shipped it to America. Britt will rest under that native soil 
in Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Profile Railroad Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Police departments across the nation with  
unsolved slayings are contacting Texas authorities and asking them 
about the rail-riding fugitive who has been linked to eight 
killings in three states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some other law enforcement agencies who have asked  
to compare, and there are some comparisons going on as we speak,'' 
Don K. Clark, the FBI agent leading the Houston-based task force 
pursuing Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old Mexican, is wanted for  
questioning in connection with five killings in Texas, one in 
Kentucky and two earlier this month in Illinois, where he faces 
capital murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the tattooed ex-convict is making his way  
from town to town by hopping freight trains. All of the slayings 
took place near railroad tracks, and most of the victims were 
bludgeoned. Fingerprints have tied Resendez-Ramirez to at least 
some of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said he was last reported seen in Louisville, Ky., a  
week ago. Investigators are stepping up efforts in Kentucky and the 
El Paso, Texas, border area, where he has relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force tip line has received nearly 1,200 calls,  
including several reported sightings of the drifter and inquiries 
from law enforcement officers around the country about possible 
connections to cold cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time such calls came into Texas was in the early 1980s,  
when authorities coaxed a confession to more than 600 slayings from 
a drifter named Henry Lee Lucas. Lucas eventually recanted as 
evidence mounted that he had lied in just about all of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Mattox, a former Texas attorney general and critic of the  
Lucas investigation, said police must not abruptly conclude that 
past slayings near railroad tracks were Resendez-Ramirez's work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they don't start pinning on him every crime that  
happens near a railroad track,'' Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said that won't happen: ``Law enforcement agencies are  
responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Pat Barr of Columbus, Ohio, said he thought  
Resendez-Ramirez could be a suspect in the 1994 rape-slaying of an 
Ohio State student until he learned that the details didn't match 
Resendez-Ramirez's alleged pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have declined to reveal the specific clues the killer  
tends to leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise County Sheriff Phil Ryan said authorities with cases that  
fit Resendez-Ramirez's profile should check out the facts without 
rushing to judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for whoever does catch him, because they'll be  
bombarded with requests for DNA and other evidence,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended mostly higher  
Thursday, with Singapore's key index setting its second record in 
as many days and Tokyo shares rising moderately despite the lack of 
fresh incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 41.57  
points, or 0.24 percent, closing at 17,628.32 as foreign investors 
poured money into the market. On Wednesday, the average fell 190.87 
points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped slightly against  
the Japanese yen when expected intervention by Japan's central bank 
to support the dollar failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.90 yen in late trading, down from 121.98  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also marginally lower than its 
overnight New York level of 121.92 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the Straits Times Index climbed 24.26 points, or  
1.1 percent, to 2,191.73, surpassing Wednesday's record close of 
2,167.47. Before that, the Singapore index had not set any records 
since February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted that some foreign fund managers had begun selling  
their holdings, indicating the recent rally may soon run out of 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were bracing for a widely expected U.S. interest  
rate hike, when U.S. monetary officials meet next week. Any such 
rate move could hurt prices on Wall Street and in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, concerns over U.S. rates also sent Hong Kong stocks  
lower for the second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 1.4 percent, or 195.92  
points, to 13,780.12. The Hang Seng had fallen 0.2 percent 
Wednesday from a nearly two-year high above 14,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking and property stocks, which are sensitive to interest  
rate changes, fell across the board. Investors worry that a U.S. 
rate hike would be matched locally because the Hong Kong dollar is 
pegged to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares plunged, triggered by an 11-percent  
tumble in PT Indofood Sukses Makmur. The JSX Composite Index closed 
down 18.550 points, or 2.6 percent, to 682.119 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rose after a finance official  
said the government is considering upgrading this year's economic 
forecast. The Composite Index rose 6.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
801.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose, propped up by heavy buying of  
property concern BW Resources and airline services group Macroasia 
Corp. The PSE index rose 27.61 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,498.53. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares ended a six-day rally, which had

<HEADLINE> Futuristic Headsets at PC Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Need more privacy to type that e-mail? Just  
strap a visor to your head to view your words without a computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck behind your desktop? Take a stroll with a wireless headset  
and dictate memos into your computer's speech recognition program. 
</P>
<P>
	For anyone who's feeling trapped instead of liberated by  
technology, help is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	At the PC Expo trade show this week, half-a-dozen manufacturers  
were displaying products that aim to untether us from technology's 
constraints and expand the ways we communicate with computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider, if you will, substituting headgear for a computer  
screen. While the futuristic concept has been around for a couple 
of years, new competition among manufacturers may finally force 
prices low enough to trigger consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Daeyang E&AMP;C of South Korea introduced a prototype of its  
Personal LCD Display Headset, which it aims to sell early next year 
for under $800. 
</P>
<P>
	Peering through the sleek silver-gray headpiece, a user sees  
what seems to be a full-size computer monitor -- but is actually a 
magnified half-inch screen that uses liquid crystal to show images 
and text. The device, which is wired to a desktop computer, is 
designed for privacy-minded people like those using laptops on 
airplanes, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A competing product displayed by Sony Electronics, the PC  
Glasstron Personal Video Headset, was first introduced more than a 
year ago and sells for $2,599, including built-in headphones. 
</P>
<P>
	While the device also works with DVD players and other video  
sources, the pitch at PC Expo also stressed portable computers, 
with Sony setting up airline seats to provide a real-life taste. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to say when prices might be cut from  
levels that are far above what a video player or even a computer 
costs. But Lloyd Klarke, Sony's business manager for advanced 
displays, expressed optimism the product could take off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We envision one day the screen may disappear and turn into  
something that you can see through your glasses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People who like to dictate to their computers, rather than the  
other way around, were offered help from Emkay Innovative Products, 
a unit of Chicago-based hearing aid maker Knowles Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The company displayed a wireless headset that uses radio waves  
instead of cables to transmit spoken words to desktop computers 
loaded with any of the voice-recognition programs sold nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking into a tiny microphone that blocks out background  
noise, users can wander up to 30 feet from their computers. The 
words appear on their monitors -- with mixed accuracy. The product's 
usefulness is limited by the speech software, whose ability to 
recognize language is imperfect. When a spokeswoman demonstrating 
the headset said the word ``biceps,'' the words ``Cover V sets'' 
appeared on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Emkay's wireless headset sells for $395 and is aimed largely at  
lawyers, doctors and other professionals who frequently dictate 
memos. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensory enhancing products on display weren't all high-tech.  
Bausch &AMP; Lomb exhibited its $295 PC MagniViewer, a 6-inch-by-8-inch 
magnification glass that hangs about two feet in front of the 
computer, enlarging the images on the screen by 175 percent. The 
device is designed for people who use bifocals, or who view lots of 
small computer text for many hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the recently introduced product allows  
better viewing than magnifiers which are fitted directly against 
the computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	While only a couple hundred have been sold so far, a Bausch &AMP;  
Lomb official said the company expects the product will have a 
multi-million dollar market. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, price could be prohibitive. The device costs more than a  
typical computer monitor and nearly as much as the cheapest PCs on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more relaxing on the eyes,'' said attendee Kevin Joseph,  
an Antigua-based information systems manager for the Cable &AMP; 
Wireless telecommunications company. ``But I'm not sure how 
comfortable I would feel all day staring at that thing.''

<HEADLINE> 'Puffy' Apologizes To Record Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap impresario Sean ``Puffy'' Combs has  
apologized to the record executive who claimed he suffered a broken 
jaw and arm in a beating by Combs and two other men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was embarrassed,'' the Grammy-winning rapper said Wednesday  
about the April 15 incident. ``That's not a normal action for me. I 
thought, `How could you be so stupid? This is not like you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs, 29, said he has ``talked everything out'' with the  
executive, Steven Stoute. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Combs, Stoute has approached the Manhattan district  
attorney about dropping the charges. Stoute's attorney, Thomas 
Puccio, issued a statement Wednesday: ``The matter has been 
amicably resolved to the satisfaction of the parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said no money was paid to Stoute to resolve the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	Combs, whose 1998 earnings of $53.5 million ranked him 15th on  
the Forbes magazine list of wealthiest entertainers, was due in 
court today to face charges of assault and criminal mischief. He 
could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said the incident was blown out of proportion: ``His arm  
was never broken, his jaw was never broken. I went in to argue, and 
I handled myself in the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs said he was irate that Stoute let MTV air a music video  
with a possibly controversial scene that showed Combs nailed to a 
cross.

<HEADLINE> Penguins To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Penguins will stay in Pittsburgh under the  
ownership of former star Mario Lemieux in a plan approved today by 
a U.S. bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL had threatened to sell or fold the franchise if Judge  
Bernard Markovitz had not supported the plan. The decision makes 
Lemieux the first pro sports player to acquire a controlling stake 
in a franchise he once played for. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan calls for converting $20 million of the $32.5  
million the team owes him for his years as its star into an 
ownership stake in the team. He will get a $5 million payment and 
forgive the other $7.5 million. Lemieux also said he would have $50 
million in new money to operate the team and satisfy some debts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did so much for the city and without him, hockey wouldn't  
be in Pittsburgh,'' Penguins captain Jaromir Jagr said. ``I think 
the city and all the people in Pittsburgh owe him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux would be the managing director, overseeing the franchise  
and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors but leaving day-to-day 
operations to management. He is expected to retain highly regarded 
general manager Craig Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he was reserving judgment for now on whether  
Philadelphia-based SMG Inc. would continue as the team's landlord 
at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan calls for removing SMG, which leases the Civic  
Arena from the Public Auditorium Authority for $350,000 a year, and 
subleases it to the Penguins for more than $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux argues the lease terms could make it impossible for the  
team to dig out of its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz said the two sides should continue negotiating and try  
to work out a new lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux saga began in October, when the Penguins became the  
first franchise in a quarter-century in any of the four major 
American pro sports leagues to file for federal bankruptcy 
protection. They also were the last team do so in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' financial problems began not long after former  
Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991 from 
Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., whose family also owns the San Francisco 
49ers. DeBartolo estimated he lost $25 million building the team's 
1991 Stanley Cup winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of cash, Baldwin relied upon a $24 million payment from  
the arena's management company, then known as Spectacor and now 
called SMG, to complete the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It was this $24 million, which apparently was written into the  
sales agreement as a lease to satisfy NHL requirements, that would 
later come back to haunt the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins won consecutive Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992 and  
the Presidents' Trophy in 1993. But there was trouble ahead as 
Baldwin lavished millions on players such as Lemieux, who signed a 
$42 million deal in October 1992; Kevin Stevens, Ron Francis and 
Tom Barrasso. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay the big contracts and keep the team competitive, Baldwin  
leveraged nearly every source of revenue. He reworked the lease 
with SMG several times and obtained upfront money from TV rights 
holder Fox Sports Pittsburgh, then called Prime Sports Pittsburgh, 
after losing a reported $20 million during the lengthy NHL lockout 
in 1994-95. He also sold off the team's merchandising rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin began easing himself out of the ownership picture after  
bringing in multimillionaire Boston businessman Roger Marino in 
February 1997. Marino pumped about $40 million into the team, 
keeping it afloat financially but alienating civic leaders, SMG, 
Lemieux and fans with a shoot-from-the-hip style. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino angered the city by signing a 10-year lease extension in  
exchange for nearly $12 million in arena improvements, only to 
secretly open relocation talks with several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux sued after Marino stopped payment on his renegotiated  
contract, which called for Lemieux to be paid even if he chose to 
quit early. He did just that in the 1996-97 season. Lemieux's $27.5 
million in unpaid wages made him, by far, the team's largest 
unprotected creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux began to quickly line up investors who kicked in an  
estimated $60 million. Marino agreed to pay Lemieux about $5 
million to settle the dispute over back pay and also joined what 
became known as Team Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL, fearful Thursday's hearing would come and go without a  
settlement, also filed a reorganization plan calling for the team 
to be sold and relocated -- or, as a last resort, to be folded and 
its players disbursed throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
	But NHL commissioner Gary Bettman repeatedly spoke in favor of  
Lemieux's plan, emphasizing the league plan was not to oppose 
Lemieux's, but to protect the NHL in the event of a last-minute 
breakdown in the Lemieux plan. NHL lawyers even sat in on the 
Lemieux negotiations with the creditors, SMG and TV rights holder 
Fox Sports Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's effort got a boost when Markovitz earlier this month  
threw out the Civic Arena lease, which was draining the Penguins of 
$6 million a year to play in the league's oldest building. He also 
ruled that SMG's deal with Baldwin was a loan rather than a lease, 
meaning Lemieux could free himself of all financial obligations to 
SMG simply by paying off the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also agreed on a  
renegotiated TV deal worth about $10 million a year to the 
Penguins. Under the deal, Fox Sports pulled out of a reorganization 
plan it had filed with SMG, leaving creditors to choose between 
either the Lemieux plan or the NHL backup plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations went down to the wire Wednesday night as Lemieux  
tried to forge an agreement with SMG that would keep the Penguins 
in the Civic Arena until a new arena can be built, possibly by 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux group sought the deal in part to prevent costly and  
lengthy litigation with SMG.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Visits Nuclear Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson sought  
to reassure Asian-American scientists at the Los Alamos weapons 
complex Thursday that their loyalty is not in question, but he got 
the most heated feedback on another subject -- polygraph testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, making his first visit to the weapons research lab  
since the Chinese espionage furor erupted in March, met in a packed 
auditorium with about 600 workers, including Asian-Americans, to 
hear their grievances. Later, he held a similar session at the 
Sandia lab near Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to me candidly, don't sugarcoat it,'' he urged the  
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of them took him to heart. If he's asking scientists to  
take a lie detector test, shouldn't he do the same and ``lead by 
example?'' one man in the audience asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might,'' replied Richardson.  
</P>
<P>
	Another questioner wanted a firmer commitment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am prepared to take it,'' he said, adding that he didn't  
want to shift attention to the issue of his plans to take the test 
and away from the issue of discrimination and concerns about 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asian-Americans feel their patriotism is being questioned ...  
and that their careers will suffer as a result,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has said it will require as many as 5,000  
scientists and employees with top-secret clearance to undergo 
polygraph tests, beginning within months. No scientists have yet 
been tested, but some officials in counterintelligence have been. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Alamos, more than a third of the questions dealt with the  
polygraph issue. The subject was also the lead question later in 
the day at the Sandia lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is concerned about security more than I am,'' said Alan  
Zelicoff, a scientist at Sandia. But he told Richardson, widespread 
polygraph testing was ``a divisive tool'' that ``will undoubtedly 
harm individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the tests will be ``unfocused'' and deal only  
with security issues and not the ``lifestyle'' of scientists and 
lab workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson announced a special task force that includes Yvonne  
Lee, head of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, will look into 
allegations of discrimination against Asian-Americans since the 
uproar over Chinese espionage at weapons labs began in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern has been expressed that Asian-Americans are being  
unfairly profiled,'' Richardson said in an interview as he flew to 
Los Alamos after a visit earlier in the day to the Savannah River 
nuclear facility in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Asian-American workers at Los Alamos and Sandia had  
asked him to come to discuss his concerns that their loyalty was 
being questioned unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The constant drumbeat of criticism has affected morale (at the  
labs) and I'm concerned it may affect recruitment,'' said 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage controversy has centered on a Taiwan-born  
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, who was fired March 8 for security 
violations after being under investigation for alleged espionage 
since 1996. Lee has not been charged with a crime and there has 
been growing doubt whether enough evidence will be gathered to lead 
to a prosecution for espionage. Lee has denied giving secrets to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, both at Los Alamos and later at Sandia, said he did  
not want problems involving a single individual to ``besmirch'' the 
lab's scientists, especially Asian-Americans. About 3 percent of 
the 7,000 workers at Los Alamos are Asian-American.

<HEADLINE> House Voting on Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the third consecutive Congress, the House  
is voting to amend the Constitution to allow legislation that would 
ban desecration of the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's certain approval moves the focus to the Senate,  
which in the past has resisted the amendment that supporters say is 
needed to protect the nation's symbol but opponents argue would be 
an infringement of First Amendment free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that a Senate vote will be close, but that  
backers of the amendment are one or two votes short of the 67 
needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 they have  
pushed numerous amendments to the Constitution dealing with a 
balanced budget, congressional term limits, school prayer and other 
issues. None has come as close to approval as the flag measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House achieved the two-thirds margin with 312 votes in 1995  
and 310 votes in 1997. The Senate fell four short in 1995 with a 
63-36 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes two-thirds majority votes in the House and Senate and  
ratification by three-fourths of the states to amend the 
Constitution. Including the 10 provisions of the Bill of Rights, 
the Constitution has been amended 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., chief sponsor of the amendment,  
said its purpose is not to limit free speech but to give Congress 
the authority to write legislation banning the physical desecration 
of the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was needed because of Supreme Court decisions in 1989  
and 1990 that invalidated the flag protection laws of 48 states and 
struck down a flag protection law passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, Cunningham said Wednesday during debate, ``wiped out  
200 years of tradition'' by removing protections for the flag, 
which is ``important to the core, to the heart, to the mind and the 
soul'' of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ret. Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, chairman of the Citizens Flag  
Alliance, said the House vote reflected the popular will and the 
wishes of 49 state legislatures that have endorsed it. ``The house 
is the body closest to the people, and I think they are responding 
to the people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said acts of desecration are rare and don't  
warrant altering the Bill of Rights for the first time in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, in a statement, said it was committed to  
protecting the flag but ``efforts to limit the First Amendment to 
make a narrow exception for flag desecration are misguided. The 
Congress should be deeply reluctant to tamper with the First 
Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the crisis for the Republic?'' asked Rep. Gary  
Ackerman, D-N.Y., who wore an American flag tie for the debate. 
``The real threat is not the occasional burning of a flag, but the 
permanent banning of the burners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As the rest of the world looks to America as its inspiration  
for democracy and freedom of speech, it would be a terrible irony 
now to diminish our own Bill of Rights, which has stood up for more 
than two centuries,'' said Paul Tash, executive editor of the St. 
Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information 
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., earlier this year  
said the Senate would vote on the matter by Memorial Day, but that 
got delayed after two undecided Democrats from North Dakota whom 
supporters had hoped to win, Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, 
declared they thought the flag could be protected through 
legislation and a constitutional amendment was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, says the plan now is to have  
a vote by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-word amendment states simply, ``The Congress shall have  
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.J. Res. 33.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House supporters of a constitutional amendment  
to safeguard the flag prevailed for the third time in four years on 
Thursday, arguing the nation's symbol can be protected without 
violating basic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 305-124 -- 19 more than the two-thirds needed --  
to amend the Constitution to allow Congress to ban desecration of 
the flag. The matter now moves to the Senate, where defeat is 
considered likely, though the vote will be close. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 the Senate fell three votes short. In 1997, knowing they  
did not have the votes, Senate leaders did not bring the proposal 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of the states also must ratify an amendment.  
</P>
<P>
	The flag amendment, a top priority of House Republicans since  
they gained control of Congress in 1995, would override two Supreme 
Court decisions: in 1989 the court struck down the flag protection 
laws of 48 states on the grounds they violated First Amendment free 
speech rights. In 1990 the court also negated an anti-desecration 
law passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the flag protection laws had been on the books  
for 200 years without any infringement on free speech, and that it 
was only right to stop physical violations of the nation's symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should accept the responsibility of protecting the one  
symbol that unites us,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, lawmakers argued that flag desecration is  
rare, that the amendment only would provoke more incidents, and 
that it was not worth limiting, for the first time, First Amendment 
rights of freedom of speech and expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the danger of discriminatory and arbitrary  
interference with freedom of expression is so great we'd rather put 
up with the occasional obnoxious jerk than to empower the 
government to decide what is acceptable and what isn't,'' said Rep. 
Barney Frank, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the debate, both sides were careful not to suggest  
that the other lacked proper patriotism. ``We all are patriots,'' 
said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., who opposed the amendment. ``We all 
believe in our country. This is an honest dispute about how we 
reflect that patriotism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsor of the bill, Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham,  
R-Calif., insisted that love of country and its abiding symbol were 
reason enough to overturn a ``wrong'' perpetrated by the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative lawmaker said he strongly would defend anyone's  
right to speak freely. ``Nothing in this prevents anyone from 
expressing themselves in writing, speech or any other way except 
for the desecration of the flag,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution has been amended only 27 times, including the  
10 articles of the Bill of Rights. The last two amendments lowered 
the voting age to 18 in 1971 and in 1992 spelled out that pay 
raises for lawmakers cannot take effect until the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican leadership has made several serious attempts  
since 1995 to amend the Constitution on such subjects as the 
balanced budget and term limits, but none has come closer to 
success than the flag amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's election, supporters thought they would  
prevail in the Senate. But they suffered a setback in late April 
when two Democrats from North Dakota they hoped to have on their 
side, Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, announced they thought 
Congress could legislate flag protections without changing the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Legion-backed Citizens Flag Alliance has lobbied  
hard in North Dakota to nudge the senators back to their side. But 
the Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said 
Thursday he was confident the pro-amendment side still was at least 
two votes short. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., earlier promised a  
Senate vote by Memorial Day, but with prospects for success now 
dimmed, no vote is expected until late fall.

<HEADLINE> Omnipoint Shares Soar on Merger News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Omnipoint Corp. shares soared 38 percent  
Thursday amid news the mobile phone service is being acquired by 
VoiceStream Wireless for about $2.04 billion in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced late Wednesday would join wireless calling  
companies serving entirely different regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnipoint, based in Bethesda, Md., operates in the New York,  
Philadelphia, Boston, Miami and Detroit markets. 
</P>
<P>
	VoiceStream, spun off by Western Wireless Corp. in May, operates  
in 13 western states. It is based in Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the two companies will provide national competition  
for Sprint PCS, said Tom Friedberg, an analyst at Janco Partners. 
``It's a wonderful deal for both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of  
Omnipoint rose $8 to $28.81 1/4, while VoiceStream fell $1 per share 
to $28.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for each share of Omnipoint to be exchanged for  
0.825 share of VoiceStream plus $8 a share in cash. VoiceStream 
also agreed to invest $150 million in Omnipoint before the merger 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnipoint, which had 1998 revenue of $172.5 million and 375,000  
subscribers by year-end, has been struggling to find an investor 
for a year after running up huge debts to build wireless networks.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Mayor's Conduct Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A San Diego County grand jury has accused Mayor  
Susan Golding of civil misconduct in her dealings with the county 
hotel-motel association and its support of a new downtown ballpark 
for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel made its accusation in a report to San Diego County  
District Attorney Paul Pfingst, sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told The Associated Press and other media outlets 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ric Grenell, Golding's spokesman, said neither he nor the mayor  
had seen the grand jury report and they were withholding comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Union-Tribune reported in today's editions that  
the grand jury alleges that Golding offered to support a $4 million 
allocation for a hotel-motel association advertising program in 
exchange for the organization's support of Proposition C, the 
ballpark ballot measure approved by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The $411 million ballpark and downtown development is to be  
financed in part with $225 million in municipal bonds secured by 
hotel-room tax revenues. The ballpark is set for completion by 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury also accused Golding of misconduct for failing to  
appoint new members to the city's watchdog Public Utility Advisory 
Commission when openings occurred. That harmed the city's economic 
interests, the panel contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's attorney, John Wertz, told the newspaper that  
Golding has done nothing inappropriate and said he and the mayor 
were confident the district attorney would conclude the panel's 
report was without merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike a criminal indictment, the only punishment for a public  
official found guilty of civil misconduct is removal from office. 
That could only occur after a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfingst planned to hold a news conference later today. His  
spokeswoman, Gayle Falkenthal, said only that Pfingst plans to 
address the panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The county grand jury ends its term June 30. Since it was seated  
last year, the panel has criticized many public officials in 
reports, and the group itself has been criticized for the quality 
of its reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors said the hotel-motel association backed Proposition  
C only after Golding promised to increase the hotel-room tax 
financing of efforts to market San Diego as a tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mansur, president of the hotel-motel association, said the  
grand jury was off the mark because his group does not market San 
Diego -- the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau does. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansur did say his organization asked Golding for an increase in  
marketing dollars for the bureau, but before the City Council voted 
to put Proposition C on the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Moral Concern Helping Republicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though President Clinton was strongly  
supported by the American public during the impeachment process, a 
bipartisan poll released Thursday suggests that concern about the 
nation's moral leadership is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	That focus may help Republicans during the 2000 campaign, the  
poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have about a 20 percentage-point edge over Democrats  
when asked which party best represents the values of faith in God, 
personal responsibility, ethics and honesty and knowing right from 
wrong, according to the latest Battleground Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the short range, Republicans were damaged by the  
impeachment process,'' said GOP pollster Ed Goeas (pronounced 
go-ez). ``Long-range, it appears that we have gained a great deal 
by what congressional members did on impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goeas and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who put together the  
poll with him, agreed that Clinton's impeachment fight and the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal appear to be having a time-released effect 
on public attitudes that morality is declining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats paid a big price,'' Lake said. ``It has diminished  
our credibility on morality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans were tied at 39 percent apiece when  
voters were asked which party they would vote for if the election 
for Congress were held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, front-runner for the Republican  
presidential nomination, had a lead of 52 percent to 37 percent for 
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner. Bush has held 
a double-digit lead over Gore in various recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Battleground Poll surveyed 1,002 registered voters June 6-8,  
and the error margin is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead heat for Congress is significant for Republicans  
because Democrats have had a big advantage for months on issues 
like strengthening Medicare, improving the health care system and 
improving education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, voters are emphasizing values, and that is clearly  
diminishing Democratic support,'' said Lake. ``We're even, in part, 
because voters are thinking more about values than they are about 
(other) issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When registered voters were asked which one issue they think is  
the most important, a quarter chose restoring moral values, 
followed by about one out of five who thought improving education 
was the top issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A slight majority of those polled, 51 percent, said the country  
is headed in the wrong direction, a view driven mostly by concerns 
over declining morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Three out of four say Clinton is doing a good job with the  
economy, and his overall job approval was 57 percent. But 
two-thirds say they disapprove of him personally and more view him 
unfavorably than favorably. 
</P>
<P>
	People were about equally divided on whether they have a  
favorable or unfavorable view of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore ``has not done anything to have that high a negative rating  
... except that people are applying some of what they feel about 
the president to Al Gore,'' Goeas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake said it's crucial that Democrats learn to talk about their  
strong issues like health care and education in terms of morality 
and the influence on families. 
</P>
<P>
	The key for Democrats is to convince the one-third of people who  
don't know enough about Bush that he is risky, while convincing 
them that Gore is the safe choice, Lake said. And Gore must 
continue to demonstrate that he is a different leader from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has helped neutralize Democratic advantages on education,  
health care and Social Security, Goeas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has shown early strength among most demographic groups,  
including Hispanics, and in most regions of the country, except the 
Northeast. That is a reflection of intense Republican desire to 
rally behind a winning candidate and end the Clinton-Gore 
administration, Goeas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment was the last straw,'' Goeas said, referring to the  
GOP. They're tired of losing to President Clinton. They're tired of 
a Congress that doesn't seem to be up to the fight with Bill 
Clinton. They want Bill Clinton to be gone.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional Pay Increase in Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved a trio of spending  
bills today that would do everything from blocking Clinton 
administration efforts to limit mining on federal lands to leaving 
the door open for a congressional cost-of-living pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	By 16-9, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to allow  
hundreds of mines to ignore a 1997 Interior Department ruling that 
attempted to limit the size of waste dumps permitted for mining 
operations using federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci criticized  
what she called an ``extreme anti-environmental'' provision and all 
but threatened a veto by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``In adopting this rider, they're threatening to do serious  
damage to the environment, and they are playing with fire,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee of the panel had voted Tuesday to exempt only  
existing waste sites. On Thursday, the full committee approved an 
amendment by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, reversing the ruling and 
allowing exemptions for waste sites that have not yet been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said his amendment would affect at least 300 mining  
operations. The proposal would overturn an Interior Department 
ruling that under an 1872 law, mines can use no more than 5 acres 
for their waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern mining cannot operate under those standards,'' Craig  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats objected. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said the  
Craig amendment ``is asking that our public lands be used for 
larger and larger dump sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Republicans were joined by three Democrats -- Sens.  
Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Daniel 
Inouye of Hawaii -- in supporting Craig's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the committee also included language by Sen. Thad  
Cochran, R-Miss., that would block a June 3 executive order by 
Clinton that federal agencies cut their energy consumption by 35 
percent, compared with 1985 levels, between now and 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran called Clinton's order a ``not well-disguised effort''  
to implement portions of the Kyoto protocol, the international 
agreement by which countries have pledged to cut atmospheric 
pollution by reducing energy use. That agreement has been opposed 
by many Republicans, who worry that it would inhibit economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Both provisions were included in a $13.9 billion measure  
financing federal land and cultural programs for the coming fiscal 
year. The bill increases funds for operating national parks, but 
cuts Clinton's $797 million request for purchasing parklands to 
$265 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved a $28 billion measure financing the  
Treasury Department and several smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, like a version approved last month by a House  
Appropriations Committee subcommittee, so far contains no language 
blocking a pay raise for members of Congress. Under a 1989 law, 
lawmakers automatically get an annual cost-of-living pay raise 
unless they vote to deny it, and the Treasury bill is the 
traditional vehicle for doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort to bar the increase could still be made in the House  
or Senate, as it does most years. But earlier this year, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., discussed the issue with Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Lawmakers got their last pay raise, to 
$136,700, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The law pegs the raise to an increase the president proposes  
each year for federal workers. Clinton recommended a 4.4 percent 
increase for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and the 
congressional raise would be expected to be about 3.4 percent, or 
about $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's Treasury bill would double the president's salary to  
$400,000, but the Senate version would not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee also approved a measure that would provide  
$410 million to the District of Columbia's city budget. 
</P>
<P>
	All three spending bills passed the Senate panel by 28-0 votes.

<HEADLINE> House-Senate GOP Raise $9M at Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Between scenes of braying donkeys, the giant  
screen showed the guests of this year's Republican congressional 
dinner their worst nightmare: a Democratic-controlled Congress and 
White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, meant as a cautionary tale, ended on a more comforting  
note for the GOP faithful by listing Republican achievements and 
predicting victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also were consoled by the night's $9 million take, a  
record for a non-election year. The 1997 dinner raised $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott thanked the 3,308 guests who  
had paid $1,500 a plate for a seat at the black-tie affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to your support, after all these years we're going to  
elect a Republican president. We're going to keep our majority in 
the Senate and the House of Representatives,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest donors were corporations interested in bills  
before Congress, and the biggest fund-raisers were lobbyists and 
lawmakers, who personally pushed tickets for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and American  
Airlines were among those bringing $100,000 each, earning 
invitations to mingle with congressional leaders at a private 
breakfast in addition to Wednesday night's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is giving tonight to us so that we can help  
build Republican majority, build it stronger for 2000. What they 
get from us is a good meal and good government,'' said Stuart Roy, 
a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With a net change of six seats each in the House and the Senate  
in next year's election, Democrats could regain control of both for 
the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But many big contributors also are giving at a time when  
Congress is considering legislation affecting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which raised $50,000 for the  
dinner, helped lead the recent effort to pass legislation limiting 
lawsuits resulting from Year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for the chamber to be visible with these kinds  
of events,'' said spokesman Frank Coleman. ``It reinforces the 
perception that the chamber is a political player in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth contributed $100,000, earning corporate co-chairman  
status, at the request of the dinner chairman, Sen. Paul Coverdell, 
R-Ga., said company spokesman Bill McCloskey. ``We have lots of 
friends in Congress and we support our friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone company supports legislation that would let local  
phone companies send data worldwide, instead of restricting that 
business to long-distance telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big donors include two tobacco companies, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson and U.S. Tobacco. In its report accompanying the Justice 
Department spending bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee last 
week said the bill included no money for the department to file a 
lawsuit against tobacco companies. The White House plans to sue the 
companies to recover smoking-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping to raise funds were Kenneth Kies, former chief of  
staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation; and Deborah 
Steelman, former deputy assistant to President Reagan. There were 
more than two dozen corporate supporters, including Microsoft, 
American Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage lawmakers to raise money for the congressional  
dinner, Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who headed fund-raising on the 
House side, pitted region against region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeastern lawmakers won by raising $584,000. Rep. John  
Sweeney, R-N.Y., led the effort, bringing in $338,000 himself.

<HEADLINE> Blast Rocks Houston Plastics Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An explosion and chemical-fed blaze erupted  
inside a plastics plant, killing two workers and injuring four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's blast rocked the section of the Phillips Petroleum  
Co. that makes clear plastic. The dead men, a maintenance mechanic 
and a pipefitter, were employed by San Antonio-based H.B. Zachry 
Co., company spokeswoman Cathy Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Green said their names were withheld until officials could  
notify the workers' relatives. The four injured men were treated 
and released from hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the blast has not been determined, said Earl  
Borths, the plant's industrial relations director. Federal 
inspectors were expected to investigate today. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was the site of a deadly explosion in October 1989  
that killed 23 and injured 130. 
</P>
<P>
	H.B. Zachry is under contract with Phillips to provide  
industrial maintenance and services at the plant, located in the 
Houston suburb of Pasadena, Ms. Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zachry officials did not know about the two deaths until  
midafternoon, when a final count of employees was made after the 
blast, said Ms. Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Phillips in Houston were forwarded to the company's  
Bartlesville, Okla., headquarters. Officials there didn't return a 
call from The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Mother Loses Home As Son Jumps Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge approved the seizure of a woman's  
home and another house she had pledged as bail for her son, who cut 
off his electronic home-monitoring bracelet and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost my son, I've lost everything,'' Spomenka Lunic said  
Wednesday as U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber gave federal 
prosecutors permission to go ahead and confiscate the property put 
up for her son's $500,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time police arrived at Lunic's home in suburban Wheaton  
on Saturday night, her son, Slobodan Lunic, had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunic, 41, was to go on trial Monday on charges of defrauding  
investors in a pay telephone scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lunic tried to get her son out of custody in a hearing last  
October, telling the judge: ``My son will never leave his family or 
the United States.''

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Just what was the Walrus trying to say? An  
alternative set of lyrics to John Lennon's enigmatic song ``I Am 
the Walrus'' may help some lucky fan find out. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheet containing the lyrics -- handwritten by Lennon -- is the  
centerpiece of a collection of Beatles memorabilia that will be 
offered at an auction at Christie's in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The lyrics differ slightly from those sung on the Beatles'  
``Magical Mystery Tour'' album, released in 1967. The line in the 
recording about the ``crabalocker fishwife pornographic 
priestess,'' for example, appears as ``pornographic policeman.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Greene Top Track Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- In a meeting of speed versus strength, it's  
Maurice Greene against Michael Johnson at 200 meters, the world 
record-holder in the 100 meters facing the world record-holder in 
the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the main event of the 38 titles decided this weekend at the  
USA Track and Field Championships at the University of Oregon's 
Hayward Field. The showdown is Sunday at 3:52 p.m. EDT on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot lines are many.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene is coming off his world-record performance of 9.79  
seconds in the 100 last week at Athens, Greece, and now has the 
unofficial title of world's fastest human. He doesn't think that 
makes him the world's greatest sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do more than one event,'' he said Wednesday. ``You  
have to run the relays and the 200.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His coach, John Smith, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be the world's fastest sprinter, you have to run the  
furlong (200),'' Smith said. ``It may take him a year or two to get 
there, but he's only 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 31, already has established himself as the best  
200-meter runner in history. He has run the two fastest times ever, 
19.66 at the 1996 Olympic trials, then an astonishing 19.32 at the 
Summer Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's best is 19.86 at Stockholm, Sweden, in July 1997. The  
last time he faced Johnson at 200 meters was May 1998 in the 
Prefontaine Classic at Hayward Field, and Greene won decisively 
over his ailing opponent in a wind-aided 19.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances are different now. Greene is still celebrating  
his record run in the 100, and Johnson is healthy but competing for 
the first time since winning the 400 at the Prefontaine Classic 
nearly four weeks ago. He skipped one meet after that because of 
the death of his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knows Johnson will be prepared and Greene will have to be  
at his absolute best to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael doesn't compete unless he's ready,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-1, 175 pounds, Johnson is bigger and stronger than the  
5-9, 165-pound Greene. Johnson has an unusual but efficient style 
of running, staying erect and moving his hands up and down like a 
wooden soldier. Greene's manner more resembles the typical 
sprinter, head slightly bowed, a rolling motion and arms thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is much more experienced than Greene at the longer  
sprints. He also was the 1996 Olympic champion at 400 meters and 
has run the second-fastest time ever at that distance, 43.39, just 
off Butch Reynolds' world record of 43.29. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still learning the 200,'' Greene said. ``I want to run a  
phenomenal race Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 heats and semifinals are Saturday, and Greene thinks  
that will be to his advantage for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have run two 200 races in one day, which means I'll have  
run a total of 400 meters,'' he said. ``He's a 400-meter runner and 
used to running that distance. I'm not. But on Sunday, I'll have to 
run only 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 100, I'm a very strong finisher. I want to show that  
I'm a very strong finisher in the 200, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Greene is planning to double in the 100 and 200 at the  
World Championships in August at Seville, Spain, this is a very 
important race for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's now stepping into an area in which Michael is very  
comfortable, and it's very challenging,'' Smith said. ``Michael can 
run 20 seconds falling out of bed. If he doesn't run under 20 
seconds, people are disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has not run the 200 often, but he trained for it last  
year, and that helped his speed in the 100, Smith said. 
Surprisingly, Greene ran the 200 last week at Athens -- after his 
record in the 100 -- and finished second in 20.03 to teammate Ato 
Boldon's 1999 world-best 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needed that race for psychological reasons, because he's  
doing it here,'' Smith said. ``He said, `You can't keep me out.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes challenges. He doesn't rest on his laurels.''  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Johnson and Greene, the 200 field is loaded.  
There's also 1992 Olympic champion Mike Marsh; 1999 U.S leader John 
Capel, a Florida freshman who ran 19.87 in winning the NCAA title; 
1997 world indoor champion Kevin Little; defending champion Gentry 
Bradley; 1997 U.S. outdoor champion Jon Drummond; 1998 U.S. indoor 
champion Ramon Clay; Tyree Washington, ranked No. 2 in the U.S. 
last year, and Curtis Perry, the 1998 NCAA champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet began today with finals in the men's 10,000 and triple  
jump, and the women's discus throw, hammer throw and steeplechase.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ga. Unwed Fathers Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused on Thursday to  
revive a Georgia law that said an unwed father could not inherit 
from his deceased children if he had not supported or treated the 
children as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, by a 6-3 vote, rejected an appeal by a Georgia woman  
who said her son's father took no responsibility for him but sued 
in an attempt to collect monetary damages after the young man was 
killed in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia courts struck down the state's law, which had applied to  
unwed fathers but not to unwed mothers. The state courts said the 
law contained an unconstitutional gender-based classification. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia  
and Clarence Thomas voted to study the case but four votes are 
needed to grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the three, Thomas said the Georgia law ``does not  
necessarily draw a gender-based classification but arguably 
distinguishes between two different categories of men: fathers who 
support their children born out of wedlock and fathers who do 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was filed by Zenobia Hamilton Rainey, who said her  
20-year-old son, DeAndre Bernard Hamilton, was one of three college 
cheerleaders killed in August 1997 when the van they were riding in 
crashed because of a tire defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's father, Robert Lee Chever, sued over the accident,  
seeking half of all damages awarded as a result of his son's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey asked a Gwinnett County court to bar Chever from  
inheriting anything from his son. Although his paternity was 
legally established in 1979, she said Chever never supported his 
son or treated him as his child. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Chever lived less than a mile away but had no contact  
with Hamilton until the youth confronted him when he was about 15 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Chever argued that the inheritance law violated the  
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, and the Georgia 
Supreme Court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal denied review Thursday, Rainey said the  
invalidated law should be salvaged because it ``merely recognizes 
inherent differences in the roles of men and women'' in 
childbearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Rainey vs. Chever, 98-1478.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Crush Dems 17-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOWIE, Md., (AP) -- Democrats gave up eight unearned runs in the  
top of the first inning, enabling their Republican colleagues to 
take home a 17-1 blowout Thursday night in the annual baseball game 
among members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP pitcher Steve Largent struck out eight batters for his  
fourth win and the 25th victory for Republicans in the 38 years of 
partisan play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the biggest margin, but it wasn't the most  
exciting,'' Largent, a former wide receiver for the Seattle 
Seahawks and now an Oklahoma congressman, said as he signed 
autographs on the field after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	With bases loaded and two outs, Rep. Kenny Hulshof of Missouri  
and Largent crossed home plate to start the scoring on an error by 
Minnesota Democratic Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, who was blinded by the 
setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first inning shows how important defense is,'' said  
Hulshof, R-Mo., who was two for three with two runs and a stolen 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	The only home run of the night was a solo by Tennessee  
Republican Rep. Zach Wamp that netted $25,000 for prostate cancer 
research. Wamp also hit a double and drove in three runs for the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' star was New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, who scored  
their only run, twice slid headfirst into base and stole a base. 
Pitcher Mel Watt, D-N.C., struck out only one Republican. His team 
lost to Largent's last year, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored annually by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the  
charity game netted an estimated $100,000 for the Washington 
Literacy Council, the Metropolitan Police Boys and Girls Club and 
the Bowie Health Center Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made an appearance, the first  
time in 10 years the sport's top official has come to the game.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Elvis Stojko wants a fourth world championship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian figure skater said today he will continue competing  
as an amateur to try for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision is to compete again, going once again for the  
world championship,'' Stojko said at a news conference this 
morning. ``I want to keep pushing myself as an athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko will go after another world title in Brisbane, Australia,  
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old has battled through injury the last year and a  
half, from a seriously pulled groin muscle that hampered his 
efforts at the 1998 Winter Olympics to a broken collarbone suffered 
in a practice spill 1 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko is a two-time Olympic silver medal winner, three-time  
world champion and five-time Canadian senior champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stojko finished fourth at the world championships in  
Helsinki three months ago, and dropped longtime coach Doug Leigh 
last month.

Thursday toward a feat last achieved by Bjorn Borg in 1980 -- 
winning the men's singles title at the French Open and Wimbledon in 
the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi is not planning to study how the great Swedish star  
did it. 
</P>
<P>
	After brushing aside Argentina's Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-4, 6-3  
to reach the third round of Wimbledon, Agassi was asked whether he 
might take a look at how Borg completed the difficult double 19 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Borg is the last player to win Wimbledon on grass just two weeks  
after capturing the French Open on clay. The Swede won six French 
Opens and five Wimbledons, all from 1974 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi says the caliber of competition can't be compared.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things are different now than then,'' said Agassi,  
who won Wimbledon in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at a guy who was as fast as Borg and could hit  
the ball with such pinpoint accuracy, and guys were forced to try 
and generate pace with smaller and less capable equipment (than 
they have now), it's easy to see why he could dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he played today, he would present the same problems on a  
different level in a different way, and I learn from his 
competitive instincts and certainly his tenacity. But the game 
changes all the time,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's main challenge Thursday was his own service games  
against Canas. Although he was a set up, the No. 4 seed went 3-0 
down in the second before winning six of the next seven games to 
capture the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I was down 3-0 in the second set, I hadn't had one  
service game where I wasn't down 15-30, 0-15, 0-30 or 15-40,'' he 
said. ``There wasn't one service game that I was holding easily. I 
snuck through the first set without giving up my serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was returning well and hitting the ball big and he was  
fighting hard. It turned out in hindsight that he couldn't keep 
that level up, but at that particular stage of the match he was 
speaking for himself out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi has a comparatively easy route to the quarterfinal. His  
next match is against Spaniard Alberto Martin, who, until this 
Wimbledon, had never been past the first round of a Grand Slam 
tournament and is unlikely to give the experienced American any 
major problems. 
</P>
<P>
	At 20, Martin is still to win a tournament above Challenger  
level and says he prefers to play on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	The first seeded player facing Agassi likely will be Germany's  
Tommy Haas in the round of 16. Haas, seeded 14th, has so far 
struggled through two five-setters and has to get past improving 
Australian Wayne Arthurs in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi also admits that the surface here is a little in his  
favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon has seen no rain at all in the first four days and the  
surfaces are dry and firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it benefits me a little more. It's better for my  
game, but Court 1 today was playing harder and quicker than the 
Centre Court and the ball was getting away from me a little me and 
I had to kind of make an adjustment out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does help me if a court is playing harder and bouncing  
higher, but I certainly can't count on that.''

<HEADLINE> Kubrick Movie Review Angers Studio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Before this week, hardly anyone knew much more  
about Stanley Kubrick's mysterious last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' 
than the fact that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman get really naked in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, rumors abounded about the film, completed just before the  
legendary filmmaker's death. But Warner Bros. has not yet screened 
it for critics and Kubrick's rigorous insistence on secrecy meant 
few people knew what they were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter London film critic Alexander Walker, a Kubrick biographer  
who, as a family friend, was allowed to view the movie early. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker then published a review, including an in-depth plot  
summary, in Tuesday's Evening Standard newspaper. And now, thanks 
to the Internet, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has segued from the best-kept 
to the worst-kept secret in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evening Standard's Web site saw such a huge surge in traffic  
Wednesday that the paper said some high-tech rejiggering had to be 
done to make sure the glut of people trying to read the review 
didn't lock up the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, the people at Warner Bros. are upset by Walker's  
actions -- as is Kubrick's family, according to a studio 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a family friend, they showed it to him and he betrayed  
their trust,'' spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick said. ``The family is 
very hurt and angry. It certainly wasn't the plan, and we are not 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick said the film was not to be screened for critics  
until July 10, six days before its opening in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was out of the country and could not be reached for  
comment, but he defended the timing of his review in Thursday's 
Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not under any embargo,'' the paper quoted him as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Kubrick's 13th film, was completed a week  
before the legendary director died in March at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't want to know what it's about, then don't read any  
further. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, according to Walker's review, stars Cruise and Kidman  
as William and Alice Harper, ``protagonists in a story of how an 
apparently happily married couple, rich, successful New Yorkers ... 
are set at odds with each other by their dreams and fantasies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a party at a grand mansion where each is tempted by the  
fruits of another, they quiz each other about their erotic 
fantasies and find out more than perhaps they wanted to know, 
including the fact that Kidman's character once had an affair, 
Walker says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut'' then follows Cruise on the rebound from his  
wife's sexual revelation, as he ponders necrophilia, patronizes a 
prostitute and explores sex games among New York's rich and famous, 
curiously clad in cloaks and Venetian masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at its most baffling,'' Walker says, ``it is an  
astonishing work made with masterly control and at the same time a 
humanity that this director's detractors insisted he did not 
possess.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore attacked critics of  
affirmative action Thursday, saying it's not time to abandon 
``special efforts'' that have achieved progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended the goals of affirmative action and toured a gay  
and lesbian center during campaign stops meant to show him as an 
inclusive leader. He was finishing a two-day California 
fund-raising blitz expected to bring in over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a largely black audience at a campaign fund-raiser  
in the affluent suburb of Bel Air, Gore listed some of the advances 
for minorities -- a shrinking wage gap between blacks and whites and 
high school graduation rates that are close to even. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the overall wealth of black and Hispanic families --  
wealth built up over years and handed down through generations -- is 
less than one-tenth that of white families. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``captures the accumulated impact of history cascading down  
throughout the generations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not lay out an affirmative action plan of his own. But  
he quarreled with those who argue that in racial relations, ``we've 
had a generation of success and so we can abandon the special 
efforts that have brought us this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Urban League report last year found black families lag far  
behind whites in the accumulation of wealth and personal assets. 
Even among households earning $50,000 or more, where the wealth gap 
is narrowest, blacks have barely half the median net worth of white 
families, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 125 people paid $1,000 each to attend the fund-raiser.  
</P>
<P>
	Later he visited the Gay and Lesbian Center, touring the  
community center's residential wing and talking with three members 
in front of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of them were openly skeptical about Gore's visit, which came  
a week after his opponent for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know exactly why you're here,'' said 20-year-old  
Javier Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to learn and pay honor to this place,'' Gore replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore voiced support for legislation introduced in Congress on  
Thursday that would prohibit job discrimination against homosexuals 
while also banning preferential treatment for them. He said he also 
favored outlawing hate crimes, although he did not define what 
might fall under that description. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Byler, 22, said after the meeting that she was left  
with ``no impression for Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't really speak to me or say anything too impressive,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the two events underscored  
Gore's conviction that ``we are much stronger as a country when all 
aspects of our community work together and come together.''

<HEADLINE> Cam Projects JFK Assassination View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- For the first time, the whole world can look out  
from the perch where Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that killed 
President Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	A camera mounted in the sixth-floor window of the old Texas  
School Book Depository pans and zooms to capture frequently updated 
images that can be viewed on the Internet at www.jfk.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., younger brother of the slain  
president, criticized the innovation at what has since become The 
Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The corner window area where Oswald crouched is the highlight of  
the museum, but is not directly accessible to the public. The area 
is in a glass-enclosed display designed to recreate the so-called 
``sniper's perch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who guided the original creation of The Sixth Floor  
Museum made a substantial effort to prevent the exploitation and 
commercialization of President Kennedy's death, and their efforts 
were a great credit to the people of Dallas,'' Kennedy spokeswoman 
Melody Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that their accomplishment is now being  
undermined in this insensitive and tasteless manner,'' Ms. Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff West, executive director of the museum, said he was  
``surprised, and disappointed, frankly'' at Kennedy's remarks, but 
defended the decision to install the Internet camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received countless requests for access to the view of  
Dealey Plaza from the sniper's perch. The installation of this 
camera affords us the opportunity to honor those requests without 
disrupting the solemnity of the museum experience,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the population of the world was born after the  
assassination. We're talking about a view of a national historic 
landmark, and I don't think that's ever in bad taste,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera angle changes every 60 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	The assassination occurred during a noon hour parade through  
downtown, shortly before Kennedy was to speak at the Dallas Market 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. John Connally, riding in the same car, was seriously  
wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warren Commission, which conducted the official U.S.  
government investigation of Kennedy's slaying, concluded that 
Oswald was the sole gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald himself was shot and killed two days later by Dallas  
nightclub operator Jack Ruby in the basement of a police station.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Thrive in Bad Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ELLENTON, S.C. (AP) -- The wide-mouth bass are monsters. The  
deer are fatter and the alligators longer. And the ponds, wetlands 
and rich bottomland brim with snakes, turtles, and salamanders -- a 
bounty of biological diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Savannah River Site, a 310-square-mile expanse of  
longleaf pine forest and marshland along the river that divides 
South Carolina from Georgia, is an ecological paradox. 
</P>
<P>
	For four decades one of the government's top-secret nuclear bomb  
factories where five reactors produced plutonium and tritium for 
nuclear warheads, it also is an ecological treasure chest full of 
wildlife and one of the hottest spots for biological research in 
the country, including long-term studies on the movement of 
contamination -- nuclear and otherwise -- through the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the sites' ecological importance, the Energy  
Department today transferred management of a 10,000-acre sliver of 
the Savannah River site over to management by the South Carolina 
Natural Resource Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will further protect a unique habitat that for almost 50  
years has been spared from development,'' Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson said, in marking the management transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely a paradox. From the outside, people see it as  
a nuclear site,'' says Whit Gibbons, a senior scientist at the 
Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, whose 35 faculty scientists and 
dozens of other researchers and students have been closely studying 
the place for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear complex, mostly mothballed reactors and structures  
devoted to cleaning up the mess they made over decades of nuclear 
weapons production, covers only about l0 percent of the Energy 
Department's property. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest is largely pristine wilderness undisturbed by  
development for a half century -- vast expanses of longleaf pine 
forests, Cypress swamps, Carolina bay wetlands and a creek that 
boasts the highest number of different aquatic insect species -- 650 
-- of any river in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also more than 100 species of reptiles and amphibians,  
79 species of freshwater fish, more than 1,500 vascular plants, 
7,000 whitetail deer, turtles, several hundred alligators, 
thousands of migratory birds, bobcats, and a number of endangered 
or threatened species including the red-cockaded woodpecker, wood 
stork, smooth purple cone flower and bald eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think it has to be an awful place,'' says Gibbons, an  
ecology professor at the University of Georgia who has scrutinized 
the Savannah River Site for 32 years. ``But it's not. Ninety 
percent of it is better protected than the rest of the region 
around us.'' And thanks to 50 years of isolation from development, 
the wildlife has thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	In the heart of the complex sits Par Pond, a meandering  
2,300-acre lake that gets its name from two reactors -- P and R -- 
that are its neighbors. Once it served as the cooling pond for the 
reactors, and despite its beauty, it also contains highly 
radioactive cesium-137, plutonium-237 and strontium-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the lake is full of fat largemouth bass as well as more than  
200 alligators, some of which have grown old and big. Some of the 
alligators have been measured at more than 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the world-class bass fisheries,'' says Tom  
Hinton, a scientist at the laboratory, who has been studying how 
radiation migrates through the environment. Or it would be, if 
fishing were allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish, says Hinton, are all slightly radioactive,  
contaminated with cesium-137. The alligators are contaminated, too, 
as are many of the other wildlife and plants. Hinton says the 
contamination is generally at low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a reminder that even while taking in the isolated beauty  
of Par Pond, this, indeed, was where the government over four 
decades produced plutonium and tritium for the nation's nuclear 
arsenal. And often it cared little about dumping the wastes onto 
the environment. Not far from Par Pond are the canyons that still 
hold 35 million gallons of radioactive sludge and liquid awaiting 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hinton winces when a visitor suggests that to some the  
thought of a nuclear bomb factory and wildlife conjures up deformed 
deer, or amphibians with two heads. He has heard that before. 
</P>
<P>
	The radiation levels in the fish and in the deer are slight.  
While the Savannah River complex is off limits to outsiders, a few 
times each year controlled deer hunts are conducted to reduce the 
herd. Hunters are selected by lottery. Tissue samples are taken 
from each dead deer to make sure radiation levels are within 
acceptable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no such lottery for fishermen, although Hinton says he's  
heard the stories about people climbing the fence and trekking 3 
miles to Par Pond to fish on the sly. According to one tale, 
someone once landed a float plane on the pond to get at the bass. 
</P>
<P>
	What is clear is that wildlife is thriving.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very simple answer,'' says Hinton, 45, who has been  
at Savannah River for six years. ``The lack of human disturbance. 
Period. It's ironic that a contaminated environment that has kept 
things out, is doing so much for the environment.''

<HEADLINE> Proposed Merger of 3 Unions Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The big merger of the International Association  
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with the United Auto Workers 
and United Steelworkers of America won't happen anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions have put the merger on hold indefinitely, but say  
talks will continue to combine the UAW and Steelworkers unions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, the presidents of the three unions said  
the UAW and Steelworkers unions have more comparable organizational 
structures and would ``take the next step in the unification 
process by conducting immediate discussions to join their two 
unions together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``During this process, the three unions will continue to meet  
and continue their ultimate goal of reaching unification of all 
three unions,'' concluded the statement, which was posted on the 
Machinists union Web site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists spokesman Robert Kalaski said Thursday that  
differences in how the three unions elect their leaders was a major 
factor in the decision to delay the merger of all three. The 
Machinists have direct elections of their officials; the UAW and 
Steelworkers unions do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski said leaders of all three unions realized at least a  
year ago that their initial goal to merge by 2000 was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not dead,'' he said. ``There's still some things in the  
pot and more going in. If they don't do it by 2000, there's nothing 
wrong with 2003 or 2004. But we're going to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talks to merge the three unions began in July 1995. With more  
than 2 million members, the merged union would be the nation's 
largest. The merger was seen as a way to increase the unions' clout 
and eliminate duplicate efforts in organizing and lobbying. But it 
faced many difficulties from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't a simple process to merge three organizations this  
different,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the 
University of California-Berkeley. ``There are differences that 
span from the presidents down to the local unions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaiken said the unions are cooperating more than before the  
talks began, especially in their political activities. ``So even 
though the former merger may be on hold, they're working together 
on key issues. And each of the three is doing well on its own, so 
you don't have desperation fueling the merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalaski denied that the larger size of the UAW strike fund was a  
factor in the decision to delay the merger. ``All three unions have 
very healthy strike funds in proportion to their membership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to UAW spokesmen in Detroit were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Thesis Could Help Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore, the Harvard undergraduate, wrote a  
piece of campaign advice that Al Gore, the presidential candidate, 
could well heed: Personality is crucial for presidents in the 
television age. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the very trait some people think Gore lacks in his bid for  
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what word best describes him, two-thirds of Americans  
polled this spring said: ``Boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 51, was well versed about the interplay of personality and  
politics when he was in his early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	His college thesis concluded that as soon as TV cameras began  
panning the political landscape, as soon as bright TV lights 
spotlighted presidential news conferences, as soon as presidents 
could bypass reporters and talk directly to millions of American TV 
viewers, personality became more than just a plus for presidential 
timber. 
</P>
<P>
	``A key factor in this trend is the increasing importance of the  
president's personality,'' Gore wrote in his 1969 paper, which was 
titled ``The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency 
1947-1969.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of this,'' he continued in staid, academic prose, ``it  
is possible to speculate that a 'role requirement' of the president 
in the future might become 'visual communication.' Just as an 
effective speechmaking technique has been a role requirement in the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore presented his 103-page thesis, which traces the history of  
presidents on TV, to earn a bachelor's degree in government at 
Harvard. Back in 1969, Gore's father, Al Gore Sr., the late senator 
from Tennessee, gave it to Herbert Klein, communications director 
for President Nixon. Klein filed it and it ended up in President 
Nixon's papers stored at the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	The advent of television in politics prompted the public to  
substitute personality for issues when evaluating presidential 
appearances, Gore surmised in his paper. ``This is, of course, 
human nature and politicians have always known it,'' he wrote. 
``However, the old medium, newspapers, filtered out references to 
the president's personality, and reported primarily the issues 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, personality is an issue for Gore's campaign  
for president, says Aubrey Immelman, an associate professor of 
psychology at St. John's University in Minnesota who presented a 
study on Gore's political personality last year to the 
International Society of Political Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is Al Gore? Immelman's study reveals ``a dutiful,  
conscientious character infused with a distinctly aloof, 
introverted aspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American public has the wrong perception of Gore, insists  
his wife, Tipper. If boring means being a great husband and father 
while still managing to be ``funny, sexy and there for you when you 
need him,'' she'll take ``boring'' any day, Mrs. Gore gushed 
recently on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Gore's reserved nature, Marla Romash, deputy  
chairman of the Gore campaign, sighs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has answered this,'' she says. ``He's said  
'I am who I am.' Anybody who knows Al Gore knows he's a funny, 
engaging, warm guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late-night talk show hosts think he's funny too. In the past six  
months, Gore has been the butt of 52 of their jokes, according to 
the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, which keeps 
a running joke tally. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore even pokes fun at himself, repeating the tired joke about  
how he's so dull that the Secret Service code name for him is ``Al 
Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be a contender for 2000, Immelman says, Gore needs to drop  
the self-effacing jokes and send the message that his stiffness 
reflects integrity; his woodenness, a portent of what would be a 
focused approach to the business of leading the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Personality -- or the lack of one -- is an issue that Gore can  
only overcome with fresh ideas, said Erwin Hargrove, a political 
science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote a book on

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Back on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's pursuit of 3,000 hits is on hold  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres star was placed on the 15-day disabled list  
for the second time this season Thursday with a pulled left calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to sit here and be frustrated and say, `Hey,  
I'm this close to 3,000. What the hell's going on?' But I take the 
approach that it could be worse,'' Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, an eight-time NL batting champion, needs 18 hits to  
become the 22nd player to get 3,000 hits. He spent three weeks on 
the DL earlier this season because of the same injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the setback, Gwynn is confident he'll reach 3,000 hits  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't concern me, because I'm gonna get 'em,'' he said.  
``I mean, I've played too long to just be totally ticked off 
because I'm 18 hits short and I can't play. When I get back out 
there, I'm going to get 18 hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, 39, hasn't played since leaving Saturday's game against  
Pittsburgh. The outfielder was scheduled to play Tuesday against 
Los Angeles, but aggravated the injury while shagging fly balls 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my glove and tried to throw that thing through that  
wall out there in right field, because I knew this was a setback,'' 
Gwynn said. ``I knew it was worse than just being tight. I've never 
had anything linger this long, especially after doing all the rehab 
that they've asked me to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn originally hurt the calf on May 21 against Cincinnati  
while running to first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``People thought it was my Achilles again, but I knew it was my  
calf,'' said Gwynn, who has been plagued by Achilles' problems in 
recent years. ``There were days that it felt really good and other 
days where it was tight as a drum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the seventh time Gwynn has been on the DL in his 18-year  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when I'll come off, but when I do, I hope to be  
100 percent and not have to worry about this anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Andy Ashby, who has been on the DL with a strained lower  
back, was activated to take Gwynn's spot on the roster.

<HEADLINE>  France Lifts Coke Production Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- As France today lifted its ban on  
production of Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink company was 
taking longer than expected to resume operations at two Belgian 
plants that were shut following reports of illnesses among children 
who drank its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The French finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said today  
that a ban on canned Coca-Cola drinks produced at the northern town 
of Dunkirk was lifted on a recommendation by the government agency 
charged with food security. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people who drank from cans produced in Dunkirk had  
reported illnesses in the past two weeks. Rat poison was detected 
on the outside of one can, but the exact cause of the illnesses was 
not detected, said Francois Muguet, a state prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it seems that the product and its packaging are safe,  
so the sales can start up again,'' Strauss-Kahn said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government, which had banned imports on beverages  
produced at the Coca-Cola plant at nearby Dunkirk, has said it 
would allow sales in Belgium once France cleared the products. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium also announced on Wednesday it is allowing Coca-Cola to  
resume production at factories in the Belgian communities of 
Antwerp and Ghent, but imposed strict sanitary conditions. Without 
determining the cause of hundreds of illnesses reported in Belgium, 
the country's top health official termed them an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola had planned to resume production today. But it was  
still gearing up for a return to bottling today and the company 
said it would be a day or two more before it completed cleaning up 
the plant and conducting inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman, has said it would  
take about two weeks to build up full distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, we let the people of Belgium down,'' Ivester  
said Wednesday, a day after Coke purchased ads in papers throughout 
Belgium to apologize for the health scare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium and  
worldwide,'' Iverster said Wednesday, sipping a bottle of Coke as 
he addressed reporters in his first news conference since the 
health scare began June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's health minister, Luc Van den Bossche, said since June  
9, there had been 249 cases of illnesses reported in Belgium by 
people who drank Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester said Atlanta-based Coca-Cola would pay the medical bills  
of anyone who had fallen ill after drinking Coke products, although 
he denied the drinks posed any health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawsuits already are in the works.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have started an initial legal complaint against Coca-Cola  
because we want to know what happened,'' said Odilon Hermans, 
director of the St. Mary School in Bornem near Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermans said four students who drank Coke two weeks ago are  
still too sick to return to classes, suffering exhaustion and lack 
of concentration. Of the 280 students at his school, 39 became sick 
after drinking Coke products and 15 spent a night in the hospital, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Coca-Cola removed from many European shelves, rival Pepsi  
said it was meeting an increased demand for its soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Jeff Brown at Pepsi's headquarters in Purchase,  
N.Y., said the company is not trying to play up Coke's problems. He 
said Pepsi issued ``a worldwide memo directing international 
managers that they're not to exploit the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said warm weather and summer sales were boosting Pepsi  
sales in addition to the temporary withdrawal of competing products 
from the world's largest soft-drink company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester acknowledged that Coca-Cola had been slow to respond to  
consumer concerns about the health fears that led to bans in 
Belgium and beyond on Coke and other company brands, including Diet 
Coke, Fanta and Sprite. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate media briefing, Coke bottles lined a table as  
government officials outlined the new sanitary conditions imposed 
at the Coca-Cola plants. But the Coke bottles remained capped and 
the ministry aides drank Belgian bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche said government scientists were unable to  
establish a clear cause for the problem, but said it appeared to 
have been caused by ``an accident during production or transport'' 
that was unlikely to happen again if proper precautions for hygiene 
were maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola maintains that there were two problems -- a production  
problem in Antwerp that allowed sulfur compounds to mix with the 
carbon dioxide used to make Coke products bubbly, which gave it a 
``rotten egg'' smell and taste. Creosote on wooden shipping pallets 
also gave some Antwerp-produced cans of Coke a bad smell and taste, 
Coca-Cola said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, a couple of our quality control procedures broke  
down,'' Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche, who is also Belgium's Interior minister, said  
the lifting of the production ban would have been announced Tuesday 
were it not for late word of an extortion attempt against Coke last 
month in Germany. The minister said Wednesday he now is satisfied 
there is no link between the production problems and the extortion 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the threat were not disclosed, but a European  
Coca-Cola executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
German extortion attempt was unrelated to the problems in France or 
Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco To Close Houston Bakery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Nabisco Inc. plans to close its 50-year-old  
Houston bakery late this year, idling 425 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bakery, near the Texas Medical Center, manufactures Nabisco  
products like Ritz and Graham crackers, Air Crisps, Cheese Nips and 
chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Parsipanny, N.J.-based Nabisco said today the  
action came after a company-wide review of plants showed Nabisco's 
capacity exceeded its needs and added to the cost of overall 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco, which said the plant's last day would be Nov. 20, said  
the factory's age makes it one of the oldest bakeries in the 
Nabisco system and that its production can be accommodated within 
other Nabisco plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would offer salaried employees a severance  
package, extended benefits and career planning services and would 
begin talks with union officials about severance benefits for 
hourly employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The company still has about 1,000 employees in Texas at sales  
offices and distribution centers in Houston, Dallas, El Paso, 
Irving, Lubbock, San Antonio and Corpus Christi.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Called in Reggie Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the  
malpractice case against a renowned cardiologist after a jury could 
not decide if his diagnosis contributed to the death of Celtics 
star Reggie Lewis. Two consulting physicians were cleared of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after the jury, for a second time within 24  
hours, said it was deadlocked over whether Dr. Gilbert Mudge was 
culpable in Lewis' death. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith had exhorted the  
jury to make a ``last good effort'' to reach a verdict on Mudge, 
who had contradicted the opinions of several prominent physicians 
by telling Lewis he suffered from a benign fainting condition and 
not a life-threatening heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than 30 hours of deliberations, the jurors had said  
Wednesday night they were at an impasse concerning Mudge, who 
treated the former Celtics captain before he collapsed and died 
shooting baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to reach a verdict, agreement was need among 13 of the  
15 jurors, who heard nearly seven weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife, Donna Harris-Lewis, sued Mudge and the consultants,  
Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed 
and mistreated her husband's fatal heart condition. A third 
consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought at least $75 million, saying that was the  
sum Lewis would have earned if he didn't die. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
subsequently diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially 
career-ending cardiac arrhythmia by a ``Dream Team'' of top doctors 
from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference the 
player instead had a neurological condition that causes fainting 
spells. Mudge said he probably could return to professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died practicing jump  
shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment was  
clouded by his search for glory as the doctor who proved the 
``Dream Team'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As testimony turned to alleged drug use by the popular sports  
star, Harris-Lewis' attorneys also suggested that Mudge, desperate 
to cover up his mistakes, was ``searching the gutters'' for 
alternative explanations for the death of his most famous patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintained that Lewis admitted to cocaine use two weeks  
before he died. He said the belated confession made an accurate 
diagnosis impossible, and called several convicted felons to 
testify to alleged cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge also had said he privately suspected the player might have  
a serious heart condition -- and was treating him with beta blockers 
that addressed both the fainting condition and the possible cardiac 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told the family and the Celtics of his concerns, but  
both groups disputed that claim.

<HEADLINE> Heston Addresses Young Republicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Actor and National Rifle Association president  
Charlton Heston urged delegates at the Young Republican National 
Convention to reject the ``political correctness'' that he says 
demonizes gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston said proposed gun legislation in Congress is ``made for  
TV lawmaking'' and would do nothing to reduce violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all just words with no action to back it up,'' he said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed White House-backed gun control legislation  
last month in the wake of shootings at a Colorado high school. The 
same provisions were rejected by the House, which also killed a 
measure that contained weaker curbs.

<HEADLINE> Heptathlon Leader Flops in High Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Shades of Dan O'Brien?  
</P>
<P>
	DeDee Nathan, the world heptathlon leader, didn't think the same  
fate that befell O'Brien in the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials would 
happen to her after failing to clear a height in the high jump in 
the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Nathan said after three misses at 5 feet,  
7 1/4 inches. ``I'll finish (the two-day, seven-event competition) and 
be in the top three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's far from where O'Brien finished seven years ago, when he  
went in as the favorite in the decathlon, failed to clear a height 
in the pole vault, wound up 11th and did not make the American 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are the qualifier for the world  
championships at Seville, Spain, in August, with the top three 
finishers in each event making the team -- provided they have met 
the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will work in Nathan's favor, even if she doesn't  
finish in the top three after Friday's final three heptathlon 
events. That's because she is one of only of two Americans -- Shelia 
Burrell is the other -- who have met the qualifying standard of 
6,000 points, and the current top three aren't expected to reach 
that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Nathan would be added to the team. She registered  
a career-best 6,577 points at Gotzis, Austria, on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic,'' the smiling, confident Nathan said after her  
surprising failure. ``I'm not discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high jump was the second event of the heptathlon  
competition. Nathan opened with the fastest time in the 100-meter 
hurdles, 13.23 seconds, worth 1,090 points. 
</P>
<P>
	She quickly went from first place to last with her high jump  
woes. The leader with 1,899 points was Tiffany Lott-Hogan, the 1997 
and 1998 NCAA champion from BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot put and 200 meters were the remaining events for the  
heptathletes Thursday. They will finish with the long jump, javelin 
and 800 meters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, who has cleared 6-1 in the high jump, was puzzled by her  
failure at 5-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue what happened,'' she said after passing at the  
first seven heights. ``I was lethargic for some reason. My bounce 
wasn't on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, the 1999 world indoor pentathlon champion, was favored  
to win her first outdoor championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been big on titles,'' she said. ``I wasn't  
concerned about getting the U.S. title. Not when you're a world 
champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's program also included finals in the men's triple jump  
and 10,000 meters, and the women's hammer throw, discus and 
steeplechase.

<HEADLINE> Source: AOL, MicroWorkz in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is in talks with MicroWorkz  
Computer Corp., a maker of $200 personal computers, to offer its 
Internet service on desktop machines that don't use Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, a source close to the negotiations said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, while described as preliminary, could have important  
implications in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial in Washington, 
where the last witness finished testifying Thursday and where a 
news report about the talks was introduced as last-minute evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its defense, Microsoft has argued that AOL's $10  
billion purchase of rival Netscape Communications Corp. illustrates 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust that federal 
intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one possible result of the talks, AOL could offer MicroWorkz  
computers at easily affordable prices or even give them away to 
people who agree to subscribe to its service. That could vastly 
expand AOL's subscriber base, currently at 17 million, and make AOL 
machines an important new rival to computers running on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL-MicroWorkz talks were first reported Thursday by the  
MSNBC Internet news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said AOL  
initiated the talks regarding MicroWorkz's inexpensive PCs as a way 
to try to sell its Internet service to the millions of Americans 
who haven't yet bought computers because of the expense. The 
negotiations come amid a major ``AOL Anywhere'' initiative to bring 
the online service to a range of computers and electronics gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Latman, chief executive of MicroWorkz, said the company was  
talking with AOL about a potential cross-marketing arrangement, but 
declined to elaborate. AOL spokesman Jim Whitney would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations comes two days after Seattle-based  
MicroWorkz introduced its iToaster computer at the PC Expo trade 
show in New York. The desktop computer uses a non-Windows operating 
system made by Be Inc., includes non-Microsoft word processing, 
spreadsheets and other programs, and easily jumps users to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to AOL possibly offering PCs to its subscribers,  
another scenario would involve AOL being prominently promoted in 
computers sold by MicroWorkz, aiming to entice users to sign up for 
its offering of information, news, chat and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL's service is available on Apple Macintosh machines,  
another non-Windows computer, Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the 
default browser for Macintosh users to get online. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL deal could help Microsoft, which sells the operating  
system that runs 85 percent of the world's personal computers, 
bolster its argument that the Internet and new technologies 
represent a major threat to its software business. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL agreement to offer PCs to its subscribers also could seem  
to contradict statements by an AOL executive in trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial's final phase, Microsoft called as a hostile  
witness AOL executive David Colburn and questioned him about his 
company's plans to develop an ``AOL PC'' that won't use Microsoft's 
flagship Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn testified that plans for ``building a PC-type  
functionality that really is an alternative to Windows are largely 
dead. I don't know of any current ones (plans) going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara on Thursday noted Colburn's  
testimony and then showed the judge a news report about AOL's talks 
with Microworkz. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson raised 
his eyebrows and appeared to take notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current'' on industry  
developments, Jackson told Microsoft's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Klein insisted outside the  
courtroom that news of the discussions between AOL and Microworkz 
will not adversely affect the Justice Department's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no dent in the case, that's clear,'' Klein said,  
noting that Microsoft's own economics expert testified this week 
that the nation's largest computer makers have no viable 
alternative to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Microsoft lawyers labored long and hard to try to invent a  
threat from AOL,'' said Stephen Houck of the New York attorney 
general's office, the lead lawyer for the 19 states suing Microsoft 
with the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Demote Guillen Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates demoted unhappy  
outfielder Jose Guillen on Thursday for the second time this 
season, and recalled first baseman-outfielder Ivan Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen drove in 84 runs in his second full major league season  
last year but has struggled this year since missing the first three 
weeks of spring training in a visa dispute. He was originally sent 
down in late April, then was recalled three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen is batting .267 with one homer and 18 RBIs, with both  
his power and RBI production way down from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen has spent extensive time working with batting coach  
Lloyd McClendon, trying to regain his batting stroke and power. But 
Guillen has resisted making some changes, saying he didn't feel 
comfortable, and also was unhappy that he has been splitting time 
in right field with Brant Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay has expressed  
dissatisfaction with Guillen's play recently, all but warning that 
he might be sent down again if he did not regain his batting 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	By recalling Cruz, a former New York Yankees prospect, the  
Pirates also improve what has been one of their weakest areas, 
their bench. Cruz is one of the Pacific Coast League leaders in 
homers and RBIs and will likely be used mostly as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates pinch hitters are batting only about .200 with no homers  
and have repeatedly failed in late-inning situations with runners 
in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was among the Pirates' spring training leaders in homers  
and RBIs before being sent down late in camp because the Pirates 
did not have room on the roster for him.

<HEADLINE> Weather News Pinches Grain, Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid word that 
forecasts for a Midwest heatwave were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, July soybean futures fell more than 7  
cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and spring wheat rose had risen in the previous day's  
trading due to trader concern that hot, dry weather would damage 
newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters, who had been calling for unusually hot temperatures  
next week, now say that a high-pressure ridge in the Midwest has 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to  
$2.49 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; July 
oats fell 2 cents to $1.12 1/4 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 7 1/4 
cents to $4.58 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.05 cent to 63.42 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle broke even at 77.55 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
fell 0.98 cent to 51.72 cents a pound; and August pork bellies fell 
.60 cent to 44.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Eight Tied for PGA Club Pro Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVEN, Wis. (AP) -- Jeff Freeman of Palm Desert, Calif., birdied  
the last four holes to shoot a 2-under-par 70 Thursday and tie for 
the lead with a record seven other golfers in the first round of 
the 32nd PGA Club Professional Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest number of golfers tied for the lead after any  
round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 145 golfers broke par on Whistling Straits, the  
7,208-yard links-style course designed by Pete Dye that lies along 
Lake Michigan 60 miles north of Milwaukee. The average score was 
more than three strokes over par. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied with Freeman were Frank Bensel of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; Bob  
Ford, Oakmont, Pa.; Brett Upper, Phoenix; Rick Schuller, Leesburg, 
Va.; Gregg Jones, Colorado Springs, Colo.; Shawn Kelly, Sacramento, 
Calif., and Christopher Toulson of Miami. Another group of six 
players were one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot putter but Freeman back into contention after a tough  
start. He sank 25-foot putts on the 15th and 17th holes and a 
15-footer on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players got to 4-under during their round, including  
Kelly, who birdied the first two holes on the back nine before 
giving back the strokes with two bogeys in his last five holes. Joe 
Regner of Lexington, Ky., had an even tougher finish, a 
triple-bogey 7 on his final hole -- his first bogey of the day -- to 
slide to 1-under 71. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner receives $40,000 out of the $300,000 purse, and the  
top 25 finishers earn spots in the PGA Championship Aug. 12-15.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines officials and federal  
investigators hope a review of the airline's safety and training 
programs can shed light on why American has had more crashes than 
any other U.S. air carrier in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based American has suffered two crashes since  
1993 that killed a total of 171 people. Four other crashes damaged 
planes but caused only minor injuries, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, a slightly larger carrier with a  
comparable schedule, has had one fatal crash this decade, according 
to federal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be turning the place inside out, trying to  
find anything that will improve our performance,'' Robert Baker, 
American vice president for operations, told The Dallas Morning 
News in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if there were a magic bullet, I think we would have seen  
it a long time ago. We would have found glaring errors or 
omissions,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials, along with outside consultants and experts  
from the Federal Aviation Administration, plan to review safety and 
training programs. The FAA said it plans similar evaluations for 
all airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to look at American and see what these events are  
telling us,'' said Margaret Gilligan, the FAA's deputy associate 
administrator for regulation and certification. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it will focus on whether American's corporate  
culture and its bitter disputes with its pilots' union are in any 
way affecting safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation experts said American's problems don't necessarily mean  
the airline is more dangerous than others. When compared with the 
rest of the industry and number of miles flown over the last 15 
years, American's safety record remains among the best. 
</P>
<P>
	But American officials and outside experts agree that the string  
of accidents since 1993 is something the airline should worry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be irresponsible not to step back and see whether  
your accident prevention program was working,'' said C.O. Miller, 
who headed the National Transportation Safety Board's Bureau of 
Safety during much of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Computer Imaging Enhances Looks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For Daniel Young's parents, it was unthinkable. How could their  
son, a senior at Daniel Hand High School in Madison, Conn., shave 
his head just before yearbook portraits were taken? 
</P>
<P>
	When a portrait company told them it could use computer imaging  
to restore his locks, they jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Youngs are among high schoolers and their parents who are  
exchanging traditional photorealism for radical enhancements like 
replacing hair, removing braces and changing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctoring of senior portraits raises ethical questions among  
some photographers. But the digital process used by Young's 
portrait taker, T.D. Brown of Cranston, R.I., has also been placed 
in the Smithsonian Institution as an example of how technology is 
changing day-to-day life. 
</P>
<P>
	Retouching photos is hardly a new practice. Manual touchups to  
correct redeye, scratches on a negative and removing other 
blemishes with airbrushing are common. More elaborate tricks such 
as removing an entire person from a picture have also been 
available -- at a price of several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	T.D. Brown charges $19 to $49 depending on the complexity of its  
retouching work. If the customer is spending $250 or more on a 
package of photographs, the retouching is free. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, not everyone is pleased, including Young, now a  
19-year-old sophomore at Keene State College in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not like it one bit,'' said his mother, Toni. ``We  
didn't mind because we were paying for it, after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Youngs gave the company an idea of Daniel's hair color and  
an indication of where it parted and its length before he shaved it 
off. The company then added hair and changed his clothing in 
addition to doing traditional touchup work. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting portrait, both Daniel and his parents agree, was  
pretty convincing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not dead on -- I mean I look a bit like Superman -- but  
they did pretty well with it, considering the circumstances,'' 
Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all changes are quite as significant. Most orders consist of  
obscuring unruly strands of hair or removing braces. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology behind T.D. Brown's photo enhancements derives  
from its ties with Kodak, vice president Craig Brown said. Through 
a partnership, T.D. Brown was able to build computer programs for 
image-altering technologies developed by Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took that technology and gave it an application,'' said  
Craig Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	T.D. Brown's process involves taking photos of a person in  
different poses. The company then places the images on its Web 
site, for inspection by the customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come to us and say 'I like that smile, that pose, that  
background or those clothes.' We take those bits and pieces and 
make one,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	While some form of digital photo technology has been around  
since the early 1990s, Brown said 65 percent of students now opt 
for touchups. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the more highly modified photographs go into the  
yearbook along with the unaltered alarms Bradley Wilson, executive 
director of the National Press Photographers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you can doesn't mean you should,'' said Wilson, a  
former yearbook adviser. After spending several years at a yearbook 
publisher himself, Wilson feels the yearbook should be a record of 
things as they were, not as students or parents would like them to 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``My objective as a press photographer is to depict reality,''  
Wilson said. ``It should be the objective of yearbook editors as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a third generation portrait photographer, Craig Brown  
understands that not everyone is comfortable with enhancing a 
yearbook photograph to such a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they really understand what it is, they think we are  
creating false images. We're not at all. What we're doing is giving 
control back to the customer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, Britain's newly-married Prince Edward ordered the  
unsmiling image of his nephew Prince William digitally removed from 
the official photograph of family members at his wedding last 
Saturday. Edward arranged for William to appear more cheerful in 
the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	William Lai, editor in chief of the University of Miami's Ibis  
yearbook, has no problem with students changing their looks for a 
portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're busy and then they find the time to do a portrait then  
on that day they had a bad hair day or a pimple that popped out, 
that's why it's so helpful,'' Lai said.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA in Major Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With personal computer prices on the decline,  
CompUSA will reduce its reliance on PC sales and turn its focus to 
consumer electronics, packing its stores with everything from video 
cameras to high-tech toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are part of a major reorganization announced  
Thursday by Dallas-based CompUSA, which has struggled recently with 
sagging profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also slash 1,000 to 1,500 jobs, or about 7  
percent of its workforce of 21,000, and it will close four stores. 
As many as 10 more stores could be closed in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a step in the right direction, but the proof will  
be in the execution,'' said Joe Panettieri, the executive editor at 
Smart Reseller magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional computer retailers have been hurt in the last year  
amid a drastic decline in PC prices. More than half the computers 
bought at retail stores this year sold for under $1,000 and a 
growing number are selling for less than $600. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, CompUSA has been stung by increased competition  
from consumer electronics merchants such as Best Buy and a rise in 
sales over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to revive its business, CompUSA will now broaden  
the array of merchandise sold at its stores. It will still stock 
desktop and laptop computers, but its merchandise mix will also 
include more Palm hand-held computers, digital cameras, interactive 
toys, camcorders and DVD movies and players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be more of a technology superstore, which is  
probably good for them,'' said David Goldstein, president of 
Dallas-based Channel Marketing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts questioned whether the shift to consumer  
electronics will do anything to help the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the product categories they're talking about beefing  
up have the same profit margins as PCs,'' Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panettieri added that such products may only be a short-term  
solution. ``Long-term, what do you do as the price of DVDs and 
handhelds drop like crazy?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cutting jobs, closing stores and changing its  
product offerings, CompUSA will begin testing different store 
layouts to better display products and it is considering the 
development of in-store centers where customers can design 
made-to-order computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also put more salespeople on the selling floor  
and will step up its employee training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its direct-sales division, CompUSA plans within 30 days to  
find a third-party distributor to handle distribution and 
fulfillment operations. Currently, CompUSA ships from stores and a 
distribution center in Grapevine, Texas, which is slated to close. 
</P>
<P>
	The outsourcing of distribution should help to reduce costs and  
keep down losses on inventory, which can quickly become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this focus will restore our financial performance  
by increasing gross margins, reducing operating costs, improving 
customer service and capitalizing on strategic growth 
opportunities,'' said CompUSA president and CEO James F. Halpin in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will result in charges of as much as $50  
million, or 54 cents a share. It expects to record the charge in 
the fourth quarter ending June 26 and the first two quarters of 
fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA's stock closed down 50 cents, or 6 percent, at $7.68 3/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA currently operates 211 stores.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Try To Turn Around Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speckled with gold and wrapped in red, white  
and blue, more than 100 of America's Olympic heroes turned out to 
say that the games they love are more than a school for scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath a sweltering sun on the front steps of the Capitol, the  
athletes formed a portrait of what they, officials and sponsors 
hope the public sees when it thinks of the Olympics -- competition 
at its best, not corruption at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was Olympic Day, a worldwide celebration to mark the  
birth of the modern Olympic movement 105 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Held annually for more than a decade, the observance took on  
added meaning this year in the wake of the million-dollar bribery 
scandal connected with the Salt Lake City Winter Games. The 
ceremony in Washington was part of the U.S. Olympic Committee's 
effort to shift the focus back to the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a few falters and a few stumbles,'' Sen. Ben  
Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican who was captain of the 
U.S. Olympic judo team in 1964, told more than 100 spectators. ``A 
few people gave us a black eye, but that's just a bump in the road. 
The U.S. Olympic team has done its best to reverse from that 
falter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those on hand ranged from 76-year-old Horace Ashenfelter, a gold  
medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 1952, to Dominique 
Dawes, part of the gold-medal women's gymnastics team in 1992 when 
she was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 111 athletes who took part, 47 have won a total of 74  
gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are my heroes,'' said Herb Douglas, the 1948 long-jump  
bronze medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, a successful business leader who started the annual  
Jesse Owens Award for athletic excellence, sat at a breakfast 
table, sharing eggs, sausage and hash browns with a group of fellow 
Olympians who counted 10 gold medals among them -- basketball's Ray 
Lumpp (1948) and track stars Harrison Dillard (four golds, 
1948-52), Charlie Jenkins (two, 1956), Madeline Manning Mims (one, 
1968) and Lindy Remigino (two, 1952). 
</P>
<P>
	They and others said it was important to remember that the  
scandal did not involve athletes, that relatively few stars made 
money from Olympic glory and that the lure of the games had nothing 
to go with personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Olympics,'' said Hilary Smart, a yachting gold  
medalist in 1948 who now gets around with the help of a wheelchair 
and an oxygen bottle. ``I was one of the amateur guys. I never was 
looking for money from it. Who cared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a quadruple gold medalist in swimming in 1976 and  
now a TV commentator, said he and his colleagues were ``ordinary 
people who accomplished extraordinary things. It is that which 
inspires others as they watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the USOC's alumni organization, Naber urged fans and  
corporations not to allow the scandal to stop the flow of donations 
and sponsorships for the competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``While major change is needed, it must be noted that it is the  
athletes who are paying the price for the deeds of others,'' he 
said. ``The clock continues to tick, wasting the athlete's most 
precious resource -- time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitol stage was limited to athletes. The only high-ranking  
officials among those donning red, white and blue windbreakers were 
there because of what they did in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great fun,'' said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of he  
International Olympic Committee, but first a bronze medalist in 
rowing at the 1976 Games. ``I've seen some folks I've admired. It 
reminds us of what we are about.''

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, eyeing next year's  
Senate race in New York, will use government jets for her political 
trips to the state ``for as long as she is first lady,'' her 
spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry said the decision to continue using military  
aircraft was made on the advice of the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising committee, in the process of being  
set up, will reimburse the government for political travel, she 
said. That is already done by other campaign committees when the 
first lady travels to help candidates raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong recommendation of the Secret Service is that she  
continue to fly military aircraft for security reasons and she will 
follow their recommendations,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a prospective GOP challenger  
for the Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, said only that he was unfamiliar with federal 
campaign finance rules. ``I think she should follow whatever the 
rules and the laws are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to announce creation of an exploratory  
committee either late this month or early in July. It would be able 
to raise and spend money for a possible Senate race. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic Party's campaign committees are  
working together to organize early in six states that will play a 
major role in the outcome of presidential, congressional and state 
legislative elections in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Andrew, in a meeting  
Friday of state party chairmen, is expected to announce plans to 
hire six grassroots organizers in Nevada, southern California, New 
Mexico, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The operatives will work with local party officials to target  
key congressional races in the state and important legislative 
contests within those districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said the staff has not been hired, thus Andrew  
will not put a cost estimate on the project Friday. The national 
party will split the costs with the House and Senate campaign 
committees. Organizers should be in place by Labor Day, party 
officials said. 
</P>

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A proposal to scrap California's  
winner-take-all Republican presidential primary has cleared another 
hurdle. But it's unlikely to become law in time to affect the March 
7 primary next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly's elections committee voted 7-0 on Thursday  
to send the proposal to the full body. But the sponsor, Sen. Ray 
Haynes, said the bill can't move fast enough to meet the national 
GOP's deadline next Thursday for changes in how states select 
presidential convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Haynes' plan, the GOP candidate who draws the most primary  
votes statewide would no longer automatically walk away with all 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a victory in each of the state's 52 districts would be  
worth three delegates. An additional two dozen or so at-large 
delegates would go to the candidate with the most votes statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes said his hope was that candidates would organize earlier  
and more extensively. 
</P>

	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush had himself a  
running mate Thursday, for 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how long it took the Republican candidate and  
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge to run together along the Susquehanna 
River after Bush spent the night at the state's executive mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``A jogging mate,'' Bush said of his friend, who accompanied him  
during a two-day fund-raising swing. Pennsylvania Republicans 
consider Ridge a potential running mate for Bush in the political 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people greeted the governors later in the morning  
at a $1,000-a-plate breakfast, and a similar crowd paid the same 
for lunch with Bush in Pittsburgh. In all, Bush raised some $1.3 
million in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in Detroit, Bush visited Mexicantown, a mainly Hispanic  
neighborhood where he showcased his bilingual abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Elena Rodriguez, president of the Mexicantown Community  
Development Corporation, said the visit demonstrated the rising 
political power of Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fully aware of the fact that demographics are changing in  
this country,'' she said. ``That he has come here is significant 
because he knows we're on the way up.''

<HEADLINE>  United States Tops Nigeria 7-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As Tiffeny Milbrett watched the ball drop into  
the goal, a wave of nausea washed over her. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 65,080 fans in the stands, and they were hungry for a  
U.S. victory. They were yelling themselves hoarse with chants of 
``U-S-A, U-S-A'' and ``U-S-A. All the way.'' Their clothes were 
red, white and blue. Their bodies were painted. 
</P>
<P>
	Even their hair was dyed.  
</P>
<P>
	And the scoreboard read Nigeria 1, United States 0.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nigeria started out fast and ready to take it to us. When they  
scored, you're mad and get a little sick feeling in your head,'' 
Milbrett said. ``Then you bite the bullet, go on and not let it 
wreck you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans did more than just hold themselves together,  
though. They attacked the Nigerians like bees at a picnic in what 
turned into a 7-1 rout Thursday night in the Women's World Cup. 
Balls flew into the net at a furious pace. It seemed as if the 
entire U.S. lineup was scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete adrenalin rush, and that makes you play at a  
level you never did before,'' said Milbrett, who scored two goals. 
``It really made us get angry, really made us alert right away so 
that we played our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, following the Americans' 3-0 defeat of Denmark in  
the opener, virtually assured them a spot in the quarterfinals and 
a berth in the 2000 Olympics. But North Korea's 3-1 victory over 
Denmark in Portland, Ore., prevented the United States from 
clinching the berth. The U.S. team plays the Koreans in Foxboro, 
Mass., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game of the doubleheader, Brazil advanced to the  
second round with a 2-0 victory over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy favorites to regain the World Cup title they lost four  
years ago, the Americans aren't even supposed to be tested until 
the semifinals. Sure, Nigeria has speed and athletic skills -- not 
to mention a keeper with some funky headgear -- but this U.S. team 
has been playing together since before women's soccer was 
introduced in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, two minutes into the game, it was the Super Falcons  
dancing on the field to celebrate their goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't part of the game plan,'' said U.S. star Mia Hamm,  
who had a goal and an assist. ``What I'm so proud of is we didn't 
get rattled. We came back out and started pressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And scoring. The Americans had talked all week about scoring on  
set pieces, so that's what they did. In the 19th minute, Hamm's 
free kick from near the left sideline ricocheted in off defender 
Ifeanyichukwu Chiejine to tie the game at 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a minute later, Hamm was left open on the right wing  
and she put a rocket of a shot just over Ann Chiejine's right hand. 
The scoring frenzy continued as Milbrett beat Nigeria captain 
Florence Omagbemi and centered, where Kristine Lilly's shot was 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ball bounced off Cindy Parlow directly to Milbrett,  
whose shot went in off Chiejine's hands for the 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States scored three more goals in the first half for  
a 6-1 edge, tying a Women's World Cup record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right from (Nigeria's goal), we knew what was going to happen  
after that,'' Lilly said. ``The momentum started picking up for us 
and we started playing our game. From then on, we were finishing 
the chances we had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best thing, in an ironic way, is that they scored  
on us. But we don't want that to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett added a late goal with a sliding left-footed poke on a  
gorgeous feed from Cindy Parlow. The seven goals tied a team record 
in the World Cup, set against Taiwan when the Americans won the 
championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I lost to a better side. I lost to a very experienced  
side, a side that has been together even before women's football 
was introduced in Nigeria,'' coach Ismaila Mabo said. ``I don't 
have any regrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
                          *Brazil 2, Italy 0    	
</P>
<P>
	Sissi scored two goals and the Brazilians got some sterling  
saves by goalkeeper Maravilha. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in their opening rout of Mexico, the Brazilians started  
quickly. Sissi, who scored three times in the previous 7-1 victory, 
took a perfect pass from Nene and blasted a 15-yard left-footed 
shot into the top of the net just two minutes in. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's attack stalled midway through the first half as  
their passes went astray and their shots were well off target. 
Finally, in the 63rd minute, Sissi fooled goalie Giorgia Brenzan, 
who was out of position, with a weak shot from 18 yards out.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Ultraviolet Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA today launched an ultraviolet  
telescope that will help astronomers better understand what the 
universe was like moments after creation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, better known as  
Fuse, took off aboard an unmanned Delta rocket. Its destination: a 
480-mile-high orbit from which it will peer into the corners of the 
Milky Way galaxy and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuse will spend at least three years measuring the abundance of  
deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, which was created along 
with the rest of the universe in the so-called Big Bang 12 billion 
or more years ago. Every day, deuterium is being consumed by stars 
and converted into helium. 
</P>
<P>
	By determining how much deuterium still exists and how much is  
regularly destroyed, astronomers can delve back in time and try to 
figure out the original makeup of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deuterium is a cosmic fossil. I think that's perhaps the best  
way I can describe it,'' said Warren Moos, the lead scientist for 
the project at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we knew the primordial abundance of deuterium, if we knew  
that, then we could figure out the average abundance of ordinary 
nuclear matter ... the ordinary matter that makes up oceans, that 
makes up people, that makes up stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope's observations, expected to begin in about three  
months, also should help explain how stars and galaxies evolve and 
how the gas between galaxies changes over time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuse will expand on ultraviolet observations by NASA's  
Copernicus observatory, launched in 1972, as well as the Hubble 
Space Telescope and small instruments occasionally flown on the 
space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The $214 million mission will be operated entirely by Johns  
Hopkins, which also designed and built the 18-foot, 3,000-pound 
telescope for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
It's the most involved a university has ever been in a NASA 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a streamlined version of the original project, which was  
twice as expensive for development and was intended for a 
considerably higher orbit. The basic scientific objectives survived 
despite the cost-cutting changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuse is part of NASA's Origins program to study the birth and  
evolution of stars and galaxies and to search for planets that 
might hold life.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Watchdog Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Bromwich, the Justice Department's  
inspector general who criticized the FBI crime laboratory in 1997 
for shoddy work, is resigning effective Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich, the inspector general since 1994, said in a letter  
Thursday to Attorney General Janet Reno he was leaving to ``move on 
to other challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspector generals are independent watchdogs who investigate  
waste, fraud and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich wrote a scathing 500-page report in April 1997 blasting  
the world-renowned FBI lab for flawed scientific work and 
inaccurate testimony biased in favor of the prosecution in major 
cases including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich recommended major reforms. The lab changed some of its  
procedures and won accredition last year from a national standards 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich also investigated whether the CIA was involved in a  
crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s after a series of newspaper 
articles about drug traffickers who were also leaders of a CIA-run 
guerrilla army in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	His report found no evidence to support the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Aerosmith Cancels Woodstock Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Aerosmith, one of the main acts scheduled to  
perform at Woodstock '99, has canceled its appearance at the rock 
festival because of scheduling conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The band -- Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton,  
and Joey Kramer -- said Wednesday it regretted the inconvenience to 
its fans and apologized to those who already had purchased tickets 
to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it came down to was scheduling conflicts and logistical  
problems with other gigs,'' said Ilene Marder, spokesperson for 
Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerosmith becomes the second headliner to cancel because of  
scheduling problems. Last month, former Yardbirds guitarist Jeff 
Beck also pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99 will be held July 23-25 at the former Griffiss Air  
Force Base. More than 120,000 tickets already have been sold, and 
promoters expect 250,000 music lovers to attend.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Using Faster Internet2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Astronomers on opposite sides of the  
Atlantic Ocean are already using it to simulate the collision of 
neutron stars, their screens filling with a pyrotechnic shower. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists hundreds of miles apart are using it to manipulate a  
remote control microscope and get a closer look at how proteins 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors separated by a mountain range are depending on it to  
receive and move three dimensional images in a virtual clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	These scientists and researchers are already using Internet2 --  
an experimental computer network with speeds 45,000 faster than the 
best telephone modems people now use to reach the cluttered old 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A collaborative effort by more than 150 universities and leading  
high tech businesses, Internet2 will revolutionize cyberspace, 
according to its developers at the Washington-based University 
Corporation for Advanced Internet Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Internet2, we're able to make amazing leaps and advances  
that could never happen on the Internet,'' said Greg Wood, a 
spokesman the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood demonstrated the new capabilities -- including a system that  
allows physicists to access and analyze huge amounts of data 
resulting from atomic collider experiments -- at the Internet 
Society's Global Summit in San Jose this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast network is used solely by academics and other  
professional researchers, with no way for home users to dial in. 
But its benefits should trickle down to consumers in a few years as 
ways to use the unprecedented speeds are discovered 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Van Houweling, CEO of the project, said the initial  
research using the system ``demonstrates how international 
cooperation can advance Internet technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Internet2 should duplicate the success of today's  
Internet by renewing the partnership between private companies, the 
federal government and universities that launched the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate members include Microsoft, IBM Corp., Cisco Systems  
Inc., 3Com Corp., Apple Computers, Inc., Pacific Bell, Motorola, 
Sprint and Sun Microsystems.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Recall Ledee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees search for  
left-field production resulted in yet another roster move. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees recalled outfielder Ricky Ledee from Triple-A  
Columbus on Thursday and sent outfielder Tony Tarasco outright to 
the International League farm team. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said Shane Spencer will continue as  
the starting left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting there I think,'' Torre said. ``Right now, it's  
our biggest priority. You'd like to do it from within because you 
know the people. If it looks like it's don't getting done, you have 
do to something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Yankees' left-field output remain stagnant -- Chad  
Curtis' .216 average is the highest among five left fielders this 
season -- New York will seek a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee, considered one of the top prospects in the Yankees' minor  
league system the past several years, went 6-for-10 with four RBIs 
in New York's World Series sweep over San Diego last October but 
hit just .200 with five RBIs in 17 games earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After this season, the Yankees won't be able to send him to the  
minors without placing him on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I go down, I'll go down swinging,'' Ledee said. ``I'm going  
to try and be as aggressive as I can. Whatever happens, it 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasco, who could refuse the outright assignment and opt for  
free agency, said he is 95 percent sure he will report to Columbus. 
He hit .161 with 3 RBIs in 14 games with the Yankees.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mary Ellen Brennan stood outside Soldier Field, a  
brush in her hand, tiny soccer balls dangling from her ears, little 
boys and girls lined up before her to get their faces painted red, 
white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	She and 74 others had loaded into cars, vans and practically  
anything else with wheels for the 12-hour drive from Tulsa, Okla., 
to see the United States beat Nigeria 7-1 on Thursday in the 
Women's World Cup. Not even an overheated van and a four-hour delay 
in Missouri could cool this group's enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was a football game, I'd just come,'' Brennan said.  
``But this is soccer. I'm a fanatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and the 65,080 others who crammed into Soldier Field. With  
two hours still to go before the Brazil-Italy game, the first match 
of the doubleheader, the lines to get in the gates were already 
snaking around the stadium. Parking lots were full and scalpers 
wandered around offering tickets at twice face value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans made sure it was money well spent. After the  
Nigerians scored first, the United States answered with three goals 
in a four-minute span early in the first half, and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
	When the final horn sounded, the Americans on the bench ran onto  
the field, hugging their teammates. Assistant coach Lauren Gregg 
turned toward the crowd as she walked to the field, clapping her 
hands above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	After shaking hands with the Nigerians, the Americans ran around  
the field in a victory lap, waving to the crowd, clapping their 
hands and giving the thumbs-up sign. It was a scene straight from a 
rock concert, as fans screamed and yelled and flashbulbs went off 
all over the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't to promote ourselves, it was to thank the crowd,''  
fan favorite Mia Hamm said. ``Two minutes in, they really supported 
us. To hear the chants of `U-S-A,' that's what you mean when you 
talk about home-field advantage. They just made us feel very 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the time the Americans took the field, the fans were wild  
and rowdy. A huge cheer went up when the American flag was brought 
out, and the team got a standing ovation as it walked onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	As the starters stood at midfield, waiting for the national  
anthem, Michelle Akers raised both her hands and pumped her fists 
at the crowd, which was chanting, ``U-S-A All the way!'' During the 
pre-game huddle, forward Cindy Parlow stepped back and waved at the 
crowd, urging them to keep cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	With a pro-American crowd, that wasn't going to be a problem.  
While a few people wore Brazil shirts, anything red, white and blue 
-- hats, T-shirts, faces, fingernails -- was the popular choice of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup goalie Saskia Webber and forward Danielle Fotopoulos even  
dyed their hair red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	One group of teen-age girls sported red, white and blue down to  
their underwear. Adreanna Pankow, sisters Jamie and Randi Siedzik, 
Natalie Black and Kelly Wood were dressed in flag boxer shorts, 
flag bandannas and red sports bras. They spelled out ``Go USA'' 
across their stomachs in face paint, and had Hamm, Kristine Lilly 
and Julie Foudy's names and numbers on their arms and backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're soccer nuts,'' Randi Siedzik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like the crowd at Giants Stadium on Saturday, many of the fans  
were young girls. And most of them were big Hamm fans. There were 
Hamm jerseys and T-shirts with her No. 9 all over the place. 
Hundreds of girls had her number painted on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the players and fans are great role models for young  
women everywhere, and we wanted to see them,'' Walz-Keller said. 
``We really can't have personal contact with them, so this is our 
way of showing support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just young girls who were excited to see the game.  
Mike and Nancy Lynch of Western Springs, Ill., brought their 
11-year-old son, Jimmy, and three of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same as the men's,'' Steven Oetking, 11, said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Except this U.S. team, I'm expecting to get a little  
further,'' Jimmy Lynch added.

<HEADLINE> Jagr wins Lester Pearson Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh Penguins won the  
the NHL's Lester Pearson award today as the league's most 
oustanding player. 
</P>
<P>
	The award is presented by the NHL Players' Association.  
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, who was to receive his third Art Ross Trophy as the  
league's leading scorer at the NHL awards ceremony later Thursday, 
was also nominated for the Hart Trophy as the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech forward led the league with 44 goals and 83 assists.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very special to me,'' said Jagr. ``It's a trophy voted on  
by the players -- the players you play against, the players you face 
every night. That's why it's special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr thanked Penguins general manager Craig Patrick for putting  
``such a good team together without using a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bankrupt Penguins were awaiting to learn their fate today. A  
bankruptcy court judge was expected to choose Mario Lemieux's plan 
to save the team or one from the NHL.

<HEADLINE> Justices Rule Against Arkansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to let  
four Arkansas cities bar people from putting leaflets on cars 
parked on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which the  
cities argued that their ordinances were a valid effort to control 
litter and did not violate free-speech rights because leaflets 
still could be handed to anyone willing to take them. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinances were enacted in Fort Smith in 1981 and two years  
later in Van Buren, Alma and Dyer. They bar people from putting 
handbills on cars parked on city streets, unless someone in the car 
is willing to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members of the Twentieth Century Holiness Tabernacle  
Church filed class-action lawsuits in 1995, saying the ordinances 
violated their rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The church members said they distribute literature in an effort  
to ``preach the gospel to every living person in the earth.'' They 
also said that only church members had ever been charged with 
violating the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge upheld the ordinances but the 8th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals reversed that ruling and declared them 
unconstitutional. The ordinances imposed too broad a free-speech 
restriction, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four cities said the church members still can  
get their message out by giving handbills to willing recipients. 
Pamphlets left on cars' windshields often wind up being thrown on 
the ground, the cities' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cities also argued that the appeals court wrongly awarded  
attorneys' fees to the church members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the church members said the answer to handbills  
being thrown on the ground is to enforce the laws against 
littering. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the appeals court's ruling followed ``longstanding  
precedent that the peaceful distribution of political or religious 
leaflets is a fundamental right at the core of the First 
Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Fort Smith vs. Krantz, 98-1753, and Alma vs.  
Krantz, 98-1954.

	In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of an unofficial,  
nondenominational prayer in New York State public schools was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the Beatles performed their new song, ``All You Need Is  
Love,'' during a live international telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, former White House Counsel John Dean began testifying  
before the Senate Watergate Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, American-born Mildred Gillars, better known during  
World War II as ``Axis Sally'' for her Nazi propaganda broadcasts, 
died in Columbus, Ohio, at age 87. Gillars had served 12 years in 
prison for treason. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  1 Dead, 21 Hurt in French Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- One person was killed and 21 injured when a bus  
carrying American and French schoolchildren struck a tree Thursday 
morning while on a field trip to Paris. Seven Americans aged 10-11 
from the Grand Rapids, Mich., area were among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, who was killed instantly, lost control of the bus in  
Orconte, about 115 miles east of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one children suffered facial and leg injures but none  
were considered life-threatening, police and doctors said. 
Twenty-six other children on the bus suffered minor bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The children not requiring surgery were expected to leave the  
hospital late Thursday or early Friday, doctors said. A French 
adult accompanying the young people suffered head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims were identified.  
</P>
<P>
	French authorities sent psychologists to speak with the children  
at the crash site and in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The American students arrived in France on June 10th as part of  
a three-week exchange program coordinated by the French-American 
Association of Epinal, a town about 250 miles east of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The schoolchildren were on their way to Paris for a two-day  
field trip when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the American children live in the Forest Hills School  
District in suburban Grand Rapids, said Forest Hills spokeswoman 
Karen Lott. She said the trip was privately sponsored and not 
connected to the district. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. consular officials were on their way to provide assistance  
to the victims and to contact the parents. Some children had been 
put in contact with their parents by telephone.

<HEADLINE> Teen Abortion Bill Clears Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill making it a crime to take a pregnant  
minor to another state for an abortion without a parent's knowledge 
is nearing a House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee voted 16-13, along party lines, in  
favor of the bill Wednesday. A vote on the House floor could occur 
as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has yet to act on a companion measure.  
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened last year to veto similar  
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it illegal for someone other than a parent,  
guardian or legal custodian to take a pregnant girl under age 18 to 
another state for an abortion if it would violate parental 
involvement laws in the child's home state. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 states have laws requiring that at least one parent  
give consent or be notified when their minor daughter seeks to have 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not apply if the abortion would save the  
girl's life, and neither the girl nor any parent may be prosecuted 
or sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators face maximum penalties of a year in jail and $100,000  
in fines, and parents whose daughters had abortions could pursue 
civil action. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans portrayed the bill as an effort to uphold the rights  
of parents to be involved in decisions by their daughters to 
undergo the surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also contend it would protect vulnerable girls from  
being taken away by older men who get them pregnant and then try to 
hide it. Most teen-age pregnancies are caused by adult men, said 
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued that girls who fear turning to their parents  
because of abuse or other reasons would suffer the most. They would 
have little option but to undergo the procedure alone or to seek 
unsafe abortions, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also said the bill was constitutionally suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defeated a slew of Democratic amendments, including  
proposals to exempt grandparents, adult siblings, other relatives 
and religious leaders from prosecution. They also rejected an 
amendment that would have barred prosecution in cases of incest. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House opposed similar legislation last year because,  
among other reasons, it did not exempt close family members from 
civil or criminal liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed the House, though without enough votes to  
overturn a threatened White House veto. It died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218

<HEADLINE> Court Faces States' Rights Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, having ended its 1998-99  
term by dramatically enhancing states' political power, will 
confront two new states' rights disputes in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices added one of those cases Thursday in an order  
issued among scores of others the day after they began a 
three-month recess from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed to use a Vermont dispute to decide whether  
people can sue a state they accuse of cheating the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont's lawyers contend that the Constitution and federal law  
bar such lawsuits against states. Lower courts rejected that 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices had agreed in January to decide, sometime in 2000,  
whether state employees who say they were victims of age 
discrimination can make a federal case of it. Consolidated cases 
from Florida and Alabama will yield that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In other orders Thursday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact a Pakistani man's Virginia death sentence for the  
1993 fatal shootings of two CIA employees outside the spy agency's 
headquarters. Mir Aimal Kasi had challenged his arrest by FBI 
agents in Pakistan following a global manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to let four Arkansas cities bar people from putting  
leaflets on cars parked on city streets.

	In the Vermont case, Jonathan Stevens was a lawyer for the state

agency in 1995. He alleged that it had submitted false time records

private citizens file lawsuits on the federal government's behalf 
alleging that someone committed fraud against the government. 
Private citizens whose lawsuits are successful can collect a share 
of any damages awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont officials asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit,  
saying a state is not a ``person'' who can be held liable under the 
False Claims Act. They also invoked the protection of the 
Constitution's 11th Amendment, which the court has interpreted to 
generally bar states from being sued by individuals in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In three decisions earlier this week, the court extended the  
``sovereign immunity'' states enjoy against lawsuits by businesses

states' power in relation to the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Play Exhibition After All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles will play their scheduled  
exhibition game against Triple-A Rochester on Monday, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The players thought the game was canceled because they gave up  
an off day on May 3 to play Cuba. But the Orioles announced 
Thursday that Baltimore and its Triple-A farm team will play a 
seven-inning exhibition at Frontier Field in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to be able to put this misunderstanding  
behind us, and we are excited about our traditional visit to 
Rochester,'' general manager Frank Wren said. ``When we met with 
our players to discuss the issue, the concern was with the fact 
that the only people who would be hurt by this are the fans of 
Rochester. As a result, we were able to come to a quick 
resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle put up a sign next to his locker this week seeking  
names on a petition to boycott the game. Wren said Belle and the 
rest of the 25-man roster will make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing the game because it's on the schedule. The  
players were under the impression the game was going to be 
scrapped, but it seems that there was a misunderstanding somewhere 
down the line,'' outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with the people of Rochester. It's giving  
up another off day when we already gave up one,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Off days are a rarity for major leaguers, who play 162 games  
over 183 days. The Orioles had only three scheduled in May and just 
four in June, and will end up losing two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any major league team in the world that  
wants to play exhibition games,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``It's a 
pretty brutal schedule, but these guys have been great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing seven innings was a compromise, but a wise decision for  
everyone involved, Surhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make any sense to play nine. By the seventh inning  
most of the starters are out of the game anyway,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren said the Orioles will not play any in-season exhibition  
games next year.

<HEADLINE> Stojko To Try for Fourth World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Elvis Stojko, saying he has yet to reach his  
potential, will try for a fourth world figure skating championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep pushing myself as an athlete,'' Stojko said  
Thursday in announcing his rejection of offers to turn pro and his 
intention to continue on the top Olympic-eligible International 
Skating Union scene. ``I still believe I have a lot more to give on 
the amateur circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that in that realm it's much easier for me to push  
the envelope and show what I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko, 27, said that watching teens win the last two world  
titles hasn't discouraged him. Age is not a factor, he said. He can 
still be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Canadian champion won the world title in 1994,  
1995 and 1997, and Olympic silver in 1994 and 1998. He was fourth 
at the 1999 worlds, while struggling through that season 
recuperating from the groin and abdominal injuries that ruined his 
bid for Olympic gold at Nagano. He did not want to go out on that 
note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last number of years, it's been difficult with the  
injuries,'' he said. ``I didn't feel I was given a fair shot for 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're trying to deal with something during the season,  
you're not going full out. Now that I'm healed and 100 percent, 
I've got a clean slate and a good shot at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he still be around in 2002 to try again for the elusive  
Olympic gold medal? 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe,'' he replied. ``I still want to take it year by year. I  
don't know if I'll be around for 2002, but it'd be kind of a nice 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first competition will be Skate America in Colorado Springs,  
Colo., Oct. 28-31. Stojko will also compete in the Skate Canada 
meet in Saint John, New Brunswick on Nov. 4-7, and in the Canadian 
championships in Calgary on Jan. 26-30, which will be the qualifier 
for the Four Continents meet in Osaka, Japan, and the world 
championships in Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to feel what it's like to land harder jumps, to feel  
what it's like to be effortlessly skating, to feel what it's like 
to have that mastered and put it down at a world championship when 
every eye is watching you across the planet,'' Stojko said. 
``That's a thrill to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I don't want to give up yet.''

<HEADLINE> Wells Fargo To Build Talking ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Blind bank customers in California may no  
longer have to feel their way through ATM transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., threatened with a class-action lawsuit,  
agreed Wednesday to be the first bank in the nation to install 
talking ATM machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the technology is still being developed, the machines  
will eventually be at all Wells Fargo branches in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The company promised to have 20 machines in place in Los  
Angeles, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area within the next 
year, and 100 installed by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo has spent more than four years negotiating with the  
California Council of the Blind and the Disability Rights Education 
and Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal  
access to public facilities, would have likely been the basis of a 
lawsuit against the bank, said Elaine Feingold, a lawyer with the 
Council of the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most ATMs already provide instructions for the blind in  
Braille, only 10 percent of the blind actually know the written 
language of raised dots, the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	And even Braille cannot reproduce important information such as  
an account's balance, which appears on the ATM's electronic screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The voice ATMs will recite the information, with headphones  
offered for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo spokesman Larry Haeg said installing the talking  
machines is just another way the bank can take care of its 
customers. He did not know how many current Wells Fargo customers 
are blind.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Gets Penicillin Relic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A mold that produced the first penicillin,  
grandfather of all antibiotics, has been acquired by the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The mold is a round, gray, flat, fuzzy-looking substance about  
an inch and a half wide, encased in glass. Next to it is a 
facsimile of the reverse side, showing the handwritten inscription: 
``The mould that makes Penicillin. Alexander Fleming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming, a Scot, developed penicillin in 1928. He had been  
working on the possibility of an agent to kill bacteria, but 
succeeded by accident. A culture of bacteria left unprotected was 
contaminated by a mold -- a fungus from the air. 
</P>
<P>
	He noticed that bacteria were killed in an area around the  
fungus. He managed to grow the fungus in a broth, but had trouble 
extracting the substance that killed the bacteria. Other 
researchers made progress in the 1930s, but they could only produce 
tiny quanitities. 
</P>
<P>
	The first patient to be treated with penicillin -- a British  
policeman suffering from blood poisoning in 1941 -- died because the 
dose was too small. Not all the bacteria were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pressures of World War II, an American pharmaceutical  
firm found a way to mass produce it in 1944. Penicillin and its 
successors have saved millions of lives, but scientists worry that 
bacteria are developing ways to resist antibiotics faster than new 
ones can be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc., the original mass producers, bought one of the two  
slides that Fleming gave his laboratory assistant, paying $35,160 
at a London auction in 1996. The company lent it to a Smithsonian 
traveling exposition, ``Microbes: Invisible Invaders, Amazing 
Allies,'' now on show in Washington at the International Gallery of 
the Smithsonian. Sotheby's auction house authenticated the 
inscription as Fleming's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer's board formally made a gift of the slide to the  
Smithsonian on Thursday. After the exhibit closes here Sept. 6, it 
will travel to the Chicago Academy of Sciences and at least nine 
other American cities through Jan. 5, 2003, before going into the 
National Museum of American History.

<HEADLINE>  Plane Makes Landing in L.A. Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The damage included a shattered plane,  
spilled fuel and two school buses with smashed front ends. It could 
have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary school students and the plane's pilot were unhurt  
Wednesday when the small plane crash-landed at a busy intersection, 
ripping away its fuel tanks as it barreled between the approaching 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 14 years on this job I have never seen a miraculous  
incident like this. There must have been divine intervention,'' 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. ``It was 
like passing through the eye of the needle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 2:45 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled for 1,500 
feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was uninjured, and more than 40 children emerged  
unscathed from the buses to sit on the curb and sip soft drinks 
before they were taken away to wait for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the plane wasn't going to hit us, but it hit us,''  
said Sasha Medina, a 10-year-old girl on the bus. ``I was like 
scared ... because I thought some of us were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student was treated at a hospital for a possible head  
injury, then released, and one bus driver was hospitalized in fair 
condition with back and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses carried 42 students from Parthenia Street Elementary  
School and six from Lassen Elementary School, said Socorro Serrano, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was alone in the plane, was questioned by  
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
National Transportation Safety Board. Authorities said he works for 
Sunshine Airlines, a Van Nuys charter firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time, with some  
children looking dazed and others among the mostly 6- to-10 year 
olds skipping and hopping. 
</P>
<P>
	They were later taken to their schools to be reunited with their  
parents. One unfazed child checked in via television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say `Mom, I love you,''' 9-year-old Luigi Escobar  
said. ``And I think you better come pick me up.''

<HEADLINE>  Penguins To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux saved the Pittsburgh Penguins  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux was approved Thursday by a federal bankruptcy judge as  
the team's new owner, breaking ground as the first 
player-turned-owner in major pro sports and preventing the Penguins 
from leaving Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a rookie again,'' said Lemieux, a Hall of Fame  
player who revived what once was hockey's worst team as a player 
from 1984-97. ``It's been a long road and it's finally great to get 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz had two choices: the  
Lemieux plan, which keeps the Penguins in Pittsburgh and preserves 
Lemieux's financial stake in the team, or an alternative NHL plan 
that would have moved the team, probably to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL supported Lemieux and offered its plan only as an  
alternative if there was no hope of keeping the bankrupt Penguins 
in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in it to make money, but I'm not in it to lose  
money,'' said Lemieux, a six-time scoring champion. ``We want to 
make sure the Penguins stay here. They've been a big part of my 
life and my success. ... I wanted to do it to repay the Penguins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan was approved after a 6 1/2-hour hearing in which the  
only objections were offered by SMG, which manages the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and Lemieux negotiated without success on a new lease until  
midnight, only nine hours before the hearing began in a courtroom 
packed with lawyers, city officials and fans who were disappointed 
Lemieux wasn't in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz all but ordered the sides to continue negotiations  
after lawyer Saul Burian argued SMG's case for hours, calling 
numerous witnesses and, at times, taxing the judge's patience. 
</P>
<P>
	During several testy exchanges, Markovitz ordered Burian to  
refer to him as ``sir'' and made several references to the absence 
of SMG's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
	When Burian suggested the NHL plan was the only alternative to  
Lemieux's, Markovitz said, ``There is little chance that plan will 
be confirmed, and if your client were here, maybe he would be 
getting that drift. ... I wonder what's going on with your client? 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it your client really wants? Do you want this  
franchise terminated? Does your client want this team to leave this 
city?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burian, in turn, threatened to drag Lemieux into lengthy  
litigation if the judge effectively rejected SMG as the arena 
manager and allowed the Penguins to operate the arena. The judge 
previously tossed out the Penguins' old money-draining lease, which 
cost the team an estimated $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their plan says they will take control of the building and  
evict us,'' Burian said. ``You'll be dispossessed and you will lose 
all rights and then we will litigate with you. This will lead to 
litigation and litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, aware that his strong talk might anger Penguins fans and  
that SMG's tough stance was threatening its ability to operate 
effectively in the city, Burian said, ``SMG is not the Darth Vader 
of Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz set July 16 as the confirmation date and suggested the  
sides work out a lease by then. Several lawyers involved in the 
case suggested an agreement might come within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still want to talk to them but, if not, we'll let the court  
decide their fate,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux suggested he won't be the last player to become an  
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more players are going to get involved,'' he  
said. ``(John) Elway maybe with the Los Angeles (expansion) group, 
Michael Jordan had a chance to buy into a team. I'm sure Wayne 
Gretzky will get involved with a franchise. The way players are 
making a lot of money, I'm sure more of them will be buying into 
franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan converts $20 million of the $32.5 million the  
team owed him in deferred compensation. He will get a $5 million 
payment from former co-owner Roger Marino, who has joined his 
group, and forgive the other $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also has raised $50 million in cash to operate the team  
and satisfy some debts. All but $12 million already is in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also will pay $9 million a year for TV  
rights, with annual increases of 5 percent, and will post the 
Penguins' $10 million line of credit with the NHL. Fox Sports and 
SMG formerly were partners in an alternative reorganization plan, 
but Fox dropped out after negotiating the new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will be the managing director, overseeing the franchise  
and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors but leaving day-to-day 
operations to management. He is expected to retain highly regarded 
general manager Craig Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine and will 
hire a chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also will push efforts for a new arena to replace the  
38-year-old Civic Arena, the NHL's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to model ourselves after the best franchises in  
the NHL, like the Canadiens,'' Lemieux said. ``I think we're only 
3-4 players away from contending for the Stanley Cup again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux saga began in October, when the Penguins became the  
first franchise in a quarter-century in any of the four major 
American pro sports leagues to file for federal bankruptcy 
protection. They also were the last team do so, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' financial problems began not long after former  
Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991. 
Short of cash, Baldwin relied upon a $24 million payment from the 
arena's management company, then known as Spectacor and now called 
SMG, to complete the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that $24 million payment, which was renegotiated four  
times, that ultimately help plunge the Penguins into bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA To Cut up to 1,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The personal computer retailer CompUSA Inc. plans  
to cut 1,000 to 1,500 jobs, or up to 7 percent its work force, as 
part of an overhaul designed to boost profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA, which operates 211 stores in 79 cities, also said in  
announcing its plans today that it will close four stores soon and 
was considering closing as many as 10 others. It currently employs 
about 21,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves result from an evaluation of its business and will  
result in ``fundamentally redefining CompUSA's entire business 
concept,'' said James F. Halpin, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, the company hopes, will reduce its dependence on  
low-margin personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced plans to offer in-store centers where  
customers can choose specific build-to-order products. In addition, 
it will focus on promoting the sales of hand-held technology such 
as personal digital assistants and console-based computer 
entertainment games from Sony, Nintendo and Sega. 
</P>
<P>
	The stores will also delve into selling equipment and software  
for other entertainment formats, like DVD movies, MP3 Internet 
music distribution technology, as well as digital cameras and 
camcorders. 
</P>
<P>
	In its direct sales to business, government and educational  
customers, CompUSA plans to consolidate distribution and 
fulfillment at one site. Currently, it ships from stores and a 
distribution center in Grapevine, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The company estimated it will have onetime charges of $40  
million to $50 million as a result of these initiatives. It expects 
to record the charge in the fourth quarter ending June 26 and the 
first two quarters of fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> More Charges in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man already accused of selling a handgun  
that two teen-agers used in the Columbine High School massacre has 
been charged with possession of a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, sat quietly Wednesday as Jefferson County  
prosecutors laid out the second charge against him. Manes 
previously was charged with selling a TEC-DC9 9mm pistol that Eric 
Harris and Dylan Klebold used in the April 20 rampage. Harris and 
Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest charge is a felony that carries up to three years in  
prison upon conviction. The TEC-9 charge carries a sentence of up 
to six years, but could go as high as 12 years if a judge finds 
extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Bob Ransome said Manes is being made a scapegoat.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Steve Jensen said his office intends to hold Manes  
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making an example of people will hopefully prevent other  
wrongdoing,'' he said. ``If he claims we're making an example of 
him, I guess I plead guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Court Judge Francis Jackson ordered Manes to return to  
court Aug. 18 to enter a plea. He remains free on $15,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> Do Knicks Still Believe? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A three-story tall tapestry hangs at the  
entrance of Madison Square Garden. It reads: ``I Still Believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the arena, the big question Thursday was whether the New  
York Knicks still do. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing the San Antonio Spurs 3-1 in the best-of-7 NBA Finals,  
a deficit that no team has overcome in the championship round, the 
Knicks have to decide whether they truly think they have a shot at 
beating the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 5 is Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we can win the series,'' said coach Jeff Van  
Gundy, who has always remained a true believer. ``I told them 
they're only bound by what they think they can accomplish. If they 
believe that since no team has ever done this then it can't be 
done, then that will be reflected in our play tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as I told them, no eighth seed has ever made it here,  
either, so history doesn't have to hamper us. All we have to do is 
win one home game. Then we can go down there and get one road game. 
And then you're playing the ultimate game. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy admitted he made it sound easier than it is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, things don't look promising for a New York team that  
continues to fight injuries and continues to play some of its worst 
ball at the worst time -- the end of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks couldn't mount a final comeback in Games 1 and 2 in  
San Antonio, nor could they do so in Game 4 on Wednesday night, 
when the Spurs closed so strongly that the crowd started streaming 
toward the exits with a minute left on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not believe, but the players say they still do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're better than us. I doubt that  
seriously,'' Marcus Camby said. ``They won two at home and one of 
two here, but I think we're better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas also remains a believer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say that we're better, but we know we can beat  
this team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victory would allow the Spurs to finish 15-2 and tie the  
1989 Detroit Pistons and 1991 Chicago Bulls for the second-best 
postseaon record in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victory also would send the city of San Antonio into an  
all-night celebration, lead to a victory parade, championship 
rings, endorsement opportunities -- all the spoils of success that 
the Spurs were trying to keep out of their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that you fight. You kind of dream about it. You  
sit in your room and things go through your mind and you fight 
it,'' Avery Johnson said. ``You're not afraid, but you just have a 
little fear of your attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs might be fighting those thoughts, but they weren't  
doing so in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Daniels was wondering aloud what it would be like to be  
in a victory parade, while Jaren Jackson was looking forward to 
showing up at Georgetown this summer for pickup games involving the 
ringless Hoya masses -- Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Dikembe 
Mutombo, David Wingate, Othella Harrington, Jerome Williams, Allen 
Iverson -- and showing off his new jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to initiate  
anything. Let them start, then I'll open my mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have won all their playoff games this postseason when  
their opponent faced elimination, doing so each time on the road -- 
in Minnesota in the first round, at the Los Angeles Forum in the 
second, at Portland's Rose Garden in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have faced elimination only once, in Game 5 at Miami  
during the first round. They won that game on Allan Houston's 
jumper with less than a second left. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd have to be an idiot not to want to close it out on  
Friday,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``But we also know that 
if we think in terms that it's already done, we'll be in big 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't done a damn thing until you win number four. If  
you don't keep that attitude, you'll be playing a Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, the Spurs will be expected to try to duplicate the  
effort they got in Game 4 from everybody, not just Tim Duncan and 
David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	All five starters scored in double figures, the defense was  
dominant and the Spurs won the rebounding battle for the first time 
in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will again look to get the bulk of their scoring from  
Houston and Latrell Sprewell, but Larry Johnson and Camby also will 
have to contribute, and Charlie Ward will have to cut down on his 
mistakes. The Knicks are uncertain how much of a contribution 
they'll get from backup point guard Chris Childs, limited to 7 
minutes in Game 4 by a knee sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	They can say they're confident, but the Knicks won't know for  
sure until the ball goes up whether they have the resolve to -- as 
the sign outside says -- still believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we capable of winning one game? The answer is a resounding  
yes,'' Van Gundy said. ``The biggest question is do we honestly in 
our hearts want to go back to San Antonio?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 5 will provide the answer.

<HEADLINE> La. Voting-Rights Case Carried Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Thursday it will carry  
over its study of a potentially important Louisiana voting-rights 
case to its 1999-2000 term, which begins next October. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move it last made in 1991, the court ordered lawyers for  
both sides to reargue the case, probably sometime next fall or 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, who heard arguments in April but left the case  
undecided before ending the court's 1998-99 term Wednesday, spelled 
out in a brief order Thursday which specific points of law the 
lawyers should address. The order did not significantly change the 
case's focus. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is how vigorously the federal government can protect  
minorities from election-system changes that might impede their 
voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana dispute is over how the Bossier Parish school  
board's 12 members are elected. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, those members have been elected to four-year terms  
from 12 different districts. About 20 percent of the parish's 
population is black, concentrated in two areas, but none of the 12 
districts has a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1990, no black ever had been elected to the school board.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board  
election map, the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two 
black-majority districts. The school board opted instead for a new 
map in 1992 with no such district, the same map that had been 
adopted by the parish's chief governing body, called the police 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the police jury's plan had received Justice  
Department approval required by the 1965 law, the school board's 
proposed redistricting plan did not. Government lawyers decided the 
plan would dilute minority voting strength because it would not 
maximize it as would a plan containing two black-majority 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government  
to veto proposed changes if they are deemed to have a 
discriminatory ``purpose or effect.'' The act's Section 2 is more 
stringent, and prohibits any voting practice that would dilute 
minority voters' clout. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts,  
two black candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 
1994 and were re-elected in 1998, along with a third black 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Reno vs. Bossier Parish School Board, 98-405.

<HEADLINE>  Penguins To Stay in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux saved the Pittsburgh Penguins  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux was approved Thursday by a federal bankruptcy judge as  
the team's new owner, breaking ground as the first 
player-turned-owner in major pro sports and preventing the Penguins 
from leaving Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a rookie again,'' said Lemieux, a Hall of Fame  
player who revived what once was hockey's worst team as a player 
from 1984-97. ``It's been a long road and it's finally great to get 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz had two choices: the  
Lemieux plan, which keeps the Penguins in Pittsburgh and preserves 
Lemieux's financial stake in the team, or an alternative NHL plan 
that would have moved the team, probably to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL supported Lemieux and offered its plan only as an  
alternative if there was no hope of keeping the bankrupt Penguins 
in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in it to make money, but I'm not in it to lose  
money,'' said Lemieux, a six-time scoring champion. ``We want to 
make sure the Penguins stay here. They've been a big part of my 
life and my success. ... I wanted to do it to repay the Penguins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan was approved after a 6 1/2-hour hearing in which the  
only objections were offered by SMG, which manages the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and Lemieux negotiated without success on a new lease until  
midnight, only nine hours before the hearing began in a courtroom 
packed with lawyers, city officials and fans who were disappointed 
Lemieux wasn't in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz all but ordered the sides to continue negotiations  
after lawyer Saul Burian argued SMG's case for hours, calling 
numerous witnesses and, at times, taxing the judge's patience. 
</P>
<P>
	During several testy exchanges, Markovitz ordered Burian to  
refer to him as ``sir'' and made several references to the absence 
of SMG's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
	When Burian suggested the NHL plan was the only alternative to  
Lemieux's, Markovitz said, ``There is little chance that plan will 
be confirmed, and if your client were here, maybe he would be 
getting that drift. ... I wonder what's going on with your client? 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it your client really wants? Do you want this  
franchise terminated? Does your client want this team to leave this 
city?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burian, in turn, threatened to drag Lemieux into lengthy  
litigation if the judge effectively rejected SMG as the arena 
manager and allowed the Penguins to operate the arena. The judge 
previously tossed out the Penguins' old money-draining lease, which 
cost the team an estimated $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their plan says they will take control of the building and  
evict us,'' Burian said. ``You'll be dispossessed and you will lose 
all rights and then we will litigate with you. This will lead to 
litigation and litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, aware that his strong talk might anger Penguins fans and  
that SMG's tough stance was threatening its ability to operate 
effectively in the city, Burian said, ``SMG is not the Darth Vader 
of Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz set July 16 as the confirmation date and suggested the  
sides work out a lease by then. Several lawyers involved in the 
case suggested an agreement might come within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still want to talk to them but, if not, we'll let the court  
decide their fate,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux suggested he won't be the last player to become an  
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more players are going to get involved,'' he  
said. ``(John) Elway maybe with the Los Angeles (expansion) group, 
Michael Jordan had a chance to buy into a team. I'm sure Wayne 
Gretzky will get involved with a franchise. The way players are 
making a lot of money, I'm sure more of them will be buying into 
franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan converts $20 million of the $32.5 million the  
team owed him in deferred compensation. He will get a $5 million 
payment from former co-owner Roger Marino, who has joined his 
group, and forgive the other $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also has raised $50 million in cash to operate the team  
and satisfy some debts. All but $12 million already is in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh also will pay $9 million a year for TV  
rights, with annual increases of 5 percent, and will post the 
Penguins' $10 million line of credit with the NHL. Fox Sports and 
SMG formerly were partners in an alternative reorganization plan, 
but Fox dropped out after negotiating the new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will be the managing director, overseeing the franchise  
and sitting on the NHL Board of Governors but leaving day-to-day 
operations to management. He is expected to retain highly regarded 
general manager Craig Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine and will 
hire a chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also will push efforts for a new arena to replace the  
38-year-old Civic Arena, the NHL's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to model ourselves after the best franchises in  
the NHL, like the Canadiens,'' Lemieux said. ``I think we're only 
3-4 players away from contending for the Stanley Cup again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux saga began in October, when the Penguins became the  
first franchise in a quarter-century in any of the four major 
American pro sports leagues to file for federal bankruptcy 
protection. They also were the last team do so, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' financial problems began not long after former  
Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991. 
Short of cash, Baldwin relied upon a $24 million payment from the 
arena's management company, then known as Spectacor and now called 
SMG, to complete the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that $24 million payment, which was renegotiated four  
times, that ultimately help plunge the Penguins into bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE>  Astros Manager Recovers at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker's recollection of his last trip to  
the Astrodome is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dierker's trademark Hawaiian shirt offered a clue Wednesday  
of the mental state that doctors want the Houston Astros manager to 
have for the next few months following brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be quiet for a few weeks and not do very much,''  
Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	He donned a baseball cap to cover his shaved head as he checked  
out of Methodist Hospital, eight days after undergoing the 
operation a day after suffering a grand mal seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, and I'm going to be fine,'' said Dierker, smiling  
and joking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, 52, is forbidden from driving for six months and must  
take anticonvulsant medication indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon who performed the operation to remove a tangled mass  
of blood vessels from the front of Dierker's brain said he expected 
the manager to make a full recovery and return to the dugout after 
next month's All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming along fine, but at this point it's hard to say how  
much more time he's going to need,'' Dr. Rob Parrish said. ``He's 
going to continue the medication, and we'll continue to evaluate 
how he responds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout June 13 with the grand mal  
seizure. He underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery June 15 to remove the 
tangled vessels that caused the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I don't know what happened'' at the game,  
Dierker said. ``I heard a lot of people talking, but I don't 
remember much more than that. It was all like a blur. From the time 
I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I have felt lucid and I 
have had my coordination and balance. I have been very much amazed 
at that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how it could have been a lot worse, so I feel very  
fortunate that the malformation wasn't in an area that was as 
complex as it could have been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker suffered from arteriovenous malformation, a condition in  
which people are born with malformed, sometimes tangled, arteries 
or veins in the brain. Over time, the vessels can dilate, 
pressuring tissue or even bursting and bleeding into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After the surgery, an angiogram showed Dierker no longer had any  
of the clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill this  
season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of 
an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker said he continued to keep track of the game through his  
ordeal and now will convalesce at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had the problem of getting emotionally stressed  
watching on television as I have sitting in the dugout,'' he said, 
joined by his wife Judy and Parrish at a news conference. ``I 
haven't had a problem relinquishing control or power; it's probably 
a function of my managerial style.''

<HEADLINE> Fewer People Watching NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fewer people are watching the NBA Finals this year and it's not  
just because Michael Jordan is gone. Some games have been too 
painful to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Jordan's retirement may be the major reason that this  
year's audience has plummeted from 1998's record-setting TV 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the play these days isn't at the same level it was a decade  
or so ago with Larry and Magic. To call today's games ``sloppy'' 
would be a major understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of scoring and ugly play prompted NBA commissioner  
David Stern to assemble a 16-member committee to draft 
recommendations for making the game more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those on the task force is NBC analyst Doug Collins, a  
former NBA player and coach. His recommendation is simple: Stop the 
NBA from becoming the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
	The league needs less wrestling, holding and pushing -- and more  
passing, cutting and team play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has gotten too rough and it's been a gradual erosion,  
not something that happened overnight,'' Collins said Wednesday, a 
day after the committee met in New York. ``There's been more 
clutching and grabbing, and strength has eroded skill. ... The game 
has become stagnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner analyst Hubie Brown, another committee member, said the  
overly physical play was first on the agenda. But he doesn't 
believe that you can pinpoint the drop in viewers to Jordan or the 
rough play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the people just don't like the two teams in the  
finals,'' he said. ``Everybody's all bent out of shape, but our TV 
ratings were up this year and NBC's were close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, but those numbers came during a 50-game abbreviated  
regular season, where each game had added meaning. And there were 
more teams in the playoff hunt down the stretch, which translated 
to more fan interest throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs were always when Jordan excelled -- not just on the  
court, but in luring viewers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 NBA Finals recorded an all-time high 18.7 series  
rating. This year's four-game average is an 11.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings for all four games in the finals have been  
considerably lower than last year. Game 1 fell 35 percent, Game 2 
had a 42 percent drop, Game 3 slipped 25 percent and Wednesday 
night's game sank 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs just don't have the same  
appeal as Jordan and the Bulls. Even having the Knicks in the 
finals to draw the massive New York market is overrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key subtraction is Jordan,'' said Turner's Marv Albert.  
``Once you're in the playoffs, you're attracting the more casual 
fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Jordan did that better than anyone. Through the first three  
games, the New York market attracted 1.4 million viewers while 1.44 
million viewers watched in the Chicago market last year.

	 *EQUALITY:* John McEnroe has changed his mind. Now he's all for  
women and men receiving equal prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the U.S. Open is the only major tennis tournament  
that gives women the same prize money as the men. At the Australian 
Open, women get 94 percent, and at the French Open, it's 90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But McEnroe said it's just a matter of time before the women are  
given the same amount in the other three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old argument is that we play five sets and they play  
three, but the bottom line is no one cares,'' said McEnroe, an 
analyst for NBC's Wimbledon coverage, which begins Saturday. ``The 
men should accept the deal before women start making more money 
than the men. Within the next six months or so, you're going to see 
it (equal money) happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Evert disagrees about the timing, mainly because Europe is  
much further behind the United States in women's equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is lagging behind,'' she said. ``They pay women 79  
percent of what men make now. We haven't made any strides in the 
last five or six years.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Assembling Sweeping Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in Congress are assembling a  
sweeping tax cut plan likely to include trimming top capital gains 
tax rates to 10 percent, fixing the ``marriage penalty'' that 
affects millions of two-income couples and abolishing inheritance 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The $778 billion, 10-year plan to be unveiled in July is  
intended to energize the GOP's social conservative and business 
supporters. It also will force Democrats to decide between tax 
relief's appeal and President Clinton's priorities of Social 
Security, Medicare and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying too much in taxes, and, as history has  
shown, any taxpayer money left in Washington will surely be 
spent,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic tax-cutting sentiment is particularly strong in the  
Senate, where as many as eight of the 45 Democrats are either 
co-sponsoring major tax relief bills or have expressed a desire to 
return some of the projected $2.6 trillion budget surplus to 
taxpayers over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to save Social Security this year. Having done that,  
we still have money to be able to cut Americans' taxes,'' said Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``I favor tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans largely agree on several major items,  
although Archer will not finalize his bill until mid-July. But 
these cuts are among those with strong support: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reducing the top capital gains tax rate on longer-term  
investments such as stocks, possibly from 20 percent to 10 percent. 
Cost: $143 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easing the ``marriage penalty'' by adjusting income brackets so  
that a greater share of a married couple's income would be subject 
to the lower 28 percent tax rate and giving married couples a 
higher standard deduction. Combined cost: $187 billion over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gradually eliminating the estate or ``death'' tax over the next  
decade. Cost: $198 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abolishing the alternative minimum tax, or at least ensuring it  
does not strike middle-class people instead of the wealthy as 
originally intended. Abolition cost: $133 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising IRA contribution limits from $2,000 to $5,000 a year.  
Total cost: $50 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Extending the research and development tax credit, a big  
priority for high-tech industries, and other expiring business 
credits for at least five more years. Cost: $12 billion over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	These proposals were included in a bill introduced Thursday by  
House GOP conservatives, whose plan is strongly backed by 
pro-business organizations and groups such as the Christian 
Coalition and the Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cut is the most important issue for us,'' said the  
group's leader, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``We haven't defined 
what the difference is between a Republican Congress and Bill 
Clinton. Cutting taxes really defines the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they search for issues in their bid to wrest House control  
from the GOP in the 2000 elections, most House Democrats are united 
behind Clinton's pledge to use the budget surplus for popular 
government programs and not tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't want to do ... is put a huge tax bill out there  
that robs and takes money from Social Security and Medicare and 
education and other priorities,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, director of Clinton's National Economic Council,  
said the White House also believes it unwise to use projected 
future surpluses for ``exploding or irresponsible tax cuts'' that 
could trigger a new federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any of the projections are wrong, these are large and  
unsustainable amounts,'' and the budget could be back in deficit, 
Sperling said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is less Democratic unity in the Senate, where the  
party is thrashing out whether to support tax cuts. Senate Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., says he wants a bipartisan 
bill, but so far Democrats cannot agree on an approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said that ``all of a sudden''  
many Democrats seem to fear the political power of a Republican tax 
relief plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bidding war is starting to take place. If we can't hold  
ourselves in check -- that's what I fear,'' he said. '' 
</P>
<P>
	As Rockefeller spoke to reporters this week following a  
closed-door meeting of Democratic Finance Committee members, fellow 
Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana walked by chanting ``Tax cuts. 
Tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is urging that GOP  
senators back a bold tax cut, including a capital gains reduction, 
and said the goal for both ends of the Capitol is to finish a 
compromise measure and send it to Clinton by the first week in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Clinton vetoes such a bill, Republicans would have  
their political issue and Democrats could claim they were 
protecting Social Security, Medicare and education. Then the two 
sides would likely be left this fall with only the expiring 
business tax credits, which are extended every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inaction may not be a bad thing: the Internal Revenue Service  
has warned Congress that it cannot handle many more tax changes 
following the 6,493 enacted since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Arco, BP Amoco Defend Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two corporations planning a merger that would  
create the world's second-largest oil company spent hours Thursday 
trying to assure senators the deal would benefit consumers and 
encourage competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield Co. Chairman Mike Bowlin told a Senate  
committee that the $25.6 billion stock deal that that would marry 
his company with BP Amoco would create a company that would invest 
in the latest and best technology and use it to develop new energy 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after hearing from Bowlin and Richard Olver, a BP Amoco  
group managing director, however, members of the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee questioned them closely on whether the 
merger would reduce competition and increase prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he didn't  
oppose the deal, but would look it over carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of his state are particularly concerned, he said,  
because the combined company would control 70 percent of oil and 
gas production from Alaska's North Slope and 72 percent of the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our obligation to future Alaskans is to ensure that this  
consolidation does not stifle competition for Alaskan oil and gas 
resources,'' he said. Under the deal, ``BP will become the largest 
non-governmental oil producer in the world. It will produce close 
to 20 percent of U.S. domestic crude oil and control 18.4 percent 
of West Coast gasoline markets and 14.2 percent of East Coast 
markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivalry between Arco and BP Amoco has been an important  
part of the competition that has served Alaska and the country 
well,'' Drue Pearce, president of the Alaska Senate, told the 
committee. ``With that rivalry possibly coming to an end, 
competition at virtually every phase is threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect the merger to save them about $1 billion a  
year. When it was announced April 1, it was the eighth proposed 
merger of the previous past six months in an industry shaken by 
more than a year of plummeting oil prices and increasing demands 
for cleaner fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger between Exxon and Mobil, which would create  
the world's largest oil company, is awaiting regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield and BP Amoco say about the expect to  
eliminate about 2,000 jobs from a combined work force of 115,000, 
mainly in the United States outside Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, the state of Alaska and several  
other states are analyzing the deal's possible impact. 
</P>
<P>
	One committee member said he remained skeptical. ``All the signs  
are very, very ominous,'' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said.

<HEADLINE> Asthma Inhalants Don't Help Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Smokers who suffer from lung disease can't count on treatments  
typically used on asthma patients to relieve their suffering, a new 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors had hypothesized that inhaled steroids prescribed for  
asthma patients might help smokers because both groups suffer 
shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	However, two studies in today's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine found steroids to be of little help for 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking causes about 85 percent of all cases of chronic  
obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a combination of chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema. Nearly 16 million Americans suffer from 
the disease, according to the American Lung Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that  
more than 106,000 people died of the illness in 1996, making it the 
fourth leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy of all of this is this is almost a wholly  
preventable disease. The real message is that people should not 
smoke,'' said Dr. Dennis E. Niewoehner of the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the studies, conducted by Niewoehner and colleagues at  
25 VA medical centers, 80 patients were given an inhaled steroid 
for eight weeks, 80 received steroids for two weeks and 111 
received a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	In both groups that received treatment, the steroids were  
associated with shorter hospital stays and easier breathing at the 
beginning, but the benefits were no longer evident after six 
months, and the eight-week treatment was found to be no more 
effective than two weeks of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, compared with patients who got a placebo, those who  
were treated with steroids were more likely to require treatment 
for hyperglycemia, an abnormally high level of sugar in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other study, led by Dr. Romain A. Pauwels of University  
Hospital in Ghent, Belgium, an inhaled steroid was tested on 
patients who refused to stop smoking and suffered from a milder 
form of lung disease. The medicine was found to produce a one-time 
improvement in lung function, but it had no appreciable effect over 
the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial, Dr. Homer A. Boushey of the University of  
California at San Francisco said the studies prove that 
inflammation in the airways in asthma patients is markedly 
different from that suffered by smokers.

<HEADLINE> Soft Fat-Hard Fat Choice Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When scanning the supermarket shelves for a bread spread, it's  
healthier to pick a soft, creamy product over a more solid item 
shaped like a stick, scientists conclude in a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine, looked at how harder, processed fats -- such as 
stick margarine, butter and lard -- affect cholesterol levels when 
compared with softer products like tub margarine and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The harder products were found to have more of what are called  
trans fatty acids, which raise cholesterol and the risk of heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it matter which fat you use? The bottom line is, yes, it  
matters a lot,'' said Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, who led the study 
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Nutrition Center at Tufts 
University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichtenstein said patients with moderately high cholesterol  
should cut out stick margarine. She added that people would be 
better off without butter as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to watch both. Because butter is very low in trans  
fatty acids does not mean that people should choose butter, because 
it is so high in saturated fat,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trans fatty acids are created during a production process called  
hydrogenation, which transforms vegetable oil into a more solid 
substance so that it will resist spoiling. Usually, foods list 
``partially hydrogenated'' oil on the label. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 18 women and 18 men over 50 were each fed one of  
six diets for five weeks. Each diet provided 30 percent of calories 
from fat. Participants were given either soybean oil, semiliquid 
margarine, soft margarine, shortening, stick margarine or butter. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants eventually were fed all six diets, and the  
researchers measured the effects on their cholesterol levels after 
each five-week period. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers checked the participants' levels of two opposing  
cholesterol forces in the bloodstream: LDL, or bad, cholesterol, 
which can clog arteries, and HDL, or good, cholesterol, which 
protects against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean oil reduced levels of LDL cholesterol by an average of  
12 percent compared to the butter diet. Semiliquid margarine 
lowered the levels 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft margarine dropped the LDL level an average 9 percent, and  
for shortening, the level fell 7 percent. Stick margarine reduced 
the LDL cholesterol only 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, the softer fats were associated with smaller  
reductions in HDL cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	In another journal article, Dr. Walter C. Willett of the Harvard  
School of Public Health and Dr. Ronald M. Krauss of the American 
Heart Association said the Food and Drug Administration should 
require trans fatty acids to be labeled on products. 
</P>
<P>
	Willett also said the FDA should require fast food restaurants  
to label menu items because fried fast foods and commercially baked 
goods often contain trans fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trans fat is the largest amount of artificial chemical in our  
food supply,'' Willett said. ``I think a lot of parents are 
concerned about their kids' health, and they should have the 
information that their kids are eating a type of fat that can be 
extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Margarine Manufacturers criticized  
the research, saying that the full-fat stick margarine used in the 
study is not representative of the products now found in most 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have come up with products significantly lower in  
total fat, saturated fat and trans fatty acids, the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAMM President Richard Cristol said the industry would not  
oppose mandatory labeling of trans fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would welcome the opportunity to use the package label to  
show consumers how we are meeting their demands for healthy, 
good-tasting and convenient margarine products,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fight Gay Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican lawmakers from New  
England revived efforts Thursday to pass a federal law prohibiting 
job discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost the measure's chance of passage, lawmakers have  
rewritten it to explicitly prohibit preferential treatment of 
homosexuals, such as hiring to meet quotas or designing affirmative 
action standards to make up for past discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as  
ENDA, have successfully fought it in three previous Congresses on 
the grounds that it would extend special protections to 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``ENDA will achieve equal rights -- not special rights -- for gays  
and lesbians,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who plans to pass 
the bill out of his Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee 
and then try to force consideration by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Senate defeated a similar bill by one vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Los Angeles at a gay and  
lesbian center, voiced support for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not confer any special rights, but it does outlaw the  
kind of discrimination that has become all too common in our 
society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was introduced by Jeffords and Sens. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and in the House by Reps. 
Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Christopher Shays, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're able to get it out of the Senate, that would create  
tremendous pressure on the House,'' said Shays, an influential 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and other ENDA supporters argue that the bill would pass  
the House -- if conservative Republican leaders allow it to come up 
for debate -- because it is backed by a majority of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would extend basic civil rights protections in the area of  
employment to cover sexual orientation. Such protections are 
already afforded to people on the basis of race, religion, gender, 
national origin, age and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven states -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,  
Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, New 
Hampshire and Nevada -- already prohibit job discrimination against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would prohibit employers of 15 or more, employment agencies  
and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as 
the basis for employment decisions, such as hiring, firing, 
promotion or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would exempt the military and religious organizations.  
It would not require benefits for workers' same-sex partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents aren't buying the argument that the bill won't confer  
special rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert H. Knight of the conservative Family Research Council  
said sexual orientation shouldn't be a category that receives 
federal protection from job discrimination because it involves 
behavior. Other specially protected categories, such as race, 
gender and disability, do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if that person was representing a company and it became  
known that that person had wild and bizarre sexual tastes?'' he 
asked. ``That reflects on his employer. An employer should have the 
right to say, `I don't want to have that kind of person working for 
me.'''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Manager Recovers at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker's recollection of his last trip to  
the Astrodome is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dierker's trademark Hawaiian shirt offered a clue Wednesday  
of the mental state that doctors want the Houston Astros manager to 
have for the next few months following brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be quiet for a few weeks and not do very much,''  
Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	He donned a baseball cap to cover his shaved head as he checked  
out of Methodist Hospital, eight days after undergoing the 
operation a day after suffering a grand mal seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, and I'm going to be fine,'' said Dierker, smiling  
and joking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, 52, is forbidden from driving for six months and must  
take anticonvulsant medication indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon who performed the operation to remove a tangled mass  
of blood vessels from the front of Dierker's brain said he expected 
the manager to make a full recovery and return to the dugout after 
next month's All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming along fine, but at this point it's hard to say how  
much more time he's going to need,'' Dr. Rob Parrish said. ``He's 
going to continue the medication, and we'll continue to evaluate 
how he responds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout June 13 with the grand mal  
seizure. He underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery June 15 to remove the 
tangled vessels that caused the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I don't know what happened'' at the game,  
Dierker said. ``I heard a lot of people talking, but I don't 
remember much more than that. It was all like a blur. From the time 
I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I have felt lucid and I 
have had my coordination and balance. I have been very much amazed 
at that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how it could have been a lot worse, so I feel very  
fortunate that the malformation wasn't in an area that was as 
complex as it could have been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker suffered from arteriovenous malformation, a condition in  
which people are born with malformed, sometimes tangled, arteries 
or veins in the brain. Over time, the vessels can dilate, 
pressuring tissue or even bursting and bleeding into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After the surgery, an angiogram showed Dierker no longer had any  
of the clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill this  
season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of 
an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker said he continued to keep track of the game through his  
ordeal and now will convalesce at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had the problem of getting emotionally stressed  
watching on television as I have sitting in the dugout,'' he said, 
joined by his wife Judy and Parrish at a news conference. ``I 
haven't had a problem relinquishing control or power; it's probably 
a function of my managerial style.''

<HEADLINE> Orders for Durable Goods Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods -- led  
by gains in aircraft and autos -- climbed 1.4 percent in May, a sign 
that the nation's battered manufacturing sector could be headed for 
a revival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Thursday that orders for durable  
goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- increased 
$2.8 billion last month to a seasonally adjusted $197.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	May's increase was the ninth in the last 12 months and followed  
a steep 2.3 percent decline in April, the government said. Analysts 
expected May's turnaround, correctly predicting a rebound in orders 
for transportation products, which had suffered a sharp drop in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report indicates that manufacturing is going through a  
slow revival, but a revival nonetheless,'' said Mark Zandi, an 
economist with Regional Financial Associates. ``When you look at 
orders over a broader period, it shows a continuing modest 
improvement, indicating that manufacturers are past the worst of 
their problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for transportation equipment rose a strong 9.5 percent in  
May, following a 12.6 percent decline in April. The transportation 
sector is often volatile from month to month because it includes 
such big ticket purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	A big increase in orders for aircraft and airplane parts led the  
rebound in transportation orders, the Commerce Department said. 
U.S. automakers said they are enjoying record sales for cars and 
light trucks for the year ending May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. consumers are not through shopping yet,'' said economist  
Paul Taylor with the National Automobile Dealers Association. ``A 
refinancing boom, which is coming to an end, has left many 
household budgets in better shape and that is giving people the 
room to go out and buy autos to fill up their two-car garages,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the strength in transportation, overall orders for  
durable goods would have fallen 0.7 percent in May, the biggest 
decline since a 2.7 drop in October 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current  
demand, increased 1 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have grown increasingly nervous in recent  
weeks that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates at 
their meeting next week to slow growth and keep inflation under 
control. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,534.83 on 
Thursday, down 132.03 for the fourth straight decline for the 
blue-chip index. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the nation's good economic health, American  
manufacturers have been battered by a global financial crisis that 
has cut sharply into their overseas sales, opened them up to 
stiffer competition from cheaper imports and led to a loss of 
453,000 jobs in the last 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. industry that has suffered the most from the global  
turmoil has been steel. But orders for primary metals, the category 
that includes steel, rose by 0.7 percent in May following a 1.4 
percent gain April, offering a glimmer of hope that the worst may 
be over. 
</P>
<P>
	However, steel coming into the United States from other  
countries continued to rise, according to preliminary figures 
contained in a second Commerce Department report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, Brazil and other foreign countries shipped 3 million  
metric tons of steel to the United States in May. That's 30 percent 
higher than the final 2.3 million figure for April. Still, total 
shipments were 18 percent below November's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blow to the U.S. steel industry, the Senate earlier this  
week blocked a bill that would have limited the amount of 
foreign-made steel sent to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the 1.4 percent rise in orders for big-ticket  
manufactured goods, orders for industrial machinery, which includes 
computers and office equipment, fell 2.5 percent in May after a big 
3.6 percent gain in April. Orders for electronic and other 
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, dropped 1.5 percent 
in May after a 0.6 percent April increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some may point to that as a sign of slowing in high-tech as  
Y2K nears. However, that also happened in February and then 
rebounded,'' said First Union economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to 
302,000 last week. However, economists said the job market remains 
healthy.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Coach Has Style All His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- During the early 1970s, San Antonio Spurs coach  
Gregg Popovich was in the Air Force, based in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Since there were no American air bases behind the Iron Curtain  
at the time, one can only guess exactly what Pop was doing over 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	He could tell us, but then he'd have to kill us.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the military, he got a chance to do a lot of Soviet studies  
and special intelligence stuff,'' David Robinson said. ``That's 
part of what makes him such an interesting person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a style to Popovich that's all his own, a manner that's  
equal parts Jerry Sloan, K.C. Jones and Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	His brand of humor is similar to Sloan's, a self-depreciating,  
folksy blend of crudeness and blandness. 
</P>
<P>
	His style of coaching is similar to that of Jones, the former  
Boston Celtics coach who had a penchant for letting his players 
talk things out in the huddle rather than talking down to them. 
</P>
<P>
	His motivational methods are so far from the norm that they can  
only be compared to Riley's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while he'll do something kind of wacko just to shake  
us up a little,'' Steve Kerr said, relating a story about a game 
earlier this year in which San Antonio blew a 20-point 
fourth-quarter lead only to win at the buzzer on a shot by Sean 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came into the locker room and stripped down,'' Kerr said,  
``took all his clothes off and said `I've had it. I can't deal with 
you guys anymore.' We were all just kind of like, `Oh my God, the 
guy's naked.' We're supposed to be the ones naked, not the coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich has been bared to the world during these NBA finals,  
handling himself splendidly off the court and on it, quietly making 
the needed adjustments to combat New York's advantage in backcourt 
scoring, attacking the Knicks' weak spots and rectifying his team's 
troubles in the rebounding department. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in New York following Game 2, he has played the  
part of the happy tourist, smiling his way through mandatory 
interview sessions and exchanging lightheated barbs with people on 
the street who recognize his increasingly familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
	His haircut says military man. His manner is all civilian.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I get asked about the military, I always smile. If  
you talk to anybody at the academy when I was there and you started 
talking about me as a military man, there would be guffaws 
everywhere. I wasn't great,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is laughing now, though, when Popovich's name is brought  
up among the best coaches and executives in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich is one of the few men in the NBA who is both general  
manager and coach, a dual role he has held since taking over the 
coaching duties from Bob Hill in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His luckiest accomplishment was winning the draft lottery that  
brought the Spurs Tim Duncan in the 1997 draft, but Popovich has 
made some wise decisions, too. This season, he brought in Steve 
Kerr, Jerome Kersey and Mario Elie to give the team a dose of 
veteran leadership and toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is new territory for me. I don't know what the hell I'm  
doing here,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure thing, Pop. Just like they taught you in the military.  
Admit nothing. Deny everything. Play dumb. Be smart. 
</P>
<P>
	One more win, and the only NBA coach who is fluent in Russian  
will become a champion -- and a little less of a mystery.

<HEADLINE> Ex-AP Newsman Lee Linder Dead at 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lee Linder covered post-World War II  
celebrations, the riot at Kent State and the aftermath of the Three 
Mile Island nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	He was bunker-side at the bombing of the radical MOVE compound  
in 1985 and dictated the obituary of one of Philadelphia's most 
well-known mayors, Frank Rizzo, from an Atlantic City phone booth 
while on vacation in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder earned his reputation as a brash, tireless reporter in a  
career that spanned a half century of covering news for The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Wednesday following a lengthy battle with cancer. He was  
77. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever there was a breaking story, he was the first to come  
to mind. He couldn't be exhausted, even well into his 60s,'' said 
George Zucker, former AP chief of bureau for Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Lee never complained about anything -- except for one time  
when he was accepting a compliment from me, he said: 'I'm the most 
overpraised man in this bureau and also the most underpaid,''' 
Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight but commanding man was well-known among  
Philadelphia's politicians. One time when Rizzo called a press 
conference, he looked out over the crowd of reporters and said: ``I 
guess this must be an important press conference. Lee Linder of The 
Associated Press is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the AP was at any event, you could almost bank on it being  
Lee Linder,'' said Joseph A. Slobodzian, a Philadelphia Inquirer 
reporter for the past 17 years. ``He was AP's public face in 
Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linder's news sources were legendary, earning him exclusives  
that won national and international display. They included a 1966 
exclusive interview with atomic spy Harry Gold, who evaded other 
reporters upon his prison release and met with Linder at a motel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, he got a Glassboro, N.J., accountant to turn his home  
into a temporary AP bureau when President Lyndon Johnson and Soviet 
Premier Alexei Kosygin organized an impromptu summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sent out to scout the home of the college president,  
Hollybush, and lucked out at the home of an accountant that lived 
across the street. He turned over his home to AP. ... For the next 
24 hours, that was the focus of the world,'' Linder said when he 
retired in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder's coverage of tropical storm Agnes in 1972 and a 12-part  
retrospective the following year earned him the Philadelphia Press 
Association award for the best news story. In 1986, Linder was the 
first recipient of the AP News Staffer of the Year award of the 
Pennsylvania Associated Press Managing Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1943 from  
Temple University, where he was editor of the campus newspaper. 
Before joining the AP in 1945, Linder worked for International News 
Service in Philadelphia and Detroit, United Press in Cleveland and 
the Washington Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder also was active in many Jewish organizations.  
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Thelma Elster, two daughters and six  
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE>  Clapton Auctions Guitars for Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Clapton parted with 100 stringed beauties  
Thursday, including a beloved Fender guitar he called ``Brownie'' 
that went for a record $497,500 at a charity auction. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Christie's sale generated $5 million for a Caribbean  
drug and alcohol clinic the rocker founded in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton used ``Brownie,'' a 1956 sunburst Fender, to record his  
hit ``Layla.'' He played the guitar in other recording sessions and 
in concert. The amount paid for it -- by an unidentified telephone 
bidder -- surpassed the previous record paid at auction for a guitar 
-- $320,000 for one owned by Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it. I am totally overwhelmed,'' Clapton said  
in a statement released by Christie's after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to ``say thank you on behalf of all the  
patients who will get free treatment as a result of this sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton did not attend the auction.  
</P>
<P>
	Actor Michael J. Fox, bidding by telephone, bought a 1949  
Gibson-125 for $36,800 and a circa 1930s National Duolian for 
$42,500. Other buyers included Michael Malone, a Seattle music 
executive, and the Hard Rock Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other buyers were not identified.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Brownie,'' Clapton sold a 1954 Fender  
Stratocaster for $211,500 and a 1974 Martin 000-28 for $173,000. 
Both were widely used for recording and stage work as Clapton rose 
to stardom during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	A rare, 1958 Gibson Explorer with a solid-body design went for  
$134,500 and a red, 1991 Gibson Firebird given to Clapton by a fan 
went for $39,100. 
</P>
<P>
	A Christie's spokeswoman would not comment on reports that  
Clapton may have intended to secretly bid on at least one of his 
guitars after having a change of heart about parting with it. None 
of the buyers were identified by the auction house.

<HEADLINE> Congress Puts Off Y2K Bill Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional action on legislation to reduce  
Y2K-related lawsuits was put off Thursday so Congress and the White 
House could try a final time to resolve their differences and avoid 
a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before the meltdown both sides pulled back,'' said Sen.  
Ron Wyden, D-Ore. House and Senate negotiators decided to wait 
until Tuesday before approving the final draft of the Y2K bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision came after lawmakers from both parties complained  
that the White House, while saying it wants a bill to stop 
frivolous lawsuits, had failed to offer ideas on what it could 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very unhappy,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., author of  
the Senate Y2K bill with Wyden and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he had had heard nothing from the White House until  
Chief of Staff John Podesta called him 15 minutes before Thursday's 
House-Senate meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen such obdurate and non-communicative  
behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said that in the 10 days since the Senate passed its  
version, ``I haven't heard any specific objections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Wyden: ``The White House has been waltzing around when  
they could have been working with us productively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before adjourning until Tuesday, the negotiators did agree to  
accept, with small changes, the Senate version, which is more 
moderate than the House bill and somewhat more acceptable to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure seeks to avoid a flood of economy-crippling lawsuits  
related to disruptions caused by the year 2000 computer bug by 
giving companies 90 days to fix computers before lawsuits can be 
filed and encouraging mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It caps punitive damages for small businesses. The bill also  
tries to protect companies from predatory lawsuits by stating that 
in most cases a defendant will be held liable only for the share of 
damages it causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, along with trial lawyer and consumer groups,  
says even the Senate bill goes too far in undermining the rights of 
people with legitimate grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta, in a letter Thursday to House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., repeated the administration's veto threat but urged 
discussions. ``Rather than going down this destructive path, we 
should work together to find a bipartisan solution,'' Podesta 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Stein, congressional liaison for the White House, attended  
the meeting to tell the lawmakers that ``we stand ready to try to 
work things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans went into Thursday's conference with the intention  
of agreeing on the Senate bill, sending it back to the House and 
Senate for quick approval and handing it to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have forced him to make a decision about vetoing a  
bill keenly sought by the high tech industry, which has supported 
his presidency and is close to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the delay, McCain said the Senate bill already was a  
``tremendous retreat'' from the stronger House-passed measure and 
there was little negotiating room. ``I do not think we should 
further emasculate this legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want desperately to work something out with the  
administration,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chief sponsor of the 
House bill. ``But I am not going to surrender principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators did agree to amend language in the Senate bill  
that would have protected people from mortgage foreclosures 
resulting from Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry and agencies such as the Federal Reserve  
Board said the provision, inserted by bill opponent Sen. Ernest 
Hollings, D-S.C., was too broadly written and could affect the 
soundness of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> NiSource Pursues Columbia Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- In a bid to become one of the nation's  
largest gas companies, NiSource Inc. plans to pursue a $5.7 billion 
hostile takeover of Columbia Energy Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana-based utility company said Thursday that it plans to  
launch its tender offer on Friday. NiSource also said it will 
nominate a slate of directors to Columbia's board at Columbia's 
next annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that your stockholders have lost faith in your  
Board's willingness to act in their best interests,'' NiSource 
chairman and chief executive Gary Neale said in a letter to Oliver 
G. Richard III, chairman and chief executive of Columbia Energy, 
which is based in Herndon. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's board has repeatedly rebuffed NiSource's attempts to  
purchase the natural gas company. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed buyout would make NiSource, the parent company of  
Northern Indiana Public Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in 
Massachusetts, one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy said it would review the bid, and urged its  
shareholders to take no action on the offer until it makes its 
recommendation, expected within 10 business days. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., disclosed earlier this  
month that it had made an unsolicited buyout offer of $68 a share 
for Columbia Energy, but that Columbia Energy had refused to 
schedule merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Columbia's board unanimously rejected the buyout,  
saying the company isn't for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	But Neale said in his letter that NiSource ``will not be  
deterred by the actions of your board ... We have made it clear 
that we intend to pursue this transaction to its end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource has said it is willing to increase its offer if  
Columbia Energy's board ``agrees to cooperate with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy had 1998 revenues of nearly $6.6 billion. It is  
involved in natural gas exploration, production, transmission, 
storage and distribution as well as propane sales and electric 
power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Columbia Energy attempted to buy Pittsburgh-based  
Consolidated Natural Gas. But Consolidated Natural Gas last month 
rejected the offer and chose to proceed with an previously-planned 
merger with Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of NiSource fell 43 3/4 cents to close at $26.93 3/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, while shares of Columbia fell 18 3/4 cents to 
$63.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE>  Mistrial Called in Reggie Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge declared a mistrial in the Reggie Lewis  
malpractice case Thursday after a jury deadlocked over whether a 
cardiologist's diagnosis led to the death of the Boston Celtics 
star. Two consulting physicians were cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after the jury, for the second day in a row,  
couldn't decide on Dr. Gilbert Mudge's responsibility. Mudge had 
treated Lewis before he dropped dead of a heart condition while 
shooting baskets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith declared the mistrial after the jury  
had deliberated about 35 hours over six days. In order to reach a 
verdict, agreement was needed among 13 of the 15 jurors, who heard 
nearly seven weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife, Donna Harris-Lewis, sued Mudge and the consultants,  
Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed 
and mistreated her husband's heart condition. A third consultant 
settled for an undisclosed sum before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sought at least $75 million, saying that was the  
sum Lewis would have earned if he hadn't died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take tremendous comfort and pride in the fact that Reggie's  
reputation and legacy has emerged from this stronger than ever,'' 
she said. ``And there's no telling how much good he could have done 
if he had been treated properly and lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Robert Harley, said he will seek a retrial.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in 1993 and was diagnosed  
with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending heart rhythm 
disturbance by a team of top doctors from New England Baptist 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference 
that the player instead had a benign neurological condition that 
causes fainting spells. Mudge said Lewis could probably return to 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Lewis died at 27.  
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, Mudge maintained that two weeks before his death,  
Lewis admitted using cocaine. The doctor said the belated 
confession made an accurate diagnosis impossible. Lewis' widow 
bitterly denied her husband used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, Mudge refused to answer questions.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to portray it any other way than the way it  
turned out,'' said his lawyer, William Dailey. ``We hope, perhaps, 
when everyone has a chance to think about the situation there may 
not be another trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's lawyers called several criminals to testify that  
Lewis used cocaine and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge also had said he privately suspected the player might have  
a serious heart condition -- and was treating him with beta blockers 
that addressed both the fainting condition and the possible cardiac 
problem. He said he told the family and the Celtics of his 
concerns, but both groups disputed that claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Harris-Lewis suggested that Mudge's judgment had  
been clouded by his search for glory as the man who proved the 
other doctors wrong.

<HEADLINE>  Mistrial Called in Reggie Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge declared a mistrial in the Reggie Lewis  
malpractice case Thursday after a jury deadlocked over whether a 
cardiologist's diagnosis led to the death of the Boston Celtics 
star. Two consulting physicians were cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after the jury, for the second day in a row,  
couldn't decide on Dr. Gilbert Mudge's responsibility. Mudge had 
treated Lewis before he dropped dead of a heart condition while 
shooting baskets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith declared the mistrial after the jury  
had deliberated about 35 hours over six days. In order to reach a 
verdict, agreement was needed among 13 of the 15 jurors, who heard 
nearly seven weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife, Donna Harris-Lewis, sued Mudge and the consultants,  
Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed 
and mistreated her husband's heart condition. A third consultant 
settled for an undisclosed sum before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sought at least $75 million, saying that was the  
sum Lewis would have earned if he hadn't died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take tremendous comfort and pride in the fact that Reggie's  
reputation and legacy has emerged from this stronger than ever,'' 
she said. ``And there's no telling how much good he could have done 
if he had been treated properly and lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Robert Harley, said he will seek a retrial.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in 1993 and was diagnosed  
with a life-threatening, potentially career-ending heart rhythm 
disturbance by a team of top doctors from New England Baptist 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference 
that the player instead had a benign neurological condition that 
causes fainting spells. Mudge said Lewis could probably return to 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Lewis died at 27.  
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, Mudge maintained that two weeks before his death,  
Lewis admitted using cocaine. The doctor said the belated 
confession made an accurate diagnosis impossible. Lewis' widow 
bitterly denied her husband used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, Mudge refused to answer questions.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to portray it any other way than the way it  
turned out,'' said his lawyer, William Dailey. ``We hope, perhaps, 
when everyone has a chance to think about the situation there may 
not be another trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's lawyers called several criminals to testify that  
Lewis used cocaine and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge also had said he privately suspected the player might have  
a serious heart condition -- and was treating him with beta blockers 
that addressed both the fainting condition and the possible cardiac 
problem. He said he told the family and the Celtics of his 
concerns, but both groups disputed that claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Harris-Lewis suggested that Mudge's judgment had  
been clouded by his search for glory as the man who proved the 
other doctors wrong.

<HEADLINE> Fieldcrest Cannon Workers OK Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- A textile union that has struggled for  
25 years to represent workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon plants 
claimed victory after a two-day election. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers voted, 2,270 to 2,102, to be represented by the Union of  
Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, but both the company 
and union challenged about 285 votes each, National Labor Relations 
Board officials said early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tied up on challenges. We cannot determine the winner,''  
said NLRB election overseer Gary Stiffler. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't say how long it would take to officially declare a  
winner because of the potential for litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting began Tuesday and ended Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won here,'' said UNITE organizer Mike Zucker. ``It's a  
historic victory. It's been a long time coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNITE already represents 4,000 Pillowtex workers at nine plants  
in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillowtex Chairman Chuck Hansen Jr., whose company bought  
Fieldcrest Cannon after the last union vote in 1997, told about 60 
cheering employees the election provided no mandate for either 
side. He estimated as many as 500 eligible employees didn't vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the union erupted with cheers when the vote total  
was announced. About a dozen supporters ran outside of the A.L. 
Brown High School auditorium where everyone had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God we won,'' said Ruth Crisco, a folder at plant No. 6  
in Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-union workers showed little emotion. Some were defiant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ain't lost yet,'' said Thelma Honeycutt, a weaver for 47  
years at the No. 6 plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon workers have rejected union organizing efforts  
four times, beginning in 1974. A court ordered an election in 1997 
after the union claimed it lost a close 1991 vote because 
Fieldcrest intimidated and fired workers. The union lost the 1997 
election by 369 votes out of 4,757 cast, and the NLRB again found 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Pillowtex bought Fieldcrest Cannon shortly  
thereafter for $700 million, creating one of the world's largest 
makers of bed and bath linen. The top issues in this election were 
the estimated $50 million in modernization and job changes that 
have occurred since Fieldcrest was sold. UNITE said change was 
displacing workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon makes towels, sheets and comforters under the  
names Royal Velvet, Cannon, Touch of Class and Charisma. Pillowtex 
makes bed pillows, mattress pads, blankets and down comforters 
under the Ralph Lauren, Disney and Martha Stewart names. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has 166,800 textile jobs, more than any state.  
But textile employment has declined for six decades because of 
improved technology and increased manufacturing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Job losses accelerated in the past year as the Asian financial  
crisis boosted imports. U.S. mills also have been moving production 
to Mexico to cut costs by taking advantage of lower wage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has the lowest proportion of union members in the  
country; unions represent just 4.2 percent of wage and salary 
workers.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Webb Having Dream Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- When Karrie Webb says she is having a  
dream year on the LPGA Tour, she's not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Australian is building on her modern LPGA record  
of 16 consecutive finishes in the top 10, has already won five 
times this year and is on the verge of becoming the first woman to 
go over $1 million before July. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the eve of the LPGA Championship, Webb revealed she has  
had some ``really weird dreams'' the last couples of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent one involved her in a playoff with fellow Aussie  
Rachel Hetherington. Tournament officials made them walk up and 
down a steep hill before they could hit their tee shots, and Webb 
was out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I woke up,'' she said. ``I woke up before I had the  
playoff because I didn't want to know who won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that would have been a big surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	Webb isn't winning every week on the LPGA Tour, it just seems  
that way. In 13 tournaments this year, she has won five times and 
been in contention on Sunday in all but three of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, two of those happened to be majors. She was among  
those in the wake left by Dottie Pepper in her record-setting 
victory in the Dinah Shore, and she finished 10 strokes behind Juli 
Inkster in the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	At 24, Webb has already accomplished more than she could have  
dreamed with 14 victories and already enough earnings to rank 12th 
on the career money list. All that remains is that first major, and 
she will certainly be one of the favorites at Dupont Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that she would consider herself a failure if it doesn't  
happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if I was 40 years old and heading on the way out,'' she  
said. ``But I'm still on the way. I know I have a lot of golf ahead 
of me. Three and a half years ago, if someone told me I had won 
this many times out here, I would never have believed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just living the dream now.''  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest dream of all this week belongs to Inkster.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning two major championships as a rookie 15 years ago -- the  
Dinah Shore and du Maurier Classic -- only made Inkster hungry to 
win them all. Perhaps that's why the LPGA Championship means more 
to her now than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Having won the U.S. Open at Old Waverly three weeks ago, Inkster  
could join Pat Bradley as the only women to complete the modern 
LPGA career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to have another great week to do it,''  
Inkster said. ``It's been a little hectic in my lifestyle, and I 
just have to focus on my golf game. But I think I can do it. I 
think I have as good a chance as anybody else out there right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Wright, whose swing Ben Hogan said was the best he ever  
saw, is the only other woman to win all four majors, which from 
1955-66 consisted of the U.S. Open, the LPGA Championship, the 
Titleholders and the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty difficult task,'' Bradley said. ``You're dealing  
with majors, which aren't your everyday, ordinary tournaments. But 
I think if anybody has the savvy to do it, Juli is perfectly 
qualified for that task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, Inkster isn't the only player capable of winning  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion is Se Ri Pak, who won last week in  
Absecon, N.J., for the first time this year. All four of Pak's 
victories in 1998, when she became the first rookie since Inkster 
to win two majors, came during a 10-week stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a good feeling to this week,'' Pak said.  
</P>
<P>
	And Webb seems to have good feelings every time she tees it up.  
She is coming off a memorable victory two weeks ago in Rochester, 
where she birdied the last three holes to win by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb decided to take last week off -- as hot as she is, she  
probably could have made a fortune in the casinos of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my schedule up around the majors,'' she said. ``I'm  
trying to peak at the right time. I feel my game is in pretty good 
shape. I have never had as much confidence as I have right now on 
the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only place her confidence seems to be lacking is in her  
dreams.

<HEADLINE> 12 Players Withdraw from NBA's Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Weber State's Harold ``The Show'' Arceneaux and  
Kentucky's Jamaal Magloire were among 12 players who have withdrawn 
from the list of those seeking early entry to next week's NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux, who led his team to a first-round upset of North  
Carolina in the NCAA tournament, will return to Weber State for his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Magliore, a 6-foot-10 center, was considering entering the  
draft, depending on how high he would be picked. He kept open his 
options by not signing with an agent and registering for summer 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he believed he was a certain first-round pick in the NBA  
draft, Magloire said he went back and forth about the decision 
several times daily over the last six weeks before telling the NBA 
to take his name off the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been the hardest decision I've ever had to make ... I had  
to go with what my heart was saying,'' Magloire said. ``It was a 
win-win situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged seven points and 4.4 rebounds last year during an  
up-and-down junior season. He was suspended twice for disciplinary 
reasons in the first half of the season, then raised his level of 
play and became a major contributor in the Wildcats' postseason run 
to the regional finals of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire said he wants to go even further in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to accomplish another national championship,''  
said Magloire, who was a backup on the Wildcats' 1998 title team. 
``I think the potential on this team is scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had projected Magloire as a second-round pick in  
the draft, but he said he was confident he played himself into the 
first round -- and a guaranteed three-year, seven-figure contract -- 
with a strong performance earlier this month at the pre-draft camp 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody that thought I was going to be a second-round  
pick is fooling themselves,'' Magloire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked where he thought he might go in the draft with another  
year of college play, Magloire said, ``Lottery. I'm going to work 
my tail off, not accept anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early entry list now includes four freshmen, nine  
sophomores, eight juniors, two high school players and four 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin ``Greedy'' Daniels of UNLV and Lamont Long of New Mexico  
also withdrew their names as did several foreign players and a 
couple from junior colleges.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Leader To Visit Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung will visit  
President Clinton at the White House next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's visit comes at a time of renewed belligerence between  
North Korea and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Thursday that Kim would visit the United  
States July 2-5, paying a working visit to Clinton on July 2. Over 
the weekend, he plans to travel to Philadelphia to receive the 
Philadelphia Liberty Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Kim are expected to discuss security, economic and  
political matters. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea accused South Korea this week of deliberately  
pushing their rivalry ``to the brink of war,'' marring the highest 
level talks between the two governments in 14 months. 
Representatives of the two nations met briefly in Beijing on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea, in its fourth year of widespread food shortages,  
needs aid to repair its ruined economy. But South Korea's president 
needs tangible evidence that his more open policy toward North 
Korea is working. 
</P>
<P>
	After just 90 minutes of talks, the North Korean delegation said  
it would not meet again with South Korean officials until Seoul was 
ready to apologize for a naval clash last week in disputed waters 
of the Yellow Sea.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Judge-turned-newswoman Catherine Crier is  
leaving the Fox News Channel for Court TV, where she will anchor a 
midday legal news show. 
</P>
<P>
	Crier's show, which begins this fall, will offer commentary and

	The company promised to have 20 machines in place in Los  
Angeles, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area within the next 
year, and 100 installed by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo has spent more than four years negotiating with the  
California Council of the Blind and the Disability Rights Education 
and Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal  
access to public facilities, would have likely been the basis of a 
lawsuit against the bank, said Elaine Feingold, a lawyer with the 
Council of the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most ATMs already provide instructions for the blind in  
Braille, only 10 percent of the blind actually know the written 
language of raised dots, the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	And even Braille cannot reproduce important information such as  
an account's balance, which appears on the ATM's electronic screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The voice ATMs will recite the information, with headphones  
offered for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo spokesman Larry Haeg said installing the talking  
machines is just another way the bank can take care of its 
customers. He did not know how many current Wells Fargo customers 
are blind.

<HEADLINE> New Transplant Policy Favors Sickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients with less than a week to live will  
have a better chance getting a donated liver under a new policy 
approved Thursday by the nation's organ transplant network. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy change brings the United Network for Organ Sharing  
closer to the Clinton administration, which has been pressing the 
network to send scarce organs to the sickest patients first, rather 
than favoring patients in the area where the organs were donated. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's board, meeting in Atlanta, also was poised to  
retreat from its long-standing refusal to release information about 
individual transplant centers and their performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has bitterly opposed efforts to change its rules,  
and the last year and a half has been dominated by a nasty fight 
with the Department of Health and Human Services over who should 
direct allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued rules last year ordering that more data be released  
and directing the network to create a new allocation system that 
would get more organs to the sickest patients. The network mounted 
an intense lobbying effort and persuaded Congress to delay the 
regulations until this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the problem is supply and demand: The waiting list  
for organs has grown much faster than donations, and more than 
4,000 people die each year waiting. That's created intense 
competition for the organs that are available. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday the network moved closer to what HHS wants on liver  
transplants, which have engendered the most debate. The change will 
take effect as soon as it can be implemented, probably within a 
couple of months, network officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has opposed giving the sickest people the highest  
priority, arguing they are less likely to survive a transplant. But 
officials calculated that the effect of the policy change will be 
minimal: 78 percent of patients would survive one year, down from 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Livers are the most controversial because they can survive  
outside the body for 24 hours, making it possible to transport them 
anywhere in the nation. And medically, there is no way to keep 
someone in liver failure alive while awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy will direct more livers to the very sickest  
patients -- those classified as ``status 1.'' These are people who 
are suddenly struck by liver disease and have a week or less to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system offers livers first to status 1 patients in  
the designated local area, which can vary from part of a city to 
several states. If there are no medical matches, the livers are 
offered to other local patients, in order of medical urgency. If 
there are still no local matches, livers are offered to patients in 
the surrounding region, sickest first. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, approved on a 30-3 vote, would kick in if there  
are no local patients who are in the greatest medical need. In this 
case, livers would be offered to status 1 patients throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nation's 11 regions have already adopted similar  
agreements on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stands, 14.5 percent of donated livers go to status 1  
patients. The network expects that to rise to 22.3 percent under 
the new policy. The percentages going to less urgent patients all 
drop slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS officials welcomed the change but said they hoped it would  
be expanded to other patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly moving in the right direction,'' said Dr.  
Claude Earl Fox, who directs the HHS agency in charge of transplant 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wants further changes. For example, while the new policy  
would speed up livers to the sickest patients who suddenly develop 
acute liver disease, it would not help those expected to die within 
a week from chronic liver ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said direct talks with network officials are continuing and  
progress is being made. ``We're going to work this out,'' he 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Network officials said government pressure did not force the  
policy turnabout, but they acknowledged that the dispute helped 
push them toward the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had some influence on the decision, there's no doubt about  
that,'' said network spokesman Bob Spieldenner. The network 
includes transplant hospitals, surgeons and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule would not eliminate geographic boundaries, even for  
the sickest patients. 
</P>
<P>
	A liver donated in Cleveland, for instance, might be directed to  
someone who is relatively healthy even if there is a status 1 
patient in nearby Pittsburgh, because the regional line is drawn 
between Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS rules also called for the network to release more data.  
The board scheduled a vote Friday on a plan to release information 
annually about patient survival rates and waiting times for 
transplants at individual hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also adopted a new policy Thursday on allocating  
livers that have been divided, with part to go to an adult and part 
to a child. Hospitals that agree to split all medically suitable 
livers will be part of the group that gets the first chance at 
other donated split livers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns N. Korea About Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea will suffer ``very serious  
consequences'' if it follows up last year's test of a long-range 
ballistic missile with another test launch this year, a State 
Department official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth told a gathering at  
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that any such 
test would have a negative impact on relations with the United 
States, Japan and South Korea and could alienate China. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said China is believed to oppose North Korea's missile  
development program because it could encourage nearby countries, 
presumably Japan and South Korea, to develop missile defense 
systems. This, in turn, could lead to a heightening of tensions in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea caused alarm in the region last year when it tested  
a three-stage rocket over Japan. A number of reports in recent days 
suggest that U.S. intelligence agencies believe that North Korea is 
preparing to test a missile of longer range this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that former Defense Secretary  
William Perry warned the North Koreans last week during a visit to 
Pyongyang that the United States will not tolerate another missile 
launch. Perry made the visit as part of a comprehensive review of 
U.S. policy toward North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior U.S. and North Korean officials ended two days of talks  
Thursday in Beijing. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
declined to characterize the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, North Korea said Thursday that the United States, in  
the aftermath of its victory in the Balkans, is building an 
``armada'' off the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current situation in the Korean peninsula is very  
worrying,'' Ambassador Ri Tcheul told the 61-nation Conference on 
Disarmament in Geneva. ``The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk has 
finished its mission in Yugoslavia and is steaming toward the 
Korean Peninsula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions escalated last week when a standoff in the Yellow Sea  
between North and South Korean warships led to the sinking of a 
North Korean vessel. An estimated 30 North Korean sailors died. It 
was after that confrontation that the administration decided to 
upgrade the U.S. military presence in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	An escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula is a principal  
worry of U.S. defense planners. It is frequently cited as an 
important reason for the Pentagon to maintain a continuous military 
presence in the Pacific, including an aircraft carrier battle 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has been criticized for his  
policy of trying to ease tensions by reaching out to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Washington Post, Kim defended the  
policy, saying engagement with communism has been more successful 
than confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the nature of a Communist regime -- if you try to  
pressure it or push it into a corner, the stronger it will 
become,'' Kim was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his efforts to achieve detente, known as the ``sunshine  
policy,'' are not based on naivete. ``Our combat readiness is very 
powerful,'' Kim said. ``No other alternative has a chance; this 
policy will ultimately succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute said the  
sunshine policy has been dismissed in the state-controlled North 
Korean media as ``an anti-North confrontation policy'' that should 
be replaced by a ``pro-North policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said North Korea is pursing a policy of ``military  
extortion'' through which it practices brinkmanship, then backs 
down only after extracting material concessions from the West.

<HEADLINE> Bridget Fonda Suffered Stage Fright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though she is from a show business family,  
Bridget Fonda says she was paralyzed by stage fright early in her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go on stage, and later I couldn't remember a thing I'd  
done,'' the actress, who has been in more than 30 movies, said in 
this Sunday's Parade magazine. ``I'd think, `I'm the worst person 
in the class.' They all looked at me like I should know better 
because of my heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how did the daughter of Peter Fonda and granddaughter of  
Henry Fonda overcome her fear? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stubborn,'' she said. ``I've learned that when it's  
something you care about, you have to take chances.''

<HEADLINE> Changes in Puberty Lessons Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Girls who mature early should be given  
the option of learning about puberty and menstruation in the fourth 
grade, a year before most other girls, a national group of school 
nurses proposed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier starting date is necessary in part because many  
girls are exposed to issues of sexuality at a younger age, said 
Judy Robinson, executive director of the National Association of 
School Nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be amazed at what kids are asking these days,'' she  
said. ``They want to know about (sexual) positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, children in the United States receive sex education  
in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three decades, the accepted belief was that puberty  
started between ages 10 and 12. But a 1997 study by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics suggests that puberty for girls can begin as 
early as 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls who have developed early, or are observed by teachers to  
be using more sexual language or behaving in sexual ways, could be 
selected to take the fourth-grade classes, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan approved by the nurses association, parents could  
choose to exclude their children from the fourth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Gadsden, a board member of the school nurses group, said  
there is another reason for teaching girls about puberty at a 
younger age: the proliferation of sexual images and messages on 
television and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are surrounded by sexual messages, and not all of  
them are healthy,'' Gadsden said. ``It's important to establish a 
baseline of information so girls can evaluate all the messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Gadsden said, an early education about puberty can  
help reassure girls who are harassed because they have developed 
earlier than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young girls need to be armed with understanding and knowledge  
to be assertive that their body is their own,'' Gadsden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents and educators questioned whether a little girl has  
the emotional maturity to deal with these issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Campbell, a health education specialist at the state  
Department of Education, said: ``It would be foolish and misleading 
to say they are all ready or they all aren't. Everyone's different. 
You have to know you're community and you have to know who you're 
teaching.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gunmaker Seeks Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A California gun manufacturer filed for  
bankruptcy protection after being named as a defendant in lawsuits 
by cities across the country seeking to recoup the costs of 
gun-related crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Industries, a Chino, Calif., company known for producing  
small, cheap handguns, filed for Chapter 11 protection in May, 
court records show. 
</P>
<P>
	A call on Thursday seeking comment from Davis Industries was not  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen companies have been named in lawsuits,  
including well-known gunmakers such as Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt, Glock, 
Berretta and Sturm Ruger. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities including Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans filed the  
suits, accusing gunmakers of failing to equip weapons with adequate 
safety devices, and marketing them in ways that allow handguns to 
fall into the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits are patterned after lawsuits that forced cigarette  
makers to pay some $246 billion over the next 25 years to reimburse 
states for the cost to public health agencies of treating 
tobacco-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Fans Go Crazy for U.S. Women's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mary Ellen Brennan stood outside Soldier Field, a  
brush in her hand, tiny soccer balls dangling from her ears, little 
boys and girls lined up before her to get their faces painted red, 
white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	She and 74 others had loaded into cars, vans and practically  
anything else with wheels for the 12-hour drive from Tulsa, Okla., 
to see the United States beat Nigeria 7-1 on Thursday in the 
Women's World Cup. Not even an overheated van and a four-hour delay 
in Missouri could cool this group's enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was a football game, I'd just come,'' Brennan said.  
``But this is soccer. I'm a fanatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and the 65,080 others who crammed into Soldier Field. With  
two hours still to go before the Brazil-Italy game, the first match 
of the doubleheader, the lines to get in the gates were already 
snaking around the stadium. Parking lots were full and scalpers 
wandered around offering tickets at twice face value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans made sure it was money well spent. After the  
Nigerians scored first, the United States answered with three goals 
in a four-minute span early in the first half, and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States led 6-1 at the half, and fan favorite Mia Hamm  
waved to the crowd and pumped her fists as she ran off the field. 
When she left the game for good, early in the second half, she 
raised her hands above her head and clapped. Fans responded, giving 
her a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the final horn sounded, the Americans on the bench ran onto  
the field, hugging their teammates. Assistant coach Lauren Gregg 
turned toward the crowd as she walked to the field, clapping her 
hands above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	After shaking hands with the Nigerians, the Americans ran around  
the field in a victory lap, waving to the crowd, clapping their 
hands and giving the thumbs-up sign. It was a scene straight from a 
rock concert, as fans screamed and yelled and flashbulbs went off 
all over the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were rowdy from the time the Americans took the field  
for warm-ups. A huge roar went out as the women took the field, and 
there were sporadic chants of ``U-S-A! U-S-A!.'' There was another 
loud cheer as the American flag was brought out, and the team got a 
standing ovation as it walked onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	As the starters stood at midfield, waiting for the national  
anthem, Michelle Akers raised both her hands and pumped her fists 
at the crowd, which was chanting, ``U-S-A All the way!'' During the 
pre-game huddle, forward Cindy Parlow stepped back and waved at the 
crowd, urging them to keep cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	With a pro-American crowd, that wasn't going to be a problem.  
While a few people wore Brazil shirts, anything red, white and blue 
-- hats, T-shirts, faces, fingernails -- was the popular choice of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup goalie Saskia Webber and forward Danielle Fotopoulos even  
dyed their hair red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	One group of teen-age girls sported red, white and blue down to  
their underwear. Adreanna Pankow, sisters Jamie and Randi Siedzik, 
Natalie Black and Kelly Wood were dressed in flag boxer shorts, 
flag bandannas and red sports bras. They spelled out ``Go USA'' 
across their stomachs in face paint, and had Hamm, Kristine Lilly 
and Julie Foudy's names and numbers on their arms and backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're soccer nuts,'' Randi Siedzik said.  
</P>
<P>
	They weren't the only ones who were big Hamm fans. There were  
Hamm jerseys and T-shirts with her No. 9 all over the place. 
Hundreds of girls had her number painted on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the crowd at Giants Stadium on Saturday, many of the fans  
were young girls. Tim Scullin of Shoreview, Minn., and his wife, 
Pam, brought their 14-year-old daughter, Katie, and her friends 
Catherine Chu and Elizabeth Heyman. The three have been playing 
soccer for eight years and they're now on a team coached by Tim 
Scullin. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Nolan of Flint, Mich., brought his daughters, Erika, 14,  
and Mackenzie, 11. And Thorpe came with her friends, Genee 
Walz-Keller and Jennifer Errante. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the players and fans are great role models for young  
women everywhere, and we wanted to see them,'' Walz-Keller said. 
``We really can't have personal contact with them, so this is our 
way of showing support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just girls who were excited to see the game. Mike and  
Nancy Lynch of Western Springs, Ill., brought their 11-year-old 
son, Jimmy, and three of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same as the men's,'' Steven Oetking, 11, said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Except this U.S. team, I'm expecting to get a little  
further,'' Jimmy Lynch added.

<HEADLINE> Rains Threaten Midwest Wheat Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, Kan. (AP) -- Spreading like a golden wave across the  
nation's heartland, millions of acres of winter wheat began 
ripening a few weeks ago, drawing crews from across the country and 
the world to harvest it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rains began.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the fields are too soggy for the 27,000-pound combines to  
move in, and the wheat is too wet to harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the stalks will fall over, making the crop even harder to  
bring in. And soon, too, the wheat heads will sprout, destroying 
the crop's commercial value for anything but animal feed. Winter 
wheat is used primarily to make bread. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``custom cutters'' who follow the ripening crops and  
streamed into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas from as far away as 
Australia and South Africa are waiting out the weather in hotel 
rooms in sleepy rural towns, doing little but sleeping, eating and 
hoping for the rain to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said that's not likely anytime soon. Rain and  
thunderstorms are expected to continue into next week in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is in the same boat -- sitting and waiting,'' said  
Robert Wawrzyniak, who hauled his combine from Missouri into Kansas 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain could mean big losses for farmers, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is too soon to say it is a national disaster, but  
obviously the acres harvested are going to be down quite a bit,'' 
said Mark Simmons of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 2 percent of the winter wheat crop has been harvested in  
Kansas, compared with 31 percent by this time last year, Kansas 
Agricultural Statistics reported this week. Oklahoma farmers have 
harvested 51 percent of their crop, compared with 79 percent at 
this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, where the wheat has been ripe much longer, many  
farmers have already abandoned their crops. In southern Kansas, 
especially around Medicine Lodge, reports of sprouting wheat heads 
are also coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	The unseasonable rains hurt wheat in a number of ways. Wet wheat  
can rot during storage, and even once it dries out, the heads tend 
to shrivel up, lowering the weight per bushel and affecting the 
price farmers get. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas and Oklahoma account for about one-third of all winter  
wheat grown in the United States. So far, commodity prices that 
could ultimately lead to higher bread prices in the supermarket 
have not been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are reaching a strong concern about the  
national production,'' said Kansas state statistician Eddie Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much damage the rains have done to the wheat crop won't  
be known until the combines can get back into the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In northwestern Kansas -- where wheat is just beginning to ripen  
-- the crop is still in mostly good condition. But farmers fear that 
with all of Kansas ready to harvest at the same time -- and with 
nearly half of the Oklahoma fields still uncut because of rain 
there-- there won't be enough crews and combines to get the crops in 
fast enough once it dries up. 
</P>
<P>
	Wawrzyniak, who came here from Maitland, Mo., with his wife and  
son, said he has worked just 6 1/2 hours in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is costing me money,'' he said. Many cutters are moving on  
in search of drier fields. That could pose a problem for some 
farmers, who rely on the crews to harvest about 60 percent of the 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really going to put us in a bind, but it's happened  
before,'' said Marsha Carothers, whose family will use its own 
three combines to finish harvesting its 3,300 acres near Anthony, 
Kan. ``We're used to it.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fight Gay Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican lawmakers from New  
England revived efforts Thursday to pass a federal law prohibiting 
job discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost the measure's chance of passage, lawmakers have  
rewritten it to explicitly prohibit preferential treatment of 
homosexuals, such as hiring to meet quotas or designing affirmative 
action standards to make up for past discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as  
ENDA, have successfully fought it in three previous Congresses on 
the grounds that it would extend special protections to 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``ENDA will achieve equal rights -- not special rights -- for gays  
and lesbians,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who plans to pass 
the bill out of his Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee 
and then try to force consideration by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Senate defeated a similar bill by one vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Los Angeles at a gay and  
lesbian center, voiced support for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not confer any special rights, but it does outlaw the  
kind of discrimination that has become all too common in our 
society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was introduced by Jeffords and Sens. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and in the House by Reps. 
Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Christopher Shays, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're able to get it out of the Senate, that would create  
tremendous pressure on the House,'' said Shays, an influential 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and other ENDA supporters argue that the bill would pass  
the House -- if conservative Republican leaders allow it to come up 
for debate -- because it is backed by a majority of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would extend basic civil rights protections in the area of  
employment to cover sexual orientation. Such protections are 
already afforded to people on the basis of race, religion, gender, 
national origin, age and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven states -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,  
Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, New 
Hampshire and Nevada -- already prohibit job discrimination against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
	ENDA would prohibit employers of 15 or more, employment agencies  
and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as 
the basis for employment decisions, such as hiring, firing, 
promotion or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would exempt the military and religious organizations.  
It would not require benefits for workers' same-sex partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents aren't buying the argument that the bill won't confer  
special rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert H. Knight of the conservative Family Research Council  
said sexual orientation shouldn't be a category that receives 
federal protection from job discrimination because it involves 
behavior. Other specially protected categories, such as race, 
gender and disability, do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if that person was representing a company and it became  
known that that person had wild and bizarre sexual tastes?'' he 
asked. ``That reflects on his employer. An employer should have the 
right to say, `I don't want to have that kind of person working for 
me.'''

<HEADLINE> Kubrick Movie Review Angers Studio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Before this week, hardly anyone knew much more  
about Stanley Kubrick's mysterious last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' 
than the fact that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman get really naked in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, rumors abounded about the film, completed just before the  
legendary filmmaker's death. But Warner Bros. has not yet screened 
it for critics and Kubrick's rigorous insistence on secrecy meant 
few people knew what they were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter London film critic Alexander Walker, a Kubrick biographer  
who, as a family friend, was allowed to view the movie early. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker then published a review, including an in-depth plot  
summary, in Tuesday's Evening Standard newspaper. And now, thanks 
to the Internet, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has segued from the best-kept 
to the worst-kept secret in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evening Standard's Web site saw such a huge surge in traffic  
Wednesday that the paper said some high-tech rejiggering had to be 
done to make sure the glut of people trying to read the review 
didn't lock up the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, the people at Warner Bros. are upset by Walker's  
actions -- as is Kubrick's family, according to a studio 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a family friend, they showed it to him and he betrayed  
their trust,'' spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick said. ``The family is 
very hurt and angry. It certainly wasn't the plan, and we are not 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick said the film was not to be screened for critics  
until July 10, six days before its opening in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was out of the country and could not be reached for  
comment, but he defended the timing of his review in Thursday's 
Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not under any embargo,'' the paper quoted him as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Kubrick's 13th film, was completed a week  
before the legendary director died in March at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't want to know what it's about, then don't read any  
further. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, according to Walker's review, stars Cruise and Kidman  
as William and Alice Harper, ``protagonists in a story of how an 
apparently happily married couple, rich, successful New Yorkers ... 
are set at odds with each other by their dreams and fantasies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a party at a grand mansion where each is tempted by the  
fruits of another, they quiz each other about their erotic 
fantasies and find out more than perhaps they wanted to know, 
including the fact that Kidman's character once had an affair, 
Walker says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut'' then follows Cruise on the rebound from his  
wife's sexual revelation, as he ponders necrophilia, patronizes a 
prostitute and explores sex games among New York's rich and famous, 
curiously clad in cloaks and Venetian masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at its most baffling,'' Walker says, ``it is an  
astonishing work made with masterly control and at the same time a 
humanity that this director's detractors insisted he did not 
possess.''

<HEADLINE> Electronics Battle May Deprive Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine sliding what looks like a stick of gum  
into your computer to download music off the Internet, then 
inserting it into a portable gizmo to play songs while jogging. 
Later, you use the tiny device to store photos from your digital 
camera, and drop it off at the store to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast.  
</P>
<P>
	A new generation of ``removable storage media'' promises to open  
an era of convenience for consumers, offering harmonious 
communication among electronics products. But a heated battle over 
technical standards by manufacturers could push that day further 
into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony, IBM, SanDisk and others have introduced competing  
high-capacity storage devices aimed at use with digital cameras, 
computers, music players and other electronics. The new devices, 
though, add to an already confusing array of storage methods, 
including floppy disks, CD-ROMs and DVDs. Those that work with one 
machine may not work with another, potentially confusing 
electronics consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure it will be resolved in the near future,'' said  
Jacques Kauffmann, technology advisor to the Photo Marketing 
Association International, a trade group of camera makers. 
</P>
<P>
	One popular medium for storing digital-camera images is called  
CompactFlash, developed by SanDisk Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif. The 
durable matchbook-size device uses ``flash'' memory chips, and 
holds anywhere from 16 to 80 images. SanDisk is also talking to 
makers of portable music players about enabling their gadgets to 
use the device. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices of CompactFlash range from $70 to $300, nearly as  
much as an inexpensive digital camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony, for its part, is hawking its ``Memory Stick,'' about the  
size of a stick of gum, and is using it as storage for its wide 
range of electronics products, including computers, cameras and 
gizmos for the home that look like ordinary photo frames but 
display digital still and video images. 
</P>
<P>
	But other manufacturers have yet to adopt their electronics  
products to the nifty stick, which is a different shape than 
CompactFlash and doesn't fit in CompactFlash sockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Memory Stick is really only relegated to Sony's own  
products,'' said Bob Amatruda, an analyst with International Data 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has another idea. It's pitching the MicroDrive hard disk  
drive, about the size of a large coin, as an advance that could 
greatly increase the storage power of digital cameras, hand-held 
computers and other small electronics devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital cameras equipped with IBM's 340-megabyte drive could  
store more than 300 photos -- about five times the capacity of 
cameras using ``flash'' memory chips. Photographers could tote an 
entire vacation's images instead of downloading to a computer to 
free up more space. And users of portable music players could enjoy 
6 hours of music downloaded off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the technology is expensive, costing $495 for a hard disk  
and an adapter that enables users to use the device with various 
electronics products. In addition, the device's moving parts are 
susceptible to damage during rough handling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily consider MicroDrive a viable option for  
cameras,'' said Kevin Kane, another analyst with International 
Data. ``If you drop it, there's a good chance you're going to lose 
what's on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But IBM spokeswoman Susan McIntyre was optimistic, noting that  
dozens of makers of cameras, computers and portable music players 
have expressed interest in the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect to replace the small, high-capacity storage  
devices. But we expect to play a major role,'' McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another contender is Iomega Corp., which recently introduced a  
relatively inexpensive product, called ``Clik.'' It costs about $10 
for a disk that stores up to 40 digital images. Drives that enable 
people to use the disks in cameras and computers range in price 
from $200 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
	The inexpensive disks could help popularize them as a method for  
on-the-go people to store images and data, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly all of those things have strengths and weaknesses and  
they are being used in different spots,'' Amatruda said. But in the 
end, he added, affordability could determine which catches on with 
most consumers.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Out Today With Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza will have to wait at least another  
day to start a new hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza's career-long 24-game hitting streak, which tied a Mets  
record, ended Wednesday night against the Florida Marlins after the 
New York catcher left the game with a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza sat out Thursday's game against the Marlins and hopes to  
be back in the lineup for a weekend showdown in Atlanta against the 
first-place Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just one of those things that happen,'' Piazza said.  
``At this point, we just want to give it a day. I feel a lot better 
than I did last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza received treatment for the injury. He iced his neck and  
spent time in the whirlpool to relieve the feeling of whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was hit under his helmet by Bruce Aven's backswing in the  
seventh inning. He remained in the game and fell over while trying 
to catch a foul pop in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I forgot who it was, but I'll have to watch the tape before we  
play them next time,'' Piazza said of being hit by the bat. ``It 
made a sick sound. I was a little bit slow after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza left the game after grounding out in the eighth inning.  
He finished 0-for-4 and tied with Hubie Brooks for the longest 
hitting streak in Mets history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the streak was that big of a deal,'' Piazza  
said. ``I didn't worry about it. I thought it was flattering to be 
associated with Hubie Brooks. It was fun while it lasted, but it is 
probably good it is over so we can get back to concentrating on 
winning games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pratt, who has only 79 at-bats this year, got a rare start  
at catcher in Piazza's place. Pratt has had little playing time 
since Piazza returned from a knee injury April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Todd could be getting a lot more playing time on another  
team,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I have empathy for that, 
because there were lots of times when I thought that was the case 
in my career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good defensive catcher, calls a good game and can hit.  
Of the 30 teams, a lot don't have one of those guys, much less 
two.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR GROVE, Fla. (AP) -- Grace Institute Bible College &AMP;  
Seminary is conservative, fundamental and evangelical. It even uses 
some of the same texts as the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a key difference. Most of Grace Institute's  
students and faculty are homosexuals. Its founder, the Rev. Jerry 
Stephenson, insists that being a gay or lesbian fundamentalist is 
not a contradiction in terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sat down, and Jerry Falwell didn't know who I was, and we  
started talking theology, he'd be taking me out to dinner and we'd 
have a wonderful time,'' Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other Christian conservatives, Stephenson believes in  
a literal heaven and hell and being saved and born again. But on 
another point, he breaks with many fundamentalists: It is belief 
that ``we can be gay and lesbian and still be Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson, 42, received a conservative Christian education at  
Trinity International University in Miami and North Florida Baptist 
Theological Seminary in Jacksonville where he earned a doctorate in 
theology. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a Southern Baptist minister for 15 years, all the time  
struggling with his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson spent two years in a group called Worthy Creations at  
the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale. It attempts 
to convert gays to heterosexuality. He proclaimed himself ``cured'' 
and worked with another conversion group in Key West before 
realizing he had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time I was engaged to be married,'' Stephenson said.  
``She knew and I knew that all the counseling in the world wasn't 
going to change my inside feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He left the Southern Baptists in 1990 and then taught at Trinity  
International until his homosexuality was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to the Florida Panhandle about a year ago, he took a  
teaching job in a public school and opened Grace Institute so 
homosexuals could openly earn degrees in Biblical studies, 
Christian counseling, church administration and music. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no conservative, evangelical, fundamental schools  
out there that would take us unless we hid in the closet,'' 
Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes for about 10 students are held two nights a week at the  
Family of God Worship Center in Cedar Grove, a small town adjacent 
to Panama City. Stephenson said the center is affiliated with the 
conservative, predominantly homosexual Alliance of Christian 
Churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 25 other students take courses by correspondence or at  
satellite locations. These have been, or soon will be, operating in 
Phoenix; Denver; Ontario, Calif.; Dayton, Ohio; Lexington, Ky.; 
Wichita, Kan.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; and the Florida cities of Fort 
Lauderdale and Daytona Beach, Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional Christian conservatives condemn homosexual relations  
as a sin and maintain gays and lesbians cannot gain salvation 
without repenting. The Rev. D. James Kennedy, senior minister at 
Coral Ridge Presbyterian, said someone can no more be a Christian 
homosexual than a Christian adulterer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Bible does not teach that homosexuality is a sin, it  
doesn't teach that anything is a sin,'' Kennedy said from Fort 
Lauderdale. ``It teaches it over and over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson contends such teachings are the result of  
misinterpreting the Bible or taking passages out of context. In 
some cases, he said, the Bible has been mistranslated. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot build the Bible and totally understand the Bible  
just from the pages of the Bible,'' he said. ``We have to look at 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace Institute teaches creationism, but Stephenson concedes  
Charles Darwin ``was not totally a lunatic.'' Things do evolve, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something had to happen for there to be black people, white  
people, Chinese people, Indian people,'' Stephenson said. ``They 
all didn't just stem from Adam and Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for sexual orientation, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the Adam and Eve story. We also believe in the  
Adam and Steve story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is room for disagreement, said the Rev. Tom Gashlin,  
Family of God's pastor and a Grace Institute teacher. He said his 
Bible doctrine class uses three texts by accepted conservative 
biblical scholars that differ on the second coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Jerry Falwell to say that what he says is the only right  
interpretation, or any of these guys, is arrogant,'' Gashlin said. 
Falwell declined comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
	The key issue is salvation, Stephenson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can argue about scripture until we're blue in the face, but  
the question we've got to ask more than anything is `What is the 
thing that will allow me to have eternal life and go to heaven?' '' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson cited John 3:16: ``For God so loved the world, that  
he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him 
should not perish, but have everlasting life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the whosoever,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me with my fundamentalist friends when they would  
say, `You're going to hell for being gay.' That's not what the 
Bible says. When we accept Jesus Christ, he is ours.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 154.82 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sank today as investors' nervousness over  
interest rates spread to the outlook for second-quarter corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 154.82 at 10,512.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 20.29 at 1,312.77, and the Nasdaq composite 
index fell 39.20 to 2,558.92. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed Wednesday, semiconductor maker Advanced  
Micro Devices said it expects its second-quarter loss to be far 
worse than analysts had expected, as microprocessor prices have 
collapsed and the company has lost market share to industry leader 
Intel. AMD fell 1 1/4 to 16 15/16 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also late Wednesday, Micron Technology Inc. said it lost 10  
cents a share in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts had expected 
the chip maker to break even in the quarter. Micron shares were 
down 3 13/16 to 40 1/8 today. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings weakness wasn't confined to technology companies.  
Goodyear, a component of the Dow, said today its second-quarter 
profits will fall well below analysts' expectations. Still, its 
shares were up 3/16 at 56 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor results helped deflate Wall Street's high hopes for  
corporate earnings for the second quarter, which concludes at the 
end of this month. While stocks have sputtered in the month since 
the Federal Reserve first indicated it might raise interest rates, 
many analysts have looked to corporate earnings as a potential 
salvation for the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second-quarter earnings still look like they'll be strong, but  
there won't be the stream of upside surprises that we got used to 
in the first quarter,'' said Brian Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter beat Wall Street  
estimates in its earnings report today. Like several of its rival 
brokerages, however, the firm's stock slipped, losing 1 3/8 to 91 7/8 
amid interest rate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The continuing slide of the bond market also pressured stocks  
today. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 6.16 percent. The 
increasingly high yield of bonds has presented investors with an 
attractive alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, a bond market rally helped stocks,'' Belski said.  
``This week, that support is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 7-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 468.8 million 
shares, well behind Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 8.33 at 622.42, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.80 at 765.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of small  
companies, was down 3.64 at 443.40.

<HEADLINE> NHL Draft Is Strong on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Don't expect the Atlanta Thrashers to stockpile  
scorers Friday in the NHL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when they pick their 26 players, the emphasis will be on  
defense and goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a whole lot of guys who scored a bunch of goals,''  
on the list of available players, said Atlanta general manager Don 
Waddell. ``Maybe the few that are on there are older players who 
are carrying big salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a mock draft done by the Thrashers after the NHL released the  
list of unprotected players on Tuesday, the highest goal scorer 
chosen had 11 last season, Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	That means such unprotected players as Wendel Clark of Detroit,  
who had 32 goals, Ray Sheppard of Carolina and Joe Murphy of San 
Jose, who had 25 each, and Derek King of Toronto, who had 24, 
aren't likely to become Thrashers. In fact, only six unprotected 
players had 20 goals or more last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a marketplace where we have to win a fan base,''  
Waddell said. ``We're not going to score a lot of goals, but, 
hopefully, we'll play a style that's entertaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers must choose at least three goalies, eight  
defensemen and 13 forwards. Since defense is the strongest position 
in the draft, the other two players to bring the total to 26 will 
be either two defensemen or a defenseman and a goalie, Waddell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will lose one player except for Nashville, which  
doesn't lose any because it was an expansion team last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the better known unprotected players are Paul Coffey of  
Carolina, Dale Hunter of Colorado, Guy Carbonneau of Dallas, Igor 
Larionov of Detroit, and goalies Grant Fuhr of St. Louis, Mike 
Vernon of San Jose and Ron Tugnutt of Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta already has its starting goaltender, trading last  
week for Damian Rhodes, who had a 2.44 goals against average in 45 
games with Ottawa last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell would like to draft younger goalies, hoping to find a  
backup who ``can challenge Damian Rhodes because I also believe 
it's good competition to have somebody who can push your number one 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltending may be critical if, as expected, the Thrashers are  
short on offense. But Waddell could pick up some scorers by trading 
some of Friday's choices between the expansion draft and Saturday's 
entry draft in which Atlanta has the second pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would see us making five to six deals,'' he said. ``We also  
have an obligation to make sure we keep the best players for our 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell anticipates two players in the entry draft can play  
immediately in the NHL -- center Patrik Stefan, who spent the past 
two seasons with Long Beach of the International Hockey League, and 
right wing Pavel Brendl, who had 73 goals in 68 games for Calgary 
of the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	``This pick is very important to the organization for a number  
of reasons,'' Waddell said. ``We're not actively shopping our pick 
(in trade talks), by any means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His immediate focus is on putting together a team of current NHL  
players in the expansion draft. While the emphasis should be on 
young players who can develop, Waddell said that's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that we need a balance. Three or four veteran players  
that we bring in to be the guidance for our young hockey players is 
the key,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest (challenge), I think, is just getting it all  
going,'' he added. ``We're in it for the long haul. We have solid 
ownership, a new building, the whole bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And soon he'll have his players.

<HEADLINE> CBOT Members OK Alliance With Eurex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Board of Trade members have  
overwhelmingly approved a broad alliance with a rival 
all-electronic exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's members voted 750-126 in favor of the deal with the  
Frankfurt-based Eurex -- less than six months after narrowly 
rejecting a similar alliance. The combination will allow the two 
exchanges to cross-trade their contracts electronically starting in 
the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote represents a change of heart for the membership.  
Members had been hesitant to stray from the Board of Trade's 
151-year-old tradition of open outcry, which lets traders yell and 
gesture to set the prices for everything from corn to U.S. Treasury 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance will secure our global leadership position,  
strengthen our world-class trading system for open outcry and 
electronic markets and bring global business opportunities to our 
members,'' Board of Trade Chairman David P. Brennan said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan urged a go-slow approach to an alliance with Eurex in  
December during his campaign for the board's chairmanship. That 
platform helped him edge out incumbent Patrick Arbor, a vocal 
supporter of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brennan reversed course this spring after a power struggle  
within the leadership ranks left his position weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trading firms have migrated to computer-based trading,  
saying it is easier and cheaper because they no longer have to keep 
expensive staff at individual exchanges. Board of Trade competitors 
have moved quickly to profit from the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision brings us another step forward in our endeavor  
to build a bridge across the Atlantic together with our American 
colleagues,'' Eurex CEO Jorg Franke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Brennan urged approval of the Eurex alliance and said  
a decision to ultimately abandon the exchange's own electronic 
trading platform, known as Project A, would save money. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal between the two exchanges will cost $50 million over the  
next 18 months, but developing a new screen-based system alone 
would cost far more, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange also is reconsidering becoming a for-profit venture  
to provide cash and governance to allow for quicker decisions on 
changes in the future.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Top '90s Stamps Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People talk into their cell phones while  
walking the streets, while driving their cars, while riding the 
bus, while eating in restaurants -- it seems like cellphones are 
everywhere. Now, they'll even be on a postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to pick 15 subjects for a set of stamps commemorating the  
1990s, Americans' No. 1 choice was cellular phones, which got 
214,449 votes during balloting in May, the Postal Service announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A close second was another piece of popular culture that, at  
least for a time, also seemed to be everywhere -- the movie 
``Titanic.'' It was the choice of 210,154 voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990s stamp set will be released next April.  
</P>
<P>
	The voting was the last in a series of ballots in which the  
public was asked to name the people or topics for sets of 15 stamps 
recalling each of the last five decades of the century. Subjects 
for the first five decades were picked by a postal advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Celebrate The Century program has given the American  
public a voice in how many of us will remember the 20th century in 
years to come,'' said Postmaster General William Henderson. ``This 
one-of-a-kind collection brings together postage stamps and 100 
years of American history, celebrating a nation bound by universal 
mail service and founded by great achievements and achievers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides cell phones and ``Titanic,'' the winning subjects for  
the 1990s set are: recovering species, 193,313 votes; World Wide 
Web, 191,292; movie ``Jurassic Park,'' 184,370; computer art and 
graphics, 170,449; sport utility vehicles, 164,058; Gulf War, 
160,687; virtual reality, 156,944; 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Special Olympics, 155,802; baseball records, 151,511;  
extreme sports, 151,090; improving education, 141,124; television 
series ``Seinfeld,'' 140,710 and return to space, 138,984. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the public chose subjects to memorialize the 1980s.  
Video games received the most votes, followed by the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Subjects picked to 
commemorate the 1970s include the yellow Smiley Face, ``Sesame 
Street,'' disco music and Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1960s, the public's selections included the first moon  
walk, the integrated circuit and lasers. And the 1950s stamp 
subjects determined by popular vote included drive-in movies, 
desegregating public schools and ``I Love Lucy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subjects from the 1990s ballot that failed to collect enough  
votes to get on a stamp were cultural diversity, active older 
Americans, sustained economic growth, Broadway musicals, 
contemporary architecture, women's sports, inline skating, junior 
golf; dinosaur fossil discoveries, interplanetary exploration, gene 
therapy, increased popularity of coffee, community service, museum 
attendance and home offices.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Three-time runner-up Goran Ivanisevic  
is back at Wimbledon and into the third round for the seventh time 
in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope springs eternal for the Croatian.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody tells me, it's about time'' he wins, he said after  
beating Australian Sandon Stolle in four sets on Thursday. ``I 
think I'm the next one they (fans) would like to see win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanisevic lost a dramatic five-set final to Pete Sampras a year  
ago and was also runner-up in '94 and '92. And he's always highly 
quotable, partly on the strength of his slightly fractured English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I think I'm playing good tennis, very concentrated. I'm  
not losing my mind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one too short,'' he added. ``If I get another  
chance, hopefully that time I should win.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUR GENERATION:* Andre Agassi is getting nostalgic about  
American tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our generation is at the tail end,'' he said after beating  
Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. ``We're old enough now to realize 
that there are a lot of great memories that we've given to each 
other -- me, Jim (Courier), Pete (Sampras), Michael (Chang), Todd 
(Martin), all the guys on and off the court ... I think now we wish 
we would have done more.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG MAC:* Playing mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Steffi Graf  
was John McEnroe's second choice. His first was playing doubles on 
the U.S. Davis Cup team, which hasn't worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, I try to stay as far away as possible from  
mixed doubles,'' said McEnroe, who is also doubling as a tennis 
commentator for NBC. ``I haven't played mixed doubles in a major in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't one of my priorities. Even this year I was hoping to  
beg my way onto the Davis Cup team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Wimbledon champion said he had ``kidded about''  
teaming with Graf, but hadn't played on grass in years ``except one 
day last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a bit of a crap shoot,'' he added. ``But the  
upside seemed to outweigh the negatives. ... It won't be easy 
because we'll have high expectations, but hopefully we'll have some 
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS:* After ousting top-seeded and top-ranked Martina Hingis  
and then gaining a place in Wimbledon's third round, 16-year-old 
Jelena Dokic is now a 25-1 bet to go all the way and win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualifier, Dokic came into the tournament as a 100-1 outsider  
with bookmaker Ladbrokes. But her amazing 6-2, 6-0 victory over 
Hingis on the Centre Court has sent her odds tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 6-0, 4-6, 8-6 victory over Katarina Studenikova of  
Slovakia on Thursday, the Serb-born Australian is tied with 
17th-seeded Anna Kournikova at 25-1. Seven-time champion Steffi 
Graf is the 2-1 favorite, Venus Williams is 4-1, defending champion 
Jana Novotna is 5-1, Lindsay Davenport is 6-1 and Monica Seles 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *0-0-0-0:* German Marlene Weingartner was drubbed 6-0, 6-0 on  
Wednesday by Monica Seles. It didn't get better on Thursday as she 
lost again 6-0, 6-0 playing doubles with Maria Fernanda Landa 
against Americans Lindsay Davenport and Corina Morariu. Without 
winning a game, she still picked up 7,920 pounds, or about $12,672, 
at Wimbledon. In 20 singles matches this season, she's lost nine 
sets 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Former stars like Martina Navratilova and  
Billie Jean King are wearing a silver pin to show their support for 
equal money for men and women in the four Grand Slam tournaments. 
Navratilova has lashed out at Wimbledon chairman John Curry, saying 
she was amazed at the club's ``stubbornness'' on the issue. ... 
London's The Express newspaper says Martina Hingis' falling out 
with her mother has to do with the larger role her mother's 
boyfriend -- Mario Widmer -- is playing in the 18-year-old star's 
business deals. Other reports say she's angry at her mother for 
inviting Dokic to practice at their home in Switzerland, apparently 
wanting to take the young Australian under her coaching wing. ... 
Boris Becker and Michael Stich want to buy their old lockers at 
Wimbledon. The dressing room will be moved to a new player complex. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AWARD WINNER:* Bud Collins, a Boston Globe correspondent and  
NBC television commentator, received the Red Smith Award on 
Thursday from The Associated Press Sports Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought writing sports was fun,'' Collins said via  
satellite from Wimbledon to about 150 editors and writers who 
watched him on a big screen at the national convention in Phoenix. 
``It was better than working for a living. It is a wonderful, 
wonderful way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how flattered and honored I am, not only  
because this award was named for the great Red Smith, but because 
it was voted on by my peers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Rob, accepted the award on his behalf.  
</P>
<P>
	Collins has written for the Globe since 1963 and is best known  
for his tennis coverage. But he has written about everything from 
baseball to boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, he led the way for writers showcasing their talents as  
broadcasters when he left the Globe as a full-time employee to do 
television work. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who describes himself as a ``scribbler and a babbler,''  
was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Smith Award recognizes writers who have made ``major  
contributions to sports journalism.'' APSE established the award in 
1981 and named Smith, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The 
New York Times, the first winner.

<HEADLINE> Source: AOL, MicroWorkz in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is in talks with MicroWorkz  
Computer Corp., a maker of $200 personal computers, to offer its 
Internet service on desktop machines that don't use Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, a source close to the negotiations said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, while described as preliminary, could have important  
implications in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial in Washington, 
where the last witness finished testifying Thursday and where a 
news report about the talks was introduced as last-minute evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its defense, Microsoft has argued that AOL's $10  
billion purchase of rival Netscape Communications Corp. illustrates 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust that federal 
intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one possible result of the talks, AOL could offer MicroWorkz  
computers at easily affordable prices or even give them away to 
people who agree to subscribe to its service. That could vastly 
expand AOL's subscriber base, currently at 17 million, and make AOL 
machines an important new rival to computers running on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL-MicroWorkz talks were first reported Thursday by the  
MSNBC Internet news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said AOL  
initiated the talks regarding MicroWorkz's inexpensive PCs as a way 
to try to sell its Internet service to the millions of Americans 
who haven't yet bought computers because of the expense. The 
negotiations come amid a major ``AOL Anywhere'' initiative to bring 
the online service to a range of computers and electronics gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Latman, chief executive of MicroWorkz, said the company was  
talking with AOL about a potential cross-marketing arrangement, but 
declined to elaborate. AOL spokesman Jim Whitney would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations comes two days after Seattle-based  
MicroWorkz introduced its iToaster computer at the PC Expo trade 
show in New York. The desktop computer uses a non-Windows operating 
system made by Be Inc., includes non-Microsoft word processing, 
spreadsheets and other programs, and easily jumps users to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to AOL possibly offering PCs to its subscribers,  
another scenario would involve AOL being prominently promoted in 
computers sold by MicroWorkz, aiming to entice users to sign up for 
its offering of information, news, chat and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL's service is available on Apple Macintosh machines,  
another non-Windows computer, Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the 
default browser for Macintosh users to get online. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL deal could help Microsoft, which sells the operating  
system that runs 85 percent of the world's personal computers, 
bolster its argument that the Internet and new technologies 
represent a major threat to its software business. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL agreement to offer PCs to its subscribers also could seem  
to contradict statements by an AOL executive in trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial's final phase, Microsoft called as a hostile  
witness AOL executive David Colburn and questioned him about his 
company's plans to develop an ``AOL PC'' that won't use Microsoft's 
flagship Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn testified that plans for ``building a PC-type  
functionality that really is an alternative to Windows are largely 
dead. I don't know of any current ones (plans) going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara on Thursday noted Colburn's  
testimony and then showed the judge a news report about AOL's talks 
with Microworkz. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson raised 
his eyebrows and appeared to take notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say you haven't brought me current'' on industry  
developments, Jackson told Microsoft's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Klein insisted outside the  
courtroom that news of the discussions between AOL and Microworkz 
will not adversely affect the Justice Department's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no dent in the case, that's clear,'' Klein said,  
noting that Microsoft's own economics expert testified this week 
that the nation's largest computer makers have no viable 
alternative to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Microsoft lawyers labored long and hard to try to invent a  
threat from AOL,'' said Stephen Houck of the New York attorney 
general's office, the lead lawyer for the 19 states suing Microsoft 
with the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Lewinsky Questioned on Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors have questioned Monica  
Lewinsky as part of their wiretapping case against Linda Tripp, 
whose tapes of telephone conversations with the former White House 
intern triggered the presidential sex scandal, The Baltimore Sun 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland forbids anyone from taping phone conversations without  
the other party's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors turned over Ms. Lewinsky's answers last week to a  
Howard County grand jury investigating Ms. Tripp, the newspaper 
said, quoting unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp secretly taped conversations in which Ms. Lewinsky  
discussed her affair with President Clinton. Ms. Tripp gave the 
tapes to Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who detailed the 
affair in evidence he presented to Congress. The president was 
impeached, but escaped removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli and one of Ms. Lewinsky's  
lawyers, Nathaniel Speights, refused to tell the Sun whether Ms. 
Lewinsky had been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp has admitted in federal grand jury testimony that she  
taped Ms. Lewinsky in 1997 after she was warned that doing so was 
illegal in Maryland. Montanarelli has been seeking those tapes 
since the state's case began last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp, who lives in Columbia, received federal immunity for  
her testimony, but she is not spared from state prosecution. The 
maximum penalty is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each 
wiretapping offense.
