<HEADLINE> UAE, U.S. Close to Concluding F-16 Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and the United States are close to concluding a deal on the
UAE's buying of 80 sophisticated U.S. F-16 war planes.
</P>
<P>
The expected 7-billion-U.S.-dollar deal was announced here on
Sunday by U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley, currently on a
visit to the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Daley said that the F-16 deal
is underway and that the planes will be the best the UAE will ever
own.
</P>
<P>
"The F-16 deal is for our mutual benefit and we are getting
closer to its conclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which has been on the table for a long time, has been
held up by the United States' reluctance to hand over the source
codes, or master keys, to the planes' technologically advanced
weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said the U.S. Congress had approved the
sale, but it still needs the nod of the White House.
</P>
<P>
Once signed, the deal are expected to provide 30,000 Americans
with job opportunities, while the UAE will be the first air force
outside of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to acquire the
planes.

<HEADLINE> Telecom 99 + Interactive 99 Attracts about 200,000 Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Telecom 99 + Interactive 99 has
attracted around 200,000 visitors to Palexpo in Geneva to see the
latest technology and services on display from more than 1,100
exhibitors from the telecommunications, information technology and
audio-visual entertainment fields, according to a ITU press
release here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
TELECOM 99 + INTERACTIVE 99, the eighth world
telecommunications Exhibition and Forum, hosted by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) from 10 to 17 October,
was the meeting place for the whole communications society, and
was the ITU's most successful event ever.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors met to do business and discuss the issues that
will shape the future path of an industry which is now worth well
over 1 trillion dollars U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
TELECOM 99 + INTERACTIVE 99, more than any event which preceded
it, demonstrated the increasing importance of telecommunications
in the modern world. It was attended by visitors that were rated
by exhibitors as being of both a higher level and quality than
ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
TELECOM 99 + INTERACTIVE 99 itself was different from its
predecessors in being fully online. The show information was
available to all participants by means of more than 300 Telecom
Information Kiosks (TIKs) which logged more than a million hits
during the first five days of the event. The TELECOM part of the
ITU's web site registered more than 10 million hits during the
first two weeks of October and much of the press coverage achieved
for the event came from users of the web rather than journalists
at the show.
</P>
<P>
The event closed with a weekend dedicated to the Internet the
World Telecom Internet Days. These two days, open to the general
public, reinforced the enormous importance of the Internet in the
world today and provided a bridge into the new millennium,
featuring debates, demonstrations and a chance for people to see
the shape of the future.
</P>
<P>
The world telecommunications exhibition will be held in Geneva
in October 2003.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes "Result-Oriented" dialogue with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will welcome
"unconditional, equitable and result-oriented" dialogue with India
to solve their problems including the long-standing Kashmir issue,
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a 25-minute televised policy statement to the nation,
General Musharraf announced a unilateral military de-escalation on
Pakistan's international border with India and initiating the
return of armed forces moved to the border in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan desires that the situation on its borders with
India and on the Line of Control, which divides the disputed area
of Kashmir, should remain "calm and peaceful".
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the step of de-escalation will serve
as a meaningful confidence building measure.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf allotted a major part of his exposition on the
country's foreign policy to the relations with India, its
arch-rival against which it had fought three times in the past 52
years.
</P>
<P>
The general congratulated Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on his assumption of office and welcomed his offer for
friendly relations with Pakistan, saying Pakistan positively
reciprocate that.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that South Asia has unfortunately remained marred
in conflict and economic deprivations during the 20th century and
said Pakistan and Indian "can change this scenario".
</P>
<P>
To achieve this objective, he said, both the countries must
sincerely work towards resolving their problems, especially the
core issue of Jammu and Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries has just turned a leaf of military conflict
in the disputed region of Kashmir this summer when Pakistani
troops and Islamic militants fought with Indian troops along the
Line of Control.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf urged India to honor the U.N. resolutions on the
Kashmir issue, "end its repression of Kashmiri people" and
"respect their fundamental rights".
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan will continue its "unflinching moral,
diplomatic and political support" to the Kashmiri people in their
"struggle to achieve their right of self-determination".
</P>
<P>
After a coup on Tuesday General Musharraf assumed the position
of the chief executive of the country and will head a six-member
National Security Council which will exercise the supreme power of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Incident Won't Harm Israel-Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prince Hassan said
here Sunday that the strong Israeli-Jordanian ties will not be
disrupted by minor incidents, in an apparent reference to the
Hebron harassment incident.
</P>
<P>
"(There is) no peace process without events, without
difficulties. At one moment we're happier, the next moment less
happy...But that doesn't mean we'll lose our hearts," Hassan told
reporters after talks with Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
On October 9, a group of Jordanian legislators were heckled by
Jewish settlers while visiting West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has lodged strong protest over the humiliation and
demanded a thorough investigation. It has also deferred Israeli
Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen's visit to Amman.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to smooth things over, Israel has expressed
regrets over the incident and hoped that the bilateral ties would
not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Jordanian counterpart last week, Knesset
(parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg called the attitude of the
settlers "unacceptable" and hoped "appropriate measures" would be
taken against the offenders.
</P>
<P>
Hassan arrived in Israel Sunday to take part in a two-day
international conference in Tel Aviv to mark the fifth
anniversary of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Hassan, Weizman described the incident as "a
cold," which he said is an illness that will disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan have been maintaining relatively close ties
since they signed a peace treaty in 1994. Israel sees its
relations with Amman vitally important because of Jordan's
geographic location and its role in the Middle East peace
process.

Welfare, Florence Chitauro said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors who went on strike on September 21 demanding better
salaries and working conditions, could not be paid for services
they did not provide, Chitauro told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
For the month they have been on strike, the health delivery
system, already crippled by inadequate funding, has been
devastated by the shortage of doctors.
</P>
<P>
While government officials refuse to provide statistics,
numerous deaths are reportedly being recorded at hospitals
everyday, purely due to the strike.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro, who for the past week has been involved in unfruitful
talks with officials of the Health Ministry, parliamentarians and
the doctors, repeated the call to the junior doctors to return to
work while the government reviews the salaries of all civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that the government is committed to
improving conditions in the health sector but it is not willing to
attend to the doctors' demands in isolation to those of other
government workers.
</P>
<P>
"It must be noted that the government has submissions from
various sectors of the civil service and also within the health
sector all requesting that their salary structure be adjusted,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the doctors to join other civil servants in the
negotiating forum where she said salary review talks are at an
advanced stage for inclusion into the 2000 budget to be announced
by Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa next Thursday but only
effective from January 1 next year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Consult With Mubarak Mideast Peace-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is to visit Egypt Monday to consult with President Hosni Mubarak
the Middle East peace process, the Palestinian ambassador to Egypt
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zohdi el Kodra said that the two leaders will discuss the
obstacles that block the smooth implementation of the revised Wye
accord signed on September 5 in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of the continued coordination between the
two leaders on the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, el
Kodra told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Due to disputes over the arrangement for security issues,
Israel decided Saturday to postpone the opening of a safe passage
and the construction of the Gaza seaport.
</P>
<P>
The opening, scheduled for Sunday, of the land link between the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza and the West Bank has been delayed for
the second time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, as president of the first Arab country to sign a peace
treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority and the Palestinian people
appreciate the Egyptian president's constant efforts to support
the Palestinians' position in the peace process and their
struggles to recover their legitimate rights, El Kodra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also to hold talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Monday on the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the outcome of
a meeting on international aid for the Palestinians recently held
in Tokyo, Japan, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Issue Dominates GCC, U.S. Economic Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The trade issue dominated the
joint economic forum between Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries and the United States which was held here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by U.S. Secretary of Commerce William
Daley, who began a two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates on
Saturday, his accompanying business delegation and representatives
from GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the meeting, UAE Minister of Economy and Commerce
Sheikh Fahim bin Sultan Al Qasimi made a keynote speech. He said
trade between the GCC states and the U.S. is crucial for both
parties - the U.S. secures more than 20 percent of its oil from
the GCC states, while the 1998 value of U.S. exports to GCC states
exceeded 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. is the GCC's second largest trading
partner after the European Union, as far as GCC imports are
concerned. GCC countries doubled their imports from the U.S. in
just four years from 8.6 billion dollars in 1994 to 15.3 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, complained about the difficulties GCC
countries are facing in accessing the U.S. market, which include
the quota system, complicated quality standards and high transport
costs.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 estimates of GCC exports to the U.S. totaled less than
9 billion dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of more than 6
billion dollars in favor of the U.S., Sheikh Fahim said.
</P>
<P>
The minister suggested measures to enhance GCC-U.S. trade
relations, including greater participation by U.S. businessmen in
economic activities of the GCC, particularly in privatization and
private sector activities, utilizing GCC states' geographical
location to promote U.S. exports in other parts of the world,
concluding agreements on avoidance of double taxation on personal
and corporation incomes and holding of business conferences and
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts made by GCC countries to integrate their
economies, particularly plans for a unified customs tariff, would
greatly help U.S.-GCC trade.
</P>
<P>
On the economic conditions of the GCC countries, he predicted a
positive growth this year due to the recovery in oil
prices. "That will allow governments to increase spending," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Chirac Hold Telephone Talks on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his French counterpart, Jacques Chirac, held a telephone
conversation Sunday on Chechnya and a number of international
issues.
</P>
<P>
The federal authorities' aim in Chechnya is to "eliminate the
seat of international terrorism 9991 to bring back the republic to
the constitutional field of Russia and to ensure normal life for
the population of Chechnya and the adjacent territories," the
Kremlin press service quoted Yeltsin as saying during the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
Russia "is using adequate ways and means as regards the gangs
in Chechnya and "is doing everything possible to help the civilian
population, including those who have temporarily left the territory
of Chechnya," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also informed Chirac how the situation in North
Caucasus is developing "considering the interest displayed by the
French head of state," the Interfax news agency quoted the Kremlin
press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, in his turn, expressed understanding of the Russian
leadership's position and reaffirmed France's invariable adherence
to the principles of the territorial integrity of the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
He voiced confidence that the Russian authorities will ensure a
solution to the problem of Chechnya, stressing the significance of
the political settlement through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Besides Chechnya, the two presidents also discussed some global
issues. Particularly, they expressed common concern over the U.S.
Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of
nuclear weapons (CTBT) and over Washington's intention to revise
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the need to coordinate efforts of the permanent
U.N. Security Council members toward overcoming this trend, which
is dangerous to international stability.

<HEADLINE> UK Denies "Safety Flaws" of Secret Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The British Government denied on
Sunday that a nuclear fuel plant processing radioactive material
for the Ministry of Defense was at risk of a Japanese-style
accident, after the Sunday Times newspaper claimed that the secret
plant near Derby had been revealed to have "serious safety flaws".
</P>
<P>
The plant was not known to local residents and leaked company
documents showed the nature of the fuel could lead to a
"criticality accident" like the one that exposed 69 people to
radiation at a processing plant in Tokaimura, Japan, on September
30, Sunday Times said.
</P>
<P>
But British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said the plant had
been given a clean bill of health by government inspectors and
should not be shut down, as had been demanded by anti-nuclear
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
"Those concerns have been addressed by the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate and they have given the plant an
entirely clean bill of health," he told Sky television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the inspectorate last week said that "not only is
the plant entirely safe, but equally the procedures for any
emergency evacuation were entirely in order."
</P>
<P>
Rolls Royce confirmed it processes nuclear fuel for the defense
ministry at the plant, but it had no knowledge of an internal
document, and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), which
oversees the civil plant which was commissioned in 1994-95,
regularly inspects the Raynesway facility, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Health and Safety Executive, of which the
NII is part, said the site had been inspected last on October 5
and 6, and "there are no concerns from our side in terms of levels
of safety."

<HEADLINE> Masses Hail Chief Executive's Address: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- People belonging to various
walks of life have hailed the address Sunday night by Chief
Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf and termed it an address of a
true Pakistani and a patriotic soldier.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Amjad Hussain, a
citizen from Rawalpindi as saying, "I am very glad that the chief
executive has announced to take strict action against the loan
defaulters."
</P>
<P>
"The nation has heaved a sigh of relief following the dismissal
of Nawaz regime and now they are confident that all the looters
and plunderers would be brought to book," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Musharraf has very rightly said that Pakistan will not
return to sham democracy," said Ayub (only one name), another
citizen from the city, adding that it was the so called democracy
which brought corrupt politicians to the helm of affairs who
plundered the national exchequer.
</P>
<P>
"I salute the commitment which Chief Executive Gen. Pervez
Musharraf expressed in putting the country on the right track,"
said Khalid Gondal, a lecturer.
</P>
<P>
"His address was an address of a true patriot who was ready to
wage Jihad (holy war) against all social ills and injustices," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the National Security Council is a step
in right direction," said Khalid Mehmood, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Pervez Musharraf has given a clear signal to all
religious leaders to forge unity and preach brotherhood," said a
shopkeeper, adding that "it would greatly help in establishing
sectarian harmony in the country."
</P>
<P>
"From his (the chief executive) speech I am certain that he
shall make Pakistan an honorable and prosperous country in the
international community," said Ch. Nazir Hussain, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former president of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)
Arif Habib has expressed hope that the address by Musharraf will
bring a long lasting and positive impact on the socio-economic
conditions of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issues discussed by the chief executive
reflect the wishes of the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the proposed National Security Council (NSC)
was much-awaited, Habib said, hoping that the NSC would definitely
take steps to improve the economic conditions and boost the morale
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to good governance, Habib said that it was another
area which needed to be addressed and hoped that the performance
of state institutions will be improved.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos: Greece's Sovereign Rights Are </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos stressed Sunday that Greece's sovereign rights were
non-negotiable and this had for years been the touchstone of the
Greek government policy.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki
while commenting to the statements made by Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou in Finland, the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the Tampere European Union (EU) summit, where EU leaders
agreed that countries should recognize judicial decisions of other
union members, boost cross-border policing and strengthen border
controls against illegal immigration, Papandreou reportedly said
that Greece was not dogmatic about relinguishing sovereign rights
to the EU.
</P>
<P>
No one could create the impression that there was an issue
stemming from this principle, Tsohatzopoulos said, adding that
what was important was not the attempt to exploit some
misunderstanding or misinterpretation but the clear stand on what
was truly non-negotiable.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Orders Doctors Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Sunday regretted the loss of lives due to the month-long
strike by junior doctors and ordered the doctors back to work.
</P>
<P>
The government at this time has not tried to use a heavy hand
of declaring the strike illegal and firing the doctors because it
does not want to lose them, Mugabe said at a church service.
</P>
<P>
The details of the deaths caused by doctors' strike are not
known.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed surprise at the continued strike and
accused the doctors of "changing the goal posts" after initially
demanding increases in call allowances only which have already
been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that his government would completely overhaul the
salary structures of all public servants, not health staff only.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the new salary structures to be effective in
January next year would result in the doubling of salaries of the
doctors among other civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot announce the new salaries now, but they will be
quite favorable," the president said, adding that the doctors
"will get double or nearly double what they are earning."
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe hoped that an amicable solution would be
reached within the next week to relieve pressure on senior doctors
and consultants who are failing to cope with the high work load.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will form a
six-member National Security Council comprising of the chief
executive, three service chiefs, experts of legal, finance,
foreign and international affairs, Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In his half-hour televised speech to the nation, Musharraf said
the martial law will not be imposed in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the constitution has been temporarily held in abeyance
and made it clear that this is not a martial law but only an other
part towards democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces have no intention to stay in charge any
longer than absolutely necessity to pave the way for the democracy
to flourish in Pakistan," assured the general.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of his government will be to build
national confidence and morale, strengthen federation, remove
inter-provincial disharmony and restore national cohesion, revive
economy and restore investors' confidence, ensure law and order
and dispense speedy justice, deploiticise state institutions,
devolute the powers to the grassroot level, swift and across the
broad accountability.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and
chief of the Army Staff, staged a coup on October 12 overthrowing
the 31-month-old government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Regional Strategy Needed in Fighting AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Sunday that a common southern African regional
strategy is needed in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic which is
killing over 1,000 people every week in his country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe could link with other countries in the region to
manufacture locally drugs such as the AZT which is used to prolong
lives of people suffering from the incurable disease, Mugabe said
at a religious interaction program in Bulawayo, the second largest
city of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The president said some of the drugs made in the United States
are available in South Africa but they are very expensive, hence
the need for different countries to come together to manufacture
them cheaply.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the only way to eradicate the disease
was through a change of sexual behaviour especially among the
youths who are the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The president said churches should ensure that the youths
change their behaviour by giving them moral and spiritual
guidance.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Efforts Made to Avoid Unnecessary Loss of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Sunday that federal troops would try to avoid
unnecessary loss of life in its campaign to root out Islamic
gunmen from the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We will not undertake the tactics of a large-scale military
action with tank attacks and the storming of towns,'' Putin told
RTR state television.
</P>
<P>
Despite reports of fire exchanges near the village of Bamut,
about 70 kilometers southwest of Grozny, the Chechen capital,
Russian authorities have kept tight-lipped about the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Military officials denied their troops had moved any closer to
Grozny. They also declined to comment on an Interfax news agency
report that troops had bombed a cement plant 25 kilometers south
of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
At the completion of the first stage of its campaign against
Chechen rebels, federal forces have now taken control a third of
Chechnya, mostly low-lying areas north of the Terek River. They
have also secured key points in western and eastern parts of
Chechnya in their drive to form a "security zone" around the rebel
republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the southern Russian town of Vladikavkaz, Viktor
Kazantsev, commander of Russian forces in North Caucasus region
that includes Chechnya, said there was no order to take Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital,
although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war
in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed.
</P>
<P>
Kazantsev said the Interior Ministry is to play the key role in
the second phase of the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal grouping "has not carried out a single
strike against peaceful villages." Rather, the rebels carried out
strikes on villages for provocative purposes, picturing them as
federal strikes.
</P>
<P>
"All of these cases are being tackled by the military
prosecutor's office," Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
Kazantsev said he believed talks with Chechnya's relatively
moderate leader Aslan Maskhadov were possible, but not in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov has repeatedly called for talks with Moscow, but
Putin says he must first hand over guerrilla leaders like Shamil
Basayev and Arab-born Khattab. Putin blames the fighters for a
series of terrorist bomb blasts in Russia that killed some 300
people.
</P>
<P>
As they suffer major losses following the federal offensive,
Chechen rebels are planning more terrorist acts in Russia,
Interfax quoted the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security
Service as saying Sunday in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the Russian law-enforcement bodies "are
taking every measure to prevent such terrorist operations."
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov claimed Sunday that
the Russian military conceal their losses in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that more than 1,500 soldiers and
officers had been killed, four planes and 10 helicopters had been
downed, and 62 armored vehicles had been put out of action so far,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen side only lost 32 men, Maskhadov said. Russian
commanders claim that the Chechen rebels' casualties, by most
conservative estimates, are at least 1,500.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has denied such claims and Colonel General Ilya Panin,
chief of the Defense Ministry's Main Personnel Department, said
that since the start of fighting on the territory of Chechnya,
federal forces have lost 47 servicemen.

<HEADLINE> India Says Too Early To Consider Talks With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 17(Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh said here on Sunday that it was "too early"
to consider resumption of the stalled bilateral dialogue with
Pakistan, now under martial law.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with 30 visiting Pakistani school children,
Who are returning home on Monday after a week-long stay, Singh
told the press that India was continuing to keep a close watch on
the developments in neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Until the situation becomes clear," the minister said, "it
will be improper for me to answer hypothetically."
</P>
<P>
The Indian official brushed aside concerns by some western
countries about the possibility of a nuclear flare-up in South
Asia, saying such fears were "totally unfounded".
</P>
<P>
Singh was optimistic that the development in Islamabad would
not have a bearing on transport linkages and people-to-people
contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister asserted that "there can not be and will be no
compromise" on cross-border terrorism which he said sponsored by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that Indian forces were on "high alert"
following the military take-over in Pakistan, adding "our forces
are vigilant".
</P>
<P>
On the proposed visit to Indian by United States President Bill
Clinton, Singh said the visit was "very much on cards".
</P>
<P>
It was up to the U.S. administration to work out something
according to their convenience.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that Indo-U.S. relations were improving, he said
this was also reflected in the telephonic conversation Clinton had
with Atal Bihari Vajpayee soon after the Indian leader assumed
charge last Wednesday as the prime minister for the third time.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the direction in which Indo-U.S.
relations were proceeding will continue to gather momentum.
</P>
<P>
Singh said both sides are looking forward to further deepening
of contacts and widening of the dialogue process between the two
countries.

PARIS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Sunday asked Russian President Boris Yeltsin to seek a political
solution to the crisis in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Yeltsin, Chirac said that it
is very important to have a political solution through dialogue
with the Chechen revels, said the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia was reacting to ``terrorist threats''
in northern Caucasus and this was the only objective of the
military campaign.
</P>
<P>
He also told Chirac that Russia cares about the life of
civilians living in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been carrying out an intensive military campaign for
one month in Chechnya, assumably against Islamic forces accused of
staging a series of bombing attacks in Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
But Western media said that the campaign is closely linked with
the forthcoming legislative elections in Russia in December and
the presidential election next year.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Wheel Ready to Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The 450-feet Millennium Wheel,
more than double the height of Big Ben, was finally hauled into
its dominant place on London's skyline on Sunday, standing upright
on the banks of the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
Organizers pledged it would be finished in time for 2000 as the
complex lifting operation came to an end.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for sponsors British Airways said: "We are all
ecstatic and thrilled. We are opening champagne to celebrate. It
looks wonderful," the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
She said there was still much work to be carried out before the
end of December, but added: "It is a fairly tight program but we
are very confident that we will get there."
</P>
<P>
The next job will be fitting the 32 egg-shaped viewing
capsules, which weigh nine tons each. Carrying about 25 people,
the capsules are currently in storage in Dartford, Kent, and are
expected to be transported up the river on barges.
</P>
<P>
The capsules, built in Grenoble, France, by French ski-lift
company Poma, will be fitted to the 1,500-ton London Eye in the
first week of November.
</P>
<P>
The BA spokeswoman said they would be floated up the river to
the site and fitted in batches of four over a period of between
eight to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
People will be able to sit in the fully enclosed capsules,
which are mainly made of glass, in the comfort of air conditioning
and listen to a running commentary.
</P>
<P>
The wheel, designed by husband-and-wife team Julia Barfield and
David Marks, is set to remain in place for five years. On a clear
day, visitors are expected to be able to see seven counties from
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-tallest structure in London, the wheel includes a
frame from Holland, Italian cables, French capsules, British steel
and a Czech spindle.
</P>
<P>
Passengers will be able to get on and off without it stopping,
as it will rotate very slowly. A full trip will take 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
BA plans to include local people and others connected with the
project in the official opening. The wheel will open to the
general public early in January. It will have the capacity to
carry 15,000 visitors a day.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Newspaper Shut down for Offending Emir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti government has
ordered a five-day closure of a popular local newspaper for
offending the Emir, the paramount leader of the Gulf Islamic
country.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language daily Al-Seyassah (Politician) was ordered
to close on Sunday because what is published on Saturday included
an "infringement upon the Emiri status and position and a damage
to the supreme national interests."
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister for Cabinet Affairs
Mohammad Deifallah Sharar immediately after a weekly cabinet
session.
</P>
<P>
While apparently avoiding repeating the offending contents
appeared in the newspaper, Sharar urged all dailies and other
parties to be committed to religious and national principles and
avert anything that hurts the country's interests.
</P>
<P>
He called them to work for maintaining the country's entity,
stability and nationality unity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwaiti Publication Law, the cabinet may
block a daily for as long as two years or rescind its license, if
evidence shows it serves the interests of a foreign state, or what
it publishes violates national interests.

<HEADLINE> Trade Issue Dominates GCC, U.S. Economic Talks ...he noted. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For his part, Daley said that the U.S. has a long-standing and
close relationship with the GCC countries in strategic, political
and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current dialog has become more important now
that economic issues and the region's desire for private-led
growth is moving to the center stage.
</P>
<P>
He said there are now more business opportunities for U.S.
companies in the Gulf. "It's a new day for trade in the region and
there is a new spirit of cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has been at the forefront among the Middle East
countries that have strived for economic cooperation and
integration through concerted efforts in recent years. These
efforts are very important for attracting American and other
foreign investors, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the GCC states' efforts for privatization, he said
this was a particularly good time for the businessmen to accompany
him to the GCC countries because they were placing their emphasis
on the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"This means our companies, already in the region, will now
have a voice in the dialog, which until now has been mostly
government to government affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the joint forum, Daley had talks with a
number of UAE officials on Sunday, including Deputy Prime
Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Daley arrived in the UAE Sunday as part of his regional tour,
which has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The armed kidnappers from
Tajikistan Monday released two Kyrgyz hostages including the
commander of Kyrgyzstan's Interior Ministry troops, Anarbek
Shamkeyev, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Shamkeyev and a Kyrgyz policeman were freed after the Kyrgyz
secret service agents and non-governmental representatives
negotiated with the kidnappers, who intruded into Kyrgyzstan's
mountainous south from neighboring Tajikistan in August and
kidnapped more than 10 people there.
</P>
<P>
Among the people taken hostage were also four Japanese with a
geological prospecting team. Kyrgyz special agents are continuing
the effort to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
The Kyrgyz government has reportedly said that there are at
present no outlawed armed groups in the country. However, the
Kyrgyz government forces are still combing the mountains in the
south and working to clear the mines planted there by those armed
groups, who are believed to have recently withdrawn to Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> India Asks Pakistan to Create Environment for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- India asked Pakistan again on
Monday to create a "proper environment" to build ties of
friendship and cooperation between the two neighbors based on
mutual trust and confidence.
</P>
<P>
In order to foster such an environment, a spokesman of the
External Affairs Ministry said, "it is imperative that Pakistan
should cease its sponsorship of cross-border terrorism in Jammu
and Kashmir and elsewhere in the country."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said it was
"too early" to consider resumption of the stalled bilateral
dialogue with Pakistan where a state of emergency is being
imposed.
</P>
<P>
The minister asserted that "there can not be and will be no
compromise" on cross-border terrorism which he said was sponsored
by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
To questions the spokesman echoed what Jaswant Singh said on
Sunday that it was "too early" for New Delhi to consider
resumption of the stalled dialogue process with Islamabad or in
fixing any time-frame for it.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that steps are taken immediately by Pakistan for
stopping cross-border terrorism," he said, adding that "we expect
action on the ground" which include disbanding training camps for
terrorists and stopping financing to them.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Turkey's EU Membership Bid Depends on Ankara Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that whether
Turkey can become an European Union (EU) candidate country would
depend on Ankara itself.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that it depended on Turkey itself whether
this can become a reality.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision on this matter would be taken at the
forthcoming EU summit in December in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that Turkey can not join the EU unless it
improves its human rights record and relations with Athens as well
as not blocking Cyprus' accession to the EU. But the recent
devastating earthquakes in the two countries have created an
opportunity for both to better their strained relations, and
Athens has since softened its opposition to Turkey's eventual
membership in the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU leaders warned Turkey Saturday it should not
take for granted that it will be made a candidate for membership
at a year-end EU summit.
</P>
<P>
They said that Turkey would have to address concerns over
Cyprus and human rights before Ankara got its EU candidacy.

Pakistan following the military coup which toppled the government

had further intensified ethnic disputes, clashes with India over
Kashmir and abundant economic problems were all alarms of a crisis
in Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Greatly concerned over the

The decree was jointly issued by the Commission for Discipline

Some local departments have been blamed for erecting obstacles
against the functioning of local courts. These obstacles, if dealt
with properly, could have a direct effect on the country's reform,
development and stability, the decree stresses.

The issuance of this decree shows the central authorities'
determination to implement the principal state policy of governing
by law and pushing forward the building of socialist democracy and
legal system, the document says.
</P>
<P>
It urges local disciplinary and supervisory departments to
study the decree and unify their thinking and increase their
awareness on this issue in order to safeguard the unification and
dignity of state law.
</P>
<P>
Any person or activity whatsoever found to be obstructing law
enforcement must be severely punished, the decree says.
</P>
<P>
It also asks the media to help tackle the problem by reporting
on any such illegal activities and the persons responsible for
them.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Motor Unveils Drastic Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's major automaker Nissan
Motor Co. announced Monday a drastic restructuring plan including
cutting the domestic output capacity and reducing the group's
workforce in a bid to return to profitability in the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year "Revival Plan" beginning in April 2000,
Nissan seeks to reduce costs by 1 trillion yen (9.5 billion
dollars) and net debt from 1.4 trillion yen (13.2 billion dollars)
to less than 700 billion yen (6.6 billion dollars), Nissan's chief
operating officer Carlos Ghosn, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The first goal of the plan is to return Nissan to profitability
in fiscal 2000 starting April next year, Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
Nissan has posted losses for six of the seven business years
from 1992. The group's net loss totaled 27.71 billion yen (262
million dollars) for fiscal 1998, which ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
As part of its production reduction, Nissan will shut down the
major assembly plant in Musashi-murayama, western Tokyo, one of
its principal factories, in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nissan Shatai Co., an auto body assembler
belonging to the Nissan group, will close its plant in Uji, Kyoto
Prefecture, in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The major Japanese automaker will also slash its consolidated
workforce by 21,000 from the current 140,000 by 2002, Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
Ghosn, the former executive vice president at Renault SA of
France, was sent by the French automaker to Nissan in June to help
the struggling Japanese automaker get back on track.
</P>
<P>
Nissan and Renault formed a business alliance when Renault
acquired a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan in March.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Strikes Upbeat Tone over Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Monday struck an upbeat tone over the Asian economy and
called for strong partnership between government and business in
co-creating opportunities and wealth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the official opening dinner of the 8th East Asia
Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum Monday night, Goh Chok
Tong said that the Asian financial crisis is over with all the
economies of East Asia, Japan included, expected to register
positive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Citing growth forecasts made by the International Monetary Fund
and the Asian Development Bank, Goh said the growth rates will
vary from a high of eight percent in South Korea to a low of 0.5
percent in Hong Kong and next year will see a better result.
</P>
<P>
The topics in his remarks about the Asian financial crisis also
gyrated from its negative impact of the storm to positive outcome
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said: "My view is that the crisis has also a bright side to
it. it has yielded four positive outcomes."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was referring to the acceleration of the
opening up of East Asian economies, more awareness of the role of
good corporate governance in creating and sustaining growth, the
forced reconsideration of the long-term growth prospect and
acquirement of traumatic but necessary lessons on the reality of
globalization, in particular, the way globalized capital markets
work.
</P>
<P>
Turning the theme of this meeting on partnership between the
government and business in co-creating opportunities and wealth
for a new Asia and a new era, Goh listed a series of roles and
functions to be played by governments and business communities.
</P>
<P>
On the global level, the prime minister said governments should
strengthen and defend the multilateral trading system and enhance
free trade and investment liberalization under the framework of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the launch of a new
round of multilateral trade negotiations with a view to help stem
such tendencies as trade protectionism.
</P>
<P>
On regional level, he held that governments should individually
as well as through such regional organizations as ASEAN and APEC,
create a business environment which promotes trade and
investments.
</P>
<P>
On national level, he believes that governments should build
new capabilities by investing in social and physical
infrastructures and maximizing the potential of their people, and
respond rapidly to changing business conditions and innovations
such as electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Touching on business side, Goh said: "Investors from Europe and
the U.S. should put East Asia back on their computer screens and
transfer management expertise and technology to this region.
</P>
<P>
He also asked business to work with governments to increase
productivity growth, embark on new and innovative ways of doing
business and make clear to governments that it prefers competition
to protectionism, freer flow of trade and investments and
transparency to the practice of KKN, the acronym for corruption,
collusion and nepotism in the Indonesian language.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998
has interrupted the miracle of East Asia, but not derailed East
Asia's progress.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has given East Asia an opportunity to quicken its
economic liberalization, jettison KKN in favor of good corporate
governance and re-focus on capability building and productivity
growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If we seize this opportunity and build strong partnership
between government and business, between technology and
entrepreneruship and between East Asia and the rest of the world,
We will co-create many new opportunities for East Asia and for the
world," Goh concluded.

four natural reserves, and 42 provincial-level tourist zones. The
efforts to develop the local tourist industry have been greatly
hampered by a backward economy and poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Vice Governor Guo Shuqing said the establishment of the new
company could help make the tourist sector a new industrial pillar
for the province.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, operators of some most famous tourist resorts
in the country have been listed on China's stock markets,
including Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Mount Tai in Shandong
Province, Mount Huangshan in Anhui Province, and the Great Wall at
Badaling in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These companies have raised more than two billion yuan from
stock market trading.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: World Urges Greater Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The international
community has been calling for greater efforts in international
arms control and nuclear disarmament, saying that such efforts
must be made in line with the changed international situation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as representatives from all over the world were
taking the floor at the general debate of the First Committee of
the 54th General Assembly, which began on Monday last week and
will end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear disarmament is one of the major issues that concern the
world at large. In other words, it is the most difficult issue
facing the world community at the turn of century.
</P>
<P>
Although nuclear weapon stockpiles had declined significantly
since the cold war, tens of thousands of such weapons remain in
existence -- many on high alert status, many ready for first-use
in future conflicts, and many available for tactical battle
fields.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the shocks from last year's nuclear tests in South
Asia continue to reverberate throughout the global
non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
Washington is working hard to make it possible for the
deployment of the missile defense systems, a very dangerous step
seen to introduce arms race into the outer space.
</P>
<P>
Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N. under-secretary-general for
disarmament affairs, warned the world against the harmful
development.
</P>
<P>
"If the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile
Systems (the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty) -- which leaders
from the United States and the Russian Federation had called a
'cornerstone of strategic stability' -- crumbled under the weight
of new pressures to deploy national missile defense systems, the
world community might soon lose another cornerstone as well: its
long-sought goal of preventing an arms race in outer space," he
said while opening the general debate.
</P>
<P>
In reality, the recent negative international development had
gradually dimmed the expectations arising from the end of cold war
that it would be possible to achieve a world free of nuclear
weapons within a foreseeable period.
</P>
<P>
Antonio De Icaza, the Mexican representative, said, "At the
approach of the new millennium, there was a new propensity to use
force in international relations, relying on military hardware
that allowed the use of force to be without risk or cost in
material and in lives for the party that employed it."
</P>
<P>
"The growing trend towards the development and deployment in
outer space of missile defense systems and the reports that
substantial funds were being allocated in that regard had
underscored the urgent need to adopt measures to prevent any
attempts to utilize outer space for military purposes," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Says Not to Run for President, Vice President Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Commander of the Indonesian Military (TNI) General Wiranto Monday
night said he will not run for the president and vice president
race.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current situation, I choose not to enter into
rivalry for presidency or vice presidency. However, I will take a
political position that what the people really need," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the country's national television station
TVRI, Wiranto said present political and security condition tended
to move into a dangerous instability and therefore "it is
impossible for me to do other things but concentrate on the task
of assuring the security of our nation and state."
</P>
<P>
Wiranto made the statement after meeting with military
leadership at the TNI Headquarters in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was chosen by incumbent President B.J. Habibie, the
presidential nomination of the Golkar Party, as the party's vice
presidential candidate for the 1999-2004 period on October 13.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Wiranto said that nobody, including the
Golkar Party that had openly mentioned his name for it, had
contacted him.
</P>
<P>
He said that rivalry among political groupings had turned
sharper marked by fiercer rhetoric of hostility which were
increasingly difficult to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is aggravated by anarchic mass mobilization that
has systematically reduced the essence of general election as a
process for strengthening representation system of democracy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of national unity, he said, TNI needs to remind
all political, socio-cultural and religious leaders that they
should take optimal joint initiatives to prevent further violence
by a group of people that had tarnished national reputation.
</P>
<P>
"They have damaged students' moral fight for democracy and
positioned TNI as if it is against the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said a serious threat faced by the nation now was
disintegration which was marked by mass mobilization by various
parties.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
supporters staged simultaneous protests in major cities on Java
island on Sunday and Monday, encouraging Megawati Soekarnoputri,
general chairman of the PDI-P, to continue her struggle for
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, Megawati supporters have staged daily rallies
to try to pressure the 700-member MPR, and thousands more are
flooding into the capital to join mass protests if she loses.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to maintain protests for Megawati until the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
legislative body, elects her as the next president on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Many fear unrest will erupt across the already crisis-hit
country if Habibie is elected for another term in office.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the withdrawal of Wiranto from the
vice presidential candidate will beat the bid of Habibie to be
re-elected in the forthcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election would be held on October 20, while
the vice presidential election on October 21.
</P>
<P>
The three potential presidential candidates are Habibie,
Megawati and Abdurrahman Wahid, founder of the National Awakening
Party.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Continue Detente Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Monday that it
will continue the policy of detente adopted by moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said
that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also
confirmed the policy, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trend of confidence building and detente
between Iran and other countries took a positive momentum
following fruitful talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and foreign officials on the sidelines of the recent
U.N. General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm expressed by other countries for building
consolidated and long-term relations with Iran is quite
noticeable and different from that of the past, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Terming as "very important and positive" the recent visits to
Iran by presidents of Austria and Greece, Asefi said that
Europeans are also all set for the establishment of long-term
relations with Iran based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming visit of President Khatami to
France, he said that the visof
long-standing relations between Iran and France in all
dimensions, he said, adding that appropriate arrangements have
been made for Khatami's visit which will be launched successfully
at due time.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in 1997, Khatami and his supporters have
begun to ease Iran's anti-western outlook and pushed hard for
economic ties with the European Union (EU). He paid a landmark
visit to Italy in March, which was widely seen as an important
step in opening links with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Time Mature for Starting Talks on Cyprus: US Presidential Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy to Cyprus Alfred Moses pointed out on Monday that
time is now appropriate for starting talks for a settlement of the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
During talks here with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou,
he noted that the recent rapprochement between the peoples of
Greece and Turkey after devastating earthquakes in the two
neighboring countries pushed them to help each other, plus Turkey'
s desire to improve ties with Europe, together created a "momentum
" that should be taken advantage of.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Papandreou reiterated Greece's full support for
efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue and hoped that talks between
the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in the divided island will
begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took control of the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with Cyprus, has
repeatedly said in recent months that the two sides should start
talks without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Moses, accompanied by U.S. State Department coordinator for
Cyprus Thomas Weston, arrived here Monday morning for a one-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged to Be Moral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Worried about some foreign
scientists' plans to clone a human being, a senior Chinese
scientist today urged her counterparts around the world to be
morally responsible by integrating their creativity with the long-
term interests of the human race.
</P>
<P>
Hu Qiheng, a vice chairman of the China Association of Science
and Technology (CAST) and a member of the China Academy of
Engineering Science (CAES), made the call at the 1999 CAST Annual
Meeting held in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on scientists to take into consideration the issue of
morals and the effects on the public while progressing in their
scientific and technological research.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have largely improved living standards,
and at the same time have brought about severe threats to human
society with environmental pollution, the misuse of resources, the
spread of infectious epidemics, and the fast development of
sophisticated weapons, she noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior engineer, local academies have moved to
attach greater importance to this issue. The CAES and the China
Academy of Sciences have both stipulated codes of conduct for
their members.

<HEADLINE> ILO Publishes Paper on Workers in Informal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Up to 60 percent of the labor
force in the developing world work in the informal sector and in
many countries it is the only part of the economy creating any new
jobs at all, said the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a
background paper here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper is prepared for a five-day meeting of trade unionists
from 31 countries to highlight the difficulties faced by informal-
sector workers and to develop strategies for organizing this
marginalized but rapidly growing part of the world's workforce,
said the ILO.
</P>
<P>
According to the ILO paper, informal-sector activities,
involving a welter of activities in commerce, agriculture,
construction, manufacturing, transportation and services, account
for the vast majority of the new jobs created in Latin America and
in Africa during the present decade.
</P>
<P>
In countries like Bolivia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire,
Gambia, Tanzania, and Uganda, the informal sector employment
accounts for more than 50 percent of total employment.
</P>
<P>
Most informal sector activities are concentrated in urban areas,
said the ILO. The jobs it involves can range from street corner
services (money changing, kiosk operators, window washers, etc.)
to transportation (rickshaw pullers, delivery men) and to small
manufacturing and construction (furniture making, wood carving and
watch repairs).
</P>
<P>
The irregular jobs are part of a vast range of small-scale,
income-generating activities which take place outside the official
regular framework and typically utilize a low level of capital,
technology and skills, offering commensurately low levels of pay,
little if any job security and often appalling working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The low productivity and income combined with the absence of
social protection, training or social services are a particularly
harsh burden on many of the most vulnerable groups in society,
including women, children and migrants, who are disproportionately
concentrated in the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the ILO meeting will try to reflect
on a broad spectrum of topics including trade union strategies,
priorities and resource allocation in respect of the informal
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ILO expected the meeting to come up with policy proposals
for trade unions to meet the needs of informal sector workers and
to give them "a voice."

<HEADLINE> Malaysian SMIs Asked to Go for Knowledge-Intensive Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Small- and medium-scale
industries (SMIs) in Malaysia have been asked to consider going
into more knowledge-intensive business activities.
</P>
<P>
Making the call, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Monday that Malaysia's economy, in keeping with the trend, was
gradually transforming itself into a knowledge-based economy
(K-economy) where brain power rather than brawn would be the
determining competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
In a K-economy, where the main activities are focused on high
value-added and knowledge-based activities such as products and
process designing, products/process development and improvement,
innovation and other research and development (R&AMP;D) activities,
size and scale of operations did not matter as much as before, he
said when opening an annual SMI showcase '99 here.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs have been recognized as a vehicle for developing
Malaysian-owned companies and Malaysian-owned brand names and
designs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, SMIs must be prepared to change, change in the mindset and
change in the way of doing business as well as the manner in which
business is conducted," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the extensive application of information and
communication technology by companies, the outreach of
Malaysian-made products and services could be extended to the
global market.
</P>
<P>
He urged the SMIs to rise to face challenges and changes in the
future, saying "They must shift their focus from being production
oriented to market oriented, should try to acquire new technology
and upgrade skills in co-competency and graduate from producing
lower end components and parts to become global suppliers of high
value-added intermediate products."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese police have
strengthened their inspections of places of recreation as part of
the latest nationwide campaign against prostitution and gambling,
a senior police officer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police in northeast China's Jilin Province launched an overall
inspection of such public places as massage parlors, hair salons,
and ballrooms, arresting 1,300 criminal suspects, seizing 420 sets
of gambling materials, and dealing with 476 persons who provide
sexual services.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- DHL-Sinotrans will further
expand its express service in China, thanks to the country's
sustained economic growth and wider opening-up, DHL-Sinotrans
managing director Charles Chai said here today.
</P>
<P>
Efficient cargo transport to Europe and the United States is
significant for Asian countries, including China, in their hope to
boosting economic development through export growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chai noted that exports from Asia to Europe and the United
States have been booming in the past two years, while trade within
Asia has been developing slowly.
</P>
<P>
Europe will become one of the most important markets for
Chinese exporters, with the introduction of the European single
currency and the development of economic globalization, which also
offers great opportunities to express service between China and
Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
DHL-Sinotrans has promoted a series of express services
orientated toward Chinese exporters since last year, the latest
being "Europe First" which takes only 2.2 days on average to
deliver a package from China to Europe, according to Chai.
</P>
<P>
The company's express deliveries from China to the United
States increased by 20 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
DHL-Sinotrans, the first joint-venture express service in China,
has accounted for 35 percent of the country's international
express market with annual business volume hitting 400 million
yuan.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony of drilling 500
water wells for Cambodia by the Chinese government was held Monday
in Kampong Cham province, some 120 kilometers from the capital.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Rural Development Minister Chhoem Siek Leng and
Chinese ambassador Yan Tingai attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The well-drilling project was financed by the grant of 40
million yuan (about 4.8 million U.S. dollars) from China.
</P>
<P>
Chhoem Siek Leng expressed his thanks to the Chinese government
for its assistance, saying "these wells will bring health and
happiness to tens of thousands of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
He said: "the lack of safe drinking water is the biggest
obstacle to eradicate poverty and to improve people's health."
</P>
<P>
The Exchange of Note of the project was signed in April this
year by Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong and Chinese Deputy
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Guangxiang
during his visit here.
</P>
<P>
China has already drilled 500 wells for Cambodia so far.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of this project, water supply in
Cambodia's rural area will be improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released last month, only 29 percent
of Cambodians have access to safe drinking water among a
population of 11.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya's Maskhadov Urged to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Nationalities Minister
Vyacheslav Mikhailov on Monday urged President Aslan Maskhadov of
the breakaway republic of Chechnya to join the federal efforts
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Close cooperation with Maskhadov is possible if he merges his
forces with federal units to combat terrorism," Mikhailov said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops, in their efforts to wipe out Islamic
rebels in Chechnya, have secured control of one third of the North
Caucasus republic in the first stage of the operation to establish
a "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov, who is seen by Moscow as a more moderate Chechen
leader, has urged the federal authorities to stop military actions
and enter negotiations with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said any talks should be
preceded by the handover of Shamil Basayev and Khattab, two
Chechen warlords branded by Moscow as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The federal assault on Chechnya came after armed incursions
into neighboring Daghestani republic led by Basayev and Jordanian-
born Khattab. The two are also accused of masterminding a series
of explosions that rocked four apartment buildings killing some
300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"Talks would be pointless without Maskhadov's firm wish to
restore order and thwart terrorism," the Interfax news agency
quoted Mikhailov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov would "turn into the terrorists' accomplice" unless
he implements anti-terrorist measures, the nationalities minister
said, noting that Maskhadov should meet federal authorities half-
way if he "loves his people and will not sacrifice them for short-
term interests."
</P>
<P>
The minister added the federal authorities are doing their best
to help the estimated 180,000 people who have fled Chechnya.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Third Asia Regional
Illiteracy Forum opened here today with an aim to exchange
educational experiences and promote Asia's anti-illiteracy
campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 scholars and experts from around the world,
mostly from Asia, are attending the five-day conference jointly
sponsored by UNESCO and China's National Commission for UNESCO.
The participants will discuss efforts to wipe out illiteracy in
their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In her opening talk, Minister of Education Chen Zhili
summarized the major achievements and experiences of China's
educators in the reform and opening-up drive of the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
"China will pay great attention to the development of education,
and stick to the policy to making nine years of education
universally compulsory," she said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Education Lu Fuyuan spoke to the gathering of
the overall campaign in China to eliminate illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 23 Chinese provinces have met the state
requirements in the campaign to wipe out illiteracy among young
and middle-aged people. But there are still some 135 million
illiterates above the age of 15 in China, 30 million of whom are
young or middle-aged, he said.
</P>
<P>
China faces severe challenges in this effort, especially in
some relatively poor and needy areas, though it has gained some
success in wiping out illiteracy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Never Separates from Syria in Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on Monday reiterated the inseparability of Lebanon and Syria
in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will not hold separate negotiations and reach a peace
deal unilaterally with Israel, Hoss said in an interview with the
Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
"A unilateral decision (by Lebanon) is not on the cards," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
After the Arab-Israeli peace talks began in 1991, Lebanon and
Syria formed a united delegation to negotiate for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from southern Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which maintains over 30,000 troops as
peacekeepers in Lebanon, agree to coordinate on key issues.
</P>
<P>
All efforts exerted to resume negotiations on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks have yielded no tangible results, Hoss said, blaming
the stalemate on Israel's rejection of a Syrian demand that the
talks be re-started from where they broke off.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
After the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in May,
the two sides have said they are interested in resuming the peace
talks. Syria insists that late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin had pledged to pull back troops from the whole of the Golan
Heights, and that the talks be restarted on that basis. But Barak
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
Hoss reasserted the continuation of the resistance by the
Lebanese people against Israeli troops in the southern border
strip and the Lebanese government's support for the resistance
politically and morally.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon
in 1985 allegedly to protect its northern areas from attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas. Lebanon's Muslim resistance forces have ever
since been fighting to oust the Israeli occupation troops.

HANGZHOU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China will have its own Nobel
Prize winners so sure if its new generation of scientists can
become more confident and stick to their creative work, according
to Zhou Guangzhao, president of the China Association for Science
and Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is one of the most prominent members of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, made the remarks today at the opening
ceremony of CAST's first annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that successful scientists have few psychological hang-
ups and are not afraid of being laughed at or of doing things that
are completely different from what others do. They keep their eyes
and ears open to new things and are always ready for new ideas.
</P>
<P>
In his 100-minute speech, the former head of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences discussed the history of science and factors
that result in major scientific findings. He said that the
innovation project, the cultivation of talented people, the
reforms and opening-up, and the stable political situation have
resulted in a special respect for knowledge in Chinese society,
and all this can provide an environment for scientific development.
</P>
<P>
Zhou asked the new generation of Chinese scientists to be more
confident and said that they should learn to "stand on the
shoulders of giants" but not listen to authoritative opinions
blindly and should try to find new points of growth from cross-
discipline areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Former First Lady Appeals Mercy for Her </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's late military ruler
Gen.Sani Abacha's wife Maryam Abacha has demanded mercy be given
to her son, Mohammed Abacha, who is currently standing trial for
murder.
</P>
<P>
The former first lady has also asked the country's tribe chiefs
for help because they enjoy a high respect from President Olusegun
Obasanjo, the Vanguard newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said in a speech last week that the country should remember
the deeds of former Head of State Sani Abacha and have mercy on
his only son left.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some close friends of the Abacha family and
prominent businessmen were also making frantic efforts to save
Mohammed Abacha from probably being convicted on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abacha appeared in a Lagos court last Thursday to be
accused of murdering late President-elect Moshood Abiola's wife.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abacha, 29, was charged alongside General Abacha's
security chief, Major Hamza al-Mustapha, and three other security
officials.
</P>
<P>
The court in its first session refused to accept an application
from the defendants for bail and decided to adjourn the case until
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Abiola was shot dead in a Lagos street in June 1996, three
years after his husband wining a general election and claiming
himself the president.
</P>
<P>
Moshood Abiola was imprisoned after the election was annulled
by the military regime. General Abacha died in 1998, a month later
Abiola died from a heart attack in jail.

BEIRUT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli warplane Monday
morning flew low on the Lebanese capital Beirut and its southern
suburb, stirring up panic and nerves among residents.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed the sound barrier in repeated low runs and
there have been no reports about bombing sorties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army anti-aircraft guns opened up against the
intruding plane over suburban Aramoun, south of Beirut, the Voice

<P>
Early in the day, Israeli troops shelled the village of
Yahmour Shiqif in the central sector of the Israel-occupied
border zone in south Lebanon, destroying several civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came as a response to a previous assault by
Lebanese guerrillas on its outpost inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

From the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) to the Ming (1368-1644)
, China exported many techniques and products to the West and
contributed a lot to world civilization. In more modern times,
many Chinese scientists have contributed to scientific and social
development. Chen Ning Yang, T.D. Lee, Lee Yuantseh, Steven Chu,
and Daniel Tsui, all of them Chinese scientists, won the Nobel
Prize.
</P>
<P>
Still, the most important thing is for China to create a better
environment for scientists, Zhou said, citing Cambridge University
's Cavendish Laboratory as an example. After the Second World War,
the lab faced many difficulties, including a shortage of qualified
personnel and money, but the people there decided to pool their
resources together to support new research directions. And the lab
finally became a "cradle" of Nobel Prize winners.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese scientists have a strong sense of patriotism,
responsibility and sacrificing. They should be able to create
world-class scientific findings," Zhou concluded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Civilian Govt Restored in Pakistan: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States hopes
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf will launch a
process which gets the country back to the representative form of
government after making a good beginning to resolve the immense
problems identified by him Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here on Monday, U.S. Ambassador to
Pakistan William B. Milam said the United States was expecting an
announcement of a timeframe for the return of democracy in
Pakistan which was not there in General Musharraf's televised
address to the nation Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"We did hope for a specific timeframe and remain disappointed
that there isn't one," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Milam said, his country was heartened by General
Musharraf's "pledge that the military will stay in power only as
long as is absolutely necessary."
</P>
<P>
"My own hope is that after a good beginning on solving these
problems he can also launch a process which gets the country back
to the representative form of government," said the U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
To a query, he said his country will not press for restoration
of the ousted Nawaz Sharif government. "It is not practicable
thing."
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Pakistan-India relations, Milam said he
appreciated General Musharraf's remarks that he was open to a
dialogue with India.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador termed General Musharraf's unilateral
withdrawal of Pakistani troops from its international borders with
India as "a good-faith gesture".
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who is also chairman of Joint Chiefs of
Staff Committee and Army Chief of Pakistan, Sunday announced the
formation of a National Security Council, which will run the
post-coup country.
</P>
<P>
The army staged a coup, dismissed the Sharif government last
Tuesday and took complete control of the country.

<HEADLINE> France to Help Russia Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-
Pierre Chevenement on Monday expressed Paris's readiness to
cooperate with Russia in a broad range of anti-terrorism issues.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation will be beyond mere information and experience
exchanges, the Interfax news agency quoted Chevenement as saying
after a meeting here with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir
Rushailo.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement was in Moscow to attend the G-8 law enforcement
ministerial meeting slated for October 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
He said France would work closely with Russia against those who
provide financial assistance to terrorists and supply everything
they need.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries will join hands in combating
money laundering, organized crime and illegal trafficking in drugs
and arms, Chevenement said.
</P>
<P>
Rushailov said Russia is "going through a very complex phase in
combating crime and terrorism."
</P>
<P>
A spate of explosions recently ripped through four apartment
buildings in Moscow and two other Russian cities, killing about
300 people. Russian authorities believe Islamic Chechen rebels
were behind the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Rushailov said Moscow would transfer a list of over 1,000
suspects and detailed information about organizers of the blasts
to France.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are North Caucasus natives who allegedly committed
aggravated crimes, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Rushailo expressed satisfaction over the level of contacts
between the Russian Interior Ministry and French police and
special services, noting that France was among the first foreign
countries which responded to "the events which occurred in Russia
in the wake of the blasts."

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
met with young Chinese scholars from both at home and abroad here
today.
</P>
<P>
The scholars participated in a technical renovation program
here aimed at helping young talent serve Chinese enterprises in
the new-materials sector.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 scholars from 20 countries and regions, as well as 300
domestic scholars, took part in the ten-day activity, which
resulted in some 60 tentative agreements worth a total 70 million
yuan (8.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
New materials are very important to China's economic
development, said the vice premier, who is also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that these activities will have a
positive impact on China's technical renovation, its
commercialization of scientific achievements, and efforts to
combine science and technology with the economy.
</P>
<P>
In today's world of the knowledge-based economy, new and high
technologies and their related industries are playing an ever
larger role in global competition, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China held a national conference on technical renovation two
months ago, and the CPC at its recent plenum made a major decision
on the restructuring of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will seize the opportunity of the new
science and technology revolution, and go all out to implement the
strategy of revitalizing the nation through science and education,
Li told the scholars.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier expressed the hope that more overseas Chinese
scholars will participate in the country's modernization drive and
serve the nation any way they can.

<HEADLINE> Manila Launches Long-Term Anti-Poverty Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
combine the creation of jobs with the upgrading of basic services
for the poor to help them cope with rising living cost, Philippine
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Horacio Morales, secretary of the Department of Agrarian
Reform, who is also the lead convener of the National Anti-Poverty
Commission (NAPC), said a new body, dubbed the Task Force 2020,
has been created for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The focus will be "on basic social services such as primary
health care, primary education, water supply and nutrition" for
the poor, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the task force is also to give the poor a
balanced package that would help them find and keep jobs that pay
them "sustainable living wages."
</P>
<P>
Under this setup, the government helps the poor cope with
rising living costs by reducing their spending on basic social
services, such as health care and education, he further explained.
</P>
<P>
NAPC Vice Chairman Donna Gasgonia also said that because of
efforts by the government to stabilize food prices and keep
inflation at a manageable level, people are now spending more on
non-food items, a sign that the poor are now coping better with
the demands of everyday living.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, she said, maintaining the low prices of food
staples, such as rice, is a big help to the poor, along with
providing them with quality basic services.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The China International Turf,
Landscape and Equipment Exposition, the first of its kind in the
country, opened today at the Beijing National Agriculture
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
The four-day expo features quality turf, seeds, advanced
equipment and the latest landscape technology.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 large enterprises from countries including the U.S.
, the Netherlands, Denmark and China, are participating in the
expo, which has over 8,000 square meters of exhibition area.
</P>
<P>
The constant improvement of living standard for the Chinese
people has prompted the rapid expansion of landscaping as a result
of increased demand for quality environmental surroundings.
</P>
<P>
However, almost all the turf seeds and garden equipment used in
China are imported. Statistics indicate that turf-seed imports
have grown over 70 percent on annual basis since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Expo organizers said the event is aimed at building a bridge
between domestic and overseas enterprises to push the development
of China's landscaping industry.
</P>
<P>
The expo is sponsored by the China Forestry Machinery
Association, the China National Seed Group, and the Beijing
Zhongnong Exhibition Center under the auspices of the National
Greening Committee.

<HEADLINE> Early Chinese Bamboo Slips Attract Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Some bamboo slips from the Chu
State dating back some 2,300 years help fill in some blank spaces
in the evolution of ideas from Confucius to Mencius, two great
ancient thinkers in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
They help rewrite the history of ideas before the Qin Dynasty (
221-207 B.C.) and the cultural history of the Chu State, says
Professor Guo Qiyong, who is deputy head of Wuhan University's
Chinese Culture Institute.
</P>
<P>
The bamboo slips, unearthed six years ago, strike a powerful
blow against any doubts about China's traditional culture and will
help rejuvenate the Chinese culture in the next century by
fundamentally correcting erroneous concepts about Chinese culture,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The 800 slips contain 13,000 Chinese characters in all. They
were dug up from a tomb of the Chu State of the Warring States
period (475-221 B.C.) in what is now the city of Jingmen in Hubei
Province, in October of 1993. They are documents reflecting
original Confucian and Daoist ideas that existed before the Qin
Dynasty, including the earliest version of ideas of Laozi and
historical materials from Confucius and his disciples, many of
which have not been seen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
There has been renewed interest in the Chu slips and many books
and academic papers have been written on them. A recent symposium
in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, attracted some 100
academic specialists, including a dozen prominent Sinologists from
overseas and from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Participants said they believe that the slips have important
academic value and describe the coexistence of Confucianism and
Daoism in their early stages, providing a better understanding of
changes in thinking from Confucius to Mencius.
</P>
<P>
Tu Weiming of Harvard University said that the slips reflect
the fundamental values of Confucianism and moral idealism, which
are still important cultural concepts today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was co-sponsored by Wuhan University, the Harvard-
Yenching Institute, the International Confucian Association, the
China Philosophical History Society, and the Hubei Philosophy and
History Society.

<HEADLINE> 60,000 Nigerian Textile Workers Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 60,000 workers in Nigeria's
textile industry have lost their jobs in the past two years and
another 150,000 jobs in the sector are now under serious threat, a
newspaper report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 24 textile firms have been closed down and
11 firms maintain only 20 percent of their normal work force, "The
Post Express" reported.
</P>
<P>
The industry capacity utilization level averages about 25
percent as against 45 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources blamed the bleak scenario in the textile
sector on the lifting of ban on imported textiles by the Nigerian
government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investigation revealed that cheap imported materials,
especially from Asia, had displaced most of the local products in
the market.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Victor Eburajolo, chairman of the Nigerian
Textile Manufacturers Association, as saying that the lifting of
the ban "came at a time when the industry was consolidating its
programs of expansion aimed at meeting domestic demand for
textiles and creating more jobs opportunities".
</P>
<P>
"Since the textile industry is strategic to our country's
industrialization efforts, it should not be exposed to the sudden
threat of unrestrained liberalization," Eburajolo said.

Hong Kong, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Venezuelan President
Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias said here Monday that he hoped his
country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China would foster closer bilateral trade in the future.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following a business luncheon given in his
honor by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Chavez said he is convinced that
Venezuela and HKSAR have "full of opportunities" for future
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the two sides will launch many joint projects of
different kinds in the future, Chavez invited Hong Kong
entrepreneurs to invest in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
A large delegation of the private sector of Hong Kong is likely
to visit Venezuela in the coming month, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He promised to improve environment for overseas investment. His
government now has a law for the protection of investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Venezuela has modified its income tax law to prevent
something which will damage foreign investment, and it is also to
offer fiscal incentives to investment towards priority areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is taking political and economic measures that will
generate political and economic stability, he said,
</P>
<P>
The country has brought down inflation to an 11-year low,
recovered the oil price, achieved currency stability, cutting
greatly its interest rate and increased its international reserves.
</P>
<P>
All these combined have created a favorable environment for
foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his opinion on China's "one country, two systems"
policy, the president said that by doing so, China has given an
example to the world of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he was impressed by the rapid
development of Hong Kong and will reconstruct Venezuela so that
the country will be for South America what Hong Kong is for China'
s mainland.

LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji
Lamido said the present civilian administration had the capacity
and resolves to defend Nigeria from external aggression, a
Nigerian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>

The Vanguard quoted him as saying in Nigerian capital Abuja on

Nigerian government "knows them very well. We know they are
very desperate", Lamido said without specifying who they are.

"Whoever dares to threaten the interest of the Nigerian people
be he a foreigner, be he a Nigerian in collaboration with
foreigners, we will confront him headlong and we will deal with
him," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will crush him, let there be no mistake about it because
nobody today in Nigeria will defy the law and go to his bed to
sleep," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Instead of using brush and
paper, students of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) will soon be
instructed via compact discs, CD-ROMs and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Electronic editions of an ancient Chinese medical book will be
available within three years in order to make the study of TCM
more vivid and intuitive, according to the Chinese Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
The Compendium of Materia Medica has been the leading guide to
TCM since noted doctor Li Shizhen compiled it some 400 years ago.
Currently, more than 100 TCM experts and multi-media technicians
are putting its content on video tapes and discs, which will
finally enable students to avail themselves of Internet-based
courses.
</P>
<P>
"Taking advantage of audio and video technology, this edition
will focus on those vivid details that traditional print editions
can not clearly present, such as the appearance of the medicine,
and the process of picking and preparing medicinal materials,"
said herbal medicine expert Xiao Peigen, chief editor of the
compilation committee.
</P>
<P>
"The compilation is significant for promoting the modernization
of traditional medicine, as well as for introducing it to other
parts of the world," noted Xiao, who is also an academician at the
Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The new edition contains information on more than 600 kinds of
herbal medicines and drugs made from animals or minerals, Xiao
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Central Election
Commission (CEC) on Monday registered a bloc headed by
ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky for the upcoming
parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
"Zhirinovsky's Bloc" consists of his Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) and two smaller parties, the Party of Russia's Spiritual
Revival and the Russian Union of Free Youth, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bloc's federal list includes 84 candidates.
</P>
<P>
This came a week after Zhirinovsky's LDP was denied
registration with the CEC because two of its top three candidates,
Anatoly Bykov and Mikhail Musatov, had submitted false information
concerning their personal incomes and properties. Zhirinovsky
topped the LDP list.
</P>
<P>
Bykov failed to declare that he has an old brick house with a
total floor space of 610 square meters, while Musatov concealed
his ownership of three Mercedes cars, according to the Itar-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's elections law, a party will be refused
registration and participation in the elections slated for
December 19 if only one of the leading three candidates was denied
registration.

traditional Chinese medicine for expansion into global markets,
according to a spokesman for the Hong Kong company.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Warns Against Exuberance Over Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has warned that there are risks and important
challenges to meet to ensure sustainable growth despite a recovery
in the crisis economies in Asia is now under way.
</P>
<P>
IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer made the
point to some 800 participants of the 8th East Asia Economic
Summit of the World Economic Forum, which opened here Monday
morning and will last until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer acknowledged that this meeting is able to strike an
optimistic tone about the outlook of the Asian economies. "Now the
world economy appears to be on the mend, the Asian economies are
reviving, financial market confidence has returned, and -- most
important for the Asian recovery -- Japan is showing signs of
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, while we are certainly entitled to several sighs of
relief, we must not become exuberant, for there are very real
risks out there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current situation as "fragile," Fischer said a
critical short-term risk lies in the external environment,
referring to the U.S. economy which he said can not continue to
grow at the rates well above any estimate of potential growth and
will not achieve a soft landing without further skilled management
in the face of concerns about stock prices and the current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the growth in European economies is gathering
pace after a slowdown in 1998 and early 1999, but Japan's recovery
is still subject to significant risks notwithstanding all the
recent positive news.
</P>
<P>
Turning to structural policy reforms, Fischer said an early
resolution of the Japanese banking sector's problems remains a key
issue to be addressed and there is need for rapid restructuring to
fully resolve balance sheet problems, downsize the sector and
restore profitability.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rest of Asia also needs to do much more
if it is to restore its position as one of the fastest growing
regions in the world while at the same time reducing its
vulnerability to future crises.
</P>
<P>
The first priority must be to solidify the recoveries that are
already under way through pursuing accommodative macroeconomic
policies and beginning the process of fiscal consolidation to
reestablish more balanced budgetary positions and relieve some of
the burden of maintaining price stability now placed on monetary
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the structural side, Fischer stressed that it remains
essential to step up efforts to restore the health of balance
sheets and promote restructuring in both the financial and
corporate sectors.
</P>
<P>
Measures to improve risks management and reduce vulnerability
must play a central part in the regions' long-term strategy,
Fischer concluded.

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The nationalist coalition led by Jordi Pujol carried a great
victory in the regional elections of Spanish Catalonia on Sunday,
while the opposition Socialists also made advances by winning four
more seats in the local parliament. Elected president of the
autonomous government of Catalonia six times since 1980, Pujol
will have to ally with small parties to keep his power.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union (EU) summit in Tampere ended on Saturday
without making any excessively ambitious decision, but the 15 EU
countries entered the rails moving toward a future ``space of
freedom, security and justice'' by adopting the framework covering
judicial and legislative issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- The tension at the stock markets caused by speculation on a
raise of interests rates by United States and European countries
is increasing, forcing the stock markets on the two sides of the
Atlantic to make readjustments. The Dow Jones stock index dropped
by 2.6 percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- The project announced last Saturday by the chiefs of state
and government of the 15 European Union countries to build a
European space of ``freedom, security and justice'' in Tampere,
Finland, looked abstract but has given a ``elan'' in this
direction. A calendar has been fixed in three fields -- the right
of political asylum and immigration, judicial space in Europe and
the fight against organized crimes.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao reflects the coexistence
and integration of the East and West, with Chinese, Portuguese,
blond western tourists walking on streets, and Chinese and
Portuguese children playing together, as the ordinary scene.
</P>
<P>
In 1488, the sixth year of the Hongzhi emperor of the Ming
Dynasty, Chinese fishermen established the oldest building that
still exists in Macao. Since the mid-16th century, its business
and trade have attracted people from all over. Many farmers,
fishermen, craftsmen, and business people came to Macao from
Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other coastal parts of
China. Three families, surnamed He, Zhao, and Shen are the
earliest families known in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese have been living there for 446 years, but are a
minority of the population. Chinese make up 96 percent of the
population, Portuguese 3 percent, and people from elsewhere, 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Macao has an area of 23.5 square kilometers and a population of
about 450,000. The population density overall is 20,000 people per
square kilometer, which is higher than in Hong Kong. The Macao
Peninsula has 96 percent of the people and a population density of
50,000 per square kilometer and 70,000 in the middle part of the
peninsula.

The mixture of cultures and ethnic groups has formed a special
group that uses Portuguese names, gets a Portuguese education, and
believes in Roman Catholicism but speaks Cantonese and follows
traditional Chinese customs.
</P>
<P>
Most of these Portuguese have never been to Portugal and some
even don't know where their families came from. The day of Macao's
return to the motherland is getting near and the question of these
Portuguese has got a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress explained the implementation of the nationality
law in Macao and said that Macao residents of Chinese ancestry who
were born in Chinese territory (which includes Macao) and other
people who are Chinese nationals in accordance with Chinese law
are Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
This allowed these Portuguese to choose Chinese or Portuguese
citizenship of their own free will and it was welcomed by Macao
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The people of Macao say that there will be no distinction in
working together to develop Macao.

HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, China, got a
flying start here Monday at the 12th Asian Cup soccer qualifying
round when it clinched a 4-1 victory over Cambodia in the opening
match of Group Seven.
</P>
<P>
After 10 shots, Hong Kong, China, scored the opener of the

chong scored from close range after receiving a clear pass from

Though the fighting Cambodians had less chances in both halves
than their opponents, they leveled the score at 1-1 six minutes
later through a sudden attack. It was the third shot of the half.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians continued fielding a defense line-up in order to
concede less goals. But their attempts were frustrated by Hong
Kong, China, which produced better team-work and scoring chances
throughout the match.
</P>
<P>
The host outshot Cambodia 23-8 in the one-sided match and
totally dominated the second half, shooting home three times in a
row.
</P>

GUANGZHOU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A 13.8-km section of the

that has been closed for widening opened to traffic today.
</P>
<P>
A part of the section from Hengsha to Xiebian was widened from
four to eight lanes and the remaining part to six lanes at a total
cost of 290 million yuan. The expansion project nearly doubles the
original traffic capacity of 60,000 automobiles per day, a local
source reported.
</P>
<P>
The work began in August 1997 when the expressway had reached
its load limit. The expressway's designed speed is 120 km per hour,
but automobiles were only traveling at 60 km per hour previously
because of the traffic load.

The incident reportedly took place at around 8:30 p.m. Saturday
in the area between Mweya Safari Lodge road junction and Kikorongo
police roadblock along Mbarara-Kasese highway, the Monitor
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barigye Bahuku, press assistant to State Minister for Defense
Steven Kavuma, confirmed the ambush in a telephone interview with
Xinhua Monday morning, but declined to comment on the details.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give you the details. I still have no information as
to that from the district of Kasese. It's really difficult to
contact those people there," he said.
</P>
<P>
When contacted, Police Deputy Spokesman Eric Naigambi refused
to comment, saying that the area is being taken care of by the
army.
</P>
<P>
The incident, the fourth at the same spot in hardly two
months, occurred about one kilometer away from a military detach.
The Monitor report did not say how many rebels were involved in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The western districts in Uganda have been subject to rebel
attacks since January 1996 when the ADF rebels began to operate
from rear bases in eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops to the DRC to allegedly defend its borders
and the western districts from being attacked by the rebels, but
with little effect to date. There have been frequent reports of
rebel attacks in those areas, leaving thousands of residents
displaced.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister: Borrowing Cannot Support Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Katele
Kalumba said that continued external borrowing was not a realistic
option for sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Times of Zambia on Monday as saying that the
key to sustained economic growth was through the mobilization of
domestic savings.
</P>
<P>
He told a bank seminar here at the weekend that without
substantial and sustained domestic savings, long term economic
growth and development would remain elusive.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was difficult for a poor country like Zambia to
raise domestic savings.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved if the government continues to adhere to
a cash budget and strive to run domestic budget surplus to
eliminate budget deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other way to improve domestic savings is through
individuals and firms with the ability to increase their savings,
he observed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the deposit interest rates are negative in real
terms meaning that they are lower than the inflation rate hence
not able to attract individuals and firms to save, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlers Protest Outpost Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Jewish
settlers demonstrated Sunday night in front of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's residence here against the planned
dismantling of Jewish hilltop outposts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, peace groups and members of the Israeli political
party Meretz organized a counter demonstration nearby to support
the government's decision to dismantle them.
</P>
<P>
The protest against outpost evacuation, organized by the Next
Generation, an organization of the right-wing settlers, was the
biggest right-wing protest since Barak took office in July.
</P>
<P>
Settler leader Shmuel Riklin, in his speech, urged the settlers
to press ahead in building new settlements and expanding the
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last week to dismantle 12 of the 42
hilltop outpost, saying all of them were built illegally, after
reaching an agreement with the settler leaders. The dismantlement
will be finished during the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Hever, member of the Council of Jewish Communities in
the territories and head of the settlement development, tried to
convince the protesters that the agreement reached by the settler
leaders and government is in fact a positive one.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration ended by midnight peacefully.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), will
begin discussing a legislative proposal on illegal religious
activities during its seven-day legislative session that begins
October 25.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the NPC
Standing Committee here today, it was announced that it will cover
drafts of 12 laws, which include laws that contradict the Basic
Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), amendments
to the 1997 Criminal Code, and laws on legislative power and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
A draft of a Highway Law amendment proposed by the State
Council, which failed to pass the legislature six months ago, will
be deliberated again next Monday, according to a legislative
session agenda that was adopted at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are intended to pave the way for a fuel tax
to replace various overlapping vehicle fees. The legislature will
also discuss and decide on nominations for the Central Military
Commission of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided
over today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to NPC sources, the bill banning illegal religious
activities is primarily aimed at dealing with the Falun Gong cult,
which has spread to various parts of China and threatened social
stability.

The Existing Macao laws that conflict with the principles of
the Basic Law of the Macao SAR will be revised or deleted when
Macao returns to the motherland December 20 of this year,
according to one proposal.
</P>
<P>
A draft of amendments to the Criminal Code that was adopted
two years ago is intended to increase penalties on violations of
the accountancy law and criminal behavior in futures transactions.
</P>
<P>
The draft on legislation is of special interest to the
public because it is expected to stop local offices and
departments from exceeding their legislative authority and passing
regulations that violate existing laws.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the legislature will discuss a proposal to
increase checks on the central government budget and amendments to
the product quality law. Also on the seven-day session's agenda
are amendments to meteorological work, accountancy, maritime
environmental protection, legislative controls on courts and
prosecutors, and procedures in maritime legal disputes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Council will submit three international
treaties for ratification, which include an international
convention on protecting cultural heritage during armed conflicts.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Reporters from China's leading
media organizations started a media blitz today to raise public
awareness of the need to preserve China's most valuable relics,
with assistance from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
The group of 30 reporters and bureau experts left Beijing today
for a close look at relics in Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi and Shanxi
provinces that date back as much as 4,000 years in the month-long
activity.
</P>
<P>
Among the relics are those from China's two earliest dynasties,
the Xia (2,100-1,600 B.C.) and Shang (1,600-1100 B.C.) in central
China's Henan Province and terracotta figures from the tomb of the
first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) in western Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Also included are some of the best relics from imperial tombs
of the Han (206 B.C.- 220 A.D.), Tang (618-907), and Qing (1644-
1911) dynasties and from Xibeipo in north China's Hebei Province,
where late Chinese Leader and founder of New China Mao Zedong
lived and worked for years during the national liberation war (
1945-1949).
</P>
<P>
In a speech to media representatives and experts today, Zhang
Wenbin, director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, said that
the campaign will draw serious attention to the need for
preservation and will help stop crimes involving cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Kuwait Seal Last Chapter of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Ambassador to Amman
Faisal Meshaan assumed duties on Sunday, sealing the finishing
touch of reconciliation nine years after relations deteriorated
between the two countries, the semi-official Jordan Times reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meshaan arrived in Amman with his wife on Sunday and took his
post immediately, the paper quoted an unnamed Kuwaiti diplomat as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meshaan had served as head of the Arab Nation Department at the
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry and ambassador to Qatar before his
accreditation in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti ambassador's post had been vacant since August
1990 when Kuwait recalled its top envoy from Amman, which had
sided with Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded the emirate.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also expelled Jordanian diplomatic envoys during the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has apparently distanced itself from Iraq since 1995
and has taken various measures to improve its ties with Iraq's
Gulf war foes Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The normalization process between Jordan and Kuwait was crowned
last September when Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein paid a
ground-breaking visit to Kuwait, the first by a Jordanian monarch
in over a decade.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the visit, Jordan appointed a new
ambassador to the emirate for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait has not opened its lucrative labor market to
Jordanian workers who had remitted hundreds of millions of U.S.
dollars each year from the emirate prior to the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait expelled some 250,000 Jordanian workers during the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Stresses Pragmatism in Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad emphasized on Monday his country's determination
to depend on its devotion to pragmatism on the road to economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said this in his keynote address at the start of the
Eighth East Asia Economic Summit organized by the
Switzerland-based World Economic Forum and Singapore Economic
Board.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's success over the last generation has been
achieved because of its devotion to doing what works although it
was often contrary to the advice and criticism of those who want
to teach or to push "the one" sure formula for success.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our success in the future will continue to be
dependent on our devotion to pragmatism, to doing what works for
us -- for our own unique economies and for our own unique
societies," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country needs the right of self-determination, that
is, to act in light of its circumstances and decide on its own
national and societal priorities, instead of the dictation by
others.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the Asian economic crisis, he said,
Malaysia once turned to what the western press called "the IMF
(International Monetary Fund) without the IMF" formula for help --
massive increases in interests rates, massive cuts in government
expenditures and massive contraction in credit.
</P>
<P>
But despite all the efforts, the Malaysian economy was still
sinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It took us some time to discover and to adopt the single most
important strategic measure -- the adoption of selective currency
controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
One year later, he said, the measure has brought many favorable
results, such as the increase of foreign reserves, the
appreciation of the Malaysian ringgit and the rise of trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF expertise on Malaysia, a difficult, complex but
historically unproblematic economy with which it is hardly
acquainted, is understandably limited." he said.
</P>
<P>
Closing his speech, he said he believes that everything in this
world can be achieved through different ways and by different
routes.
</P>
<P>
"We will do it our own way and the world should not condemn and
obstruct us merely because our way is different." he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also called for East Asian countries' comprehensive,
multi-dimensional cooperation in achieving peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the establishment of an Eastasian Monetary Fund
(EMF), a compact regional funding organization for facilitating
monetary cooperation and dealing with crises on a daily basis.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Defense Ministry has

arms to Jordan, the first time an Israeli firm has been allowed to
sell weapons and defense equipment to an Arab state.
</P>

as saying.
</P>

No Israeli individuals or firms were allowed to sell arms to
Arab countrie arms sales to Jordan

sign peace treaties with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Pledges to Address Hamas Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Sunday evening he will intervene in the issue of the
radical Palestinian group Hamas in Jordan after he returns home
next week.
</P>
<P>
"When I return I will be briefed by the government on what is
going on and what needs to be done," the monarch said in his
residence in the United States in an interview with Jordan
Television.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is on a 10-day visit to the U.S. on bilateral ties and
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question over the status of Hamas
members who were arrested during a month-long clamp-down in Jordan
on the Islamic movement in September.
</P>
<P>
Hamas politburo chief Khalid Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim
Ghosheh are among the 21 Hamas members currently detained in the
Jweidah Prison in southern Amman on charges of "belonging to an
illegal group."
</P>
<P>
Mishaal and Ghosheh started a hunger strike on Saturday,
demanding their freedom and the "injustice against them be lifted."
</P>
<P>
The Hamas members were also charged with involvement in
illegal political activities, illegal possession of weapons and
carrying out military exercises in Jordan as part of their
campaigns against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a militant Palestinian group which remains
opposed to the peace process with Israel. It calls for a holy war
to liberate all Palestinian territories from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The roundup of Hamas members in Jordan was apparently aimed
at containing Hamas activities at a time when the peace process is
making progress.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been actively promoting the peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors after it signed a peace treaty with
the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas enjoyed wide-spread sympathy in the majority
Palestinian population in the desert kingdom. Over 60 percent of
Jordan's 460 million population are of Palestinian origins.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, an umbrella group
for Hamas, had asked King Abdullah to intervene in the Hamas
issue and to get the release of the detained Hamas members.

<HEADLINE> Global Teochew Natives Meet in Thailand to Close Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PATTAYA (THAILAND), October 18 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000
representatives of Teochew or in Chinese "Chaozhou" natives from
more than 30 countries and regions attended the 10th Teochew
International Convention Monday in Pattaya, a resort city in
central Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri delivered the
opening speech, saying he hopes the convention will help further
deepen the friendship among Teochew natives and strengthen
economic and cultural cooperation between the countries they are
now living in.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Fu Xuezhang expects Teochew
natives to continue carrying forward the spirit of solidarity and
cooperativeness, make greater contribution to the social and
economic development of the countries they are now living in and
the revitalization of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The First Teochew International Convention was held in Hong
Kong in 1981 and the last one was held in Shantou, China, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Teochew, or Chaozhou, refers to a part of the coastal areas in
South China's Guangdong Province. A lot of people living there
migrated overseas in the past century because of poverty and many
of them have become successful businessmen in the countries they
immigrated to.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Inches Up to 1.95 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate rose
marginally by 0.7 percentage points to 1.95 percent for the week
ending October 2, as vegetable prices shot up by a hefty 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on the wholesale price index (WPI), rose to 1.95
percent compared with 1.88 percent in the previous week and 8.32
percent in the corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise is mainly on account of a 1.4-percent increase in food
articles, especially vegetables. Though the vegetable prices have
been rising this year, they are still way below the prices of last
year thanks to a good agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the diesel prices to push up the inflation rate
by about two percentage points in the next few weeks.

TOKYO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply in
Tokyo Monday, following a plunge on Wall Street last Friday, with
the key Nikkei index closing below 17,500 for the first time in 12
trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 326.24 points, or 1.85
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 17,275.33.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 50.03 point or 3.31 percent to 1,460.23.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 560.41 million
shares from 769.49 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York declined 266.90
points, the largest one-day point fall this year, to 10,019.71,

Remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
last Thursday urging U.S. bankers to prepare for a sudden plunge

Investors in Tokyo will remain hesitant to buy stocks as long

Despite the plunge, the insurance sector was strong following
reports of a business alliance by three Japanese nonlife insurance
companies.

Other financial sectors, however, faced selling following their
recent gains, while export-oriented technology issues lower.

BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua)-- An unprecedented second college
entrance examination is expected to be held by 10 to 15
universities and colleges early next year to give students who

schools in March.
</P>
<P>
If the second entrance examination is applied, it will mark an

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Assures No Retrenchment in Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 82,000 bank
workers in Malaysia was Monday given assurance that none of them
will be forced to resign due to mergers among local banks.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's policy to protect the interests of the
bank workers since there are now fewer job opportunities, Second
Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said when replying to a question
in Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have 82,482 workers in the banking sector, and the
government today gives its assurance that forced resignation of
workers will not happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government ordered last July the 58 local
financial institutions to merge into six core banking groups.
</P>
<P>
All the institutions have signed memorandums of understanding
on the mergers by the end of last September.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said the merger exercise was aimed at strengthening
local financial institutions to enable them to compete with
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no political agenda, and instead the move was
for the country's economic interests and integrity.

<HEADLINE> No Ready Formula for Crisis-Hit Economies: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai told the 8th East Asia Economic Summit here Monday that
there is no ready formula to rebuild economies in the aftermath of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his key-note address at the opening of the summit
organized by the Switzerland-based World Economy Forum in
partnership with Singapore's Economic Development Board, the prime
minister stressed that "structural change is a must" to rebuild
economies hit by the crisis and "there does not exist a ready nor
single formula for structural change and reform."
</P>
<P>
"Every country has its own unique characteristics and special
problems, all of which demand their own solutions and approaches,"
he said, adding that "there are some basic principles that equally
apply to all countries and governments must be the pro-active
agents of change -- the architects of reform -- if a faster and
more sustained recovery is to be achieved."
</P>
<P>
In his address the Thai prime minister highlighted the ongoing
recovery, returning confidence and the need to push forward
reforms in his country as well as in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai told some 700 participants of the meeting that
"It is becoming increasingly evident that many of the countries
hard hit by crisis have already started to recover quicker and to
a greater extent than previously anticipated and confidence is
returning," citing that the International Monetary Fund has
recently revised upwards Thailand's growth projection for this
year from one percent to almost four percent.
</P>
<P>
On lessons learned from the crisis, the prime minister said
financial and economic disruptions lead to severe social
repercussions and "we have to build up our societies, providing
them with solid foundations on all fronts -- economic, political
and social."
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice but to be more responsive to market
conditions and trends...We have to ensure that our economies are
competitive with sound macro-economic policies, with professional
and accountable public and private sectors, and with
internationally accepted regulatory and supervisory framework--all
of which are necessary if we are to achieve sustainable growth and
development in the long range."
</P>
<P>
Summing up the achievements and difficulties in carrying out
the reforms his government has initiated, the Thai Prime Minister
emphasized the principles underlying his country's reform are to
believe in the rewards and penalties of a free market system, to
encourage Thai corporate sector to work toward international
standard of governance and transparency and to strengthen national
competitive position with a clear long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai also underlined the need to extend structural
change to the regional and global levels as well and urged
countries in the region to draw lessons from the past experience
and cooperate with one another to prevent another crisis from
recurring.
</P>
<P>
While answering questions, the prime minister expressed his
hope that the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle in November this
year would benefit all its members and there would be closer
cooperation between Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Poll Indicates New Zealand Election Cliffhanger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The general election of New
Zealand, which will fall on November 27, is shaping up as a
cliffhanger, according to the latest opinion poll in the country.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the country's ruling party the National Party
and its main rival the Labor Party, is closing, and NZ First
would, like the last general election, hold the balance of power,
Television New Zealand-Colmar Brunton poll showed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,000 people showed support for the National Party
led by current Prime Minister Jenny Shipley was up two percentage
points to 37 percent from the previous one, while the Labor Party
led by Helen Clark was down two points to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance, a main ally of the Labor Party, was down two
points to 4.5 percent, while ACT NZ, a main partner of the
National Party, was up two points to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
NZ First was up two points to six percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll continues the trend shown in other recent polls of a
narrowing gap between the main parties.
</P>
<P>
The result of the latest poll would mean that neither a
National-ACT nor a Labor-Alliance coalition could govern without
NZ First backing.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Shipley's rating as preferred prime minister was up eight
percentage points to 31 percent, while Helen Clark's rating was up
two points to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll has a margin of error of 3.2 percent.

DHAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina left here for Australia Sunday night on a five-day official
visit, at the invitation of her Australian counterpart John
Howard, press reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a Bangladeshi head of state or
government to Australia, an important development partner of
Bangladesh and one of the country's donors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who is leading a 52-member delegation, will
hold official talks with the Australian prime minister in Canberra
and will also visit Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment issues are likely to dominate her talks
with Howard, and Hasina is scheduled to address an investors'
conference.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on the utilization of Australian
aid in Bangladesh would also be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Australian National University will confer an honorary

<P>
The visit would be "a landmark event" in the relations between
the two countries, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told

</P>
<P>
He said Australia has provided about 400 million U.S. dollars
as development aid to Bangladesh since the latter's independence.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi-Australian trade is "insignificant" now, and the
trip is expected to increase bilateral trade, concerned sources
said.

<HEADLINE> A Thai Bank to Sue Students over Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Krung Thai Bank
is preparing to sue about 20,000 students who took out educational
loans from the bank but failed to repay them, local newspaper The
Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
New policy measures would be introduced to deal with bad debts
of the bank's Educational Fund and increase the rate of repayment
next year, Direk Phonakhon, the bank's executive in charge of the
program, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said 26,876 students who received loans from the Krung Thai
Bank Education Fund were to pay their first installments on July
5. The bank expected to receive repayments totaling 673.67 million
baht (16.84 million U.S. dollars), or 1.5 percent of the loans, on
that day.
</P>
<P>
But only 6,750 borrowers paid the first installment. The other
20,117 debtors did not pay, though 2,000 of them contacted the
bank seeking changes to their repayment schedules.
</P>
<P>
"Those who should have started repaying their loans, but found
they were unable to find the money must advise the bank.
Rescheduling, however, has to be in accordance with the bank's
refinancing regulations," said Direk.
</P>
<P>
Krung Thai Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education, has provided low-interest educational loans to students
from low-income families. Students start repaying their loans two
years after they graduates.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate is only one percent and the repayment period
is 15 years, according to Direk.
</P>
<P>
According to the fund's regulations, those who cannot repay
their loans because of unemployment, injury or illness, must
request that their repayments be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
The bank might then agree to postpone repayments by up to six
months, Direk said.

<P>
However, there is wide speculation that the Parliament will be
dissolved by the end of this month to pave the way for the
much-talked about next general election which is due by the first
half of 2000 but was speculated to be held in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the parliamentary sitting Monday, the
ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) pre-council meeting
was held and decided that all ministers give briefings on the
budget of their respective ministries and whatever issues related
to it, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters
after chairing the meeting at Parliament House.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants Radioactive Cargo Shipment Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia on Monday called
for an internationally accepted legal regime to check the
transportation of ultra hazardous radioactive cargo by sea.
</P>
<P>
The absence of such a regime must be urgently addressed,
Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said
here Monday in his opening address at a two-day conference on
"Carriage of Ultra Hazardous Radioactive Cargo by Sea:
Implications and Responses," organized by the Maritime Institute
of Malaysia. His speech was read out by his deputy Abu Bakar Daud.
</P>
<P>
At present the international legal regime pertaining to the
transportation of ultra hazardous cargo does not impose
prohibitions on sailing routes, exposing littoral states like
Malaysia to great danger, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Shipments and movement of ultra hazardous radioactive
materials have been our major concern as undesirable incidents can
happen no matter what amount of precautions might have been
taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said although the international community had made
some positive steps to address the risks created by the movements
of ultra hazardous cargo, there were still no agreements regarding
salvage responsibilities, liability for damages, obligations to
consult, advance notification and contingency plan to handle
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's position on this is very clear. We insist on prior
authorization and demand that flag state be accountable for their
actions as expressly stated in the Malaysian Declaration upon
ratification of the Convention of the Law of the Sea 1982," the
minister emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Importers and exporters of such hazardous materials must also
be accountable for their actions through an accepted international
legal regime, he added.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that littoral states have every right to
refuse passage to such ships, in view of the potential hazard it
poses to the littoral states, saying such a passage no longer
constitutes "innocent passage" under international law.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here Monday
ordered former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to enter his
defense on the charge of sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, the former
driver of Anwar's wife.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja was also
ordered to enter defense on the same case.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the decision, justice Arifin Jaka said after a
maximum evaluation of all the admissible evidence by the
prosecution, "I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved its
case beyond reasonable doubt against accused 1 (Anwar) and accused
2 (Sukma)."
</P>
<P>
The judge dismissed the application by Anwar's counsel Karpal
Singh for the court's reasons for its decision, saying "I am not
obliged to give my reasons for calling the defense at this stage."
</P>
<P>
"This is not a complicated case. This is just an ordinary
criminal case of sodomy under the Penal Code," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision of the court depended on the evidence
adduced.
</P>
<P>
Asking for reasons, Karpal Singh claimed that this is a
"complicated and a high profile case."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Sharply Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
amounted to only 11.823 million U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year, plummeting by 94.73 percent from the same period of
last year when 224.482 million dollars came in.
</P>
<P>
During the half-year period, Myanmar absorbed investment from
India, Thailand, Japan and Indonesia with 4.5 million dollars, 4.5
million dollars, 1.446 million dollars and 1.377 million dollars
respectively, according to the latest figures published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 7.323 million dollars were injected into
manufacturing sector in three projects, 3.5 million dollars into
hotels and tourism sector in one project and 1 million dollars
into mining sector in one project.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop of foreign investment was mainly attributed to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government openly admitted recently that due to the
effect of the crisis, direct investment from member countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations reduced by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, since Myanmar opened to foreign
investment in late 1988, the country has drawn a total of 7.1
billion dollars from 24 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The 10 major foreign investors lined up as Britain, Singapore,
Thailand, Malaysia, France, the United States, Indonesia, the
Netherlands, the Philippines and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China ranked the 14th with 30.826 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gets Less Customs Duties Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar gained a total of only
389 million U.S. dollars in customs duties in the first half of
this year, 46.34 percent less than that the 725 million dollars it
obtained in the same period of last year, according to the latest
figures released by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of the total customs duties income, that obtained from import
through normal trade amounted to as high as 339 million dollars,
accounting for 87.14 percent of the total, while that gained from
import through border trade was only 46.33 million dollars,
accounting for 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, Myanmar received a total of
1.135 billion dollars of custom duties income, a reduction of 10.9
percent compared with 1997 when the figure was 1.274 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has made some adjustments in the rate
of customs duties in an effort to boost the development of
agriculture. It exempted import duties on agricultural implements
including machinery, pesticide and fertilizer while raising import
duties on luxury goods.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuke Plant Running Smoothly After Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- After its fourth routine
interruption in power supply and a stringent overhaul, Qinshan
Nuclear Power Plant (QNPP) in east China's Zhejiang Province has
reached full power again, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
In January last year, the plant's workers noticed a minor alarm.
Since the key parameters were just within operational limits and
the reactor was shrouded in several safe, strong and impenetrable
shields, the plant kept working until the fourth outage began on
July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stringent examinations were carried out by Chinese experts and
foreign experts from the Westinghouse Electric Company of the U.S.
Then, the problem found was: some connectors of the thumb tube end
had failed, part of the tube was damaged, and as a result about 0.
08 percent of the fuel rods were affected by the loose parts.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by the China National Nuclear Safety Administration
(CNNSA), specialists redesigned and replaced the failed components
of the core internals and affected rods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relevant modifications and rectification were made
to the whole plant.
</P>
<P>
"The problem was a mechanical hitch, and we have solved it,"
said Lin Deshun, general manager of the nuclear power company.
</P>
<P>
QNPP was the first indigenously designed, constructed and
operated prototype nuclear power plant on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring data from environment protection authorities
indicate the plant's waste disposal is under control and much
lower than the national waste disposal limit, imposing no negative
effect on the environment so far.
</P>
<P>
China is a member state of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and QNPP is a member of the world Association of
Nuclear Operators (WANO).
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power plant fully accepts the surveillance of the
CNNSA and the IAEA and event reports, including the latest one,
have been delivered to the IAEA and the WANO Tokyo Center and are
also open to the media, said Lin.
</P>
<P>
The plant receives a lot of support from the IAEA and other
nuclear power plants throughout its construction, operation and
outages, according to Lin.

<HEADLINE> More Than 200 Tamil Rebels Killed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops have killed
more than 200 Tamil Tiger rebels, including its seven leaders, and
injured many others in four days of fierce fighting starting last
Thursday in the north of the country, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said the army has lost at least 40 soldiers and more than
360 were wounded in the operation code-named "Watershed" launched
at Ampakamam, about 260 kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that heavily armed infantry troops supported
by the artillery and MI-24 ground attack helicopters continued to
mount attacks on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), in a statement
sent here from their London office, said scores of Sri Lankan
soldiers were killed and hundreds more were injured when rebels
resisted an attempt by the soldiers to overrun their front defense
lines.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE placed their own losses at 48 killed in land battles
and six dead in a sea confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio confirmed that the army
had penetrated their defenses in another front at Ampakamam by
using artillery and air power.
</P>
<P>
The battle, the fiercest in weeks, began when the LTTE rebels
launched an attack on the army's defense line at Ampakamam with
machine guns and mortars. The troops retaliated effectively with
artillery causing heavy casualties among the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization a Top Priority in China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China is considering making
urbanization a top priority in the first five-year plan period of
the new century to sustain economic and social growth, according
to the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
The commission, a key planner of the country's 10th Five-Year
Plan (2001-2005), has decided that a correct urbanization strategy
is crucial to addressing a host of problems facing China, such as
sluggish consumer demand and backward rural economy, today's China
Daily quoted Xu Lin, an SDPC division director as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's guiding principle of urbanization is to plan and
develop super-large and large cities, expand medium-sized cities,
and improve small cities and towns, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"We deem that accelerating urbanization pace is the most
effective way to expand domestic demand and encourage rural
modernization," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1997 urbanization rate of 32 percent lagged for
behind the world's average of 50 percent, according to the World
Development Report 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
To bring up China's urbanization level to the world average,
the country will have to turn over 300 million rural dwellers into
urban residents, which could create tremendous investment and
consumer demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
A 1-percent urbanization increase annually over the next 15
years could stimulate the market demand and rural consumption that
the government is looking for, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Such an expansion rate calls for shifting 85 million of the
rural population into cities within the next five years. According
to SDPC projections, if each of them spends 30,000 yuan in housing
and urban infrastructure construction, there will be demand for
construction and housing rental worth 2,550 billion yuan, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Urban newcomers will also purchase an estimated 400 billion
yuan worth consumer products including color TVs, refrigerators
and washing machines annually, thus substantially alleviating
industrial product surpluses.
</P>
<P>
"The urbanization process will create job opportunities and
help unemployment," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Fewer farmers in rural areas will contribute to readjusting
crop growing mix, expanding need for farm produce and enlarging
agricultural production scale, narrowing the income gap between
rural residents and urban residents, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC has reached a consensus that China now has favorable
conditions for speeding up urbanization through 2015, when the
country's urbanization rate should reach 50 percent, noted Xu.
</P>
<P>
Although the planned rate of urbanization increase is much
faster than that over the past 50 years, the SDPC official said
they are optimistic the rate can be achieved given economic
development and policy support factors.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Only 183 parliament
representatives out of the 485 who were elected in the 1990
General Election remain valid as of the end of May this year,
according to the country's Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The 302 others include 91 resigned, 31 died, 72 disqualified
under election law and 108 canceled for breach of law.
</P>
<P>
Of the 392 elected parliament representatives of the winning
opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), only 129 remain
valid. The 263 others include 82 resigned, 26 died, 38
disqualified under election law, 95 canceled for breach of law and
22 became independent elected, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The 1990 general election, contested by 93 political parties,
was sponsored by the Myanmar military government on May 27 that
year after it took over the power of state on September 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The NLD complains that no parliament session has been held
until now although the election ended for many years. The NLD
demanded on June 23, 1998 that the government convene the
parliament elected in the election setting a dead line of 60 days,
but it's demand was ignored.
</P>
<P>
Later on September 16 that year, the NLD unilaterally formed a
10-member "Committee Representing the People's Parliament Elected
in the 1990 General Election" and set up the "People's
Parliament."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar government regarded itself as a
"transitional or caretaker government" which has "no intention" to
hold on to power for long time.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Indonesian Golkar Party's Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, the
incumbent president of the Republic of Indonesia, is the sole
presidential candidate for the 1999/2004 term of the Golkar Party,
the House's second largest political party which had ruled the
country for the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
He began reading newspapers when he was a child. His lifelong
religious devotion continues in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Jali Habibie from the South Sulawesi town of
Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13. Then his Javanese mother
brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, West Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of deep sea submarine and a
high-pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> KFOR Condemns KLA for Terrorist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo Peacekeeping Force
(KFOR) on Sunday condemned the illegal Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
for violating the demilitarization agreement and continuing its
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
A KFOR spokesman told a press conference in Pristina that large
numbers of Kosovo ethnic Albanians assembled at the village of
Gornje on Saturday, some of them wearing the forbidden KLA
uniforms and many carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said this assembly obviously violated the demilitarization
agreement and was intolerable.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the KFOR admitted the KLA was not
totally disarmed.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug noted that increased KLA
terrorist activities, especially the serious conflict in Kosovska
Mitrovica with the KFOR soldiers, had been worsening the relations
between the two sides and their "honeymoon" is over.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations demilitarization resolution,
the KLA should be completely disarmed before September 19. The
KFOR' representatives and the KLA leaders declared on September 21
that the KLA would cease to exist as from that day and would be
reorganized into a civilian force, the Kosovo Protection Corps.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Coup Overshadows SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The bloodless military coup in
Pakistan has cast a long shadow on the upcoming 11th summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
How the military takeover in Pakistan will affect SAARC is not
yet clear, but diplomats here said that an immediate consequence
might be the postponement of the 11th summit due to take place on
November 26 in the Nepali capital of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf was
sacked by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last Tuesday and then
reportedly initiated the coup overnight after returning from
Colombo where he had been invited to attend the Sri Lankan army's
golden jubilee celebrations.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since the formation of the SAARC in 1985
that a member country's government has been ousted by a military
coup.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the regional grouping is to face a dilemma
whether it should breach its charter which precludes discussion on
bilateral or internal issues.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad has been barred to attend this year's Commonwealth
Summit in South Africa and its membership in the Commonwealth was
reportedly to be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
However, SAARC is likely to accept Pakistan's participation in
the summit despite the coup because summits of the grouping cannot
be held unless all member states are represented either by head of
state or head of government.
</P>
<P>
In November 1991, the then government of Sri Lankan President
Premadasa had to cancel the scheduled summit when the King of
Bhutan declined to attend. However, the summit took place a month
later with the Bhutanese King present.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the current
chairperson of SAARC, has yet to react to the developments in
Pakistan while Foreign Minister Kadirgamar was quoted by local
press as saying, "we are watching events closely."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Sri Lanka is not likely to oppose Pakistan being
represented at the summit by General Pervez Musharraf although
Sharif in late August accepted an invitation from the Nepalese
Foreign Minister Ram Sharan Mahat to attend the November summit.
</P>
<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and Nepal have called for the restoration of
democracy in Pakistan while it's arch rival India has so far not
revealed its position with regard to Pakistan's participation.
</P>
<P>
India's new government has refrained from denouncing the
military rule in Islamabad, simply expressing "grave concern" over
the ouster of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from smaller SAARC member states who are always
unhappy over Indo-Pakistan bickering that dominates or overshadows
regional summits are once again worried that the Pakistan coup
will play spoilsport this time.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, local newspapers have warned of the coup's
problems for the upcoming SAARC summit and cautioned that the
Pakistan coup could also jeopardize a South Asian tour planned by
U.S. President Bill Clinton early next year.
</P>
<P>
Two earlier trips planned by Clinton to the subcontinent were
put off, first because of tension in the Middle East and then
because of rival nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who has appointed himself the Chief
Executive of Pakistan, announced in a much awaited speech Sunday
night that he will head the all-powerful National Security Council
and Pakistan will continue to honor international obligations and
commitments as in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, other SAARC members are anxious to make clear where
Pakistan is heading for and what is the fate of the last SAARC
summit in this century, which should be designed to plan its
future developments for the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Crime Rate Continues to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in the United
States declined in 1998 for the seventh straight year, with the
murder and robbery rates being the lowest in three decades, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies
and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level
since 1985, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes
reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998,
down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder
every 31 minutes, but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six
slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime
rate to "more police officers on the street, greater partnerships
between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns
away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes
prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision."
</P>
<P>
"This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can
indeed turn the tide on crime," President Bill Clinton said in a
statement. But he cautioned that "even as crime falls, we must
not let down our guard. That is why we must redouble our efforts
to build on what works."
</P>
<P>
The report also said firearms were used in 64.9 percent of
murders. Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported
used in the killings.

Pesantren, or traditional Islamic boarding schools, in Java before
undertaking tertiary level studies at the Al-Azhar Islamic
university in Cairo, Egypt in 1964. From Al-Azhar he went on to
further studies in the field of literature at the University of
Baghdad in Iraq in 1966, and returned to Indonesia in 1970.

and stability. In recent years, however, he has increasingly been
seen as an opposition figure as he, together with some leading
public intellectuals, launched the ginger group "Forum Demokrasi"
(Democratic Forum) to campaign for democratic reform. His public
criticism of former president Soeharto resulted in him being
placed under considerable political pressure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profile of Indonesian Golkar's Vice Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- General Wiranto, Defense
Minister and Commander of the Indonesian Military, is the sole
vice presidential candidate for the 1999/2004 term of the Golkar
Party, the House's second largest political party which had ruled
the country for the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
Born in Yogyakarta, Central Java, on April 4, 1947, Wiranto had
graduated from the National Military Academy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Wiranto was a platoon leader in the 713th Infantry
Battalion in Manado, capital of North Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
After a low-profile career in the infantry and the Army's
Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad), including two stints in East
Timor, Wiranto's career took off after he served as the former
president Soeharto's adjutant between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
After becoming a staff officer in the Jakarta Military Command
in 1993, Wiranto assumed the post as chief of the Jakarta Military
Command between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was chief of the Kostrad in 1996. After assuming the
post of chief of the Army in 1997, his rank was promoted to
general.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, Wiranto became Commander of the Indonesian
Armed Forces. When Soeharto was re-elected by the People's
Consultative Assembly as president in March 1998, Wiranto occupied
the defense and security portfolio in the Soeharto's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
When B.J. Habibie was sworn in as president on May 21, 1998
after Soeharto resigned amid the country's worst political and
economic crisis, Wiranto retained his post as the defense and
security minister in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Wiranto made sweeping changes among his
top officers in a move seen as consolidating his position to carry
out reforms within the military which has come under great public
pressure following revelations of gross human rights violations
during Soeharto's 32-year rule.

<HEADLINE> Rios Regains Singapore Open Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and denfending
champion Marcelo Rios retained his crown on Sunday at the
Singapore Open Tennis tournament, beating Swedish qualifier Mikael
Tillstrom 6-2, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the men's doubles' title was grabbed by Belarussian
Max Mirnyi and American Eric Taino after scoring a win over second-
seeded Australian Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Rios, with his flowing movements around the court and heavy-
weight serves, did not find much difficulty in trashing his
unseeded opponent in the first set who had to qualify for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Only in the second set, the Swedish who put compatriot Jonas
Bjorkman out of the court in the second round began to launch a
come-back.
</P>
<P>
Rios, however, managed to keep the lead throughout the set and
nailed the result of the set at 7-6.
</P>
<P>
The title, his third for the year and the fifteenth in his
career, should keep the Chilean at number 6 in the world ranking
as he was defending his points from Singapore last year.
</P>
<P>
The final should bring Tillestrom, currently ranking at 146,
inside the top 100.
</P>
<P>
Last week in the finals of the Shanghai Open, Rios lost to
Swedish Magnus Norman 6-2, 3-6, 5-7.
</P>
<P>
But in Singapore the two had no chance to meet as Norman was
shocked out even in the first round by Thai number one Paradorn
Srichaphan 3-6, 6-1, 3-6.

The following are facts and figures about Indonesia:
</P>
<P>
Official Name: The Republic of Indonesia
</P>
<P>
Area: 1,904,443 square kilometers
</P>
<P>
Geography: Indonesia, the largest archipelago nation in the
world, consists of about 17,508 islands, lying between the
mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. The islands, of which
some 6,000 are inhabited, stretch from the Malay Peninsula to New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The five main islands are: Sumatera which is about 473,606 sq.
km. in size; the most-fertile-and-densely-populated islands Java
and Madura, 132,107 sq. km.; Kalimantan which is two-thirds of the
island of Borneo measuring 439,460 sq km; Sulawesi 189,216 sq. km.
and Irian Jaya 421,981 sq. km. which is part of the world's second
largest island of New Guinea. The other islands are smaller in
size.
</P>
<P>
Population: 207.535 million in 1998, making Indonesia the
world's fourth most populous country after China, India and the
United States. About 120 million people live on the main Java
island.
</P>
<P>
Capital: Jakarta (population more than 10 million).
</P>
<P>
Language: There are about 583 languages and dialects spoken in
the whole archipelago. Bahasa Indonesia (based primarily on Malay)
is the official language. English, Dutch and about 25 local
languages (primarily Javanese) are also used.
</P>
<P>
Religion: About 88 percent of the inhabitants say they are
followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, making Indonesia the
world's largest Muslim country. Roughly 10 percent are Christian
(Protestant and Roman Catholic) and approximately 2 percent Hindu
and Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
Defense Forces: In 1997 the total strength of the armed forces

</P>
<P>
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) -- The MPR, as the
nation's highest state institution, has the full right to make
decisions on the issues of the presidency. The 1945 constitution
vests the highest authority in the MPR consisting of 700 members
-- 500 from the House of Representatives and 200 nominated by the
president.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The president, who is elected
to a five-year term by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
is the head of state and government. As mandatory of the MPR, he
must execute the policy of the state according to the decrees
determined by the MPR during its four general and special
sessions. In conducting the administration of the state, authority
and responsibility are concentrated on the president. The
ministers of the state are his assistance and responsible only to
him. Presidential powers encompass a variety of independent
executive and administrative duties.
The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is Indonesia's highest
state institution. Sovereignty is in the hands of the people and
is exercised in full by the MPR as the embodiment of the whole
Indonesian people. The People's Consultative Assembly is to be
distinguished from the legislative body proper -- House of
Representatives or DPR which is incorporated in the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The MPR has a total of 700 members who serve for five years,
including
500 members of the DPR and 200 presidential appointees (135 from
regional
representatives and 65 from functional representatives).
</P>
<P>
The MPR is required to meet once every 5 years, and its duties
include
electing the president and vice president, amending the
Constitution and
approving the broad policy aims of the government.
</P>
<P>
The 500-member DPR exercises legislative authority, with 462
directly
elected and 38 reserved for the Armed Forces whose members do not
vote.
</P>
<P>
The DPR meets at least once a year. All laws must have the
approval of
the DPR, but the president has absolute veto. Members of the DPR
have the
right to submit draft bills which require ratification by the
president.
The president may enact ordinance in times of emergency, which
however
must be either ratified or revoked by the DPR at its following
session.

<HEADLINE> Redknapp: 'Big Mouth' Wenger to Blame for Di Canio Booking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- West Ham manager Harry Redknapp
claimed Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's "big mouth" was to blame
for Paolo Di Canio's booking in the 2-0 defeat at Middlesbrough on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp was fuming after Di Canio was shown a yellow card by
referee Uriah Rennie for diving in the penalty area following a
challenge from Gary Pallister.
</P>
<P>
The Hammers chief believes Wenger's protestations about Di
Canio's style of play after the fiery clash with the Gunners at
Upton Park earlier this month helped to make up referee Rennie's
mind.
</P>
<P>
Wenger accused Di Canio of diving and provoking the sending-off
of his midfielder Patrick Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp said: "Arsene Wenger had put that in these referees'
minds. The fellow doesn't dive - everybody who watched it said it
was a penalty except the referee unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
"Arsene Wenger opening his big mouth has got him booked.
</P>
<P>
"When he (Di Canio) is brought down in the box what's he
supposed to do, stand on his feet or something? The referee might
have thought he made too much of it but how do you make too much
of it when you get tackled and brought down?
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't fall down he shoots and scores, so why does he
want to go down?"

<HEADLINE> 101,000 Capacity for New Wembley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Wembley chiefs have confirmed
the new national stadium could hold more than 100,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
Stadium bosses and designers have met with government ministers
to discuss the possibility of increasing the proposed capacity
from the original plans of 90,000 to 101,000.
</P>
<P>
This would mean the futuristic new Wembley will be big enough
to meet International Olympic Committee requirements and host
Britain's first Olympic Games since 1948.
</P>
<P>
A bigger capacity would obviously mean an increase in cost for
the new-look stadium, designed by architect Norman Foster and
originally priced at 475 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
It was to be funded by a 120 million pounds lottery grant and
355 million pounds of debt finance, secured on contracts with
sporting organisations to stage future events at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
Wembley's press and public relations manager Martin Corrie said
meetings had taken place to reconsider the capacity after an
approach by the British Olympic Association.
</P>
<P>
Corrie said: "We have met with ministers and have had
discussions in terms of capacity."
</P>
<P>
"Under the terms of the lottery grant we were asked to provide
65,000 seats for athletics, based on the capacity at Barcelona,
and we actually put in provision for 67,500 seats."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Dutch winger Marc Overmars is
set to stun Arsenal by seeking a move to the continent.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Sunday, the 26-year-old said: "I
went to England to win the League title and FA Cup with Arsenal.
That happened quicker than I thought possible.
</P>
<P>
"If you realise your ambitions so quickly, you start dreaming
about new challenges. My next aims are to win a major trophy with
Holland and to win a League championship trophy with a club in
another country."
</P>
<P>
He added in The Mail on Sunday: "My current contract expires in
2004. I wouldn't be surprised if something happens before that."
</P>
<P>
Overmars also revealed that he could have already left the
Gunners had the Highbury board not blocked a clause in his
original contract when he joined from Ajax in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said: "When I first joined Arsenal three years ago, I asked
for a clause that I could leave for a set fee of 10 million pounds.
Arsenal wouldn't allow that.
</P>
<P>
"At the time it seemed like a bizarre amount. Now such a fee
would be negotiated by most clubs.
</P>
<P>
"If I'd had that clause in my contract last summer I probably
would have gone. It doesn't matter that the clause isn't there. We
'll just see what the future brings."

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints Israel May Return Golan to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel Prime Minister Ehud
Barak hinted here Sunday evening that he is willing to return
almost all of Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Barak said Israel would be better
off with peace than with a plateau overlooking its northern
international border.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the statement after being asked repeatedly about
whether he was considering a full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, taken over from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
This was Barak's clearest indication so far that he is ready to
return almost all of the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process on the Israeli-Syrian track has
been stalled for three years. The two sides have recently
expressed willingness to resume negotiations, but differed on how
this can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Syria insisted the talks be restarted from where they were left
off three years ago and Israel promise an eventual withdrawal from
the Golan, while Israel said a resumption of talks should be
without preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Calls on N. Ireland Politicians to Show Courage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern on Sunday called on Northern Ireland politicians to show
moral courage, leadership and responsibility in the current talks
being held with former United States Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration in County
Kildare, in the Republic of Ireland, Ahern said there was an
urgent need for decommissioning and a commitment to non-violence.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time for moral courage, leadership and
responsibility to be shown," a BBC report quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told members of his Fianna Fail party that
Belfast and Northern Ireland stood "tantalisingly" on the brink of
a major political transformation.
</P>
<P>
But he also attacked those campaigning against the political
deal endorsed in a referendum 17 months ago.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is above all, about implementing the declared will
of the people. It would be inconceivable, for example, in any
developed society after a general election that there would be a
refusal by a defeated party, to accept and honour the outcome," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he commended the "courageous political leadership"
shown by Sinn Fein and the parties representing loyalist
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
Ahern also maintained that total disarmament of all
paramilitary organizations, as envisaged in the agreement was "a
situation that has to be achieved".
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell is leading a review of why
the Good Friday Agreement has not yet produced a political
settlement which would allow a power-sharing executive to be set
up in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Agreement politicians attended talks in London last
week and have been briefing their parties on the progress of
efforts to resolve differences over devolution and the
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
The political impasse developed in July after the Ulster
Unionists refused to sit in government with Sinn Fein until the
IRA began to decommission its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says decommissioning is not a precondition in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of talks are due to continue this week.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls on West to Help Serbia Through Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy's United Nations
representative Staffan De Mistura Sunday called on Western
countries to provide food and aid for the Serbian people through
the harsh winter months, arguing that a system like the Iraqi oil-
for-food program could be used.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the close of a three-day conference on Balkan
reconstruction in Italian central city of Gubbio, De Mistura said
that: "the Serbs are facing the most terrible winter of their
history and this is the real emergency that we should be trying to
deal with immediately."
</P>
<P>
He said that the West should not underestimate the problem and
that it was possible to respect the decision to exclude Serbia
from reconstruction aid while at the same time providing
humanitarian help through the winter in a way similar to that in
which Iraq received vital food and medicine supplies despite being
under stringent UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"A similar initiative is possible - help which is destined
exclusively for the Serbian people in order to alleviate the
suffering caused by the bitter Balkan winter," De Mistura said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. representative for south-eastern Europe Richard Sklar
openly admitted that the reconstruction phase in the Balkans was
still a long way from being launched and expressed concern for the
lack of investments in the area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the European Union approved the delivery of
urgently needed oil supplies to two cities run by opposition
mayors hostile to Milosevic in an operation dubbed Oil for
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction conference was organized by the Italian
National Press Federation, the Italian journalists' union, and was
also attended by a number of Italian trade union leaders.

WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Sunday

Pervez Musharraf and urged him to set a "clear timetable" for the
return of civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
In his second broadcast to the nation since taking power five

</P>
<P>
He also announced the unilateral withdrawal of some Pakistani
troops along the border with India.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming those announcements, the United States called
for further steps.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that he did not offer a clear timetable
for the early restoration of constitutional, civilian and
democratic government," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said in a statement. "We call upon him to do so now."
</P>
<P>
The United States also urged Musharraf to expand his troops
withdrawal to forces along the military Line of Control that
divides Indian and Pakistani Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Our own actions toward Pakistan in the days ahead will be
guided by the steps taken by the new authorities," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
CNN in an interview that she would like to see Musharraf to take
the steps "that would return Pakistan to a constitutional system."
</P>
<P>
Albright also urged Musharraf to guarantee the safety of
ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but stopped short of calling
for his return to power.

DAMASCUS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad on Sunday praised visiting former South African President
Nelson Mandela for his support for the Arab nation and world people.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Mandela Sunday night at the grand People's Palace,
Assad also spoke highly of Mandela's history of struggle against
apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mandela praised Syria's policies and Assad's
contributions to the Arab nation and the world.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed a string of international and regional
issues, in addition to their bilateral relations, according to the
official Syrian News Agency. No more details were given.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived here earlier Sunday night on the second leg of
his Mideast tour. He has visited Iran and will travel on to
Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Assad, who expressed welcome
to the "freedom fighter respected around the world."
</P>
<P>
Mandela "is known by everyone in the world," Assad said, "he
did many, many things and made sacrifices, all the people are
indebted to him."

<HEADLINE> Trade Issue Dominates GCC, U.S. Economic Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The trade issue dominated the
joint economic forum between Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries and the United States which was held here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by U.S. Secretary of Commerce William
Daley, who began a two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates on
Saturday, his accompanying business delegation and representatives
from GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the meeting, UAE Minister of Economy and Commerce
Sheikh Fahim bin Sultan Al Qasimi made a keynote speech. He said
trade between the GCC states and the U.S. is crucial for both
parties - the U.S. secures more than 20 percent of its oil from
the GCC states, while the 1998 value of U.S. exports to GCC states
exceeded 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. is the GCC's second largest trading
partner after the European Union, as far as GCC imports are
concerned. GCC countries doubled their imports from the U.S. in
just four years from 8.6 billion dollars in 1994 to 15.3 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, complained about the difficulties GCC
countries are facing in accessing the U.S. market, which include
the quota system, complicated quality standards and high transport
costs.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 estimates of GCC exports to the U.S. totaled less than
9 billion dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of more than 6
billion dollars in favor of the U.S., Sheikh Fahim said.
</P>
<P>
The minister suggested measures to enhance GCC-U.S. trade
relations, including greater participation by U.S. businessmen in
economic activities of the GCC, particularly in privatization and
private sector activities, utilizing GCC states' geographical
location to promote U.S. exports in other parts of the world,
concluding agreements on avoidance of double taxation on personal
and corporation incomes and holding of business conferences and
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts made by GCC countries to integrate their
economies, particularly plans for a unified customs tariff, would
greatly help U.S.-GCC trade.
</P>
<P>
On the economic conditions of the GCC countries, he predicted a
positive growth this year due to the recovery in oil
prices. "That will allow governments to increase spending," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Daley said that the U.S. has a long-standing and
close relationship with the GCC countries in strategic, political
and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current dialog has become more important now
that economic issues and the region's desire for private-led
growth is moving to the center stage.
</P>
<P>
He said there are now more business opportunities for U.S.
companies in the Gulf. "It's a new day for trade in the region and
there is a new spirit of cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has been at the forefront among the Middle East
countries that have strived for economic cooperation and
integration through concerted efforts in recent years. These
efforts are very important for attracting American and other
foreign investors, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the GCC states' efforts for privatization, he said
this was a particularly good time for the businessmen to accompany
him to the GCC countries because they were placing their emphasis
on the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"This means our companies, already in the region, will now

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Russia Help on Radar for Altering of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. newspapers on
Monday disclosed that the United States has offered to help Russia
complete a missile-tracking radar and share more radar data if
Moscow agrees to renegotiate a landmark arms control pact so that
the United States could build a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post and the New York Times said in their
separate stories that if Russia agrees the United States would
help Russia finish a partially constructed radar near the Siberian
city of Irkutsk, that is oriented eastward, covering northern
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Russia might also be given access to data rom U.S.
early-warning radars on the full trajectory of missile launches
and the two countries might collaborate on some satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the United States wants to renegotiate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM), which limits the system the
United States can deploy to ward off warheads.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is due to decide in next June
whether to build a National Missile Defense that would breach the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has consistently opposed Washington's effort to have the
1972 treaty amended.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration decided last month to ask initially
for modest changes in the ABM treaty, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington Post, Russia has officially
rejected U.S. proposals to renegotiate the ABM, but it has agreed
to listen to American ideas. The latest round of talks on the ABM
treaty occurred last week, and the United States has not yet
received a Russian response.
