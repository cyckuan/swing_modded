   WASHINGTON _ In the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the military allies
gave detailed briefings twice a day, in Washington and in Saudi
Arabia, announcing the number of combat flights, targets hit and
Iraqi troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters complained of being spoon-fed only what the Pentagon
wanted them to know, without a chance to confirm independently the
damage to Baghdad's forces.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it was something, which is considerably more than
is being disclosed about the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton's national security advisers flood the
television airwaves with back-to-back-to-back interviews to justify
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, the U.S. military has
clammed up on many of the most basic details of the operation.
Pentagon briefers have refused to discuss what the pilots are
trying to bomb, or whether they have destroyed particular targets.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are concerned that their
colleagues have become overly casual about the handling of
classified information, a complacency that the Defense Department
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, attributed to a belief that U.S.
interests are less at risk in the post-Cold War era. There is also,
he said, a growing hunger for operational details from a media
driven by 24-hour news cycles.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the casual treatment of sensitive material,
Bacon said that a planned cruise missile attack against a Bosnian
Serb mobile missile battery in 1995 was called off after a
televised report of the impending strike. The Serbs, Bacon said,
moved the target after the report aired.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said relatively little about air strikes last
summer against suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan
(even a subsequent awards ceremony for the pilots was held in
secret) and the current low-level bombing campaign against Iraq (so
as not to upset Persian Gulf allies.)
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivities of the 19-member NATO alliance have added
another element to the Yugoslav operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some European allies who don't like this portrayed
as too much of an American show, and there are other allies who
don't want information about their role put out at all,'' said a
senior military spokesman on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels on Friday, a British air
commodore, David Wilby, gave the first details on the total number
of NATO flights (400), a partial list of some of the Yugoslav
targets (18 of 50 sites), the damage inflicted to them (light to
totally destroyed) and videotapes of some of the successful
bombings. But alliance spokesmen still are not talking about
casualties on the ground, the operation's cost, the dogfights that
downed five Yugoslav MiGs and the country-by-country makeup of each
day's attacking air forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, senior administration officials are following a
tightly choreographed script as they seek to manage information and
perceptions of the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Friday appeared on three
television morning news shows, repeating the administration's
deter-or-be-destroyed mantra to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic. But she shied away from specific questions on reports of
massacres by Serbs in Kosovo or attacks on American Embassy
employees in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what the administration will do if Milosevic does not
bow to the bombing, the president's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, sidestepped the question: ``There's one end state if
we do nothing. The end state in the other direction is either a
peace, which we hope to be the case, or a severely diminished
military capacity for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, say it is too early to
discuss publicly the impact of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with journalists. But in an effort to keep a skeptical
Congress supportive, or at least not hostile, military intelligence
analysts gave lawmakers an upbeat, richly detailed classified
assessment of the early attacks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Given the secrecy surrounding ongoing military missions,
administrations have the upper hand in controlling the flow of
information and the spokesmen for that news.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon briefing Friday, reporters challenged Bacon to
provide detailed briefings, as the British have done in London, and
urged him to have Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander,
update his morning briefings to accommodate the evening deadlines
of American reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon sloughed off the complaints, and said he would pass along
the request to Clark.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when a reporter suggested to Bacon that he might
buff his credibility by admitting that some American bombs missed
their mark, as a British military spokesman said this week about
some British strikes, the Pentagon spokesman acknowledged the
information lock-down: ``You haven't heard about many bombs hitting
their targets, either. I think we've been pretty even-handed.''

   KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in `i' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ As NATO stepped up its bombing into
the daylight hours, Yugposlav President Slobodan Milosevic
maintained fierce resistance both on the ground and in the air. Two
of his MiG-29 fighters shot down on what NATO claimed was a foray
into neighboring Bosnia. The sweep by Serb troops through the
ethnic Albanian villages of Kosovo continued unabated, NATO said,
despite the third straight day of air assaults that NATO officials
emphasized would be unrelenting until Milosevic accepted peace. By
Francis X. Clines and Steven Lee Myers. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALLIES (Washington) _ Iceland has no military. Luxembourg
has no air force. Greece doesn't want to bomb a neighbor. And
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have only been NATO members
for two weeks. But those six countries, though not contributing
forces to the assault on Serbia, bridle at the suggestion that they
are not full partners in the allied attack. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA-LEWINSKY (Moscow) _ Russia's rage over NATO
airstrikes in Yugoslavia boiled over when it canceled the upcoming
visit by Monica Lewinsky. She had been scheduled to visit Russia in
June or July to promote a Russian-language version of her book,
`Monica's Story.' Friday night, however, the Russian publisher
announced that the trip was being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-ASSESS (Brussels) _ The allied military strategy for
stopping Serbian attacks against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
rests largely on the hope of a specific Serbian response to the
heavy NATO bombing, according to officials here. The hope, allied
officers and diplomats say, is that intense airstrikes will cause
so much damage to Yugoslavia's army and its sophisticated
air-defense system that Serb commanders may soon pressure him to
back down and accept allied terms before they lose everything. By
Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ In schools around the country, a
complicated lesson in geopolitics has suddenly sprung from the
textbook onto the television screen. And like many of their
parents, students are struggling to make sense of it. Few had heard
of Kosovo before NATO began air strikes on Wednesday. The military
assault and its historical background puzzled students at every
grade level. But they, their parents and their teachers said the
fighting in the Balkans offered a chance to link current events and
history. And teachers were seizing the moment. By Randal C.
Archibold.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-LEGAL (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Yugoslavia skirts
the edge of international law, legal experts say. But there are few
meaningful sanctions that could be imposed under international law
and legal principles are vague enough to provide justification for
the bombing as a humanitarian act. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Jazince, Macedonia) _ Since the bombing began,
accounts of Serb reprisals against Kosovars range from harrassment
and property damage to the killings of civilians. But information
is sketchy and unverifiable. For now, the world is relying on
rushed and emotional reports by a few refugees and scratchy
mobile-phone calls from Kosovars trapped in their homes. By
Alessandra Stanley. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MIGS (Washington) _ The Yugoslav MiG-29s are among the
world's top fighter jets. But NATO has Awacs radar planes to track
their every move, long-range air-to-air missiles to shoot at them
and better trained pilots who anticipate the Yugoslav pilots'
antiquated Soviet-style tactics. And that is why NATO has shot down
5 of Belgrade's 15 most advanced MiGs in the past three days. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERB (Washington) _ The Clinton administration and a
European security group said they had received reports from
refugees fleeing Kosovo and others that an estimated 15,000 to
20,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were put on a forced march in
central Kosovo by Serbian forces. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-YUGOSLAVIA (Belgrade) _ Whispers about a face-saving
Serbian loss to the world's most powerful military alliance began
here long before NATO bombs started to fall. Forfeit of control of
Kosovo through peaceful negotiation would be humiliating. But a
hard military loss of Kosovo, after a brave struggle against an
overwhelming Western foe, could be just the ticket Milosevic needs
to survive with his Serbian manhood and his rule intact. By Blaine
Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-COUNCIL (United Nations) _ In a resounding victory for
the U.S. and its NATO alliance, the Security Council overwhelmingly
rejected Friday a Russian-sponsored resolution demanding an
immediate end to NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia. The vote on
the 15-member Security Council was 12 against the resolution and
three in favor. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REPUBS (Washington) _ Republican presidential contenders
are deeply divided over whether the U.S. should play any role in
Serbia, and most accused President Clinton of a misguided foreign
policy that led to this country's entanglement there. By Richard L.
Berke.

   EUROPEAN-UNION (Berlin) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder
guided the European Union early Friday to a landmark agreement to
hold down its spending enough to enable three Central European
countries to join. The union also advocated Palestinian statehood
within the next year in more forthright terms than it had
previously used or than the United States has ever backed,
provoking a furious reaction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of Israel. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-TUNNEL-FIRE (Paris) _ French and Italian officials said
Friday that at least 35 people had died in a fire that erupted
Wednesday deep inside the Mont Blanc tunnel in the Alps. The blaze,
which began in a heavy truck and quickly engulfed some 30 other
vehicles, was finally brought under control Friday. By Alan Riding.

Los Alamos for several months in 1997, was located by the the FBI
on Thursday at Pennsylvania State University. By James Risen.

KNICKS SET SUNS, 94-87 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The New York Knicks' desperation to win overwhelmed
the panic they were feeling in the fourth quarter Friday night when
they nearly let another lead slip from their hands. Instead of
giving into the mental mistakes and carelessness, the Knicks found
the resolve to put the Suns away, 94-87, at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Their relief was visible when the clock expired and their
three-game losing streak came to an end. The Knicks (16-13) were
led by Allan Houston's 29 points and Latrell Sprewell's 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a 9-point lead to begin the fourth quarter. They
had a reason to worry. They had blown a 9-point lead in the fourth
against Sacramento on Wednesday. With history repeating itself, the
Knicks watched as the Suns turned the Knicks' silly fouls,
turnovers and bad shot selection into a 16-6 run to take the lead,
78-77, on two free throws by Danny Manning with 5 minutes 55
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could have panicked. But Charlie Ward grabbed a loose
ball and then forced a turnover by Jason Kidd, leading to two
scores that allowed the Knicks to retake the lead, 81-78, with 4:46
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing then came up with an impact play. On a missed
jumper by Ward, he grabbed the rebound and layed it back in with
3:20 left to give the Knicks a 5-point advantage. That lead was
threatened after Luc Longley sneaked in for a putback to pull the
Suns to within 85-82. The Suns had a chance to tie it after Houston
turned the ball over and helped set up George McCloud for an open
3-point attempt. He missed, and the Knicks still had the lead.
After a flurry of misses by the Suns, Sprewell came up with a
defensive rebound and was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   He calmly hit two free throws with 51.2 seconds left in the game
to give the Knicks a 87-82 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks avoided their first four-game losing streak in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going through a tough streak, the pressure
heightens to win,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the game.
``So, I think they feel the pressure a little bit. And that's good,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have been stuck in a funk most of the season.
Whenthey have built leads, they have not had the killer's instinct
to put a team away.
</P>
<P>
   With each mental collapse, the Knicks' confidence has grown more
threadbare. Although the season is just past its halfway point, the
Knicks needed to find a way to dismiss the Suns just to let them
know that they could pull off such a feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of team at this point would give in mentally and get
down,'' Houston said. ``We can't do that. Mentally, this is a game
we need to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston needed an electric performance as much as anyone.
Wednesday night, after a sleepy effort against the Kings for three
quarters, he was benched by Van Gundy for the fourth quarter.
Houston looked on as the Knicks folded before him, helpless to do
anything about it. Houston didn't blame Van Gundy. He blamed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Houston uncorked a load of energy in the third quarter.
Together, with an intense defense, the Knicks rode his hot streak
to a 69-56 lead with 3:08 left in the third quarter. At that
moment, a sizzling Houston had an attention-getting 29 points, 13
of them in the third quarter. Entering the fourth, the Knicks led
by 71-62.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks seemed on top of their game. But they had to be wary
of the kind of lapses that cropped up in the second quarter. After
another mental meltdown, the Knicks' 9-point second-quarter lead
was turned into a 48-47 Suns' lead at the half. &QL;

EWING grabbed his fourth rebound of the game. And with that, Ewing
became the 12th player in league history to reach 20,000 points and
10,000 rebounds. Leading the list of the double-double club is
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR (33,387 points, 17,440 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   _ Ewing was not amused when SHAQUILLE O'NEAL's name was
mentioned this morning after the shoot-around. In an interview with
Sports Illustrated, O'Neal blasted Ewing's leadership as president
of the players' union during the National Basketball Association's
lockout. O'Neal, who can opt out of his deal to be a free agent
this summer, could have demanded $20-million a year or more under
the old labor agreement. Now, he would be limited to $14 million
under the current deal. ``Tell him I'll see him on Sunday,'' Ewing
said. The Knicks play the Los Angeles Lakers at the Forum on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Suns were playing their third game in three nights. The
Suns were also without 3-point shooter REX CHAPMAN. He was
suspended for the game and fined $5,000 after pointing at and
making contact with an official after he was called for a blocking
foul against Portland on Thursday night.  &QL;

RODMAN REPLACES KNIGHT AS STARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A week ago, Dennis Rodman was missing in
action, drawing fines for an unexcused sojourn to Las Vegas. By
Friday night, he'd earned a job promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Only in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis made the expected move Friday _ replacing
Travis Knight with Rodman in the starting lineup _ in an effort to
reverse the Los Angeles Lakers' recent trend of lifeless first
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in no way blaming our slow starts solely on Travis,''
Rambis said. ``That had absolutely nothing to do with it. I'm just
looking to tweak (the lineup) with a better alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   So what Rodman's seven rebounding titles couldn't do, the
Lakers' anemic starts did instead _ got him his first start since
joining the team six weeks ago. The Lakers had been outscored in
the first quarter in three straight games and four of the past five
entering Friday's game against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if that corrects itself,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, the Lakers' starter in all but three of their first 29
games, has consistently gotten in early foul trouble, limiting his
minutes and effectiveness, and was playing about half as much as
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been up and down but he hasn't been getting consistent
playing time either,'' Rambis said. ``I've messed with him a little
bit, but him getting in foul trouble, I've gotta take him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was disappointed but said he understood the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right. (Rambis) is a good coach and I think everybody
on this team has faith in Kurt that he wants the team to win.
That's our common goal. And the thing that helps the team the most,
that's what we need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to do whatever Kurt thinks is best.... I'm still
gonna work hard, still gonna play hard, see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Where it went was further down the depth chart, to No. 3 behind
Rodman and now Robert Horry. Rambis liked the energy Rodman brought
off the bench, but with Rodman in the starting lineup, Rambis
decided to replace that spark with Horry, last year's starter at
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can continue that (spark) with (Horry's) activity and his
smart play,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has considered other changes in the rotation as well, but
is making one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   More change: J.R. Reid has apparently cemented his position as
the No. 2 center behind Shaquille O'Neal, pushing Sean Rooks to No.
3 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy about it,'' said Reid, who was fighting for
time at power forward. ``All I want is a chance to contribute....
It makes no difference what position I play. I've played it all _
small forward, power forward and center, so it's all the same to
me.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Scoonie Penn walked out on the court for
practice Friday afternoon and looked up at 27,662 fans who showed
up for a midday workout session. Finally it all sunk in: this
really was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt ever since we beat St. John's last week and we've been
in the Final Four, I mean, I felt like it really hasn't hit me that
much,'' said Penn, the Ohio State guard. ``But I know when I walked
out there for the first time today and heard the crowd yell, just
seeing everybody's faces lit up, it made me feel like we are at the
Final Four. It's just a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, the normally low-key Jim O'Brien, was equally
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the Final Four was there when we beat St.
John's,'' O'Brien said. ``When you cut down nets, that was the
thing that got everybody's attention. That this is a championship
of sorts is fine. But when you finally get here and you go out for
the final practice and you see the number of people and you see the
environment, it's at that point that it really sinks in.''
</P>
<P>
   This is big-time college basketball at its best. For all the
excesses and contradictions, treading over youthful exuberance with
rules and enforcement, these last two weeks make the season worth
the wait.
</P>
<P>
   A player like Penn, who started off at Boston College, was
rookie of the year; two years later, sobered by the business of
basketball, he left and followed O'Brien to Ohio State. He spent
last season in mourning as Ohio State went 8-22. Now this.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four teams here, only one, Duke, has fresh memories of
this feeling. Ohio State has not been to a Final Four since 1968.
Connecticut has never been; watching Jim Calhoun make his
excruciating climbs up and slides back down have become a
post-season ritual. Not this year. Calhoun sat with his team Friday
and spoke about Saturday's battle with Ohio State and his old Big
East rival, O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has beaten O'Brien's teams 18 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jimmy had good teams we had very good teams,'' Calhoun
explained. ``When Jimmy had the Eisley-Edmund team, they were
terrific; we had Marshall, Ray Allen, Travis Knight, guys who are
now making a living in the N.B.A. We had a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   For O'Brien, Saturday night's meeting with his former Big East
rival goes beyond X's and 0's; the game is one more bizarre twist
in a dream season and a career year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many coincidences and ironies,'' O'Brien said.
``I grew up in New York, we beat St. John's; I've known Mike Jarvis
forever. My first job was at UConn; playing against Jim, knowing
him from Northeastern, then all the games through the years, B.C.
and Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which plays the second semifinal game tonight
against Duke, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its first
national championship, with the team led by Magic Johnson. Johnson,
whose duels with Indiana State's Larry Bird set the stage for a
career-long rivalry in the pros, has been a presence throughout
this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as excited to be here as I think a guy could ever be,''
Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo said. ``Everybody told me how good it
gets, but words can't describe the excitement myself or the team or
the school have had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' reward for climbing a steep hill is a matchup with
No. 1 Duke, the prohibitive favorite to win the tournament and one
of the most consistently outstanding programs in college basketball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Its coach, Mike Krzyzewski, is a counterpoint to the newness and
exuberance that surround this tournament. Krzyzewski's teams have
reached the Final Four seven times, played for the title five times
and won it twice. At age 52, Krzyzewski is now the dean, the
terror, possibly the latter-day John Wooden, of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Some say this year's Duke team is invincible. Krzyzewski winces
at the suggestion. When Duke won its first national championship,
in 1991, the Blue Devils defeated a supposedly invincible
Nevada-Las Vegas team in the national semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't feel like we're invincible,'' Krzyzewski
said. ``I don't think any of our players or coaching staff have
ever portrayed that mood, that opinion. I think we can lose to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Michigan State beat Duke? Sure. A victory will require more
than a miracle; it's going to take Magic. But that's what this
tournament is about.

DUKE AND PURDUE ADVANCE TO TITLE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to incorporate results of Purdue-Louisiana Tech game.)  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Duke, a bit player in women's college
basketball until recent seasons, continued its captivating run
through the NCAA tournament Friday night, advancing to the
championship game with a thorough 81-69 defeat of Georgia at the
San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Blue Devils will face No. 1-ranked Purdue, a 77-63
winner over Louisiana Tech in Friday night's second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weekend of a tournament traditionally dominated by
a few powerhouse programs, underdog Duke has stolen the spotlight
with a tough-talking coach and a savvy, scrappy, senior-dominated
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not surprised by this,'' Duke coach Gail Goestenkors
said after the victory, which allowed her team to hold serve in its
figurative Final Four match with the Duke men's team. ``We expect
to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that her team was considered the least talented of the
four teams in the women's Final Four, Goestenkors smiled. ``You
don't have to be athletic to be a great player,'' she said. ``We
have smart, poised players who know how to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   To dismantle Georgia (27-7), Duke used the formula that was so
effective in its stunning upset of three-time defending national
champion Tennessee in the East Regional final Monday. There was
dependable inside play by 6-foot-6 center Michele VanGorp, who had
20 points and nine rebounds, and the lively play of three nimble
guards, Georgia Schweitzer, Peppi Browne and Nicole Erickson, who
led all scorers with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   And Duke (29-6) won with an infectious enthusiasm and a weaving,
pass-happy, team-oriented offense that involved every player on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spread you out and kill you slowly,'' said Georgia coach
Andy Landers, who has become something of a Final Four fixture but
still seeks his first national championship. ``You find yourself
yo-yoing defensively from a talented inside post player and a
talented bunch of perimeter shooters. You choose your poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's exit means the championship game will be played
without a team from the Southeastern Conference for the first time
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten will be represented by Purdue (33-1). The
Boilermakers, who have won 30 consecutive games and have not lost
since Nov. 22, were led by guard Ukari Figgs, whose 18 first-half
points gave them an early advantage that they never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who teams with Stephanie White-McCarty in what is
considered the best backcourt in women's college basketball,
finished with a game-high 24 points. It was her 3-point shooting in
the first half _ she made three of her first four _ that staked
Purdue to a 40-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech (30-3) mounted a comeback that cut Purdue's lead
to 58-55 midway through the second half, but led by Figgs, Purdue
scored 12 unanswered points. Louisiana Tech, which was hoping to
avenge a lopsided loss in last year's title game against Tennessee,
never seriously threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   Now Purdue will have to face Duke, which Friday night presented
its offensive attack exactly as planned. The Blue Devils also
effectively slowed Georgia's star twin guards, Kelly and Coco
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller came into the game averaging 27.5 points per game
in the tournament but sank just five of 13 shots against Duke to
score 13 points. Her sister led Georgia with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to focus on the twins,'' Erickson said. ``We
saw on film that they liked to go to their left and then shoot, so
we tried to force them to their right. And we bumped them around a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Millers, who are 5-10, were supposed to be
the physical presence that thwarted and wore down the 5-6 Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen that way. Erickson came out shooting, matching
a Coco Miller 3-pointer with one of her own for Duke's first
points. She scored 8 first-half points, helping Duke to an early
10-point lead that Georgia cut to 40-34 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the half, VanGorp struggled to get shots because of
a smothering Georgia double team. But as Erickson and Schweitzer
(13 points) bombed from outside and Browne sliced through the
Georgia defense with piercing drives to the basket, the Lady
Bulldogs' defense was forced to stray from VanGorp.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp responded with 8 of Duke's final 12 first-half points.
At the start of the second half, she hit a 3-pointer from the
corner and another pull-up jumper, leading Duke to a 13-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's pressure defense, led by the Millers, rattled Duke
briefly, cutting the Duke lead to 6 points at the midpoint of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Coco and Kelly Miller each hit baskets, taking advantage of the
absence of VanGorp, who sat out three minutes at this juncture with
three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller's two free throws cut Duke's lead to 60-54, but the
Blue Devils' Hilary Howard sank two free throws to rebuild an
8-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams seemed fatigued as the game _ played at a frantic
pace from the opening tip _ wound into its final eight minutes. And
with that fatigue, contact between the players was more common,
something that played to Georgia's disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Duke shoots 77 percent from the foul line as a team, with a
handful of its players making more than 80 percent of their foul
shots this season. Friday night, Duke made 16 of 21 free throws,
including eight of 11 in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those free throws were by Schweitzer as Duke regained its
double-figure lead, 64-54.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson followed with a driving layup, VanGorp then blocked a
shot attempt by Tawana McDonald, and Erickson hit a fallaway jumper
as the shot clock was expiring to give Duke a 15-point lead, 70-55.
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by McDonald, Erickson delivered another
staggering blow, hitting a 3-point shot from the corner. If that
didn't wound Georgia's morale, then a 3-pointer by Lauren Rice with
3:02 to go that gave Duke a 76-57 lead must have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would disagree with anyone who says that Duke isn't
talented,'' Landers said. ``They're damned good players and so far
in this tournament there isn't much they haven't been able to do
and accomplish.''

PACERS BEAT NETS, 100-91 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Nets executed fairly well, beat a
larger opponent on the backboards, played with fire and showed some
heart Friday night. But their failure to correct a problem that has
dogged them this season was too much to overcome against the
polished Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Another woeful shooting display, 35.7 percent, nullified the
good the Nets did and enabled Indiana to leave the Continental
Arena with a hard-fought 100-91 victory. The loss was the Nets'
third in three games against the Pacers this season, and like the
others, it was competitive and at times dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Nets exited their home court with another
crushing defeat, their 22nd in 27 games, and Indiana, the Central
Division leader, improved to 19-8. More unsettling than the loss
was an injury to Keith Van Horn, who is questionable for Saturday's
game against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 forward, who scored 22 points and blocked a
career-high six shots, sprained his right ankle one minute into the
third quarter while stepping on Dale Davis' foot. After having the
ankle retaped, Van Horn returned to play 11 minutes before removing
himself because of the pain. Van Horn, who missed the first 17
games of last season with a severe sprain of the same ankle, said
he would have X-rays taken Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same tendon I injured last year, but I didn't feel it
pop like last year,'' said Van Horn, who scored only 4 points after
the injury. ``Once I started making my moves to the basket and got
in the flow of the game, it started giving out on me. That's when I
pulled myself out. I had no explosiveness and I couldn't put any
pressure on it, so I wasn't being of any help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets trailed, 86-74, when Van Horn left for good with 7
minutes 1 second remaining. While the Nets' porous defense was a
problem _ Indiana scored 52 points in the paint and shot 46.5
percent _ the Nets' largest obstacle was their inability to make
layups, short shots in the lane and outside jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   While no Nets starter made half of his shots, the main culprits
in the sad shooting display were Chris Carr, who started in place
of Kendall Gill, and Kerry Kittles. After scoring 8 points to help
the Nets build a 24-23 lead, Carr went frigid, missing his last 10
shots in an excruciating 4-for-18 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who was placed in the starting five when Gill (4 points,
20 minutes) suggested the move to coach Don Casey, was distraught.
``I feel like I was a big part of the reason why we lost,'' Carr
said. ``I've got to concentrate more and focus on making those
shots because that makes Stephon and Keith's job easier. When they
pass me the ball, they depend on me making the shots and I wasn't
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittles was nearly as inaccurate. He scored 15 points, but
missed 10 of 15 shots, including an open 15-footer after Stephon
Marbury (24 points, 8 assists) pulled the Nets within 94-89 by
hitting the last of his four second-half 3-pointers with 1:34 left.
The Pacers capitalized with a thunderous dunk by Antonio Davis that
turned into a 3-point play when Marbury fouled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said Kittles, who had 10 rebounds to
help the Nets to a 53-45 rebounding advantage. ``I can't tell you
how many open looks I had tonight where I was wide open, looking at
the ball, looking at the crowd and just sitting there waiting. But
the shots aren't going in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which was led by Rik Smits' 20 points and Reggie
Miller's 16, got a strong performance out of Al Harrington, the
rookie who last summer became the latest high school player to
enter the National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, who played sparingly through the first 24 games,
scored 6 of his season-high 8 points in the fourth period to help
Indiana push a 74-70 lead to 86-74 with 7:01 remaining. The 6-9
graduate of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J., played a
season-high 17 minutes and had five rebounds as 30 of his family
members and friends watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great to be out there,'' said Harrington, whose 8
points matched his season total. ``I've been waiting for this for a
long time. Everything just seemed to fall into place tonight.''

   That represents a tenfold increase from just 10 years ago, the

   ``When I invest in a company,'' he said, speaking in bursts as
he downed Bedouin coffee on the back lawn of his new $200 million
palace in Riyadh, ``I get sentimentally attached.''
</P>
<P>
   However, another magazine, The Economist, recently raised
questions about both the origins of Walid's wealth and the extent
of his investing prowess. The prince said the suggestions of
shadiness had been hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that people would like to say that this Saudi prince is
like all the others,'' he said bitterly _ an apparent reference to
the royal corruption that business people and diplomats say is
endemic in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a series of interviews, Walid acknowledged that one
early source of his investment capital was ``hundreds of millions
of dollars'' in ``commissions'' paid by foreign and Saudi
businesses. Even last year, he acknowledged, such commissions
accounted for $40 million of his $500 million in income.
</P>
<P>
   The commissions are a form of commercial lubricant common in the
Middle East, as elsewhere. A company that wants to win contracts in
Saudi Arabia often hires a prince or other prominent Saudi as an
agent. While executives complain that they often see very little
work in return, they still pay _ out of the perception that it is
difficult, if not impossible, to win lucrative contracts in Saudi
Arabia without a high-level connection.
</P>
<P>
   Walid said the money paid to him, at least, had always been
hard-earned. ``This had nothing to do with influence,'' he said. In
return for what was usually a 30 percent cut on a contract, he
explained, his firm provided services that included ``handling all
government relations, from A to Z.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, with a steep falloff in the construction sector, a
major source of business in Saudi Arabia, his commissions have been
``nothing huge, like before,'' the prince said.
</P>
<P>
   In four recent conversations _ beginning at his Riyadh office,
continuing a week later at his palace in the capital after a
late-afternoon lunch, and carrying over into long-distance talks as
he cruised the Caribbean in his yacht _ the prince offered one
further revelation about his finances:
</P>
<P>
   For all his professions of faith in buy-and-hold investing, the
largest single source of his income is speculative, in-and-out
trading in real estate and stocks. Fully a quarter of his income
last year was from such trading, he said, through a $2.1 billion
account used most often to buy and sell stocks and real estate in
Saudi Arabia. About $200 million to $300 million in the account is
devoted to short-term trading in American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any contradiction,'' Walid said. ``Frankly
speaking, I'm all over the place _ very strong in trading and very
strong in investment. But my long-term investment portfolio is
untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly stung by The Economist's rare challenge to his
reputation, the prince volunteered a detailed accounting of his
wealth. His current holdings, he said, include about $10.2 billion
in long-term investments abroad, $700 million in listed Saudi
stocks, $2.1 billion in other assets in the Middle East and Africa
and $1.2 billion in cash that has piled up because he is
``uncomfortable'' with the current stock market, regarding it as
``definitely overvalued.'' (The speculative fund, he said, is made
up of portions of the latter three categories.)
</P>
<P>
   His start as an investor was buying and selling Saudi real
estate, not buying and holding stocks. In 1979, when he was 24, the
prince said, he mortgaged a house given to him by his father to
come up with $400,000 in capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he said, real estate investing accounted for 65
percent of his income, with an additional 10 percent to 15 percent
coming from commissions. By 1989, his net worth had grown to $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not until late 1990 that the prince turned to
stock investing outside Saudi Arabia, with a dramatic bailout of
Citicorp, some $9.2 billion of his wealth today is in publicly
traded stocks. Indeed, it is his success in finding undervalued
public companies, and his gutsiness in betting on them with vast
amounts of cash, that have earned the prince a reputation as the
Warren E. Buffett of Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his long-term investments, in companies like Netscape
Communications and Apple Computer, have indeed produced
breathtaking gains. An analysis by his advisers at Citibank of his
holdings in publicly traded companies since 1991 found an average
annual internal rate of return, a complex figure that accounts for
cash flows as well as appreciation, of 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw in other investments, and that figure rises by another
eight percentage points,'' Walid said in a letter to The Economist.
(The prince said he had been told &UR;  &LR; recently, for example, that his
initial investment of $80 million in Canary Wharf, the London real
estate project that has lately turned from a debacle into a
triumph, would soon be returned to him in cash, still leaving him
with a roughly $4.3 billion stake.)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, stripping away his single best investment, Citicorp, in
which the prince put nearly half his money in 1990 and 1991, the
returns on his stock portfolio have been much less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, he has invested some $1.9 billion in other publicly
traded stocks _ including big gainers like the News Corporation but
also big losers like Euro Disney. At the close of trading on
Thursday, those stocks were valued at $2.9 billion, including
Canary Wharf Group, which made its initial public offering that
day. The gain translates to an average annual return of 7.3
percent, far below that of the major market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prince says any calculation that excludes his Citi holdings
is unfair, because he has made a conscious decision to keep the
financial services company _ called Citigroup since Citicorp merged
last year with the Travelers Group _ as more than 65 percent of his
stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, thanks to Citigroup and other good investments,
the overall surge in the prince's fortune has been phenomenal, and
he bridled at The Economist's characterization of his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, my performance might not be quite as good as Warren
Buffett's, as you note _ nobody's perfect,'' he wrote in his letter
to the magazine, which was published in The Economist's March 20
issue. ``You may find this `disappointing,' but I can assure you
that quite a few of your readers would be more than content with
consistent returns like this.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shares in Buffett's investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway,
have gained an average of 29.4 percent annually since 1992, a
figure not readily comparable to the internal rate of return that
the prince's bankers provided to Money &AMP; Business at his request.)
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much his wealth might have been built on what
critics regard as feudal tributes, the prince is seen by most
Saudis as an exception in a country whose royal family is sometimes
accused of greed and sloth. And within the royal family, he is
regarded as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Prince Talal bin Abdel Aziz, a son of Saudi Arabia's
founder, King Abdel Aziz ibn Saud, was a leader in the early 1960s
of a group known as the Liberal Princes, who openly differed with
King Faisal, then the country's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Walid spent part of his childhood in Lebanon with his maternal
grandfather, Riad al-Solh, modern Lebanon's first prime minister.
Now, like every other grandson of King Saud _ they number in the
several hundreds _ the prince receives a monthly royal stipend of
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The prince is hard-working, even driven. In accordance with
Muslim teachings, he does not drink, smoke or gamble. He also does
not invest in tobacco or alcohol stocks; he has extensive holdings
in hotels but insists that the portion of his income generated from
drinking, smoking or gambling in those establishments be placed in
a separate fund and contributed to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Walid said he felt no similar qualms about profiting from his
investments in banks, which earn money by charging interest, a
practice prohibited under some interpretations of Islamic law. ``I
do not believe that banking and charging interest is against
religion,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His schedule, which he said was unyielding, lists a precise time
for everything: wake-up at 10 a.m., exercise 15 minutes later,
office hours from 11 a.m. to 4 P.M, a family lunch and rest from 4
to 7 p.m. He returns to work from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., exercises
again, has dinner and observes dawn prayers before retiring at 5.
</P>
<P>
   The late hours let him keep track of the American stock market,
with Wall Street closing at midnight Saudi time, and to follow
nocturnal habits of work that are common in Saudi Arabia, where
businesses and government offices close in the afternoon heat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a man who counsels patience in investing, Walid
displays little in his daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I despise sleeping, really,'' he said, sitting cross-legged on
a carpet in his football field-sized back yard, whose manicured
lawn, free-form pool, Tiki torches and restaurant-style dining area
suggest a Four Seasons resort. ``I think it's a period where your
brain goes stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, the prince is direct but also restless; even in
mid-conversation, his eyes flick to one of the oversized television
sets always placed nearby, tuned to the Cable News Network, CNBC or
the Arabic Television Network, which he partly owns.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, around an outdoor table set for 20 people, the prince
sat alone, with the nearest guest several seats away, and spent
most of the meal on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   For at least eight months, he said, his stock portfolio has
remained unchanged; he has seen no reason to buy shares at inflated
prices and has been disinclined to sell. Indeed, the last time he
sold any of his long-term holdings was in 1993, when he had to
reduce his Citibank holdings by one-third to meet the Federal
Reserve's restriction on the percentage of an American bank that
can be owned by a foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his most frequent calls, he said, are to the man who
handles his stock investments _ an American, Michael R. Jensen of
Citicorp's private banking operation in Geneva. And twice a day,
the prince pores over one-page updates that summarize his holdings
and track an additional 12 stocks that he will not name but that he
has singled out for possible acquisition if their prices fall.
These companies share a few characteristics _ notably the potential
for ample long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out autos as a sector that no longer held much of his
interest, though he retains stakes in Hyundai and Daewoo of South
Korea and Malaysia's troubled Proton..
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the industries should not be too cyclical and not
facing a meltdown,'' the prince said. ``By definition, we invest in
firms that are doing badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince was educated in the United States, at Menlo College
in Atherton, Calif., and at Syracuse University, where he earned a
master's degree in social science. He speaks fluent English and was
an avid soccer and tennis player until a back injury forced him to
turn to swimming. He is single, after two divorces. ``I fall in
love, basically, with my companies,'' he said, ``and because I have
no wife, that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is also very much a traditional Saudi, and at work, he
wears a thobe, the traditional Arab garment, and headdress. He has
insisted that his 22-year-old son be educated in Saudi Arabia,
principally as a shield against what Walid calls the ``great
temptations'' in America ``to do things that are against
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wanted his son to have an American education and has
arranged for the University of New Haven in Connecticut to send
professors to Riyadh to teach courses from its regular curriculum
to the young man and five of his friends; he intends to do the same
for his daughter, who is 18.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of his charity; he says that in an average year he
gives $100 million in cash gifts to the poor, to mosques and to
Saudi development programs that buy generators and build bridges
for remote villages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a religious duty,'' he said. ``No. 2, it is my duty as a
rich man. And No. 3, it is my duty as a member of the royal
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his guests every day at lunch, a meal prepared by Lebanese
chefs and usually including eight main courses, are five
impoverished and usually elderly women selected each day from among
those to whom he has given money in answer to personal appeals.
Veiled, the women sit at a separate table and are later visited by
the prince.
</P>
<P>
   His Riyadh office, headquarters of his Kingdom Holding Co., has
a staff of 30. And on call around the world are outside advisers _
from Citibank, which handles his investments; Arthur Andersen,
which handles accounting; Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, which handles
publicity, and Hogan &AMP; Hartson, his law firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to work smart, not hard,'' he said of his decision
to contract out much of his work. In two separate conversations, he
also pointed out that the first initials of his four advisory firms
spell ``cash.''
</P>
<P>
   His home and possessions shout the same message. The new palace,
with at least five wings, includes an indoor pool in an atrium the
size of a jumbo-jet hangar. Vast areas are set aside for his
children and for the 150 servants who provide around-the-clock
attention. A separate, private sports complex is reached by a
tunnel that runs under a public street.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, who moved in just last month, said the palace sits
on 35,000 square meters of land, or 8.6 acres _ five times the size
of his old palace complex just down the street, which he has set
aside for his son. He also owns a helicopter, three jets (including
a 727 and a 767) and a huge yacht whose previous owners included
Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi financier; Donald Trump, and, briefly,
the Sultan of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's early investment in Citibank _ in 1990 and 1991,
when the bank's future was in doubt _ now accounts for almost half
his wealth. But some critics say the investment also represents his
weakness: that he may not be a good judge of when to sell.
Citigroup is down 15 percent from its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The prince defended himself vigorously against the assertion. He
noted that Citigroup recovered sharply in recent months from last
fall's lows, adding that if he had succumbed to advice to sell Citi
shares as the market plummeted, he would have lost hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously at the right place and the right time, I'm a
seller,'' he said. ``But you have to choose the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was afraid his portfolio might have already peaked
in an overheated market, he demurred. ``I don't think we have
really milked the cow completely,'' he said. ``I believe there is
more potential for these companies to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some of his recent investments in technology and
media companies have produced dizzying returns. In March 1997, he
bought 5 percent of Apple for $115 million; last week, the
investment was worth $211 million. Later that year, he bought 5
percent of Netscape for $145 million. With America Online's
acquisition of Netscape this month, that holding was worth more
than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The prince acknowledged that he has also picked his share of
what have been losers _ ``so far.'' His worst investment? Planet
Hollywood, the theme restaurant chain into which he has sunk an
estimated $100 million since April 1997. Last week, he said, the
investment was worth just $21 million. Other losers, he said,
include his 24 percent stake in Euro Disney and his 3 percent of
Proton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prince said he remained as loyal to his weaker
holdings as to those with better returns _ and as determined, if
not more so, to help expand their businesses. He said he uses only
Motorola phones (he owns 1 percent of the company) and stays only
in Four Seasons and Movenpick hotels.
</P>
<P>
   He may develop as many as 44 Planet Hollywood restaurants in
Europe and the Middle East. He even says he plans to replace the
Mercedeses and Volvos in his personal fleet with cars made by
Hyundai and Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest impression left by Walid is of his fierce pride in
his decisions. One recent day, he thumbed through printouts from
The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The International
Herald Tribune, all downloaded from the Internet long before the
papers reached Saudi newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   A Journal article about Buffett's latest letter to shareholders
of Berkshire Hathaway caught the prince's eye. Buffett, the article
said, acknowledged to investors that they would have been better
off last year if he had spent his afternoons at the movies, instead
of buying and selling parts of his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The author speculated that Buffett was thinking, among other
things, about his sale of much of his stake in Travelers _ and
hence in its successor, Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Walid passed the clipping to a visitor. ``Buy and hold,'' he
said.

TV SPORTS: TVKO WILL MAKE A DEAL FOR HOLYFIELD-LEWIS, EVENTUALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, Time Warner will make a deal to carry Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis II on TVKO. That's inevitable. Through TVKO
and HBO, Time Warner has too much tied up in boxing to use the
stench of the March 13 draw as an excuse to exit the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   TVKO insists that it's too soon to execute a television deal,
although promoter Don King has joined the fighters in pugilistic
matrimony for $15 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not running full speed to close a deal,'' said Lou
DiBella, the senior vice president of HBO Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Before TVKO makes a deal, DiBella said, several elements need to
change.
</P>
<P>
   The first is for the television network to cut a better deal.
Although the first fight netted 1.2 million pay-per-view purchases
at $50 each, DiBella said the success ``is not reflected on our
books. We made a deal with a lot of risk and virtually no upside.''
</P>
<P>
   There was probably a smidgen of profit for poor old Time Warner,
but apparently not enough after King's profit taking began once the
pay-per-view buys reached 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever role King plays may change. To promote the disputed
first bout, King bought out the interests of Panos Eliades, Lewis'
promoter. Eliades did not want the risk. King did. With Lewis
enraged with King, the WB C heavyweight champion may insist on a
larger role for Eliades.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, DiBella said, TVKO would prefer a deal that
guarantees that the judges are chosen by the local athletic
commission, in New York, Wales or Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial choice of the IBF judge, Eugenia Williams _
who scored the fight, 115-113, for Holyfield, the IBF champion _
exposed further the conflicts inherent in sanctioning bodies
choosing a fight's judges, and the questionable criteria exercised
in selecting someone with big-time experience as limited as
Williams'.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's athletic commission chooses judges _ New York's does
not _ but only from a pool submitted by the alphabet soup of
sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience for a rematch should be completely comfortable
that it will be administered in a fair process,'' DiBella said.
``Just imagine, the night before a game, Jerry Jones taking the
referees to Lutece,'' he added, referring to the Dallas Cowboys'
owner and a top New York restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Also, DiBella said, promoters should not pay judges, and limits
should be placed on what is paid for judges' travel, meals and
entertainment. Not that the three Holyfield-Lewis judges were
overindulged at the Hotel Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella's points are all logical. But the pace of reform rarely
keeps pace with the speed of outrage. Last week's hearing by New
York state Sen. Roy M. Goodman was a farce, as Goodman toadied up
to King and failed to ask necessary and obvious follow-up
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for reform may emerge from the criminal inquiry of
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, and
legislation by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   After the Williams affair, boxing fans (and pay-per-view buyers)
may feel assured that the rematch is legitimate only if King is
exiled to referee fights in South Korea; judges are required to
publicly disclose their federal income tax returns, bank accounts
and telephone records; and the leaders of the IBF, WBC, et al.,
resign, citing their need for group therapy to alleviate the stress
accumulated through years of kowtowing to promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Another `SportsCenter'
</P>
<P>
   Starting April 6, ESPN will add a live ``SportsCenter'' at 1
a.m. Eastern time, but one that is targeted to West Coast viewers
watching at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumers crave it, the affiliates crave it and the
affiliates want it,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice
president. ``We've been looking to do this for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Glover's rationale is any admission that ESPN is
reacting to competition from the Fox Sports Net, which has spent
lavishly to build a news presence. The newest ``SportsCenter'' will
go head to head out west with Fox's 10 p.m. program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm seeing the wrong numbers, but I'm not sure about
Fox's growth,'' said Glover, whose former boss, Steve Bornstein,
recently referred to the Fox sports empire as a mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they add a new `SportsCenter' now?'' asked Vince
Wladika, a Fox spokesman. ``It's obvious this is a reactionary
move. Everyone knows why they're doing it.'' &QL;

LUKE AIR FORCE BASE F-16S ARE GROUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 and DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mystified Air Force officials have shut down flights
indefinitely at Luke Air Force Base after Friday's crash of another
F-16 fighter jet near Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Five Fighting Falcons have crashed on training missions from
Luke in the past six months. Investigators say engine failure
caused four of those accidents, but none of the malfunctions had
anything in common.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Friday's crash west of Phoenix, Sen. John McCain
sent a letter to the Air Force secretary expressing ``deep
concern'' and questioning whether a problem with the F-16's engine
might be the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, the F-16 engine, or some particular component of
the engine, is found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, I would
be very interested in your assessment of an immediate fix,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's accident happened near 339th Avenue just a few miles
from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. Smoking wreckage
from the $20 million jet was strewn across the desert just north of
Interstate 10, narrowly missing drivers along the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was carrying dummy bombs, not live munition. The pilot,
Capt. Michael G. Rider, 27, ejected safely. The native Texan had 47
hours of experience flying the F-16 before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. John Barry, the commander at Luke, is so frustrated
by the series of crashes that, for the first time, he has called
for all jets to be grounded indefinitely, saying he will not allow
any of Luke's 211 jets back in the air, ``until I am convinced it
is safe to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never put a pilot in a cockpit that is unsafe for
flying,'' Barry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It might be a blessing we are discovering these
problems within the safety and security of the U.S. borders, rather
than in the skies over Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The F-16s, already being used to patrol two no fly zones over
Iraq, are now being deployed in the Kosovo airstrikes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barry and McCain are not alone, nor are they the first, in
worrying about the jet engines. More than two years ago, the
``Defense Daily,'' a trade publication, quoted top Air Force
officials who were complaining of constant, costly engine problems
with thousands of F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a variety of problems _ some with the fans, some with
the compressors, some with the turbines and some with the
bearings,'' said Gen. Richard Hawley, then-head of Air Combat
Command.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hawley blamed a shortage of maintenance funds and
vowed to reverse the trend with a tough inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   But a month ago, ``Defense Daily'' published another story
blaming the spate of crashes on engine problems. In that report,
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mike Ryan said, ``We have some
(pilot) problems, but for the most part, it's engines.''
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 aircraft are manufactured by Lockheed Martin but the
engines and some components are made by Pratt &AMP; Whitney and General
Electric. Officials of the engine manufactures could not be reached
for comment, and Lockheed officials are baffled as well.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Todd Vician, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, said
an additional $225 million has been allocated in the upcoming
budget to pay for spare parts for engines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Air Force told Congress that it needed an
additional $257 million to buy spare engines.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last week, Ryan cited the number of
crashes at Luke as proof that funding needs to be beefed up. He
said the base has lost four jets because of engine problems _ no
two of them from the same cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, bases nationwide increased inspections but
continued flying with old parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts and manufacturers say the accidents stem
from larger, more complicated troubles within the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is for sure: There's big problems in the F-16
community,'' said Alan Diehl, formerly a senior civilian crash
investigator for the Air Force. ``I can't explain it. I don't think
there's any single cause. I think it's a manifestation of what
happens with shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Diehl said the crashes stem from a dangerous mixture _ too much
work and too little funding. He said Air Force pilots and
maintenance crews have been overtaxed just when many of the top
personnel are leaving the service for civilian jobs, and when the
number of sorties has escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the military has gone through a wave of
cutbacks, including the purchase of spare parts. As a result, some
F-16s are being cannibalized to keep others aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Barry confirmed the cannibalization rate (taking parts from one
jet and putting them in another) has increased nearly 80 percent in
the Air Force since 1996. At Luke, at least one jet in each of the
eight squadrons is used for spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's given 'em an awful lot of tasks,'' Diehl said.
``And Congress hasn't given 'em a lot of money. Maintenance has
become shoddy on the aircraft because of the high operational
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the F-16 woes have gained political importance.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle _ who, like McCain, is
considered a potential candidate for the presidency _ blamed the
Clinton administration for jeopardizing pilots and aircraft with
military budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply don't have the money for (engine parts),'' Quayle
told reporters during a news conference in Phoenix earlier this
year. ``The military never has been a priority with this
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Air Force Lt. Col John Nance, an aviation safety
analyst, said, ``We're asking almost super-human feats of the guys
we do have, the gals we do have. They're getting deployed all the
time, they're tired, they're proficiency is waning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance and Diehl question whether the Air Force will ever be able
to get to the bottom of the crashes. Both have criticized the
service for past cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Air Force investigates itself,'' Nance said. ``It's
wink, wink, . . . we don't talk about this problem or that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,900 F-16s have been sold to 19 nations. Of those, 2,200
are owned by the U.S. Air Force, said Michael Nipper,
communications manager at Lockheed Martin which manufactures the
F-16 aircraft, but not the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress for funds in the 2000 defense budget
for an additional 10 F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, which ended in September, the Air Force recorded
just 24 ``Class A'' incidents _ those in which a plane or pilot was
lost or more than $1 million of damage was done to a jet _ making
it the second-safest year in Air Force history. But more than half
the incidents involved F-16 fighter jets _ there were 14 F-16
crashes with six fatalities. Meanwhile, F-16 jets accounted for
less than 6 percent of the flying hours during that time. Luke had
no accidents during that time.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, the Air Force has recorded another 18
mishaps. Those involving Luke pilots account for nearly one-third
of that total.
</P>
<P>
   Nipper said the sudden surge of accidents is inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever seen this big a rash of
engine-related mishaps in the history of the program,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nipper, pilot error has been responsible for more
than half of all F-16 wrecks in the history of Falcon flying.
</P>
<P>
   Nipper emphasized that Lockheed Martin does not build the
engines. It installs engines which are purchased from Pratt &AMP;
Whitney or General Electric by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned because it's our product,'' Nipper added.
``But there's not much we can do about it.'' &QL;

SUITORS LINE UP FOR TMS' NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway should add a corporate
name within a year at a price of $3 million to $5 million annually,
a top executive for Speedway Motorsports Inc., which owns the
track, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably see this in the next 12 months,'' said H.A.
``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of North Carolina-based SMI. ``You're
looking at three, four, maybe five million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no shortage of interest among companies
wanting to put their name on the racetrack, Wheeler said, the
selling of naming rights demands a slow, careful process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing to do,'' Wheeler said. ``You've got to
have a certain type of company willing to put up a lot of money to
do it, and you don't want to give up the name lightly. This is a
little bit like getting married. Everybody involved's got to be
absolutely sure it's the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true, Wheeler said, because SMI wants a
long-term arrangement with its sponsor _ possibly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do this for only three or four years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   SMI recently sold the first track-naming-rights sponsorship in
NASCAR when its Charlotte Motor Speedway signed a deal with Lowe's,
a chain of home improvement stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said that motorsports is following the lead of football,
baseball, basketball and hockey in affixing names to its
facilities, and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly searching for new forms of revenue,'' Wheeler
said. ``We've got a tremendous investment in these speedways,
particularly this one here. You're always looking to recoup \Rthe
costs\S and you can only sell so many tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   SMI has been lobbying NASCAR for a second Winston Cup race date
at Texas Motor Speedway because it would provide a dramatic boost
in revenues for the track. The company's inability to secure a
second Winston Cup weekend, Wheeler said, makes the selling of
naming rights that much more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we've got only one Winston Cup weekend sort of
accelerates our reason for doing this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said he understands NASCAR's scheduling problem _ too
many tracks seeking too few races _ but, speaking of Texas and
Texas Motor Speedway, he said that a second Winston Cup race only
makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track's too good and this market's too big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While it awaits a second date, SMI is considering alternative
revenue generators at TMS. SMI and other NASCAR track owners will
certainly benefit from a new national television contract that
could boost overall TV revenue from $100 million to about $400
million annually. But the company is looking for other means, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may bring some other types of racing in here during race
week,'' Wheeler said. ``We need to take more advantage of the
\RWinston Cup\S race week we do have.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said one possibility is a Winston West series race, an
increasingly popular circuit that's proved popular in markets such
as Las Vegas.

MAYBE HENDRICK TEAM'S THIRD CAR IS HAUNTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the great three-car NASCAR scheme that is
Hendrick Motorsports, Wally Dallenbach Jr. drives the No. 25
Bermuda Triangle Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so officially it's the No. 25 Budweiser Chevy. But since Ken
Schrader last scored a victory in the bright red car in June 1991,
this has been a place where promising Winston Cup drivers go ...
only to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick teammates Jeff Gordon and Terry Labonte have captured
the past four driver's championships for team founder Rick Hendrick
and his brother, John. Gordon and Labonte have accounted for 49
victories since 1995, the year Gordon scored the first of his three
Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 car, meanwhile, has seen Schrader bow out and Ricky
Craven get the boot after never fulfilling his 1995
rookie-of-the-year potential.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dallenbach, a championship road-racer, who got the job
full time last August after scoring top-10 finishes in three of his
first four starts with crew chief Tony Furr. But Dallenbach's best
start this year has been 14th at Atlanta Motor Speedway. His best
finish is 12th in the season-opening Daytona 500. He enters the
Primestar 500 tomorrow 25th in points, and in danger of falling off
the Cup radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it that way,'' Dallenbach said yesterday
afternoon, ``but it's still the best thing I've ever had. The
Hendrick ride _ even if it was the third team and it wasn't
successful _ was the best opportunity I had \Rlast summer\S. Now if
I can make it work, or we can make it work, we're heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   This team is a direct descendant of the one that once featured
the flamboyant Tim Richmond. Dallenbach said the popular notion
that the current No. 25 car is nothing more than a research and
development program for Gordon's team is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, I don't see it,'' Dallenbach said. ``If it is,
they're doing it behind closed doors and I don't know anything
about it. All the resources are there and it's a matter of
chemistry within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach, who has no poles, no wins and 47 Did Not Finishes in
166 Cup starts, is working under a one-year contract. Robin
Dallenbach, who negotiated Wally's deal with John Hendrick while he
was on a hunting trip in Bolivia, is keeping her husband's resume
updated.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as job security goes, I really don't worry about
that,'' said Wally Dallenbach, 35. ``I go out and drive my butt off
every time I drive this race car. I don't lose any sleep over if
John Hendrick or Rick Hendrick is going to hire me for next year.
If they want to blame the driver for not being competitive, then,
hey, I'm out of the job. I know how the business works.''
QUICK HITS
CHASING ANOTHER BGN DATE
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying for a second NASCAR Busch Grand National date at Texas
Motor Speedway continues. And Eddie Gossage hopes the crowd
anticipated for today's Coca-Cola 300 sends NASCAR a strong
message.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, executive vice president and general manager for TMS,
classified his most recent discussions with NASCAR officials as
nothing more than ``shooting the breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know we'd like to have a second Busch race here,''
Gossage said. ``We're going to have a crowd bigger than most
Winston Cup races for our Busch race. From what we've got sold
\Ryesterday\S and what we sold walk-up last year, we'll probably
have 125,000 to 130,000 people here. It makes a statement, but
NASCAR makes the scheduling decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said a second BGN date as the headline event to another
race weekend remains ``very possible.''
</P>
<P>
   EARNHARDT SPELLS $UCCESS
</P>
<P>
   Seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt is a ``Field and Stream''
kind of guy. So what's he doing inside ``Forbes'' magazine?
</P>
<P>
   Crunching numbers, all the way to the bank. Earnhardt is ranked
fifth on the magazine's annual list of 1999 top-40 athletes,
trailing Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher and Sergei
Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes'' uses the formula of salaries and endorsements to
compile the list, excluding merchandise royalties and other sources
of income. Jordan, the retired Chicago Bulls star, tops the chart
with $69 million. Earnhardt ranks fifth at a mere $24.1 million,
behind two-time Formula One champion Schumacher. But Earnhardt is
still No. 1 among domestic drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked awful hard throughout our career and capitalized
on all the things available,'' said Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3
GM Goodwrench Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hawk, the president of Dale Earnhardt Inc., traces
Earnhardt's rise among sports' big hitters to 1993, when he began
to market ``The Intimidator'' as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's street smarts with a business plan,'' Hawk said. ``When
you perform, you sell. But you've got to have more than
performance. You've got to have some kind of swagger to your walk
or some kind of style to your talk. Something's got to be
different. We think Earnhardt _ and Dale Earnhardt Jr. _ have got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those trailing Earnhardt are Arnold Palmer, Oscar De La
Hoya, Wayne Gretzky, Greg Norman, Andre Agassi and Mark McGwire.
LITTLE E PANS RIVALRY
</P>
<P>
   The main subplot to today's Coca-Cola 300 Busch race is the
highly anticipated matchup between three-time Winston Cup champion
Jeff Gordon and BGN champion Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It will be their second ``mano a mano'' in the BGN series.
Gordon debuted his No. 24 Pepsi Chevrolet with a fourth-place
finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where Earnhardt Jr. ran sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Little E's spin on his instant rivalry with Maximum Jeff?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not beat to death yet,'' said Earnhardt Jr., driver of
the No. 3 ACDelco Chevy. ``But what we're doing here and what we
done last year and the five \RCup\S races we're going to run isn't
quite worthy of putting him in a sentence with us. He's the
champion three times over. He's winning races right and left. There
ain't nobody that can stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are we to be compared to him? You know what it's like?
It's kinda like one of y'all \Rmedia members\S just opening up the
door to the old man's \RDale Earnhardt\S coach and walking in there
and saying, `Hey man! How about an interview?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is not uncomfortable. That, friends, is downright stupid.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty tough. I didn't shave one day. I got in
trouble for not shaving. About Tuesday, I could tie my shoes.''

TOUGH TEXAN READY TO SHOULDER LOAD FOR A SUNDAY DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The man has a broken shoulder, and that
would be enough to knock most of us driving stiffs out of the car
pool line, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bobby Labonte, eschewing even aspirin, is in the front
line.
</P>
<P>
   One week after cracking his right clavicle during practice at
Darlington, S.C., Labonte is in the front row for tomorrow's
Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts mostly when I move it the wrong way,'' Labonte said
yesterday, after climbing out of his No. 18 Interstate Batteries
Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, actually, I'm not as sore as I thought I'd be today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Labonte spoke, a mini-Quasimodo bulge poked from the right
side of his driver's suit. Doctors have outfitted him with a
shoulder cast and lashed it with tape to his back.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Labonte says, he's fine, as long as he doesn't
have to reach for the Mapsco or change radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverse is the hardest thing,'' he said. ``I can't get to
reverse too good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at the TranSouth Financial 400, Labonte reported
difficulties shifting gears. The unspoken footnote to the complaint
is that Labonte even raced at all, a scant 48 hours after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   To secure his Winston Cup standings points, Labonte only had to
be behind the wheel for the green flag that signals the race's
start. The Corpus Christi native toughed it out, however, driving
with the freshly broken shoulder for another 43 laps, before he
pitted and turned the driving over to young Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make him either a hero or just another tough guy
from Texas, Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my wife,'' he corrected. ``I'm not very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Terry _ he's 42 and Bobby is 34 _ would
dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's a tough guy,'' said Terry, who sits in the No. 4
starting spot. ``He's going to try to run the whole race for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   And there sits part of the drama for tomorrow's Winston Cup
race. Once the younger Labonte gets on the track for practice today
and sees how the shoulder holds up with traffic around him, he
thinks that he will have a better idea of how deep into the race he
will be able to drive tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be up to him,'' said Joe Gibbs, the former Washington
Redskins coach who owns the No. 18 car. ``I always left it up to
the player when I was coaching, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby will be the best one to judge how far he can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is third in the Winston Cup standings, and so the points
earned in Texas have meaning. In five starts this NASCAR season,
Labonte has four top-10 finishes and has started on the pole twice.
</P>
<P>
   With that at stake, Labonte and crew chief Jimmy Makar have
already decided to have Kenseth on call. Labonte's crew has
practiced removing him from the driver's seat _ i.e., grasp snugly
in the arm pits and pull, ignoring the driver's yelping.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Darlington, Kenseth got back in the race and drove
to a quality 10th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby and Jimmy have watched \RKenseth\S and liked him, and
they feel good about it,'' Gibbs said. ``Bobby's got a lot at stake
in this. We all do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of NASCAR racing, scrapes and bent sheet metal are
a way of life. Duct tape rules. But there is no bench, no Mark
Rypien, for Gibbs to easily turn to when the driver turns up with a
dent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's a good, young driver with a good head on his
shoulders,'' Labonte said. ``I knew he would take care of the race
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte contends that the shoulder is better. He spent this week
in North Carolina, undergoing therapy with trainers from the NFL
Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done some underwater treatments,'' he said, ``and some
stimulants for working the bone, moving it and moving it. I was
down there about three or four hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had prescribed the pain killer Vicodin, but Labonte
stopped taking the pills four days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a hangover,'' he said. ``Everything they had
me take makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   His best prescription, therefore, Labonte figures, is a long
Sunday drive with plenty of drivers in his rear-view mirror.

A STORIED CAREER NEEDS SOME SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Darrell Waltrip said his back was against
the wall before Winston Cup Primestar 500 qualifying yesterday.
Today, the season and quite possibly the legendary career of the
three-time Winston Cup champion could hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip ran a first-round qualifying lap of 184.666 mph,
finishing far behind the top 25 automatic qualifiers. He placed
46th out of 48 entries. His speed was more than 2 mph slower than
25th-place Ted Musgrave (186.600).
</P>
<P>
   Relying on provisionals and owner's points to qualify for the
season's first five races, Waltrip, Winston Cup's winningest active
driver, is out of free passes. Speed is his last avenue to qualify
for tomorrow's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Waltrip said to his crew as they watched his
speed plummet in the standings on a computer monitor in the garage.
Usually candid and accessible, Waltrip, 52, refused to comment on
his run and headed for his hauler.
</P>
<P>
   He will be among 23 drivers competing for 10 spots today in
final-round qualifying at 10:45 a.m. It is desperation time for one
of the sport's greatest drivers, and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole season is riding on what we do today,'' Waltrip said
before yesterday's qualifying run. ``My one lap is the most
critical lap I've run in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Waltrip fails to qualify today in his No. 66 Big Kmart Ford,
the remainder of his season will be jeopardized only six races into
a long, 34-race marathon. He can use four more provisional entries,
but only once every fourth race.
</P>
<P>
   Since failing to qualify at Charlotte Motor Speedway in October
1997, Waltrip's decline has been swift and has lent itself to talk
of retirement: ``Soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled through 1998 and finished 24th in the points
standings. Now driving for his third team in a year and a half, the
27-year veteran is practically starting from ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish this season is 20th, and he owns a dubious
double-digit streak of qualifying by provisionals. He dropped out
of the top 25 in points last week. He expressed unhappiness with
his car, but said he has seen improvement over the past few weeks
and expects to have a new car ready within weeks. He said he
thought the car he ran yesterday would be fast enough to get him in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for what I'm getting,'' Waltrip said. ``If we run well
this week, we'll get a week off and the team can relax a little.
That's what this team really needs right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip wants to race into the year 2000. It would make him the
only driver to compete in NASCAR events in the '70s, '80s, '90s and
2000. He is just one victory away from 85, which would break a tie
with Bobby Allison for third on the all-time win list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will get it together. It is just a matter of
time,'' Waltrip said. ``I hope I stay with this team long enough to
get there.''

   So for some officers, a report that a Bronx grand jury had
indicted four street crimes officers in the murder of Amadou Diallo
not only came as little surprise but also gave them hope that the
shadow cast over the entire police force might soon go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's going to take some of the motivation away for
the circus going on in front of Police Headquarters,'' said one
officer, a 30-year-veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity
about the daily protests over the Diallo killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think these guys were indicted for doing their
jobs, so you'd have to be a moron for that sort of thing not to
affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many officers who were questioned Friday about their reaction to
the reported indictments described how a difficult job had been
made even tougher by the Diallo case. They have had to deal with
suspicious stares from people on the beat or back talk from
suspects about the Diallo killing. One young officer in Harlem
recounted his most recent difficulty clearing a street corner on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just stood there at first and looked at me,'' said the
officer, who would only give his first name, Joel. ``Then one of
them said something about 41 shots, and the other responded, `yeah,
I guess we should move, you know how trigger-happy they are.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You take it in and try not to let it affect you,'' the
officer, a 15-year veteran, said. ``But it still hurts, and you
wonder when its going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said he supported the reported murder indictment by
the Bronx grand jury. He said that while other officers disagreed
with his views on the case, nearly all had similar complaints about
what the killing had wrought on their department.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you ride through the streets, you can actually see people
look at you funny,'' Officer Damian Gilsenan, 29, said Thursday
during a counter-demonstration to support the four officers at
police headquarters. ``You know they're wondering, `Are these guys
going to shoot me 41 times.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sagging morale in the 40,000-member department has become so
palpable that Police Commissioner Howard Safir opened his speech at
the department's promotion ceremony Friday by comparing his
officers to the rugged soldiers who took Iwo Jima during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncommon valor'' is ``really what this Police Department is
all about,'' he explained, adding, ``If you read the papers over
the last few months, you would think differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir then urged the officers to maintain their dignity and
understand that most people appreciate their efforts in quelling
crime. People in Harlem and Bushwick ``want more cops, they know
how hard your job is, as well as I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That job has become more difficult as the crime rate has gone
down, said James Savage, interim president of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association. He said pressure on officers to continue
making arrests and to focus on quality-of-life crimes had
demoralized them and helped to irritate much of the population.
Other officers said the pressure to make arrests and take
contraband and guns off the streets had also raised the probability
of shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were looking for a criminal, they were on edge and
they were alert for danger,'' said one 49-year-old officer,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``They were doing, from a
Police Department view, the right things when this shooting
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, a PBA delegate from the 90th Precinct in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that some officers were now
questioning whether to pursue their jobs vigorously. ``It has put a
second guess in the minds of officers; it is making them question
their obligation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not Safir, a former federal narcotics officer, nor the
citizens of New York City _ really understands the difficulties
that police officers routinely face on the streets, many officers
said.
</P>
<P>
   And among beat cops, there remains a certain empathy for the
four officers _ Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy _ involved in Diallo's shooting. It is not that all
of them agree with the amount of force the officers used that
February night _ 41 shots _ but most say they fear what they
themselves might have done in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like because I've been there,'' said a
33-year-old transit officer in a deli in the Park Slope section of
Brooklyn, adding that he had been shot by a suspect a few years
before. ``So I think it's wrong to call these guys killers for what
was probably just bad communication that ended in tragedy.''

KEVORKIAN CONVICTED OF 2nd-DEGREE MURDER  
(mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who claims he has helped
more than 130 people to commit suicide, was convicted Friday of
murder for giving a fatal injection to a man with a terminal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trial that people on both sides of the assisted-suicide
debate believe will have a profound impact on future discussion of
this contentious, emotional subject now that the most visible and
controversial proponent of euthanasia and assisted suicide could
spend much of the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, 70, was convicted in the death of Thomas Youk, a
52-year-old man from a Detroit suburb, who suffered from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Prosecutors
had originally charged Kevorkian with first-degree murder in Youk's
death. First-degree murder involves premeditation, but the jury,
which deliberated for 13 hours, returned a verdict of second-degree
murder, which does not.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, when a person is charged with first-degree murder,
the judge automatically instructs the jury that it can consider
second-degree murder. In this case, at the prosecutors' request,
the judge told the jury that it could consider an even lesser
charge, involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian faces a minimum sentence of 10 to 25 years in prison,
prosecutors said, and under the state sentencingguidelines he
would have to serve at least two-thirds of it. A conviction of
first-degree murder would have meant a mandatory life sentence. The
doctor, whose state medical license has been revoked, also faces up
to seven years for his conviction on a second charge, delivery of a
controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian reacted impassively as the jury read its verdict,
blinking several times as he looked toward the jury box. Released
on bond until sentencing in mid-April, he declined to speak with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth time in a decade that prosecutors had tried
Kevorkian for his role in the deaths of seriously ill people. Three
trials ended in acquittals, while a fourth ended in a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, Kevorkian was charged not with murder but with
violating laws against assisted suicide, for helping people to use
a contraption called a ``suicide machine'' to give themselves fatal
injections. Juries in those cases had been swayed by emotional
statements from the families of the dead, who defended Kevorkian's
actions as compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   But this trial was different because prosecutors had unusually
direct evidence: a videotape Kevorkian made of himself injecting
Youk with lethal chemicals last September. Kevorkian brought the
tape to the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast it in
November, along with an interview in which Kevorkian dared
prosecutors to file charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kevorkian was charged with murder, the judge instructed
the jury that the issue of whether Youk consented to his death was
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we knew it wasn't, was it wasn't assisted
suicide on trial,'' said a juror, a young man who would not
disclose his name. ``That was unequivocal. I mean we knew why we
were there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``what it came down to was the evidence proved
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strikingly short trial in which Kevorkian insisted on
defending himself, betraying his lack of legal skill as he asked
legally impermissible questions and failed to persuade the judge
that his proposed witnesses were relevant to the case. Likening
himself to such heroic figures as Martin Luther King Jr. nd Rosa
Parks, he appealed to the jury to send a message that laws against
euthanasia and assisted suicide were unjust.
</P>
<P>
   The same juror, the only one of the 12 who would speak to a
reporter, said the jury was not influenced by Kevorkian's
self-representation. But he said: ``There wasn't much defense. All
we were left with was the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror said that he perceived Kevorkian to be telling the
jury, ```Here's the tape. Now make a decision as to whether
assisted suicide is going to go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that wasn't what that was about,'' the juror said.
``We knew it was about the facts, we knew it was about a murder
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's lawyer, David Gorosh, said the defense would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is certainly unjust to try to equate an act of
compassion with an act of murder,'' Gorosh said. ``What he did was
a complete act of mercy. He was invited into the Youk home. Tom
Youk requested help, and he was suffering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors had originally charged Kevorkian with assisted
suicide as well as murder, but they dropped that charge when Judge
Jessica Cooper ruled that the defense could present testimony about
Youk's pain and suffering with an assisted-suicide charge and not
with a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   John Skrzynski, the lead prosecutor on the case, said the
decision to drop the assisted-suicide charge, considered a huge
gamble at the time, ultimately proved successful.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Youk's wife and brother could not testify and,
apart from the videotape, which showed how much Youk was suffering
when he was alive, no testimony was presented about Youk's painful
condition and his apparent desire to end his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trials in the past were always emotionally based,''
Skrzynski said. ``We tried to put it on a legal playing field, not
an emotional playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Youk's wife, Melody, and brother, Terrence,
hurried out of the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The trial attracted people with strong passions about assisted
suicide and euthanasia, both supporters and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Girsch, executive director of the Hemlock Society, was
dismayed by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call it murder is barbaric,'' she said. ``It highlights the
necessity to change the law all over the country and in the world
so that a compassionate physician can help a suffering patient
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Coleman, the founder and president of a group of disabled
people who have given themselves the name ``Not Dead Yet,'' was
heartened.
</P>
<P>
   She said the euthanasia movement was ``very threatening to a
disabled person,'' and added, ``I hope this will send a message
that this steamroller has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski was asked after the trial if he felt this would
silence Kevorkian, who has been flamboyant and outspoken in his
advocacy of euthanasia and assisted suicide, sometimes in ways that
alienated people who might be inclined to support his position on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silence him?'' Skrzynski said. ``I think as a practical matter
he'll go to prison and you know, prisoners don't usually have press
conferences. And I think he's going to be surprised that he's not
going to be able to maintain the public interest in the media that
he's gotten in the past once he becomes a prisoner. In a way he
kind of silenced himself by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said Kevorkian's views would ultimately be vindicated and
``Dr. Kevorkian will be lauded as a hero in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Cooper, who was patient with Kevorkian's
legal stumbling, implored him to allow himself to be represented by
lawyers. He refused, saying he felt he could express his views to
the jury better.
</P>
<P>
   But once the jury began deliberating, Gorosh, frustrated because
he was relegated to whispering advice to Kevorkian during the
trial, said he told his client, ``'There's nothing left for you to
argue here. These are legal issues that are better served by
lawyers who are experienced.'''
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, Kevorkian asked Judge Cooper if his lawyers could
represent him from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?'' the judge asked, before granting his request.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has said he would starve himself if sent to jail, and
both Gorosh and prosecutors said Friday that they hoped that would
not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski was asked if he had created a martyr. He replied, ``I
created an inmate.''

LAKERS STUNNED BY KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kurt Rambis shook up the lineup, shook up
the offense, shook up the rotation and anything else he could get
his hands on Friday night, shaking the Lakers' foundation so
furiously he could have changed his last name from Rambis to
Richter.
</P>
<P>
   But after several temblors, all the Los Angeles Lakers coach
could do was shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   After playing near-perfect basketball for the first half against
the Sacramento Kings, the Lakers tanked the third quarter, then
collapsed in the closing seconds of the fourth, turning an early
double-digit lead into a 111-109 loss before a packed house at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber's off-balance putback of a Vlade Divac off-the-mark
3-pointer with four-tenths of a second left gave the Kings the
dramatic win. And negated a series of changes Rambis had installed
to snap the Lakers out of their recent mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis started the night by thrusting Dennis Rodman into the
lineup for the first time this season. That change came a day after
he force-fed his team a change in offensive philosophy, emphasizing
more movement.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Rambis did seemed to pay off when the Lakers reversed
their trend of slow starts and played their best first half in
recent memory against the Kings. All it took was a horrific third
quarter to make it all seem irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by as many as 19 points in the first half, and by
16 at halftime, the Lakers surrendered 40 points in the third
quarter and trailed the Kings heading into the fourth. A chorus of
boos accompanied them off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Webber finished with a game-high 29 points and 10 rebounds, and
Divac scored 23 for the Kings. Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 26
points, and Shaquille O'Neal added 24.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome wasn't exactly what Rambis envisioned when he made
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if we get blown out in the first quarter by 50 points in
the next two ballgames then (the new lineup) probably won't stay
very long,'' he said before tipoff. ``But if we jump out to
50-point leads in the first quarter I might just stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-point lead sufficed as progress for a team that has been
nodding off in the opening period. With Rodman starting, and a
new-and-improved, movement-oriented Lakers offense clicking in
steady rhythm, the Lakers took a 30-20 lead by the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Lakers had a 62-46 advantage, a 26-14
rebounding advantage, were shooting 55.6 percent and had dished out
16 assists with their suddenly unselfish play.
</P>
<P>
   And Rambis seemed to be building a portfolio for a
coach-of-the-year nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It all came apart in the third quarter. The Lakers' defense
disappeared, surrendering 13 points to Corliss Williamson and 75
percent shooting to the Kings, who outscored the Lakers 40-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by six points with about two minutes left in
the game. Then Glen Rice took over, scoring seven straight points,
including a 3-pointer, to give the Lakers a 108-106 lead with 57.7
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Reid made one of two free throws to push the lead to three
points, only to see it wiped out when Vernon Maxwell drained a
3-pointer over Robert Horry.

DUCKS ROUT STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg
isn't one to mince words, and Friday morning he was as blunt as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start winning games, St. Louis, San Jose, Calgary,
lots of teams are going to catch us,'' he said. ``You can't hold
your position in this league very long if you don't win some games.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Hartsburg's Ducks responded with a most unlikely
win, a 5-1 rout of the Dallas Stars before 16,533 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   After spotting Dallas a 1-0 lead on Derian Hatcher's power play
goal at 8:27 of the first, Marty McInnis got a crucial power-play
goal to tie the game with 31.8 seconds left in the period. That
gave the Ducks at least a glimmer of hope against a Stars team that
is 22-1-5 when leading after one period and has turned protecting
leads into an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's hope then turned into a tidal wave of confidence as
the Ducks scored four times in perhaps their most dominating period
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen gave Anaheim its first lead of the year against
Dallas 19 seconds into the second when he converted Teemu Selanne's
center passing with a quick shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period Guy Hebert came up with his biggest
save of the game on a shot by Pat Verbeek to preserve the Ducks'
lead. Seconds later Kariya put a perfect lead pass on Selanne's
stick and the Anaheim winger chipped it over Ed Belfour for his
league-leading 41st goal of the year at 9:46.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne then ended Dallas' streak of 27 road games without
giving up more than three goals when he scored at 14:51 off a
rebound of Tomas Sandstrom's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had been closing in on the NHL record of 30 games set
by Detroit in 1952-53.
</P>
<P>
   To top off the second period, Kariya stole a Dallas pass in the
Stars' zone and while falling down snapped a wrist shot over
Belfour's glove with 40 seconds remaining. The fourth goal of the
period equaled the team's best output in a period and it marked the
first time Dallas had given up four in a period all season.

PROFESSIONAL STUNT MAN'S RACING IS NO PUBLICITY STUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Racing is dangerous. Only yesterday, a
handful of drivers smacked the Texas Motor Speedway walls at high
speeds. Two of them, Tony Raines and Ken Bouchard, were taken to
the hospital with concussions.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, however, is the least of Stanton Barrett's worries.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care about hitting the wall at 190 mph when
you've been blown up, hit by cars, gone flying off a motorcycle,
fallen off buildings, tumbled off snowmobiles at high speed and
been slammed into a vertical cliff while hanging from a helicopter?
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, 26, is a professional stunt man. He has worked on
movies _ including ``Batman, Jurassic Park, Blade, Volcano'' and
``Dante's Peak'' _ and TV shows, including ``JAG, Beverly Hills
90210, Baywatch'' and ``Extreme TV''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of stuff where you have a better than 50
percent chance you're going to go to the hospital,'' he said.
``I've been hurt a lot. I've broken my tailbone, my shoulder. I've
broken lots of bones.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett wants to be a Winston Cup driver. He's at TMS this
week trying to put owner W.C. ``Junie'' Donlavey's No. 90 Suburban
Lodge Ford into the field for the Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett turned his qualifying lap at 186.136 mph, putting him
36th of the 48 cars that made attempts. That's a tenuous position,
but might be good enough to make the field if no one goes faster in
second-day qualifying today.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett also climbed into Kerry Earnhardt's backup car for
second-day Busch Grand National qualifying but failed to make the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Donlavey, an owner since 1950 who has worked with NASCAR legends
Joe Weatherly, Tiny Lund, Fred Lorenzen, David Pearson, Benny
Parsons and Buddy Baker, said Barrett has talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be good,'' Donlavey said. ``He's got a good feel
for a car; he seems to know what he's doing and he pays attention
to you. A lot of times you'll get young drivers who want to prove
to you how good they are to start with, but you can't be good
without experience. It just takes time to get experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience, though, is in short supply. Barrett has raced in the
Goody's Dash Series and run late-model sports cars in North
Carolina. He has made 30 or so starts in the Busch Grand National
series. But he has never raced a full season at this level.
</P>
<P>
   He's a freelance driver, with a partial sponsorship deal with
Heritage Consumer Products but without a full-time team. He uses
his stunt work to fund his quest to go racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stunts have made me a living and allowed me to go to the
races,'' he said. ``When I have a shortfall from a sponsor, I put
in the rest of the money. I race as many races as I can, and then I
go back and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Work sometimes involves a stunt where a cable is anchored and
then tied to a motorcycle. The stunt man takes off, knowing what's
going to happen when the cable plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ride it, it runs out and you go sailing,'' he said.
``You're getting paid to hit the ground. If you don't do it right,
you have to do it again. You know it's going to hurt when you hit.
You just hope it doesn't hurt too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett would rather drive a race car for a living, even if it
does mean hitting the wall now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I risked my life to get here, and this is where I want to
be,'' he said. ``I've turned down a lot of work to pursue racing.
That's cost me a lot of money, so I'd better be dedicated to what
I'm doing. Whatever it takes to survive and pursue my racing
career, I'm going to do.'' / nn

STARS DONE IN BY FINN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Plain and simple, the Stars were Finnished
last night.
</P>
<P>
   Missing their top defensive forward, Finnish sensation Jere
Lehtinen, because of an ankle injury suffered Thursday against Los
Angeles, the Stars couldn't contain Teemu ``the Finnish Flash''
Selanne in a 5-1 loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation between the two Finns is tangible, as Lehtinen
is considered the top defensive forward in the NHL and has taken
delight in shutting down his boyhood friend, Selanne. Before last
night, the Stars were 6-1-1 in their previous eight games against
the Ducks. Lehtinen (4 goals, 4 assists, plus 6), who's not known
as a goal scorer, had outscored the high-flying Selanne (2 goals, 3
assists, minus 4) while playing head-to-head in most situations
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Selanne went wild. He scored two goals and added two
assists _ all in the second period _ as he pushed his NHL-leading
goal total to 42. Selanne has scored 16 goals in the past 16 games.
In addition, Selanne linemate Paul Kariya, who also had struggled
against the Stars, added three points. Kariya and Selanne have
combined for 15 points in their past three games.
</P>
<P>
   While Lehtinen's absence was notable, it wasn't the Stars' only
problem. They were playing their third road game in four nights
while the Ducks were coming off a four-day rest. The Ducks also
have not traveled outside the Los Angeles area in the past 13 days,
while the Stars have been to six different cities in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The result wasn't pretty. The Stars yielded more than two goals
for the first time in the past eight games and saw an end to a road
streak in which they had not yielded more than three goals in 27
consecutive games (two goals or less on 26 occasions), the longest
such streak in the NHL since the Detroit Red Wings went 30
consecutive road games while allowing three or fewer goals in
1952-53.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Stars hold a four-goal lead (146-150) on the
Ottawa Senators in the race for the Jennings Trophy, given to the
NHL team that allows the fewest goals.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Stars to 45-15-12, still 19 points ahead of
the second-place Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference. The
Stars need one point to clinch a Pacific Division title and two
points to clinch the top seed in the Western Conference. The also
can clinch with losses by the Avalanche or the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks move to 32-28-11, two points ahead of the St. Louis
Blues for fifth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars opened the scoring once again as they have scored
first in 49 of 72 games this season. This time, their moribound
power play finally came to the rescue. After going without a shot
on a scattered first power play attempt one minute into the game,
the Stars received a beautifully skilled play from captain Derian
Hatcher. Hatcher took a pass on the left wing as the Stars were
breaking into the offensive zone, glided in on goalie Guy Hebert
and deftly slipped a backhand under his pads.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hatcher's ninth goal of the season and only the seventh
for the Stars on the power play in their past 18 games (a span of 7
for 59).
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, however, answered with their own power play goal. The
Stars were whistled for too many men on the ice at the 18:26 mark
of the first period and the Ducks went to work with the best power
play in the NHL. Anaheim's Marty McInnis scored on a deflection of
a point shot for the Ducks' 74th power play goal of the season
(they would later get 75). The Stars are tied for second with 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks then took their first lead of the season series (3-1-1
in favor of the Stars) 19 seconds into the second period. Selanne
fished out a puck behind the net and fed Matt Cullen in the slot
for an easy chip in past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made it 3-1 on a beautiful transition play by Selanne
and Paul Kariya at the 9:46 mark of the second, took it to 4-1 on
Selanne's second goal of the night at 14:51 and made it 5-1 when
Kariya stole a pass and beat Belfour at the 19:20 mark of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also were without Dave Reid (back spasms) and lost
Jamie Langenbrunner to an abdominal strain during the game. The
Stars today travel to Nashville and tomorrow will finish a
four-game road trip with a 5:30 p.m. game against the expansion
Predators.
</P>
<P>
   It will end a stretch in which the Stars have played seven of
nine games on the road.

CORNELL AIR CONDITIONING PLAN THREATENS LAKE, SAY CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ It seems an environmentalist's dream: a system
that can cool 10 million square feet of Cornell University
dormitories, laboratories and computer rooms simply by pumping
frigid water from the depths of a nearby lake. No more
chlorofluorocarbons, the refrigerants that can destroy protective
ozone in the atmosphere. An electric bill 80 percent smaller than
for conventional air conditioners. To top it off, nothing goes back
into the lake, except water that came from the lake in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   But an energetic group of local opponents insists that Cornell's
$55 million plan to replace its aging air conditioners is actually
an environmental nightmare. They say it could foster choking blooms
of algae and bacteria at the south end of Cayuga Lake, one of the
fjordlike Finger Lakes created where glaciers scratched across
central New York during the last Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to five years of studies, thousands of pages of data,
and more than a dozen permits from local and state agencies,
Cornell scientists and engineers say the system could actually
improve conditions in the lake. Yet another benefit, they say, is
that the smaller electric bill would not just save the school
money; it would reduce Cornell's contribution to global warming by
reducing the need to burn coal to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, government officials have agreed, and
construction is expected to get into high gear in April.
</P>
<P>
   But a small, determined coalition of critics from Ithaca and
surrounding Tompkins County says the school's plan should never
have been approved. They recently garnered support from as far
afield as the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private
environmental organization, and Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   They say New York state environmental officials granted permits
for the project in violation of a provision of the federal Clean
Water Act, which prohibits new releases of anything into a lake or
river that is included on a list of ``impaired'' water bodies. Even
though the project would return to the lake only the water that it
removed, that would be considered a new release under state law.
</P>
<P>
   The south tip of Cayuga Lake was added to a list of impaired
water bodies last year. Officials with Cornell and the state
contend, however, that the listing is in a special category not
covered by the federal ban on discharges.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, even as several dozen train cars loaded with
miles of pipe sit along the lake shore, a burst of e-mails and
letters persuaded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to begin
a review of the project and the permits granted by the New York
state Department of Environmental Conservation. The review, which
could result in the permits being revoked, is expected to be
finished in early April.
</P>
<P>
   There is no panic at Cornell. Engineers and administrators say
that they attended to every detail through five years of planning.
They have gained endorsements from the local Sierra Club chapter
and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue, Walter Hang, who runs an Ithaca
business that maps toxic sites around New York state, has lent his
company's expertise to the opponents of the Cornell project. His
concern, he said, is that allowing it to proceed would weaken the
Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Ithaca and a spreading zone of suburban and rural
development sits at the south end of the 38-mile-long lake. There,
the water often turns soupy in the summers, even though the rest of
the lake is clean. Two sewage plants there together release about
12 million gallons a day of treated water. At the same time,
several communities, including the surrounding town of Ithaca, draw
drinking water from the lake. Some residents fear that the Cornell
project, even if it adds just a little to the problems, could
threaten the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the law, this lake is supposed to get studied,
get a management plan, and there are supposed to be no new
discharges,'' Hang said. ``But that's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell staff engineers who conceived the cooling plan say
their goal was to reduce the school's impact on the environment.
The school's trustees had voted that chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
the most common refrigerant chemical, were to be eliminated from
the campus by 2005. The chemicals have been linked to a
deterioration of the ozone layer that shields the earth from
harmful ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a push for energy efficiency, both to cut costs
and pollution. In central New York, coal is the dominant fuel at
power plants, including the university's own small power plant. It
was only natural that the school would turn to the cold depths of
Cayuga Lake, four miles from the campus.
</P>
<P>
   A team of engineers came up with a simple system of pipes and
pumps that pulls the chilly water from 250 feet down in the lake to
a heat exchange on shore. There it would sop up warmth carried from
the campus in water circulating through a long loop of pipe.
</P>
<P>
   W.S. ``Lanny'' Joyce, the project director, said every step of
the construction and operation of the cooling system had been
designed to minimize its impact. The intake pipe, sunk two miles
out in the lake, would have a sound generator to shoo fish away and
lights to deter tiny freshwater shrimp that might otherwise be
sucked in, he said. The shrimp, an important link in the lake's
food web, reflexively avoid light, he said. The lake water would
never mingle with the water circulating around the campus, which
has chemicals in it to prevent rust, he said, adding that the heat
would flow from one to the other across stainless steel plates, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature of the piped lake water would rise 10 to 15
degrees at most as it absorbs the heat removed by the campus
cooling system, he said. It would be returned to the lake at its
shallow, warm south end. During most months the water leaving the
cooling system would be cooler than the water around the outflow
pipe, so that it would be unlikely to spur the growth of bacteria,
according to Cornell's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Its concentration of nutrients, such as phosphorus, would also
be lower than the levels of phosphorus and other nutrients already
typical of the shallow waters, the university found. The existing
nutrients come mainly from sewage plants, silty streams, and flocks
of waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Joyce said, the flow from the Cornell project would
help reduce pollution in the south end of the lake. ``Our water is
clearer, cleaner, and cooler,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayuga Lake Defense Fund, a local group that was created to
fight the cooling project, has attacked nearly every step of the
cooling plan. Last year, it hired Alex Horne, a lake expert from El
Cerrito, Calif., to assess the project. He contends that the pipe
would pull nutrients from the bottom of the lake and release them
into the shallow, warm part of the lake, fertilizing it. The pipe
``will cause or increase nuisance blooms of blue-green algae
(cyanobacteria) which could cover several miles of near shore water
in summer,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics are more focused on what they contend were
procedural lapses in approving the project. Doria Higgins, an
artist and retired clinical psychologist, has been one of the most
energetic foes of Cornell, writing dozens of letters to local,
state, and federal officials, pointing out what she says are dozens
of gaps in the project's environmental impact study and in the
permits issued by state officials.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the state permit says the project can be
stopped if follow-up studies show it is not working as planned, but
the university is only required to submit data once a year. ``In
the meantime, the plume from the discharge pipe will be running
right past the intake area for our drinking water,'' Ms. Higgins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, opponents got a boost when Ralph Nader wrote a letter
supporting their fight, calling the project ``an ill-advised
boondoggle.'' In contrast, John Kaminsky, the chairman of the
Finger Lakes chapter of the Sierra Club, a private group, said that
residents should focus more on the biggest sources of pollution _
suburban development and the sewage plants _ and less on a project
that has many environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in the March issue of the group's newsletter, he
said that Cornell made an easy target, because it had long been
perceived as ``Big Brother'' by many townsfolk. ``In reality, we
are the problem,'' he wrote. ``Every time we flush our toilets,
fertilize our lawns, gardens and fields, or wash our cars we
contribute to the nutrient loading of the lake.''

TRAFFIC SIGNALS INSTALLED FOR THE SABBATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENCINO _ Even pushing a crosswalk button violates the religious
customs of Orthodox Jews on the Sabbath, so city officials are
trying to find a way to avoid the danger of their having to hurry
across busy intersections.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, engineers with the city Department of Transportation
reprogrammed five intersections along L.A.'s bustling Ventura and
Burbank boulevards so traffic lights will automatically allot extra
time for pedestrians even if they did not activate the crossing
button.
</P>
<P>
   This timing pattern will remain in effect every week from 4:45
p.m. Friday to 8:30 p.m. Saturday, officials said. Sabbath ends at
sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very considerate of them to do that,'' said Joseph
Tehrani, 48, an Orthodox Jew and civil engineer for Caltrans.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews strictly observe the Sabbath as a day of rest and
reflection and accordingly do not use any electricity, including
cars and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   For Tehrani and others, there is another pressing concern about
these intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people can't walk as fast,'' Tehrani said
Friday after crossing Ventura Boulevard at Newcastle Avenue, one of
the reprogrammed intersections.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that intersection on Oct. 20 that Soltan Netan E-Li,
the 76-year-old wife of a rabbi, was struck and killed by a
hit-and-run driver while she was walking to temple for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the crash said Netan E-Li appeared to get stranded
in the intersection when the light changed before she could reach
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her death, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura
Chick said she began looking into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Chick, chairwoman of the City Council's Public
Safety Committee, and fellow Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski,
engineers changed the timing patterns for the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our families and elders, all residents in Los Angeles,
to be able to cross streets safely, and, in particular, we want to
be respectful of people's religious beliefs and traditions,'' Chick
said Friday. ``This was an easy thing for the city to do.''
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a few clicks of a computer keyboard in the
city's Automated Traffic Surveillance Control Center in downtown,
said transportation engineer associate Dan Mitchell. The effort was
no extra cost to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minimal effort on our part, and for the most part it
has a minimal effect on traffic since most of it takes place on
Saturday, which is an off-peak day,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The time between a green and red light can vary from 5 seconds
to 40 seconds, he said. The cycle is shorter when no one pushes the
crosswalk button because the intersection assumes that only
vehicles want to cross.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes made Friday, people will now have about 30
seconds to cross the affected intersections, with or without
pushing the button, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The affected intersections are along Ventura Boulevard at both
Newcastle and Zelzah avenues and Burbank Boulevard at Reseda
Boulevard and both Etiwanda and Lindley avenues.
</P>
<P>
   These are among about 40 intersections citywide where traffic
signals have been modified on account of the Sabbath, Mitchell
said. Some of these intersections, called ``Sabbatical pedestrian
recall locations,'' were changed more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ones changed Friday were the first in the western end of the
San Fernando Valley, Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight other such intersections in the valley are in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While the Encino intersections are now set to change
automatically every Friday, traffic engineers will have to
reprogram them from downtown on religious holidays, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   But even that will be automated in about a year because the
department has rewritten the software it uses to control signal
timing at the computers housed in the gray boxes at intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will know each day what time, to the second, the sun rises
and sets and has all the special holidays programmed in,'' Mitchell
said. ``That will eliminate the need for us to manually implement
this (every holiday).''
</P>
<P>
   There are now no plans to make these changes at any other Valley
intersections, but Chick said she is open to recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orthodox Jewish community congregates geographically
because they have to be within walking distance of their
synagogue,'' she said. ``There are a whole lot more synagogues and
shuls showing up in this area because of the growth of the
community.''

MANN MAY BE READY TO SELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's nothing like the massive lines expected for
``Star Wars Episode I: Phantom Menace,'' but the troubled Mann
Theatres chain has drawn several bids since putting itself up for
sale two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, whose top performers are the fabled Chinese Theatre in
Hollywood and the landmark Village in Westwood, is believed by
industry insiders to have attracted offers from a pair of Southern
California rivals -- Pacific Theatres and Edwards Theatres -- along
with an investment group headed by former Mann chief Jeff Lewine
and the recently formed Resort Theatres of America.
</P>
<P>
   Newport Beach-based Edwards, which bought Mann's Orange County
facilities in the early 1990s, had no comment on a Daily Variety
report that it has submitted a bid worth over $100 million for the
375-screen chain. Los Angeles-based Pacific has confirmed it has an
offer on the table without disclosing further details, but its bid
is reportedly far under the Edwards offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lewine, who led the 1997 buyout of Mann by Wall Street
investment firm Warburg Pincus, was a candidate even before
resigning his post at Mann last week. Resort Theatres, launched
last year by Hollywood veteran Brad Krevoy, has emerged as a
candidate because of recent deals to build a five-plex in Aspen,
Colo., and to buy five existing Metropolitan theaters in Palm
Springs with four additional sites under development.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than cash, Warburg Pincus may be looking over bids
that would swap the Mann sites for an equity stake in another
operator. Entertainment industry consultant Kevin Skislock of
Laguna Research Partners noted that both Edwards and Pacific have
embraced the strategy of building state-of-the-art megaplexes
equipped with stadium seating and massive concession stands rather
than buying existing theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could mean that Edwards or Pacific are taking a long-term
view and buying the Mann facilities as knock-downs,'' Skislock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has been far less aggressive at launching new theaters, and
many of its older sites face tough competition. For example, Mann's
triplex in Pasadena competes with a recently built eight-screen
Pacific and will be leveled next year when its lease runs out, the
property owner has told city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, which has 60 theaters in California and Colorado, has seen
its value plunge over the past decade. Paramount bought the chain
in 1986 from producer Ted Mann for $220 million in 1986, then sold
half of it two years later to Warner for $150 million. Warburg paid
the Paramount-Warner partnership $165 million when it bought the
chain 15 months ago.

PINKTERTON'S PURCHASE BY SWEDES FINALIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's official: Pinkerton's Inc. is now a wholly
owned subsidiary of Securitas AB of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Pinkerton's, the international detective agency
known for tracking Butch Cassidy and providing protection for
Abraham Lincoln, overwhelmingly approved the purchase by its
Swedish rival to create the largest full-service security company
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   About 99.3 percent of shareholders -- or 12.2 million shares --
have accepted Securitas' offer of $29 a share in cash. The merger
is valued at $384 million.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory approval is needed, said Pinkerton's spokesman
Mark Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage will lead to layoffs of an undisclosed number of
Pinkerton's employees holding certain jobs in finance and strategic
planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Pinkerton's headquarters employs 160 people, Leaf
said.
</P>
<P>
   Denis R. Brown, president and chief executive of Pinkerton's,
will stay on as the chairman and CEO of the subsidiary. He will
also join Securitas' board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Swedish officials said last month that they are
investigating nine people for possible insider trading connected to
Securitas' purchase of Pinkerton's. It was described as the biggest
such investigation in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's generates sales of $1 billion a year and employs
48,000 people worldwide. Securitas' revenues are $1.8 billion
annually. It employs 66,000.

DOUBTS PERSIST IN BRONX AREA WHERE POLICE KILLING TOOK PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with NY-POLICE-INDICT)  
 (bl)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the residents of Wheeler Avenue, a modest stretch
of two-story apartment buildings in the Soundview section of the
Bronx, reports that four police officers had been indicted on
charges of second-degree murder in the killing of their neighbor,
Amadou Diallo, did little Friday to allay their suspicion of the
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   One of Diallo's roommates, who answered a knock at his door, and
neighbors who sat quietly on their stoops in the sunshine expressed
deep skepticism about the judicial process, especially the official
silence surrounding the grand jury. The Bronx district attorney's
office, which has overseen the jury for six weeks, has refused to
confirm that the officers have been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   These neighbors said they would not be satisfied until the
police officers involved answered a central question: Why did they
open fire on an unarmed 22-year-old immigrant whom everyone
remembered as being courteous, hard-working and shy?
</P>
<P>
   At Diallo's ground-floor apartment at 1157 Wheeler Ave., a
roommate, who did not give his full name, opened the door a few
inches and explained why reports Friday that the officers had been
indicted did so little to address his concerns: ``Just put yourself
in those boots. Imagine a family member killed for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reports of the indictments, he said only: ``If that
is what is required by law, then that's the right thing. All we are
looking for is justice. We don't want anything outside the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Others on the block said that they were troubled by many
questions: Why had the officers not been arrested? Why did Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani hold his Thursday town hall meeting in Bushwick,
Brooklyn, instead of in their neighborhood? While they were in pain
over the killing, why did Police Commissioner Howard Safir fly to
the Academy Awards last weekend?
</P>
<P>
   For them, the news about possible indictments was no news at
all. ``Justice is not done until there's a trial,'' a neighbor
said. He declined to identify himself, saying he was a witness in
the case and had given testimony to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, a woman who identified herself only as Dee and said
she on the block, added, ``Not done until they get convicted.'' The
two expressed doubt as to whether the officers had been indicted at
all. ``What is the secret?'' the man asked. ``Why is the indictment
sealed until Monday? There's something behind the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   For Trudy Browne, 69, who took her 12-year-old granddaughter,
Keisha, Friday to see the vestibule where Diallo was shot by police
officers who fired 41 bullets at him, the reports of indictments
came too late. ``They should have been indicted the same week,''
she said. ``They should not be working when they deliberately
killed a man.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors attributed their skepticism, in part, to a mayor
whom they described as ``arrogant'' and ``selfish,'' but most of
all, absent. ``As soon as one of those cops is shot, Lord, he's
there,'' Dee said. ``The other one is chilling at the Oscars. They
should have come out here for one of those town meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence McDonough, a neighbor who examined the piles of wilting
flowers outside the vestibule, said Giuliani was ``the one who
caused all these things because he has no respect for people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the head of the city,'' he said of Giuliani. ``You're
supposed to do something to stop the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bullet-scarred vestibule, neighbors had left poems
and Psalms, and had scribbled angry messages about the police. Amid
the graffiti was a scrawled note that seemed to capture the
neighborhood's suspicion. Dated ``2/26/99,'' it read: ``Secret
`Grand Jury'? Why haven't they been arrested?''

CLUTCH SHOT BY POLYNICE HELPS SONICS SURVIVE CLIPPERS SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With the seconds whirling off the shot clock as well
as the game clock, Detlef Schrempf knew he had to get the ball to
someone.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Sonics' veteran forward settled for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice, not exactly a go-to guy with the game on the
line, took a pass from Schrempf and dropped in an 18-foot jump shot
with 38.4 seconds remaining Friday night to assure the Sonics a
hard-fought, 104-98 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those Clippers. The now 2-24 Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally realized who the shooter was,'' Polynice
deadpanned of his dead-center jumper that gave the Sonics a 102-98
lead.
</P>
<P>
   That comment drew laughter from the reporters gathered around
Poly-nice in the Sonics locker room, as well as from the team's
7-foot center.
</P>
<P>
   Losing to the Clippers would not have been a laughing matter,
especially with the Sonics embarking on a road trip where they will
play five games in six nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely important,'' guard Hersey Hawkins said of
getting the win before the team's longest road trip of the
truncated NBA season. ``For confidence, of course, because you hate
to go on the road with a losing streak. So to get this one we'll
hopefully be able to springboard a little and just go out on the
road and be aggressive, play hard and win the majority of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics lost to the Washington Wizards Wednesday and had
dropped eight of their past 12 overall. Losing to the Clippers
would have been hitting rock bottom face first.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (14-12) needed everything they could muster Friday to
avoid falling to .500 before a late-arriving crowd of 17,072.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton again led the way, registering 26 points, 11 assists
and eight steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take Gary for granted, but he made huge plays on both ends
of the floor in the second half and was the big difference in the
game,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, however, needed help and got it from Schrempf, who added
25 points, and Dale Ellis, who scored eight of his 20 points in the
final three minutes when the game was very much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Polynice's timely jumper, the Sonics will need more from
their big men because Vin Baker is expected to miss at least
another month with ligament damage in his right thumb. Schrempf has
picked up much of the slack since moving into the power forward
spot vacated by Baker, but Polynice (9), Aaron Williams (6) and
Jelani McCoy (2) combined for only 17 points in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detlef was really good,'' Westphal said. ``Guarding (Maurice)
Taylor in the low post, scoring and playing 40 minutes. He's really
a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were led, appropriately enough, by rookie center
Michael Olowokandi, who scored 16 points and had 13 rebounds. To
say the Clippers are a young team is like saying they are not a
very good team. Schrempf, who appeared in his 1,009th NBA game
Friday, has played almost three times as many games in the league
as the Clippers' starting five combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing almost good enough to win, but almost is
not good enough in the NBA,'' Clippers forward Lorenzo White said.
``Their veterans knew exactly what to do when they get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clippers would not go away. They made 57.9 percent of
their shots in the first half, when they led by as many as eight
points at 43-35, before the Sonics closed the gap to 54-53 at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a lot of tough shots tonight,'' Hawkins said. ``So I
wasn't surprised they hung around, not with the shots they made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers also made a lot of open shots because Westphal had
his players trapping in an attempt to force turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting everything,'' Westphal said, shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Except at the end, when the Sonics outscored the Clippers 16-6
over the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they felt like they could steal a game tonight,''
Ellis said of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Polynice is knocking down 18-footers as the shot clock
expires and with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Detlef said, he just saw a white jersey and it happened
to be me,'' Polynice said. ``I was shooting all the way because I
knew the clock was running out. And it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes it did, which helped the Sonics avoid going down to an
embarrassing defeat.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kurt Rambis shook up the lineup, shook up
the offense, shook up the rotation and anything else he could get
his hands on Friday night, shaking the Los Angeles Lakers'
foundation so furiously he could have changed his last name from
Rambis to Richter.
</P>
<P>
   But several temblors later, all the Lakers coach could do was
shake his head in disgust. Everything he tried to build had been
knocked into ruins by a Kings-sized earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   And all the changes, seemingly effective for one half, were
rendered irrelevant when the Lakers reverted to bad habits in the
third quarter, lost a double-digit lead, then lost the game
111-109.
</P>
<P>
   A fallaway putback by Sacramento's Chris Webber with four-tenths
of a second left sealed the Lakers' second straight loss and
negated any progress they had appeared to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed, personally,'' Derek Harper said, ``because
this team did to us what we did to Orlando on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant squandering a huge lead, in this case 19 points, on the
home court. It's the kind of performance unbecoming a team with
championship aspirations and a roster of All-Stars that was
supposed to be strengthened with the promotion of Dennis Rodman to
starter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers lost to the Kings for the second time in 11
days, and again with turmoil surrounding Rodman. Last time, they
lost in Sacramento while Rodman vacationed in Las Vegas. He was MIA
again, but this time by design _ Rambis benched him for the final
16 minutes for undisclosed reasons.
</P>
<P>
   So while Webber was getting perfect rebounding position to score
the winning basket on a putback of Vlade Divac's missed 3-pointer,
Rodman watched from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have to take the blame for that,'' Rambis said,
``even though I can't tell you what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wouldn't commit to leaving Rodman in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters pressed for details, Rambis cut off the query,
saying: ``Let's not start with 20 questions trying to get it out of
me. That's just the end of it, it was just a coach's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One that possibly backfired. ``We could have used Dennis on that
last tip-in, for sure,'' Kobe Bryant acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, as per usual, was not available, but in comments he
issued through the team, he noted his limited playing time. ``But I
can't say nothing about that. That is a coach's decision, so don't
ask me about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the loss, he was more expressive: ``I think you need to ask
the people around here what is going on. This is just completely
ridiculous. I'm not used to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis started the night by thrusting Rodman into the lineup for
the first time this season. That change came a day after he
force-fed his team a change in offensive philosophy, emphasizing
more movement and a ban on one-on-one play.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Rambis did seemed to pay off when the Lakers reversed
their trend of slow starts and played their best first half in
recent memory, gaining a 19-point lead and coasting into halftime
with a 62-46 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a horrific third quarter to make it all seem
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-point third quarter by the Kings _ against the worst
defense the Lakers have played _ turned the game around, and the
Lakers trailed for most of the fourth. And yet they nearly got away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by six points with 2:43 left in the game when
Glen Rice almost singlehandedly brought them back. Rice scored
seven straight points in less than a minute as the Lakers surged
ahead 109-106.
</P>
<P>
   But Vernon Maxwell's 3-pointer over Robert Horry forged a tie.
At the other end, Harper missed an open 3-pointer, and Webber ended
up with the rebound. Seconds later, he pushed in the game-winner to
finish with a game-high 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started (messing around) in the second half,'' Horry
said. ``Guys started freelancing.... It's (bleeping) ridiculous how
we played.''
</P>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg
isn't one to mince words. And Friday morning he was as blunt as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start winning games, St. Louis, San Jose, Calgary,
lots of teams are going to catch us,'' he said. ``You can't hold
your position in this league very long if you don't win some
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Hartsburg's Ducks responded with a most unlikely
win, a 5-1 rout of the Dallas Stars before 16,533 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing St. Louis had pulled even with them and that San Jose
was only two points back, the Ducks made the Stars look like just
another team, rather than the squad that leads the NHL in points
(102) and wins (45).
</P>
<P>
   ``We got back to being a hardworking, tenacious team, we had
gotten away from that,'' said Hartsburg after the game. ``It's
something for us to build on. Things (the playoff race) have
tightened up so much the past week ... we have to continue to play
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After spotting Dallas a 1-0 lead - on Derian Hatcher's power
play goal at 8:27 of the first period -- the Ducks scored five
consecutive goals against a team that they were 3-18-1 against in
their last 22 games. A team that had outscored them 81-37 in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   But like they did after a recent win over Detroit, the Ducks
tried to temper their excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win, but we don't want to get too satisfied,''
said Teemu Selanne who took over the NHL goal-scoring lead with his
41st and 42nd goals and assisted on two other goals. ``We know they
did have as much energy as we had (Dallas played the Kings on
Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again we haven't had much success against them, so
it's a nice confidence boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty McInnis got a crucial power play goal to tie the game with
31.8 seconds left in the opening period. That gave the Ducks at
least a glimmer of hope against a Stars team that is 22-1-5 when
leading after one period and has turned protecting leads into an
art form.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's hope then turned into a tidal wave of confidence as
the Ducks scored four times in perhaps their most dominating period
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen gave Anaheim its first lead of the year against
Dallas 19 seconds into the second when he converted Selanne's
center passing with a quick shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period Guy Hebert came up with his biggest
save of the game on a shot by Pat Verbeek to preserve the Ducks'
lead. Seconds later Paul Kariya, who had a goal and two assists,
put a perfect lead pass on the Selanne's stick and the Anaheim
winger chipped it over Ed Belfour for a 3-1 Anaheim lead at 9:46.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a playoff-type atmosphere,'' said Hebert. ``One
big save, whether it was tough or not ... we score and it's like
monumental change in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne then snapped Dallas streak of 27 consecutive road games
without giving up more than three goals when he scored at 14:51 off
a rebound of Tomas Sandstrom's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe we were scoring that many goals,'' said
Hebert, who was very aware that the Stars came into the game
allowing only 2.0 goals a game.
</P>
<P>
   To top off the second period, Kariya stole a Dallas pass in the
Stars zone and while falling down snapped a wrist shot over
Belfour's glove with 40 seconds remaining. The fourth goal of the
period equaled a Ducks' high and marked the first time Dallas had
given up four in a period all season.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim left the ice to a standing ovation, a far cry from last
Sunday when they helped empty the building by allowing four goals
in a 5-2 loss to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great feeling, especially against a team like
Dallas,'' said Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the Dallas playbook the Ducks sat on the lead
in the third period and wound up outshooting the Stars 32-26. In
the Ducks' last three games -- a win, a loss and a tie -- they had
been outshot 123-72.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Ducks (32-28-11) two points ahead of
sixth-place St. Louis and four up on seventh-place San Jose.

<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Serbian forces stepped up
attacks against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo on Saturday as
NATO air operations rattled Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, in the
heaviest attacks of the campaign, allied officials said. ``The
Serbs have been torching villages,'' the British Defense Minister,
George Robertson, said in London. ``There are reports that the
Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration. There are
clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against the Albanian
population has started.'' By Craig R. Whitney. With photos and map.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-FORCE (Washington) _ Bill Clinton is a politician to his

they complained of being pushed back by police wielding batons, he
told them: ``No one will dare to beat you again.'' By Michael T.
Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As the price of

control statute meets stiff resistance in the Canadian northwest.
By Anthony DePalma. With photo and map.

special domestic police force, trained in riot control, reflecting
Beijing's preoccupation with internal stability. By Erik Eckholm.

   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-COMPANIES-ADS (Washington) _ The federal government has

the vast market of postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer,

the border that separates federal authority from state
prerogatives. By Linda Greenhouse.

<P>
   PENSION-PROBLEMS (Undated) _ A quarter-century ago, Congress
created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to make sure that the 42
million workers with traditional pensions would get paid even if
their employer went bankrupt. How well that agency operates is now
being questioned in a series of audits by the agency's inspector
general and by a lawsuit charging that one of the pension agency's
contractors defrauded it. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>

   &UR; NATIONAL  &LR; (``a'' code)

<P>
   INTERNET-BUG (San Francisco) _ A rapidly spreading computer

this small key of largely palm and sand with intentions of turning
it into an upscale resort area, older black residents of Miami-Dade
are shaking their heads. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   NAVAJO-ZOO (Window Rock, Ariz.) _ The Navajo's assertion of
tradition and the cultural reverence for animals have combined to
put the future of the 36-year-old Navajo Nation's zoo in doubt.
``It's a culture shock that we're experiencing,'' said Harry
Walters, a Navajo who is an anthropologist. By Catherine C.
Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   D-DAY-MEMORIAL (Bedford, Va.) _ Board members of the National
D-Day Memorial Foundation, which has its headquarters in this city
of 6,400, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, were
disappointed when ``Saving Private Ryan'' didn't win the Academy
Award for best picture. They were hoping that an Oscar sweep for
the D-Day epic would help the foundation reach a $12 million
fund-raising goal for the construction of a major national
memorial, a rarity outside Washington. By Ian Zack.
</P>
<P>
   INMATE-APPEAL (Auburn, N.Y. _ In 1987, David Wong, an illegal
Chinese immigrant who was serving time for armed robbery, was
convicted of second-degree murder in the slaying of a prison inmate
and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Ordinarily, the case
of Wong would not attract much notice. But this story is different,
not only because interviews with prison employees, inmates and the
dead inmate's widow strongly suggest that Wong is innocent, but
also because Wong has found unconditional support from a group of
indefatigable strangers in New York City. By David Chen.
</P>
<P>
   GURU'S-WILL (White Plains, N.Y.) _ When Frederick P. Lenz III
swallowed 150 tablets of Valium and stepped off a dock into the bay
behind his Long Island home last year, he left behind a collection
of mansions, private jets and luxury cars valued at $18 million,
and a will that practically invited a lawsuit. By Debra West.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE-BRUTALITY-TRIAL (New York) _ More than a year and a half
after a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima was reportedly
brutalized by police officers in Brooklyn, jury selection is to
begin Monday for the trial of four officers charged with attacking
him and of a sergeant accused of joining them in an attempted
cover-up. By Joseph P. Fried.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   RENAULT-NISSAN (Tokyo) _ In taking a stake in the troubled
Nissan Motor Co., Renault, the stodgy French car company that has
tried to become a formidable force in Europe, has embarked on a
risky business gamble to strengthen the global competitiveness of
both companies. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY &LR;  (``k'' code)

<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (New York) _ Commentary by Maureen Dowd on police
brutality and Mayor Giuliani's response to the police shooting of
an unarmed immigrant.

   ZAGREB, Croatia _ If anyone has ever wondered how wars begin,
they begin like this: Two sides, starting from different principles
and world views, back one another into a trap of their own rhetoric
and mythologies.
</P>
<P>
   If the West miscalculated President Slobodan Milosevic's
willingness to invite NATO-led troops into Kosovo, the southern
Serb province, the Yugoslav leader may at the same time have
miscalculated his own freedom to solve the problem he created.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rose to power on the issue of the minority Serbs in
Kosovo, the province from which Serbs derive their defining myths
of nationalism, victimization and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he promised Kosovo's Serbs that ``no one will be
allowed to beat you'' and that Kosovo would remain in Serbia
forever. When he did that, said Slavko Curuvija, a Yugoslav
journalist who was standing next to a shaking Milosevic at the
time, ``he suddenly became the leader of all Serbs and the Serb
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But that path led Milosevic and the Serbs toward widespread
ethnic cleansing and killing through much of what once made up
Yugoslavia. The Serbs certainly misjudged how much revulsion this
would stir in the West. On the other hand, the notion of martyrdom
in Kosovo is so deeply ingrained in Serbian mythology that the West
likewise seems to have miscalculated Milosevic's ability to walk
away from Kosovo once the battle there had been joined.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, Kosovo is their Jerusalem, the holy touchstone
and center of their existence as a nation despite all the defeats
and travails of history. It was in Kosovo, in 1389, on the Field of
Blackbirds, that Serb forces lost a mighty battle to the Ottoman
Turks, who then ruled Serbia for the next 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs regard themselves as having kept the flame of
their nation alive, with Kosovo as its bleeding heart. They
regained Kosovo by force in 1912, in the First Balkan War, when the
crumbling Ottoman empire was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalism was the distant spark that touched off World
War I, and the Serbian nation that resurfaced in this century still
has enormous complexes. Serbs still consider themselves a
misunderstood Christian nation on the edges of Western
civilization, patronized, mistreated and pushed around by more
powerful states, even as they bravely draw the line today against a
new Muslim expansionism in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's current bombing campaign to protect Kosovo's Albanians
feeds into all those Serb mythologies, and for now, at least, has
strengthened Milosevic's support at home. Again and again over the
last week, Serbs of widely differing backgrounds have said they
have no great love for Milosevic, who is bringing destruction to
the country, but that they support his refusal to allow foreign
troops into Kosovo as an intolerable infringement of Serbia's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Milosevic has drawn the wagons more closely around
himself, firing critics in the army and elsewhere who express
dissent even privately, and not always getting the best
information, Western negotiators and Yugoslav officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have believed until the end that NATO really meant
to bomb him,'' said a Yugoslav official with ties to the
presidency. ``But Kosovo is too big a prize for him and for all of
us, and the West really offered us nothing in return, only this
pretense that we would remain legally sovereign.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. negotiator long involved with the effort to
negotiate a peaceful solution for Kosovo expressed some wonderment
when the final visit to Milosevic by the U.S. diplomat Richard
Holbrooke produced no movement. ``We thought that faced with the
choice of having NATO-led troops in Kosovo and getting bombed, that
he would prefer the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   This miscalculation was a part of the larger U.S. assumption
about Milosevic, based on the experience in Bosnia, that he would
always bend to superior force to preserve his power. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has long argued that ``the only language
Milosevic understands is force.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was able to walk away from Sarajevo when it was
included in the Bosnian Muslim zone under the Dayton accords of
1995, and he could survive the cleansing of Serbs from the Krajina
region when Croatia's forces drove them out earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo is different. Bosnia was never an integral part of
the Serb nation or myth, as Kosovo is, and it was independent, as
Kosovo is not. The Serbs were losing anyway by the time the
Americans got around to trying to stop that war in 1995, and
Milosevic had a lot to gain by suddenly turning into the West's
crucial partner in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may yet bend, says a Yugoslav analyst, Bratislav
Grubacic, who has close ties to part of the regime. But he notes
that Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, is a more nationalistic and
ideological figure than her husband and is fond of saying, ``You
can defeat us, but you cannot convince us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her logic, which Milosevic seems to accept, is that to
effectively give away Kosovo by signing the peace accords would
destroy their claim to leadership, Grubacic said. ``But if we lose
Kosovo in a war, we have the legal basis to reconquer it in 100
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav army is doing its best to destroy the
Kosovo Liberation Army and leave ethnic Albanians a calling card
they will long remember.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic may have outsmarted himself, Curuvija suggested.
Having ridden Kosovo to power and having set that genie free, it
may have turned out to be his captor. ``After all Milosevic has
said and done since 1987 to bind Kosovo to Serbia, if now he said,
`To hell with all that,' and signed the deal, he'd be dead,''
Curuvija said. ``I told American officials that a policy intended
to push Milosevic to the wall over Kosovo, to act as they want or
to be killed, is the worst policy, that they had to find another
way with him, to find a way to make him a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Grubacic, the West has pushed Milosevic into
embracing his isolation to preserve his power at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a suicidal policy, and he may finish like Hitler in the
bunker,'' Grubacic said. ``But he will be remembered in Serb
mythology history as someone who said `no' to the dissolution of
the nation.''

<P>
   President Clinton's argument, enticing in its simplicity,
packages the bombing of Yugoslavia's armed forces as a humanitarian
mission: It is meant, he says, to halt a murderous campaign against
innocent ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to bring the Serbs to heel, NATO has unwittingly
married itself to a new partner. It is the Kosovo Liberation Army,
an armed group whose goals include not only independence but the
expulsion of Serbs from the province. A little more than a year ago
it was dismissed by a senior U.S. diplomat, Robert Gelbard, as a
``terrorist group'' and its insistence on armed resistance has
deepened the crisis and propelled Kosovo into warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog of horrors that have befallen Yugoslavia, the
Kosovo Liberation Army is one of the lesser plagues. The danger to
stability presented by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
is far greater than anything within its power.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that this group has emerged to speak for Kosovo's
Albanians, and the bombing by NATO of Serbian targets on their
behalf, reveals a great deal about the moral ambiguities
confronting outsiders who wade into the Balkans to halt the killing
and ethnic cleansing begun a decade ago by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA began on the radical fringe of Kosovar Albanian
politics, originally made up of diehard Marxist-Leninists (who were
bankrolled in the old days by the Stalinist dictatorship next door
in Albania) as well as by descendants of the fascist militias
raised by the Italians in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It has no ideology beyond a drive to liberate Kosovo from Serb
rule, but its leaders have long championed the quixotic goal of a
``Greater Albania'' reaching into Albania, Macedonia, Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Though its atrocities pale next to the rampages of the Serbs, it
has shown little tolerance for its ethnic rivals, carrying out
random kidnappings and executions and burning Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic embarked on his nationalist drive, stoking hatreds
between Serbs and other ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia, in
Kosovo in 1987. Yet it took a decade, with the Serbs running Kosovo
like a colonial outpost, before Kosovar Albanians turned to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Milosevic revoked the province's autonomy in 1989, a
moderate leadership under a self-styled president, Ibrahim Rugova,
maintained a fragile peace. It did so by pretending to exercise
autonomy, delivering some services and forbidding street protests,
while the Serbian government pretended to have full control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, whose very existence was in dispute
among U.S. diplomats until the uprising last year, consisted of a
few ragtag bands that walked around remote villages in motley
uniforms and shot the odd police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, Milosevic set out to eradicate the armed
bands, and his security forces surrounded Prekaz, a town where Adam
and Hamza Jashari, founding members of the KLA, were holed up with
dozens of armed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Double-barreled 20-mm anti-aircraft guns and .50-caliber machine
guns pounded the stucco and brick homes for three days. More than
50 people were killed, nearly half of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Belgrade naively assumed they had wiped out
the resistance group. In fact, the raid triggered a province-wide
rebellion. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone in Kosovo was a charter
member of the KLA. Most of Rugova's local officials, tired of
international indifference to Serb repression and abuse, became
village commanders. His party disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders seemed to sprout like mushrooms and nominal leaders
had no control over forces acting in the name of the guerrilla
group in the next village. The chaos was aggravated by a flood of
weapons that poured over the border from northern Albania, where
armories had been looted after an economic meltdown in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from among the 600,000 ethnic Albanians who send home
money from abroad left their menial jobs as dishwashers and
construction workers in Germany and Switzerland and flocked to
northern Albania. They were handed uniforms and weapons and sent
over the mountains to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 30,000 automatic weapons in the hands
of the force of several thousand fighters, plus anti-tank weapons
and light mortars. But while some special fighting units have been
set up, there remains no central command. The Kosovo Liberation
Army is a state of mind, not a tight organization.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is not simply a rebellion by Albanians against
Serbs, but by a new generation of Kosovar Albanians against the
intellectuals and urban elite in Pristina. Kosovo has the highest
birth rate in Europe, and 70 percent of the population is under 30.
Couple this with the 70 percent unemployment rate and the result is
a vast pool of disenchanted youth from which the guerrilla army can
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   These fighters, by and large, differ from their elders in that
they do not speak Serbo-Croatian, have no loyalties to the Serbian
state and have contact with Serbs only at checkpoints or jails.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when international negotiators sought a peace
agreement between Milosevic's government and the Kosovar Albanians,
they turned to the Kosovo Liberation Army, hoping to blunt its
drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it signed on to the terms, which include a three-year
period for Kosovo to be a NATO protectorate. But it has not given
up its central goal of eventual independence _ a goal the Clinton
administration has steadfastly said it does not agree with.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group accepted a phased plan to disarm once NATO
forces can be deployed to safeguard a truce, it is unlikely that
after three years of preparation for war, many weapons would be
turned over.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the international community had to turn to the Kosovo
Liberation Army was that by the time the world woke up to the
conflict in Kosovo, there was no political center left.
</P>
<P>
   So U.S. officials have been left trying to portray the Albanians
as innocents, when in fact their leaders are nationalists who have
retreated very little from positions once described as extreme. In
the long history of Balkan nationalist movements, pressure has
sometimes nudged such militants from more extreme tactics, but it
has rarely if ever extinguished their goals of building nationalist
states.
</P>
<P>
   So, as happened in Croatia and Bosnia before, the West now has
no choice but to make common cause with one such nationalist group
to oppose another nationalist group, Milosevic's government, that
is clearly more destructive.

has shown little tolerance for its ethnic rivals, carrying out
random kidnappings and executions and burning Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic embarked on his nationalist drive, stoking hatreds
between Serbs and other ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia, in
Kosovo in 1987. Yet it took a decade, with the Serbs running Kosovo
like a colonial outpost, before Kosovar Albanians turned to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Milosevic revoked the province's autonomy in 1989, a
moderate leadership under a self-styled president, Ibrahim Rugova,
maintained a fragile peace. It did so by pretending to exercise
autonomy, delivering some services and forbidding street protests,
while the Serbian government pretended to have full control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, whose very existence was in dispute
among U.S. diplomats until the uprising last year, consisted of a
few ragtag bands that walked around remote villages in motley
uniforms and shot the odd police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, Milosevic set out to eradicate the armed
bands, and his security forces surrounded Prekaz, a town where Adam
and Hamza Jashari, founding members of the KLA, were holed up with
dozens of armed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Double-barreled 20-mm anti-aircraft guns and .50-caliber machine
guns pounded the stucco and brick homes for three days. More than
50 people were killed, nearly half of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Belgrade naively assumed they had wiped out
the resistance group. In fact, the raid triggered a province-wide
rebellion. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone in Kosovo was a charter
member of the KLA. Most of Rugova's local officials, tired of
international indifference to Serb repression and abuse, became
village commanders. His party disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders seemed to sprout like mushrooms and nominal leaders
had no control over forces acting in the name of the guerrilla
group in the next village. The chaos was aggravated by a flood of
weapons that poured over the border from northern Albania, where
armories had been looted after an economic meltdown in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from among the 600,000 ethnic Albanians who send home
money from abroad left their menial jobs as dishwashers and
construction workers in Germany and Switzerland and flocked to
northern Albania. They were handed uniforms and weapons and sent
over the mountains to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 30,000 automatic weapons in the hands
of the force of several thousand fighters, plus anti-tank weapons
and light mortars. But while some special fighting units have been
set up, there remains no central command. The Kosovo Liberation
Army is a state of mind, not a tight organization.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is not simply a rebellion by Albanians against
Serbs, but by a new generation of Kosovar Albanians against the
intellectuals and urban elite in Pristina. Kosovo has the highest
birth rate in Europe, and 70 percent of the population is under 30.
Couple this with the 70 percent unemployment rate and the result is
a vast pool of disenchanted youth from which the guerrilla army can
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   These fighters, by and large, differ from their elders in that
they do not speak Serbo-Croatian, have no loyalties to the Serbian
state and have contact with Serbs only at checkpoints or jails.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when international negotiators sought a peace
agreement between Milosevic's government and the Kosovar Albanians,
they turned to the Kosovo Liberation Army, hoping to blunt its
drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it signed on to the terms, which include a three-year
period for Kosovo to be a NATO protectorate. But it has not given
up its central goal of eventual independence _ a goal the Clinton
administration has steadfastly said it does not agree with.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group accepted a phased plan to disarm once NATO
forces can be deployed to safeguard a truce, it is unlikely that
after three years of preparation for war, many weapons would be
turned over.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the international community had to turn to the Kosovo
Liberation Army was that by the time the world woke up to the
conflict in Kosovo, there was no political center left.
</P>
<P>
   So U.S. officials have been left trying to portray the Albanians
as innocents, when in fact their leaders are nationalists who have
retreated very little from positions once described as extreme. In
the long history of Balkan nationalist movements, pressure has
sometimes nudged such militants from more extreme tactics, but it
has rarely if ever extinguished their goals of building nationalist
states.
</P>
<P>
   So, as happened in Croatia and Bosnia before, the West now has
no choice but to make common cause with one such nationalist group
to oppose another nationalist group, Milosevic's government, that
is clearly more destructive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has argued that at least the Kosovo Liberation
Army has put its signature on the draft truce accords, something
Milosevic has refused to do, and that this merits protecting the
Albanian side. He has also argued that it is Milosevic whose
strategy ignited and has fed the wars of hatred that have consumed
the Balkans now for nearly 10 years, producing slaughter that the
world cannot tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all powerful arguments. Still, they leave unanswered
the question of how tricky it may be to work with the Kosovo
Liberation Army to build peace after the bombing stops. In fact,
the situation recalls another maneuver by Washington four years
ago, the last time it decided to bring Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fighting was in Bosnia with Serb forces shelling cities
like Sarajevo and executing some 7,000 Muslims in the fields around
Srebrenica. Before Milosevic agreed to negotiate, the West did two
things: It bombed the Bosnian Serb forces for 20 days, crippling
its military machine, and it applauded as President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia, a rabid nationalist whose fondness for ethnic cleansing
is outdone only by Milosevic's, launched a pitiless military
campaign that drove some 200,000 Serbs out of Croatia and, in
coalition with Muslim forces, tens of thousands more out of central
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some of Tudjman's generals stand accused of war crimes in
these campaigns. But at the time, the West looked the other way
because the battlefield victories forced Milosevic to sue for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Kosovo, the West is gambling that by allying with the
Kosovo Liberation Army and bombing Milosevic's forces it will
avert, or at least limit, a slaughter of Kosovo's Albanian
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with the Kosovo Liberation Army after all this is
over remains unanswered. But if past forays into the Balkans are
any guide, the United States could find itself struggling to
contain new nationalist groups that have no more interest in
achieving reconciliation than the butchers who preceded them.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the candidates are to be believed, the unfolding
presidential campaign will be a high-toned, polite affair.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, in a mailing to
prospective supporters, pledged never to lambaste ``my friends and
colleagues'' in the race. Former Vice President Dan Quayle made the
same vow. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said he has never run an
attack commercial _ and is not about to start now. Among Democrats,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey has no plans to resort to
biting rebukes to catch up to the favorite, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Will debates, therefore, more resemble tea parties? Instead of
those commercials featuring grainy, villainous images of their
rivals, will politicians promote themselves frolicking through
clover?
</P>
<P>
   Don't put away your television clicker just yet.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates sense that people are repulsed by the vitriolic
discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that attacks can
boomerang _ virtually no one in politics believes that the days of
dark, dirty presidential campaigns are over. There will always be
one candidate who is winning and one candidate who is losing. And
the candidate who is behind almost invariably will seek to alter
the dynamic by discrediting his or her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the impeachment imbroglio, politicians are
especially sensitive to the accusation that they would rather
slaughter their enemies than save the republic. So the trick now is
to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
recently warned his party's contenders that they risk ``a
bloodbath'' unless they abide Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment:
``Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic strategist in Chicago,
said that may be for naught. ``We've heard about the 11th
Commandment for a decade,'' he said, ``but the First Commandment of
politics is: `Thou shall not lose!'''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians can promise not to go negative and then go negative
anyway because they hold divergent views of what constitutes an
out-of-bounds remark or advertisement. Asked to define negative
campaigning, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who is seeking the
Republican nomination, was not entirely joking last week when he
replied, ``Any attacks made on me!''
</P>
<P>
   No candidate, of course, likes to fess up to going too far after
an opponent. A prime example is Steve Forbes, who pumped roughly
$35 million of his personal fortune into commercials that bashed
his opponents in 1996. His attacks were so thermonuclear that his
brief burst of support in the polls began to hemorrhage, leaving
opponents (using his given name) to deride Forbes as ``Malcolm the
Mudslinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire in February 1996, Forbes conceded that he had
``spent too much time talking about the inconsistencies and
shortcomings of my opponents.'' He added, ``When you make a
mistake, you learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week Forbes, who is making a second try for the
nomination, was at it again: He began running radio commercials in
the pivotal states of Iowa and New Hampshire, accusing Gore of
``hiding while his liberal friends do his dirty work'' _ attacking
Republicans on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, Forbes insisted that he was not out of line
last time. ``To me, the 11th Commandment means no personal attacks,
talking about rumors, drinking, that sort of thing,'' he said.
``Our ads were about issues, particularly the tax issue. And unlike
other campaigns, which should remain nameless, we never did phone
calls in the middle of the night, `If you vote for Mr. X, you know
he poisons cats.''' (Forbes' commercials also delved into such
matters as raising questions about the financial practices of his
opponents.)
</P>
<P>
   While Kasich said he would never make personal attacks, he
pleaded ignorance when asked whether the Forbes commercials in 1996
were appropriate. ``What my problem is, is I don't watch a lot of
television,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain argued that Forbes served as a case study in negative
campaigning. ``What's the definition of a negative ad?'' he asked.
``I remember the Forbes campaign commercials: `August something,
1991. Bob Dole voted for a gondola in Idaho!' When asked, the
Forbes campaign said, `Well, that's his voting record.' Well, it
wasn't his voting record. It was an omnibus goddamn appropriations
bill that had nothing to do with the gondola!''
</P>
<P>
   For all of McCain's indignation, Darrell West, a professor of
political science at Brown University, said he was not convinced
that the senator would stay on the high road. ``I'll believe it
when I see it,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how George Bush ridiculed Michael Dukakis in the 1998
campaign _ and Dukakis never responded _ West said: ``Nobody wants
to get Dukakis-ized. Nobody wants to be the candidate who is
attacked but doesn't respond, because the risk in that situation is
that the negatives will stick.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since elections are inherently comparative exercises, the
question always comes down to how much comparing a candidate should
do. Tone is important, too; Does ominous music transform a
commercial into a negative commercial?
</P>
<P>
   By promising not to engage in negative campaigning, candidates
try to persuade voters that they are above sinking into mud. Former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee cultivated such an image, but he
has not ruled out running negative advertisements in his current
campaign, arguing that his failure to respond to attacks cost him
the New Hampshire primary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander neglects to tell people that he ran the first negative
advertisement in New Hampshire in 1996, attacking then-Gov. Pete
Wilson of California on the radio for increasing taxes and pledging
to serve a second full term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contest has the potential to get nasty as well.
Gore has a Boy Scout reputation, but he first raised the issue of
Massachusetts' prison furloughs in a debate in the 1988 primaries.
Bush's supporters picked up the idea and cited the furlough of
Willie Horton in perhaps the most devastating commercials against
Dukakis in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McSlarrow, Quayle's campaign chairman, said that maybe
campaigning will be cleaner in 2000. ``All of us watched what
happened to Bob Dole when he was running out of money as he was
getting pounded right and left _ he couldn't get off the mat for
months,'' he said. ``Nobody wants whoever the nominee is to get
wounded again.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who cling to Reagan's approach should be mindful that
he was no shrinking violet. In scathing remarks about President
Gerald Ford's foreign policy in March of 1976, Reagan accused him
of ``a timid, vacillating and divided leadership.'' The father of
the 11th Commandment had violated it.

<P>
   DETROIT _ The end of the Cold War has had many unexpected
effects, but few are as surprising as the arms race that has
developed between the people who make cars and the people who steal
them.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging car thieves used to be relatively simple. Until the
late 1980s, the biggest problem involved youths who hot-wired cars
for joy rides. Even small alterations in vehicle design, like
changing door locks, could dissuade some of these thieves, or at
least prompt them to choose another car to steal.
</P>
<P>
   But tearing down the Berlin Wall and loosening totalitarian
controls across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics
changed the auto-theft business by opening up an enormous new
market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this international
business have become more sophisticated, and so have the
countermeasures designed by automakers to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   While criminals have been stealing cars in the United States and
selling them in Latin America for years, the growth of an Eastern
European market has attracted criminal organizations with the
ability to ship large quantities of cars across oceans, according
to U.S. insurance officials.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and elsewhere on the East Coast, expensive cars
and sport utility vehicles that are stolen and not recovered are
usually on their way to the Baltic ports of Estonia for resale
across the former Soviet Union, said Kim Hazelbaker, the senior
vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute, which is
financed by auto insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is even worse in Western Europe, where hot-wired
cars can be quickly taken across borders. In Germany, insurers will
provide theft coverage for only two-thirds of a car's value unless
it is equipped with the latest theft-deterrence equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, automakers responded to the fall of the Berlin Wall
by redesigning their cars during the early 1990s to make them
harder to steal. The design changes are now spreading to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The main design change has been the placement of a tiny radio
transponder inside the base of each key. When the key is turned in
the ignition, a weak electrical current from the car battery flows
through the lock, allowing the key to broadcast a coded signal with
a range of just 2 inches. The signal is detected by a sensor in the
steering column, which then permits the engine to be turned on.
Without the signal, even a hot-wired engine will not start.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves responded to the first such keys in the mid-1990s by
trying to transmit all of the available codes, which for some
models meant as few as a dozen combinations. But technology has
leaped ahead since then. Ford's keys now have 10 quadrillion
combinations, and engines will accept the correct combination only
if it is received within 0.0007 seconds after the electrical
current flows through the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it is not aware of any successful criminal efforts to
override this system, but it plans to start encrypting the codes
anyway for the next generation of Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   When automakers add these engine-immobilizing devices to cars,
the theft rate drops by as much as two-thirds from one model year
to the next, according to insurers. But the rapid spread of the
technology has prompted thieves to up the ante, too. Professional
criminals increasingly rely on tow trucks and flatbed trucks.
Thieves replace the immobilizing devices on expensive stolen
vehicles destined for export with $400 worth of replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some criminals simply resort to carjackings. ``If it's not going
to run without the key, they're going to walk up and put a gun to
your head and demand the key,'' said Edwin Sparkman, the senior
manager for vehicle theft at the National Insurance Crime Bureau,
an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said this month that its surveys found
there were about 49,000 attempted carjackings a year from 1992 to
1996, and in half of those cases the criminal got away with the
car. This figure is twice as high as criminologists had expected,
but because of insufficient data the department was unable to
conclude whether the annual totals were rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings are a much bigger problem in some poorer countries,
notably South Africa, where one entrepreneur sells flame throwers
that are attached below a car's doors and are designed to
incinerate nearby assailants. U.S. auto engineers say they have no
plans to make any devices that would injure car thieves, pointing
out that such devices are illegal in the United States anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings still account for a tiny portion of all car thefts.
Federal statistics show that 1.35 million vehicles were stolen in
1997, the most recent year available, down 16 percent from the peak
in 1992, because less serious criminals have lost interest in car
theft. But the recovery rate for stolen cars has plunged as more
are shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Insurance Crime Bureau estimated last week that
about 200,000 stolen vehicles were shipped out of the United States
in 1997, or nearly half of the 450,000 cars that were stolen that
year and never recovered. By comparison, the United States legally
imports about 2 million cars a year, and there are more than 200
million registered vehicles on the nation's roads.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the vehicles stolen for export are hidden in the big
steel containers commonly seen now on trucks and flatbed rail cars
as well as cargo ships. Customs agents focus mostly on stopping
illegal imports, not exports, although the government has been
stepping up its efforts to find stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen vehicles in greatest demand overseas are luxury sport
utility vehicles, like the Mercedes M-class and Lexus RX-300, which
can handle the bad roads in places like Russia, Colombia and China,
said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, another industry group. Some foreigners even order
the theft of specific vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drug lord in Colombia says, `I want a Mercedes
M-class,''' Ms. Rochman said, ``and poof, a Mercedes disappears in
San Antonio or San Diego and it shows up in Colombia in a crate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many lists issued each year of the most frequently
stolen cars, but most fail to adjust for the number of each type of
vehicle already on the road. As a result, such lists tend to show
that Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys are stolen most often simply
because there are so many of these vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But when the number of registered vehicles of each model is
taken into account, a different picture emerges. ``If you don't
have a luxury car, a sports car or a sport utility vehicle, you're
not really at risk,'' except in high-crime neighborhoods,
Hazelbaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the arms race has been the teen-ager who
used to be able to hot-wire a car for a quick joy ride but now has
little hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   A once-popular theory of history held that Rome fell because
China built a wall. In other words, the construction of the Great
Wall of China forced nomadic peoples outside the wall to turn their
attention westward, eventually destroying the Roman Empire. The
peculiarity of auto theft in the United States today is that joy
riding is disappearing partly because Berliners tore down a wall.

   DETROIT _ The end of the Cold War has had many unexpected
effects, but few are as surprising as the arms race that has
developed between the people who make cars and the people who steal
them.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging car thieves used to be relatively simple. Until the
late 1980s, the biggest problem involved youths who hot-wired cars
for joy rides. Even small alterations in vehicle design, like
changing door locks, could dissuade some of these thieves, or at
least prompt them to choose another car to steal.
</P>
<P>
   But tearing down the Berlin Wall and loosening totalitarian
controls across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics
changed the auto-theft business by opening up an enormous new
market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this international
business have become more sophisticated, and so have the
countermeasures designed by automakers to stop them.

   LOS ANGELES _ Meet the Grogan boys.
</P>
<P>
   There's Tom. He's 17. In May, he's graduating from Pierce
College. A month later, in June, he's graduating from El Camino
Real High School.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's right, the kid's graduating from college before
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   There's John Jr., Tom's older brother. He's 18. He graduated
from El Camino High last year after participating on the football
and wrestling teams, and he's also graduating from Pierce this May.
</P>
<P>
   So is John Sr., their father. He started taking classes at
Pierce when he was 18, and 22 years later is finally graduating at
40 _ with his sons.
</P>
<P>
   The Grogan boys have taken all their night classes at Pierce
together _ four nights a week for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   When you talk to one, the other two usually finish the sentence.
It's like walking into the middle of an Abbott and Costello
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night of class, it's always the same thing,'' said
John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The instructor wants to know if we're related,'' said John
Sr., picking up the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say no,'' said Tom, finishing it off with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. The Grogan boys are tighter than the Three
Musketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bauer, principal at El Camino High, and Sandi Rubalcaba,
Tom's school counselor, think the kid is breaking new ground here
graduating from college before high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had seniors who have completed a quarter or two of
college before they've graduated, but none who have gone to the
extent Tom has,'' Rubalcaba said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer likes to see the surprised look on people's faces when he
tells them about this senior he has graduating in June _ a month
after graduating from college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some parents who have high-powered, high-achieving
kids, and when I tell them what Tom has done, they can't believe
it,'' Bauer said. ``They think it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people do. Check out this schedule Tom has just
completed:
</P>
<P>
   Up at 6 a.m. to get ready for high school. Classes from 8 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. The extra time at school is so he can participate on
the football and wrestling teams just like his brother did.
</P>
<P>
   Then a half-hour at home before meeting his brother and father
four nights a week over at his dad's private investigation office
near the college. Catch a quick bite to eat, and finish off the day
sitting in a college class from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If you think it's too much, and that Tom and John Jr. don't have
any time for a social life, think again, the boys say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to all the proms, Disneyland nights, and lettered
in two sports,'' John Jr. said. ``We haven't been cheated out of
anything because we've gone to college at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing they've lost is the three or four hours a night a
lot of teen-agers spend at home watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we missed that, but so what?'' Tom said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet music to the ears of John Sr. and Karen, his wife of 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families do things together,'' John Sr. said. ``Our family
just likes to take college classes together, that's all. Instead of
going out to movies, we're in class learning things.''
</P>
<P>
   And by being in class, John Sr. said, he gets a candid glimpse
of his boys in action that few, if any, parents get to see in their
own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, they forget that their dad is there,'' he said.
``I get to see how they interact with their classmates, and how
they respond under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see stuff parents never get to see because they're not in
the classroom with their kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that, he thanks his own father _ also named John, a retired
detective who put in 30 years with the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about 10, he took me to some night classes he was
taking over at Valley College,'' John Sr. said. ``I thought it
would be so neat to be a young guy in college. I never forgot it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, John Jr. is going on to California State
University, Northridge, where he wants to start a law enforcement
career after graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, whose earned the nickname ``Doogie Howser'' from
classmates at El Camino _ wants to go to law school and take a few
classes with his brother at CSUN. He wants to be a licensed
attorney at 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been accepted at two law schools, but I don't
want to say which ones because I haven't made up my mind which to
attend yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To enter some law schools, applicants need only 60 units toward
a four-year college degree. Tom already has those 60 units.
</P>
<P>
   John Sr. is already enrolled in La Verne Law School, and plans
to add the title ``attorney'' to his business cards as a licensed
private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   He's going to miss these Pierce College night courses he's taken
with his sons, John Sr. said, but it's only a hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Grogan girls.
</P>
<P>
   His two daughters, Jennifer, 8, and Kathryn, 9, already are
bugging him to take college classes with them when they get into
high school.

   VIENNA, Austria _ When Arabs united in 1973 to slap an oil
embargo on the United States because it had supported Israel, the
international oil cartel known as OPEC fell into line and shock
waves reached every continent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini launched a second
oil shock when he telegraphed his consuming wrath at the ``Great
Satan'' by slashing oil production in half. Again, the political
passion behind the action drew OPEC's cooperation. Oil prices
quadrupled in months.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next 20 years, the oil-producing countries fell into
disunity, losing their ability to panic the world by boosting oil
prices at will.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, all of that seemed to change _ or at least the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to give that
impression _ as OPEC's members rediscovered the appeal of political
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing aside technocrats and oil ministers who wanted
production kept high, they decreed a cut in production of about 3
percent. They hope this will lift the rock-bottom prices to which
oil has fallen in recent years, savaging the economic hopes of
once-haughty countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? The answer, in large measure, is in the political
climate. In the 1970s a measure of anti-American sentiment could be
counted on in virtually all of the Middle East, which dominated
OPEC. Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, divisions among the Middle
Eastern oil producers (and alliances with the United States after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became much more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production came on line in Alaska and the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new political factor is at play _ the political cost
of low oil prices. This is uniting OPEC's members, overcoming at
least some of their rivalries, and attracting new allies like
Norway and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The price fall has been so steep that it has become, in the
words of an OPEC minister, ``a matter of state.'' The 11 countries
of OPEC saw their collective revenues from oil drop by a third last
year. Oil companies laid off hundreds of thousands of workers
worldwide as their profits sank by 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria, and even in the world's
largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, shrunken budgets are straining
social and political cohesion. Even in the United States, oil
companies dismissed 50,000 employees last year and U.S. oil
production fell by 500,000 barrels a day to a new low of 5.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by this unraveling, foreign ministers and heads of state
from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Algeria, Norway and Russia engaged
last January in a whirlwind campaign of phone calls and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a carefully choreographed meeting in Vienna,
lasting less than an hour, to announce a 2.1 million-barrel-a-day
reduction in the world's oil production for a year. This comes on
top of an earlier reduction last year of 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long this super-oil-producers' alliance will last is
anybody's guess,'' said Gary Ross, chief executive officer of
Petroleum Research Industry Associates in New York. ``But this is a
very aggressive agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the agreement has the blessing of the large
multinational oil companies, which find themselves in the position
of wishing the cartel good luck. Ironically, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries owes its creation 40 years ago to the
political passions of the postcolonial era, in which developing
nations sought to wrest control of their oil resources from ``big
oil.'' Now OPEC members are courting these companies to come back,
invest money, take equity and pump oil.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance may last longer than skeptics believe because
of the confluence of interest among OPEC, non-OPEC countries and
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   The social and political pain created by low oil prices has made
for some surprising bedfellows, the most interesting being Iran and
Saudi Arabia, which are the world's first- and second-ranking
producers. Traditional oil rivals and bitter enemies, the neighbors
now have new leaders, and they have been groping toward a new
relationship.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ascension of Mohammed Khatami to the presidency of Iran and
the rising power of Crown Prince Abdullah in Saudi Arabia as the
ailing King Fahd slips into the background have brought two
pragmatic figures to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   For the prince, the notion of having two powerful enemies, Iraq
and Iran, nearby was becoming intolerable at a time when lower
revenues had forced Saudi Arabia to cut defense spending by some 22
percent. And the fall in revenues had weakened Khatami's hand in
his tug-of-war with sterner clerics who do not agree that Iran
should interact more with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   One result of these two leaders' efforts to talk was that Saudi
Arabia moved away from a production level of 8 million barrels a
day that it had considered nearly sacrosanct since 1990. And Iran
stopped obstructing a deal within OPEC by agreeing to a cut of
300,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Once this was worked out by their foreign and oil ministers, the
deal was sealed in telephone negotiations in which other OPEC
members and Mexico, Norway and Venezuela were brought on board.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there are wild cards in this deal. One is forlorn,
angry Iraq, which said it would not take part. Under the United
Nations' oil-for-food sanction regime, Iraq has nearly tripled its
oil production in the last year to 2.7 million barrels a day. The
Iraqis say they will continue to pump more oil, but their ability
to do so may be limited by their inability to get cash and spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the temptation for many of poorer countries to
break ranks once oil prices start to rise. And there is the Asian
economic crisis, which may keep demand for oil down.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC says if more cuts are needed, it will decree them. And
its members say they have learned the lesson of drowning oil
markets in oil.

DRUG COMPANIES GET FDA REPRIMANDS FOR FALSE CLAIMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government has repeatedly reprimanded
drug companies in recent months after finding that they had made
false or misleading claims in television commercials and magazine
advertisements for a wide range of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such advertising has exploded as drug companies market their
products directly to consumers, and the government is now
scrambling to keep up with Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the Food and Drug Administration has
admonished companies about commercials advertising drugs for
allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hair loss
and sexually transmitted diseases. It has also found problems in
advertisements for birth control pills, anticancer drugs and
medicines to help people lose weight and stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the regulatory agency said, the advertisements
violated the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they
overstated the benefits of a particular drug, minimized the risks
or falsely suggested that one drug was superior to another. The
agency also found that many companies had been promoting their
drugs for uses not approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA typically demands that the use of such advertisements
``cease immediately.'' Drug companies generally agree to stop
making the claims to which the agency objects. In rare cases, the
government has required corrective advertising, to offset what
officials saw as inaccurate information in prior advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical comment, Daniel J. Watts, a spokesman for Pharmacia
&AMP; Upjohn, cited for improper advertising in the last year, of
contraceptive drugs and those to treat male impotence, said, ``We
were not in total agreement with everything the FDA said, but we
complied with what the agency wanted us to do.'' He defended
advertising aimed at consumers, saying, ``That's how people find
out about new therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   Though companies dislike being cited for violations, they
applaud the FDA when it accuses their competitors of similar
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules say drug companies must submit their
advertisements to the FDA ``at the time of initial dissemination''
or publication. The agency generally does not have the power to
review commercials before they run.
</P>
<P>
   But an exhaustive review of more than 100 agency letters
asserting violations of federal drug-advertising standards shows
that, in practice, the agency often operates as an editor,
criticizing the text and the design of advertisements, including
details like the size of type.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, information about the risks and the benefits of
a drug must be presented in ``reasonably comparable'' ways, so
there is a fair balance. But advertisements, especially television
commercials, often fail this test, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   Premarin, for example, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to
treat symptoms of menopause and osteoporosis, is one of the most
frequently prescribed drugs in the United States. The FDA said that
in a television commercial for Premarin, ``multiple distracting
visual images and activity occur during the audio presentation of
the risk information,'' but the drug's benefits are described
clearly and cogently, against a visual background without any
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The government told Wyeth-Ayerst to withdraw this and certain
other advertisements because, it said, they made ``broad and
ambiguous health claims for Premarin,'' promising benefits that had
``yet to be substantiated or even identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey A. Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst, said the
company had complied with the agency's request to stop running the
advertisements. In the future, she said, the company will submit
any television commercials that mention Premarin or other drugs by
name, so they can be reviewed by the government before they are
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the government said, information about the risks of
Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, was jumbled in the audio
and visual parts of a television commercial. The multiple messages
``virtually insure that consumers will have trouble fully
comprehending any of the information,'' the FDA said in a letter to
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kamp, senior vice president of the American Association
of Advertising Agencies, said that prescription drug companies
spent $1.3 billion on print and broadcast advertising aimed at
consumers last year, up from $843 million in 1997 and $595 million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said that drug companies did not want to get into fights with
the FDA over advertising because they feared that the agency might
retaliate by delaying the approval of their applications for the
marketing of other drugs. Federal officials said such fears were
baseless, but Kamp said the perception was nevertheless widespread
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government said recently that Novartis Pharmaceuticals had
disseminated ``false, misleading, unbalanced and incomplete
information to consumers'' in a television commercial for Lescol, a
cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said the advertisement overstated the drug's benefits,
failed to acknowledge that it could cause liver problems and misled
consumers by suggesting that it cost less than other
cholesterol-lowering medicines, when in fact ``Lescol may cost
more.'' The agency ordered Novartis to run corrective
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Anna M. Frable, a spokeswoman for Novartis, said the company had
submitted an ``action plan'' as the agency requested. ``When we
developed the broadcast ad,'' she said, ``we felt it was fair and
responsible. But after hearing the FDA's thoughts, we agree there
were some areas where we could have provided more information.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FDA Comissioner David Kessler, now dean of the Yale
University School of Medicine, said: ``Once a new drug has been
approved, a company is under intense pressure to promote it as
vigorously as possible. There's a risk that patients who don't need
it will be exposed to a powerful pharmacological agent and harmed
by it. That's why the role of the FDA is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has also found problems with advertising for
several other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA objected to an advertisement promoting Caverject as an
alternative to Viagra pills for the treatment of male impotence.
The advertisement in Parade magazine last November said,
``Caverject can help you and your partner enjoy renewed spontaneity
and sexual satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the manufacturer, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, had
omitted an important fact, that ``Caverject is a prescription
medication that must be injected via a needle that is inserted
directly into the penis.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company had misled
consumers by using female athletes _ a swimmer and a tennis player
_ in advertisements promoting the use of Pravachol to reduce the
risk of heart attack. The FDA said the message was misleading
because women were not included in the clinical study that showed
Pravachol's value for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, said the
commercials were no longer running.
nn
</P>
<P>
   The government said Merck &AMP; Co. had overstated the effectiveness
of its drug Propecia by suggesting that it was guaranteed to
prevent hair loss in men. An advertisement for the drug in Time
magazine last year showed a man looking anxiously into a mirror.
``Starting today,'' it said, ``you need not face the fear of more
hair loss.'' The government said that was misleading because, while
Propecia could slow hair loss, it did not necessarily stop the
process or prevent hair from falling out.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA found that a recent advertisement in Time magazine for
Valtrex, a herpes drug made by Glaxo Wellcome, was ``false or
misleading and lacking in fair balance,'' in violation of federal
law and regulations. The advertisement failed to mention common
side effects of the drug and used small type to inform consumers
that ``there is no cure for genital herpes,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie A. Dean, a spokeswoman for Glaxo Wellcome, said the
company had stopped running the advertisement, because it was no
longer needed for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also accused the manufacturers of three
competing allergy drugs of making unsubstantiated claims of
superiority for their antihistamines. The drugs are Allegra, made
by Hoechst Marion Roussel; Claritin, made by Schering-Plough Corp.,
and Zyrtec, made by Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA reprimanded Hoechst and Pfizer for suggesting that their
products were more effective than Claritin. But it also reprimanded
Schering for suggesting that Claritin was more effective than
Zyrtec.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency has complained about materials used by
Schering to promote Nasonex nasal spray. The government said the
company selectively presented favorable data to suggest that
Nasonex was better than Flonase, sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   William J. O'Donnell, a spokesman for Schering, said the company
had worked with the FDA to resolve its concerns, but he refused to
give details.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most expensive warplane ever built, the $2
billion B-2 stealth bomber, made its combat debut against
Yugoslavia last week after more than a decade of controversy over
its costs and abilities. But the truly remarkable aircraft taking
part in NATO's strikes was not the newest but the oldest: the B-52.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the long, lumbering B-52H Stratofortress bombers have
been pounding targets across Yugoslavia from a base in England.
Three months ago, B-52s hammered Iraq from the Indian Ocean. During
the Persian Gulf war in 1991, B-52s dropped a third of the total
tonnage of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the
production line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force,
old and slow, but still able to deliver a punch. And incredibly,
the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not expected to retire
until 2044. Those that make it that long will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the bomber's longevity has been its ability to adapt.
The first of them, known as B-52Bs, entered service in 1955. Their
original mission was to fly high enough to avoid Soviet air
defenses as they waged nuclear war. When the Soviets built missiles
that could shoot them down, later models were adapted to fly low
instead.

   The latest and last model _ the B-52H _ has undergone constant
remodeling since being built between 1960 and 1962. These B-52s

<P>
   Today's B-52s are outfitted with as many as 20 air-launched

   That limited role has led some to question the Air Force's plans

can essentially keep it a couple hundred miles out of harm's way,''
said Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``It's a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a day of outrageously expensive projects, B-52s have a
tremendous advantage. Built for only $74 million apiece, they are a
bargain.

   WASHINGTON _ The most expensive warplane ever built, the $2
billion B-2 stealth bomber, made its combat debut against
Yugoslavia last week after more than a decade of controversy over
its costs and abilities. But the truly remarkable aircraft taking
part in NATO's strikes was not the newest but the oldest: the B-52.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the long, lumbering B-52H Stratofortress bombers have
been pounding targets across Yugoslavia from a base in England.
Three months ago, B-52s hammered Iraq from the Indian Ocean. During
the Persian Gulf war in 1991, B-52s dropped a third of the total
tonnage of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the
production line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force,
old and slow, but still able to deliver a punch. And incredibly,
the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not expected to retire
until 2044. Those that make it that long will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the bomber's longevity has been its ability to adapt.
The first of them, known as B-52Bs, entered service in 1955. Their
original mission was to fly high enough to avoid Soviet air
defenses as they waged nuclear war. When the Soviets built missiles
that could shoot them down, later models were adapted to fly low
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and last model _ the B-52H _ has undergone constant
remodeling since being built between 1960 and 1962. These B-52s
have new engines, new avionics, new electronics and, most
important, new weapons. Imagine having a '57 Chevy with all the
latest automotive innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's B-52s are outfitted with as many as 20 air-launched
cruise missiles, each weighing a ton. These missiles _ used in last
week's raids _ allow the bombers to attack far from their targets.
</P>
<P>
   That limited role has led some to question the Air Force's plans
to rely on them for another four decades. ``It only works if you
can essentially keep it a couple hundred miles out of harm's way,''
said Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``It's a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a day of outrageously expensive projects, B-52s have a
tremendous advantage. Built for only $74 million apiece, they are a

COMMENTARY: GOING TO EXTREMES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was nothing symbolic about the arrest of
Rebecca Scanlon last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon is no criminal. She's a solid citizen and a hard
worker. She and a partner are opening a restaurant across the
street from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. For the past few years
they owned a restaurant, the New City Cafe, that was rated at times
by Zagat as one of the top 50 in the city. She is 32 years old and
the mother of a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   But New York is taking on the sinister coloration of a police
state, and in that environment almost anyone can be taken off the
street and thrown into the terrifying confines of ``the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon, driving her 1987 Subaru, was caught Tuesday morning
in one of the many sweeps and roadblocks being conducted by the
police around the city. This was a ``safety sweep'' at the
intersection of Classon Avenue and Fulton Street. Ms. Scanlon said
she saw about eight officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to write me up because I didn't have my seat
belt on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was on her way to pick up her partner and then meet
a construction crew at the site of the new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was late for an appointment,'' she said. ``This
has happened to me at least three other times. It usually takes 15
to 45 minutes. It's not pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was told the officers would let her go as soon as
they could. Her license and registration were checked and then an
officer walked back to the car and told her to step out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they said to me was, `Get out of the car, you're under
arrest.' And then they put me in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was upset and embarrassed. An officer patted her
down and asked if she was carrying any needles or other sharp
objects. ``People were gathering and watching, wondering what I had
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that it is widely believed that if a young white woman
is in the custody of the police in a predominantly black
neighborhood, she must have been trying to score drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Scanlon was taken away in handcuffs because she had
forgotten to pay a ticket for driving with a broken taillight.
That's it. A computer check showed that her license had been
suspended. Later it would be confirmed that Ms. Scanlon had never
been notified of the suspension. She was no intentional scofflaw.
When she moved recently she notified both the Department of Motor
Vehicles and the Post Office of her new address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just forgot to pay it,'' she said. ``Usually if your license
is in jeopardy you get some kind of notification.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of town we've become. The voters put an
ambitious zealot of a prosecutor in charge and now everybody's a
suspect. All sense of proportion has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Roane had a chilling story in Friday's Times about the way
the police have treated students and teachers at Rice High,
Harlem's only Roman Catholic high school. Roane wrote:
``Administrators said that Brother Tyrone Davis, who teaches
business law at the school and is the executive director of the
Archdiocese's office of black ministry, has grown so tired of being
stopped by the police that he now rarely leaves work without
donning his religious collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was fingerprinted and locked up at the 88th Precinct
stationhouse. She shared a small cell with another woman, a mother
of three, who was also arrested for a traffic violation. All of
Brooklyn breathed a sigh of relief to hear that these two had been
taken off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cops at the precinct told Ms. Scanlon she was going to be ``put
through the system,'' which meant she would be shackled and sent to
Central Booking with the real bad actors who had been arrested and
she probably would be jailed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Scanlon was not without resources. Her father is John
Scanlon, a prominent public relations man. He immediately got her a
lawyer, Matthew Dunson, and began calling friends and associates to
see if they could help get his daughter out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Several people called the precinct captain, James Guida,
including, according to Ms. Scanlon, a retired New York police
captain. It worked. Ms. Scanlon and her cellmate were finally
released about 7:30 p.m. after being locked up nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was kind of sick,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: BROKEN BONES

<TEXT>
<P>
   My father shot a man to death once.
</P>
<P>
   He and another police detective were sitting in the dark in the
middle of the night, staking out a drugstore in downtown
Washington. They had been tipped off that there was going to be a
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   When the two policemen surprised the thief, he pulled a gun and
shot at them. My father shot back, aiming to wound but killing
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Like many tough Irish guys, my father scoffed at psychiatrists.
But he saw one then. It was hard for him to believe he'd taken a
life, even though he was in a life-and-death business. He spent
three months at home. He couldn't sleep. He had trouble swallowing.
``I feel,'' he told my mother, ``like my throat is full of broken
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter, I always avoided police brutality stories. It was
not that I did not believe that police could abuse power in
sinister ways. It was just that I preferred not to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Giuliani is forcing me to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Police Headquarters last week to see the
demonstrations for justice in the death of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed African immigrant who was ripped apart by a sheet of
bullets after four police officers mistakenly thought the peddler
with the broken English and a stutter might possibly maybe resemble
a rapist they were looking for, and might possibly maybe be
reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo demonstrations grew after Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, whose force is facing cascading investigations, took a
junket to the Oscars on a Revlon plane. They grew even after it was
reported Thursday that the four officers had been indicted by a
Bronx grand jury on second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to poke fun at the radical chic air of the
demonstrations. The arrests, with veteran activists walking
jauntily in to be booked by elaborately polite officers, could have
been scripted by Tom Wolfe. Wednesday was Rabbi and Labor day.
Thursday was Susan Sarandon day. Friday was Jesse Jackson day.
</P>
<P>
   People mingled in front of the State Supreme Court Building as
if they were at a cocktail party in a New Yorker cartoon. ``Hi, are
you getting arrested?'' a woman asked a man.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a clipboard organized protesters from the City
University of New York. ``Is there anyone who hasn't been arrested
before?'' she called out chirpily.
</P>
<P>
   Young women, with the brio of Lakers cheerleaders, sang out,
``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Giuliani's got to go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gottfried, a Democratic state assemblyman from the Upper
West Side, boasted to Pete Grannis, a Democratic assemblyman from
the Upper East Side, ``My previous arrests were South Africa and
Soviet Jewry.'' Grannis tried to top him, murmuring that he'd been
``in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Al Sharpton, who organized the protests with
all those bobbing signs depicting the mayor with a little Hitler
mustache. It is so easy to dismiss the man who, in Tawana Brawley,
perpetrated one of the most damaging frauds in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the protests smacked of radical chic, and just
because the protesters didn't seem to have a precise goal in mind,
doesn't mean they were not important and right.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those moments where you see the ugly worms crawling
under the gleaming rock. It is a moment for white, middle-class New
Yorkers to acknowledge that those who are not white or well off are
paying too high a price for the safer, shinier city that Giuliani
has given us.
</P>
<P>
   When something disgraceful happened to an innocent man, the
mayor's reaction was grudging, defensive and totally lacking in
human kindness. Instead of standing tall for the police, he should
have gotten on his knees and begged forgiveness from the Diallo
family.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the mayor to acknowledge that sometimes there is
something even more important than how the police are feeling. He
has finally said the right things in this case. But it is time for
him to stop bristling and denying at every criticism, to see he has
more than a P.R. problem when nearly all the major black officials
in the city, and many white leaders, are willing to get arrested to
protest his Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The only question about Rudolph Giuliani right now is whether he
can transcend himself, whether he feels broken bones in his throat.

TRACING THE PATH TO CONFLICT: THE EVOLUTION OF MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (See also: KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-FORCE, KOSOVO-BELGRADE,
KOSOVO-RUSSIA, KOSOVO-CLINTON, KOSOVO-TURKEY)

 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Slobodan Milosevic things have come full circle, returning
to Kosovo, where almost 12 years ago, with one short phrase, he
transformed himself from a colorless Communist hack into a
firebrand of Serbian nationalism and set Yugoslavia on a course of
conflict, fragmentation and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely can a historical turning point be established quite so
precisely as the one that occurred on April 24, 1987, when
Milosevic, a veteran apparatchik best known for his organizational
skills, faced a crowd of enraged Serbs in a suburb of Pristina. As
they complained of being pushed back by police wielding batons, he
told them: ``No one will dare to beat you again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had gathered as in earlier protests to demand that
Kosovo's constitutional guarantees of autonomy be curbed, thus
reducing the political power of the ethnic Albanians who then
outnumbered the province's Serbs by 4 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who at the time was the recently appointed leader of
the Belgrade City League of Communists, had been sent to Pristina
to calm the protests. The man who sent him, Ivan Stambolic, who was
the undisputed Communist leader of Serbia, was also Milosevic's
best friend.
</P>
<P>
   They had met as first-year law students and for 25 years
Milosevic had ridden Stambolic's coattails, rising to become an
executive of a gas company and then a bank. When Stambolic took
over Serbia's League of Communists, he named Milosevic to the
leadership of the party's organization in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's assignment in Pristina was to paper over a growing
but local conflict. At the time, the last leader of Yugoslavia,
Tito, had been dead for seven years, but a key precept of Titoism
that remained in force _ ``brotherhood and unity'' _ forbade public
discussion of inter-ethnic tensions. Debate of nationality issues
was to be confined only to the highest and most trusted of party
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   So when Milosevic interrupted his meeting with Kosovo party
officials, most of whom were ethnic Albanians, and descended to
shout to the Serbs protesting outside the building that no one
would ever be allowed to beat them again, the impact was profound,
immediate and startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slobo, Slobo,'' the crowd began chanting. Television cameras
captured the image of the politician with his trademark hedgehog
hairstyle, as he identified with Serb national sentiments against
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, violating the longstanding taboo by
which Tito and his successors had kept the lid on Yugoslavia's
welter of ethnic and nationalistic rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his Belgrade party position, he developed close
ties to managers of national television, and for a long time the
clip was replayed so widely, the words became a catch phrase. Serbs
in all parts of Yugoslavia took it up as a rallying cry, though for
members of old Yugoslavia's other nationalities, it was a
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's nationalistic outburst was not entirely spontaneous.
He had made sure Belgrade television cameras would be in position
to film it, and he had held talks with local Serbs several days
before. But even he appeared surprised by the intensity of the
response.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the question of Milosevic's motivations have been
much debated in Yugoslavia. Aleksa Djilas, the Belgrade-based
historian and the son of the late Milovan Djilas, who was the most
famous dissident of the Titoist period, has written critically
about Milosevic, but contends that the Serbian leader was genuinely
driven by Serbian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, noting that Milosevic had kept such passions to
himself for his first 25 years of political life, generally portray
him as a Machiavellian cynic who simply reached out to grasp the
overhanging branch of nationalism as the raft of communism he had
been riding was about to be swept over the cataract.
</P>
<P>
   Stambolic would later recall that when his protege returned from
Pristina ``he was transformed, set afire by Kosovo.'' Stambolic had
been shocked and disappointed by what Milosevic had done there, but
he was slow to realize that by seizing the Serbian nationalist
agenda, Milosevic was embarking on a campaign to wrest leadership
of the Serbian party from his oldest and closest friend.
</P>
<P>
   Far from transcending nationalism, as Communism had taught, he
was embracing it, linking his destiny to the yearnings of the Serbs
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer of 1987, Milosevic gained backers in a
succession of closed-door party meetings as allies in television
and in key newspapers tailored their coverage to his advantage.
With police help, demonstrators were marshaled and strategically
sent to chant ``Slobo, Slobo.''
</P>
<P>
   He was emerging from the apparatchik's bland cocoon and was
acquiring charisma. With official help, as well as spontaneity,
Milosevic cults were forming, intoning jingles and songs, among
them one that played on his first name, which incorporates the
Slavic stem for freedom:
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan, they call you freedom,
</P>
<P>
   You are loved by big and small,
</P>
<P>
   So long as Slobo walks the land,
</P>
<P>
   People will not be enslaved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newspaper articles attacking the men Milosevic had so
suddenly turned against were several written under pseudonyms by
his wife, Mirjana Markovic, a professor of Marxist sociology at the
University of Belgrade who was more of an ideological purist than
he.
</P>
<P>
   They had met in high school in Pozarevac, a provincial town of
some 20,000 where Milosevic was born in 1941. Milosevic's father
had hoped to become a Serbian Orthodox priest but never completed
his seminary work, and earned his living as a teacher of Russian
and Serbo-Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   While Slobodan and his older brother, Borislav, now Ambassador
to Moscow, were in grade school, their father left for his native
Montenegro. The boys then were raised by their mother, who was also
a teacher, and a dedicated Communist activist.

UNDATED: Communist activist.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a youth, Milosevic was a pudgy loner with few friends. He
shunned sports and wrote poetry. Today, he often is described in
Serbian profiles as being reclusive and moody, still with few
friends, though in public appearances and during interviews he can
be as effusive and gladhanding as a door-to-door salesman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 while he was in college, his father committed suicide.
His mother killed herself 11 years later. An uncle, his mother's
brother, who had been a general, also took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markovic was similarly steeped in a sense of family tragedy.
When she was an infant, her mother, a member of Tito's partisan
resistance during the war, was captured and tortured by the
Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   After her mother's release, she was killed by partisans who
believed she had given up her comrades under interrogation. Ms.
Markovic has spent much time trying to clear her mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Ms. Markovic's father became a member of the
Communist political elite and left his daughter in the care of her
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   She has long been her husband's close political partner, and she
mobilized support for him at the Central Committee meeting in
September 1987, where by pushing the nationalist themes he raised
in Pristina he virtually drove his mentor, Stambolic, from Serbia's
top party post.
</P>
<P>
   Ruefully, Stambolic would later observe: ``When somebody looks
at your back for 25 years, it is understandable that he gets the
desire to put a knife in it at some point. Many people warned me
but I did not acknowledge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stambolic may have been the first major figure to have been
betrayed by Milosevic, but he was hardly the last.
</P>
<P>
   The list of allies he jettisoned during the last 12 years is
quite long, including men like Dobrica Cosic, the Serbian
nationalist novelist whom he chose to serve as president, and Milan
Panic, the pharmaceutical magnate from California who was lured to
be prime minister for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Among those discarded have been politicians from left and right
and military leaders inside and outside Serbia who had at various
times rallied to Milosevic's failed but alluring call for a Greater
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   As for betraying his word, he has consistently perplexed and
infuriated scores of negotiators from dozens of countries and
international organizations, by reversing himself, stalling,
denying evidence, and steadfastly clinging to absurd explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Zimmermann, the last American ambassador to the former
Yugoslavia, has called him ``the slickest con man in the Balkans.''
Less diplomatically, the British writer J.F. Brown described him as
``a consummate politician and a pathological liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Such characterizations came long after he rose to and
consolidated power over Serbia by focusing on Kosovo. Aleksa
Djilas, the historian, observed that because of his emphasis on the
Serbs of Kosovo and by extension on all ethnic Serbs, ``by mid-1988
Slobodan Milosevic enjoyed a popularity greater than any Serbian
political figure in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, the ethnic Albanian party leaders of Kosovo were
arrested at his behest and a new constitution was announced for the
province, stripping it of its autonomy. During two days of
protests, 22 ethnic Albanians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Then three months later, on June 28, Milosevic celebrated his
gains and proclaimed his nationalist visions when he traveled to
the ancient Kosovo battlefield of Gazimestan, where on that day in
1389, Serbian epics say, Turkish troops overwhelmed Serbian
fighters to usher in 500 years of Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
   With tens of thousands cheering him, Milosevic linked the
glorious past to the present, saying, ``Six centuries later, again
we are in battles and quarrels. They are not armed battles, though
such things should not be excluded yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the loss of autonomy by Kosovo and another less incendiary
autonomous province called Vojvodina, Serbia picked up two
additional votes in the complex federal structures of Yugoslavia,
meaning that it grew more powerful than its partners in the union.
</P>
<P>
   Already chafing under Milosevic's promotion of Serbian
nationalism, the other republics began to break away, beginning
with Slovenia in 1991. Only Montenegro was to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The dismemberment was accompanied by wars that successively
pitted Serbs and Serbia against Slovenes, Croats, and Bosnian
Muslims, and streams of refugees became a common phenomenon as
tactics of ``ethnic cleansing'' proliferated. As other fronts
opened, Milosevic's attention, and that of the world, was diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years have passed, and most of the dreams of Serbian
nationalism that were set in motion when Milosevic spoke up for a
small group of Serbian demonstrators have failed terribly.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing desires of establishing enclaves of ethnic Serbs out
of the territories of Croatia and Bosnia have not succeeded.
Serbian hopes of linking such areas to Serbia proper have also
proved impossible, at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Slobodan Milosevic is confronted by the might of NATO,
he is back where his career, his politics and the wars of the
Yugoslav succession began.

GOOD FRIENDS JOIN ENEMIES TO CRITICIZE U.S. ON RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States, which regards itself as a bastion of
human rights, found itself under attack from friend and foe alike
during the first week of the U.N. annual meeting on global
democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest blow came from America's ally, Germany, whose
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, announced that the 15-member
European Union for the first time would submit an
anti-death-penalty resolution to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He told delegates from the 53 member countries that the
resolution was intended to prevent ``the execution of minors, of
the mentally ill, enforcement before completion of ongoing
procedures, and extradition to countries where the death penalty is
in force.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer did not single out the United States by name, but
Germany protested when Arizona executed two German-born men earlier
this year, despite German government protests that the executions
were ``barbarism.''
</P>
<P>
   America's rights record was excoriated by longtime rivals like
Cuba, but it also came under criticism from friendly countries and
from Amnesty International, a leading crusader against human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   On the commission's opening day, Amnesty International for the
first time placed the United States on its list of human rights
violators, in the company of Algeria, Cambodia and Turkey, among
others, because of police brutality, violations against people in
detention and increased numbers of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Amnesty International, which is based in London,
targets a half-dozen nations as the worst violators of human rights
and lobbies to see that the U.N. body censures them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights violations in the United States are persistent,
widespread and appear to disproportionately affect people of racial
or ethnic minority backgrounds,'' said Pierre Sane, the group's
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that despite its ``claim to international
leadership,'' the United States' position as a champion of human
rights had been tarnished by its violations.
</P>
<P>
   Police brutality and poor treatment of those in detention are
widespread in America, he said. He also accused American officials
of detaining those seeking asylum from political persecution in
other countries without judicial review and sometimes in the same
lockups as criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rubin, head of the American delegation, disagreed
``strongly that civil and human rights violations in the United
States are persistent, widespread or indeed that they go
unpunished.'' There are already ``mechanisms in place'' to
safeguard citizens' rights, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, the average time on death row is 11
years,'' said one American official, who refused to be identified.
``The average time after a death sentence is given in China is 30
minutes, but it is not on Amnesty's list this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, Amnesty International has placed China high
on its list of violators, but it was listed as a second priority
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sane, from Senegal, said Amnesty International would support a
resolution that will urge a moratorium on executions, with the goal
of abolishing the death penalty. To do otherwise, he said, would
jeopardize the group's credibility because of the increased numbers
of people being executed in the United States, and because of the
3,500 people currently on death row.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has executed 380 people since 1990, with 78
put to death last year. Currently, 38 states have the death
penalty. Around the world, about 90 countries still reserve the
right to use capital punishment, while 105 nations have renounced
it, including Canada, Bulgaria and Lithuania in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most European countries either bar the death penalty or have
placed a moratorium on its use.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the resolution would be the rights commission's
third endorsing a global moratorium on executions. The campaign
against the death penalty has been led by Italy, and picked up
speed in Europe after the British government, under Tony Blair,
placed a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   A number of European countries, including Norway, Finland and
Italy, used their opening statements last week to emphasize
opposition to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Finland's Foreign Minister, Tarja Halonen, denounced it as ``an
inhuman form of punishment.'' She did not name the United States
but said that capital punishment should never be used in the ``case
of minors,'' one of the key complaints against the United States,
where people are held accountable for crimes committed before they
turned 18.

 BELGRADE SHAKEN   BY INTENSIFYING NATO AIR RAIDS

<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ As the price of gasoline rose more than seven
times and a prominent Serbian journalist was arrested Saturday for
offending new censorship rules, the citizens of Belgrade appeared
considerably shaken after the heaviest night of NATO bombing in and
around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, residents said in interviews, large
explosions hit in Belgrade before air raid sirens sounded, giving
credence to NATO assertions that Yugoslavia's integrated air
defense system has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   This correspondent, ordered to depart Serbia on Thursday and
refused re-entry at the border with Croatia on Friday, was allowed
to re-enter the country early Saturday morning from the Hungarian
border with the help of the federal information minister, Deputy
Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic. Draskovic, a relatively liberal
nationalist, has been trying to reverse the deportation order for
NATO-country journalists, originally issued by the Serbian
information minister, Aleksandr Vucic.
</P>
<P>
   All of Serbia's television channels broadcast news coverage
Saturday of NATO attacks and of protests against them in Greece and
Russia. Reports that at least four NATO jets were downed were later
denied by NATO, but the denials were not shown on television here.
</P>
<P>
   After a steady diet of patriotic films, however, all seven
channels also showed the film ``Wag the Dog'' numerous times
Saturday, following the example of Iraqi television during the
early days of American air strikes last December.
</P>
<P>
   But there was very little information on events in Kosovo, and
no way for ordinary citizens to hear Western charges of a
full-scale offensive by Serb forces against ethnic Albanians there
and allegations that large numbers of civilian men are being
rounded up and killed by Serb Interior Ministry soldiers and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it possible for Western correspondents, expelled from
Kosovo and with many police checkpoints and roadblocks, to easily
judge the situation there. Attempts to telephone Pristina were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
stripped away Kosovo's autonomy, causing large celebrations in
Belgrade and protests by ethnic Albanians, more than 20 of whom
were killed by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   None of a dozen people interviewed had seen or heard statements
taped by President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and transmitted to Serbia by the American government.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship has been strict here under the rules laid down by
Vucic, the Serbian information minister, who is a member of the
strongly nationalist Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj. NATO is
normally referred to as ``criminal'' and Clinton and Albright are
labeled ``killers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reliable Serbs, a prominent Serb journalist,
Dragoslav Rancic, a senior contributing editor of the weekly Nin
magazine, was arrested Saturday for an article considered to have
broken censorship rules.
</P>
<P>
   Editors were informed that they must provide a first edition of
newspapers to Vucic's ministry every night for approval. Most
newspapers either do not appear or are in smaller, cheaper
editions. Glas Javnosti, for instance, dropped its price in half.
The only newspaper to appear in its usual size is the
government-run Politika.
</P>
<P>
   Even on another bright and sunny day, the streets were much
emptier than normal for a Saturday, both of cars and people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted with tension and little sleep because of
the nightly bombings and the need to tramp down to the shelters,''
said Vesna Prlja, who runs a tourist agency with ``not so many
tourists these days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, for the first time, everyone in Belgrade felt the
real impact of the war. Everyone could see the big explosions in
the central city and the suburbs.'' Ms. Prlja said. ``People use
the mornings to try to get some sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline and diesel fuel are being rationed, with many stations
closed, and the price of gasoline has risen to about 5 deutschmarks
a liter, or more than $10 a gallon, while the value of the Yugoslav
dinar fell Saturday to about 10.2 to the deutschmark on the black
market. A liter of gas that cost about 7 dinars a week ago cost
about 55 dinars on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of imported items like coffee also increased, but
there were plentiful stocks of cooking oil, bread and other food
products.
</P>
<P>
   At a Saturday party in a central Belgrade apartment, Dejan, a
29-year-old medical student, said that what frightened him the most
was mobilization. He said he was ``sent an invitation to join the
army reserve,'' but has not been living at home so the invitation
could be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Bojan, 26, a veterinary student, said he slept in different
apartments every other night to avoid mobilization. He also liked
spending time in different air raid shelters, because ``you meet a
different class of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan complained jocularly that ``NATO only seems to bomb when
we sit down to lunch or dinner'' and complained that an air raid
siren was only 50 yards from his apartment. But he said he spent
time every day telephoning friends abroad to find out more
information about events than he can get here.
</P>
<P>
   Zaklina, a 31-year-old gynecologist, said she found herself
``calmer than in peacetime.'' But life is boring with all the
alerts, she said, ``and young children and kids have a lot of
traumas, cause they move them to shelters.'' She said the Americans
were ``completely crazy _ this is Europe and not Iraq and they
shouldn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
that life in her building's shelter was now well organized, with
cots assembled, men's and women's toilets arranged, a small
generator installed and a ham radio operator entertaining the
almost 100 people who gathered there.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio operators exchanged a lot of information, but were not
careful, she said. When one operator asked: ``Is there any
indication of a nuclear attack?'' another broke in to say: ``For
God's sake, watch what you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   When a bomb hit a missile factory or fuel depot on the edge of
Belgrade Friday night, causing a large, visible fire, television
announced that the acrid fumes released form the fuel were not
toxic, but cautioned residents to shut their windows. In the
shelter, originally built for nuclear attack, cries went up to shut
the two heavy steel doors, while others complained that then it
would be impossible to leave the shelter to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a doctor came on television to tell people that feeling
sick to the stomach was a common reaction to anxiety, and was not
necessarily a reaction to the chemical fumes. If eyes began to
burn, however, he said, he instructed people how to bathe their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There were renewed attacks on a large base 10 miles northwest of
Belgrade at Batajnica. During a drive past the base Saturday, two
MiG-29s, perhaps decoys, were visible by the side of the road, as
were military communication trucks and mobile radars. Traffic was
diverted from the highway, raising speculation that the road might
be used for takeoffs and landings.

   When the January issue of Glamour magazine reached its 2.2
million readers, some may have been surprised to find this line
blaring from the cover: ``New for '99: You asked for it!
Horoscopes. Psychic details you need for your love, lust and work
life. Big Decisions!''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine _ once an influential voice in the feminist
movement because its gospel of modulated assertiveness appealed to
a large audience that was put off by the stridency of Ms. magazine
_ had dumped its ``Women in Washington'' column, which covered
political activity concerning women's issues. It had added
astrology.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour commonly ran articles like ``Let's Stop Lying About Day
Care'' and ``Excuse Me, Are Women Equal Yet? 18 Reasons Why We
Still Need Affirmative Action.'' Recently it featured an editorial
on e-mail privacy titled ``Why We Should All Get Down on Our Knees
and Thank Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the sexual advice, a staple of women's magazines since the
heyday of Helen Gurley Brown at Cosmopolitan, has changed _ from
instruction on maximizing female or mutual pleasure, to guidance on
pleasing men.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Glamour, echoed in other women's magazines, is
part of a larger retreat _ not a backlash of men against women but
of women against feminism _ that vexes feminist theorists and
cheers conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of the articles they choose to publish, youthful
women's magazines like Cosmopolitan, Glamour and Marie Claire seem
to argue that their reader doesn't want or need feminism; that she
doesn't care much about Washington or affirmative action, and that
she isn't terribly angry about being cheated out of day care.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of its March cover, Cosmopolitan features ``His
G-Spot.'' On its February cover: ``Be the best sex of his life.''
And this one: ``He Needs His Space? Why Guys in Love Say Scary
Things.'' (It would seem logical to think that the guy in question
is probably not in love if he needs his space, but in the world of
women's magazines, determination _ and learning about those G-spots
_ always wins out.) From January's Cosmopolitan: ``10
Make-Him-Throb Moves So Hot You'll Need a Firehose to Cool Down the
Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Good Housekeeping features Maria Shriver on its current cover
promising that she will discuss ``Why forgiveness matters so much
in her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Claire, which began publishing in 1996 with a modified
feminist tone and regular features on women's issues, now runs
articles like these: ``How Do Men See You?'' (September 1998);
``Sex Appeal: Do You Know Who He Finds Attractive?'' (December
1998); ``Men, Sex and You'' and ``What Men Think About Your Look''
(the current issue). One headline announces, ``Get a Better Body _
for Sex.'' Tellingly, Marie Claire is one of the great circulation
successes of the women's magazine categories, shooting up from
400,000 in 1996 to more than twice that now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that American women seem to be buying these magazines
in increasing numbers points to an unsteady postfeminist
convergence in American attitudes toward feminism. The convergence
brings together magazine editors _ mostly liberal-leaning women who
consider themselves feminists _ and anti-feminists like the authors
of two recent books that argue that feminism has made women
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the books, ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost
Virtue'' (Free Press), which was widely praised by conservatives,
the 23-year-old author Wendy Shalit argues that the sexual liberty
championed by the feminist movement is responsible for eating
disorders and other female troubles, and that men respect women who
won't accede to their sexual advances without putting up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the other book, ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why
Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman''(Simon &AMP; Schuster) 35-year-old
Danielle Crittenden, who studied decades of women's magazines in
preparation for her book, argues that if the truth about women can
be found in the magazines they read, feminism was a bad career
move. It taught women to expect to live freewheeling sexual lives,
which was a poor choice, she says, that has left her contemporaries
``even more miserable and insecure, more thwarted and obsessed with
men, than the most depressed, lithium-popping suburban readers of
the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The political conservatives say the path to feminine fulfillment
lies within the orderly rows of family, child-rearing and
husband-pleasing. That view is starkly different from the one that
emerges from the pages of the women's magazines, which hold up Ms.
Lewinsky as the embodiment of the modern woman _ an
independent-minded odalisque, unshackled from sexual modesty and
constantly celebrating her zaftig sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet authors like Ms. Shalit and Miss Crittenden, who attack the
gains of feminism by saying it promoted some sort of female
priapism, have become unlikely comrades-in-arms against feminism
with the magazine editors whose work they deplore. The editors
concede they are products of feminism, while the conservatives say
they are not. Yet both have dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the editors insist that feminism is alive
and well in their pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Fuller, 42, the editor in chief of Glamour, argues that
the lessons of feminism are now so densely woven into the cultural
fabric that readers don't need to revisit them, and that the
mainstream magazines no longer need to provide monthly monitoring
on the state of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for all women's magazines,'' Ms. Fuller said,
``but there are an enormous number of thought-provoking articles in
women's magazines and very much so in Glamour. We assign
investigative reporters, who do major articles on women's health
issues every single month.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, for example, there is an editorial about domestic
violence. And she pointed out that sexual advice is a product of
the women's movement. ``It would be unempowering for women not to
be able to read about sex as much as they wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gloria Steinem, the editor of Ms. and arguably the last
reigning symbol of 1970s feminism, said she has been observing what
she considers to be a decade-long anti-feminist shift in women's
magazines away from coverage of women's issues and politics, and
even high-quality fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers in women's magazines have more influence than
ever, and don't want their ads to appear next to anything but
stories about celebrity and sex,'' she said. (Ms., which Ms.
Steinem reintroduces this month, does not carry advertising.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steinem said such magazines offer sexual advice about
pleasing men as part of a larger movement toward making women feel
bad about themselves, and then fixing those imagined ills in the
pages of the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So reading them becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she
said.

gains of feminism by saying it promoted some sort of female
priapism, have become unlikely comrades-in-arms against feminism
with the magazine editors whose work they deplore. The editors
concede they are products of feminism, while the conservatives say
they are not. Yet both have dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the editors insist that feminism is alive
and well in their pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Fuller, 42, the editor in chief of Glamour, argues that
the lessons of feminism are now so densely woven into the cultural
fabric that readers don't need to revisit them, and that the
mainstream magazines no longer need to provide monthly monitoring
on the state of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for all women's magazines,'' Ms. Fuller said,
``but there are an enormous number of thought-provoking articles in
women's magazines and very much so in Glamour. We assign
investigative reporters, who do major articles on women's health
issues every single month.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, for example, there is an editorial about domestic
violence. And she pointed out that sexual advice is a product of
the women's movement. ``It would be unempowering for women not to
be able to read about sex as much as they wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gloria Steinem, the editor of Ms. and arguably the last
reigning symbol of 1970s feminism, said she has been observing what
she considers to be a decade-long anti-feminist shift in women's
magazines away from coverage of women's issues and politics, and
even high-quality fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers in women's magazines have more influence than
ever, and don't want their ads to appear next to anything but
stories about celebrity and sex,'' she said. (Ms., which Ms.
Steinem reintroduces this month, does not carry advertising.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steinem said such magazines offer sexual advice about
pleasing men as part of a larger movement toward making women feel
bad about themselves, and then fixing those imagined ills in the
pages of the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So reading them becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she
said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Miss Crittenden's description of these magazines is not very
different. The magazines she read from the early 1970s, she said,
``were so intelligent it breaks your heart. They were packed with
interesting things to read. It wasn't The Atlantic Monthly, but
there were serious interviews and good writing.'' She added:
``Magazines today, especially under an editor like Bonnie Fuller,
sell beauty and sex and sex and more sex. That's all there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalit argues in her book that such magazines diminish
female power by advocating sexual helplessness and round-the-clock
availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all breasts and lipstick and your performance in
bed,'' said Ms. Shalit, whose book cites articles in a half-dozen
women's magazines, including Glamour and Mademoiselle. ``There's
something so desperate about it. The thinking is that if you're not
currently in a sexual relationship, you're a real weirdo.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Crittenden said Ms. Lewinsky is ``a total product of Cosmo
and Glamour. She goes in there and does what she did and thinks
she's a liberated woman, when she is, in fact, an unpaid hooker.''
</P>
<P>
   So while conservatives may be pleased that women's magazines
have backed away from overt feminism, the Lewinsky-ization that has
replaced it is not exactly what they had in mind.

DRUG COMPANIES GET FDA REPRIMANDS FOR FALSE CLAIMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
repeating to fix slug in notes field  By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government has repeatedly reprimanded
drug companies in recent months after finding that they had made
false or misleading claims in television commercials and magazine
advertisements for a wide range of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such advertising has exploded as drug companies market their
products directly to consumers, and the government is now
scrambling to keep up with Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the Food and Drug Administration has
admonished companies about commercials advertising drugs for
allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hair loss
and sexually transmitted diseases. It has also found problems in
advertisements for birth control pills, anticancer drugs and
medicines to help people lose weight and stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the regulatory agency said, the advertisements
violated the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they
overstated the benefits of a particular drug, minimized the risks
or falsely suggested that one drug was superior to another. The
agency also found that many companies had been promoting their
drugs for uses not approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA typically demands that the use of such advertisements
``cease immediately.'' Drug companies generally agree to stop
making the claims to which the agency objects. In rare cases, the
government has required corrective advertising, to offset what
officials saw as inaccurate information in prior advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical comment, Daniel J. Watts, a spokesman for Pharmacia
&AMP; Upjohn, cited for improper advertising in the last year, of
contraceptive drugs and those to treat male impotence, said, ``We
were not in total agreement with everything the FDA said, but we
complied with what the agency wanted us to do.'' He defended
advertising aimed at consumers, saying, ``That's how people find
out about new therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   Though companies dislike being cited for violations, they
applaud the FDA when it accuses their competitors of similar
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules say drug companies must submit their
advertisements to the FDA ``at the time of initial dissemination''
or publication. The agency generally does not have the power to
review commercials before they run.
</P>
<P>
   But an exhaustive review of more than 100 agency letters
asserting violations of federal drug-advertising standards shows
that, in practice, the agency often operates as an editor,
criticizing the text and the design of advertisements, including
details like the size of type.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, information about the risks and the benefits of
a drug must be presented in ``reasonably comparable'' ways, so
there is a fair balance. But advertisements, especially television
commercials, often fail this test, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   Premarin, for example, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to
treat symptoms of menopause and osteoporosis, is one of the most
frequently prescribed drugs in the United States. The FDA said that
in a television commercial for Premarin, ``multiple distracting
visual images and activity occur during the audio presentation of
the risk information,'' but the drug's benefits are described
clearly and cogently, against a visual background without any
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The government told Wyeth-Ayerst to withdraw this and certain
other advertisements because, it said, they made ``broad and
ambiguous health claims for Premarin,'' promising benefits that had
``yet to be substantiated or even identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey A. Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst, said the
company had complied with the agency's request to stop running the
advertisements. In the future, she said, the company will submit
any television commercials that mention Premarin or other drugs by
name, so they can be reviewed by the government before they are
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the government said, information about the risks of
Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, was jumbled in the audio
and visual parts of a television commercial. The multiple messages
``virtually insure that consumers will have trouble fully
comprehending any of the information,'' the FDA said in a letter to
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kamp, senior vice president of the American Association
of Advertising Agencies, said that prescription drug companies
spent $1.3 billion on print and broadcast advertising aimed at
consumers last year, up from $843 million in 1997 and $595 million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said that drug companies did not want to get into fights with
the FDA over advertising because they feared that the agency might
retaliate by delaying the approval of their applications for the
marketing of other drugs. Federal officials said such fears were
baseless, but Kamp said the perception was nevertheless widespread
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government said recently that Novartis Pharmaceuticals had
disseminated ``false, misleading, unbalanced and incomplete
information to consumers'' in a television commercial for Lescol, a
cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said the advertisement overstated the drug's benefits,
failed to acknowledge that it could cause liver problems and misled
consumers by suggesting that it cost less than other
cholesterol-lowering medicines, when in fact ``Lescol may cost
more.'' The agency ordered Novartis to run corrective
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Anna M. Frable, a spokeswoman for Novartis, said the company had
submitted an ``action plan'' as the agency requested. ``When we
developed the broadcast ad,'' she said, ``we felt it was fair and
responsible. But after hearing the FDA's thoughts, we agree there
were some areas where we could have provided more information.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FDA Comissioner David Kessler, now dean of the Yale
University School of Medicine, said: ``Once a new drug has been
approved, a company is under intense pressure to promote it as
vigorously as possible. There's a risk that patients who don't need
it will be exposed to a powerful pharmacological agent and harmed
by it. That's why the role of the FDA is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has also found problems with advertising for
several other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA objected to an advertisement promoting Caverject as an
alternative to Viagra pills for the treatment of male impotence.
The advertisement in Parade magazine last November said,
``Caverject can help you and your partner enjoy renewed spontaneity
and sexual satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the manufacturer, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, had
omitted an important fact, that ``Caverject is a prescription
medication that must be injected via a needle that is inserted
directly into the penis.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company had misled
consumers by using female athletes _ a swimmer and a tennis player
_ in advertisements promoting the use of Pravachol to reduce the
risk of heart attack. The FDA said the message was misleading
because women were not included in the clinical study that showed
Pravachol's value for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, said the
commercials were no longer running.
nn
</P>
<P>
   The government said Merck &AMP; Co. had overstated the effectiveness
of its drug Propecia by suggesting that it was guaranteed to
prevent hair loss in men. An advertisement for the drug in Time
magazine last year showed a man looking anxiously into a mirror.
``Starting today,'' it said, ``you need not face the fear of more
hair loss.'' The government said that was misleading because, while
Propecia could slow hair loss, it did not necessarily stop the
process or prevent hair from falling out.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA found that a recent advertisement in Time magazine for
Valtrex, a herpes drug made by Glaxo Wellcome, was ``false or
misleading and lacking in fair balance,'' in violation of federal
law and regulations. The advertisement failed to mention common
side effects of the drug and used small type to inform consumers
that ``there is no cure for genital herpes,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie A. Dean, a spokeswoman for Glaxo Wellcome, said the
company had stopped running the advertisement, because it was no
longer needed for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also accused the manufacturers of three
competing allergy drugs of making unsubstantiated claims of
superiority for their antihistamines. The drugs are Allegra, made
by Hoechst Marion Roussel; Claritin, made by Schering-Plough Corp.,
and Zyrtec, made by Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA reprimanded Hoechst and Pfizer for suggesting that their
products were more effective than Claritin. But it also reprimanded
Schering for suggesting that Claritin was more effective than
Zyrtec.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency has complained about materials used by
Schering to promote Nasonex nasal spray. The government said the
company selectively presented favorable data to suggest that
Nasonex was better than Flonase, sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   William J. O'Donnell, a spokesman for Schering, said the company
had worked with the FDA to resolve its concerns, but he refused to
give details.

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON or TUZLA, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ As
more reports of heavy fighting and Serb atrocities in Kosovo
emerged Saturday, tensions continued to mount along Yugoslavia's
borders with Bosnia and other countries. NATO carried its offensive
in Yugoslavia closer to Belgrade in the heaviest of three nights of
attacks, as state-run media showed pictures of explosions and fires
in Belgrade suburbs caused by ``NATO criminals'' and claimed
civilians were killed and injured. And in an escalation of the
conflict, Yugoslav helicopters crossed into Bosnia, setting off air
raid sirens and sending people scurrying at Eagle Base, a major
U.S. military compound. (Shepard-Holmes, Cox News Service)

ill-fed and beaten, his rations and uniform stolen by officers
looking to sell them. The nation's economic crisis has reduced
soldiers to foraging for potatoes in the fields and begging for
change in subway stations. Since the economic squeeze last August,
the number of deserters and draft dodgers has doubled, according to
advocacy groups who work with disaffected soldiers. The only way to
strengthen Russia's army is to reduce its size, many officials
contend. In coming months, severe cutbacks are planned in military
spending and manpower controversial military reforms. It's an
uneasy task ahead: soothing the generals outraged by the plan,
holding off political rivals attempting to capitalize on the
dissatisfaction and convincing the public that their
morale-battered army can be improved by cutting it back. (Holmes,

 &HT;    Celtics pitiful under Pitino

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Boston, where mediocrity is welcomed as much as red
clam chowder, the Celtics are engrossed in a funk so dastardly that
the unthinkable has happened: Highly regarded coach Rick Pitino
even questioned his ability.
</P>
<P>
   If observers wondered from afar how bad things were in Beantown,
nothing could convey that better than Pitino admitting he's as much
a part of the problem as anyone else. Yeah, it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I've been given, I really believe, great treatment in
this town by the press and by the fans,'' Pitino said, ``and right
now the way the team is playing, I deserve to take a lot of heat.
That is a poor performance from a team that is supposedly
well-coached. I should take the heat, and I don't mind it one bit,
and look in the mirror and say maybe this isn't a well-coached
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Pitino is a quality coach. But his system of
pressing at all costs is flawed because it basically is an
all-or-nothing scheme. If opponents are rattled by the frenzy that
his ``white'' and ``black'' presses create, Boston forces
turnovers, scores in transition and wears down teams. However, if
foes handle the chaos with poise, crisp passing and an attack
mentality, they get open shots and layups at a rate that the
Celtics cannot withstand.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which scenario has been played out far too often for
Pitino this season? Even after a 90-84 win Friday over
Philadelphia, which was without Allen Iverson, Boston has lost 10
of its last 12 games. Worse, the Celtics have gotten blown out in
most defeats, prompting many to contend that the players have quit
on Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his reputation as the consummate program-builder and
his status as team president, it is not likely the former Kentucky
leader's job is in jeopardy. But he is far from comfortable,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to stay positive, upbeat, but I've seen the
Washington Generals play defense better,'' Pitino said of his club.
``I won't be humiliated. If (players) are humiliating the Boston
Celtics, they're not going to play anymore. Everybody is going to
think of team, winning, defense. If they don't want to think about
that, they can sit there and watch other guys do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Celtics stand for winning, tradition, teamwork.
When we do that, we can be a decent basketball team. And we'll
think of that from here on out because I broke. They broke me. It's
no more.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Celtics responded to Pitino's harsh words by
shooting 30 percent and scoring 68 points in losing by 19 at home
to the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it could get worse,'' Pitino said, ``but it
just did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston fans have shown their displeasure with boos. And the
No. 1 target has been All-Star forward Antoine Walker, who shot
1-for-14 against the Bucks. He was 2-for-15 a week ago against
Chicago, and booed after going 0-for-11 in the first half. He went
8-for-18 at Cleveland and then 1-for-14 against Minnesota, again
getting booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's right,'' Walker said of his treatment.
``We need all the support we can get. I guess they want to see good
basketball, but (booing) on every shot? Is that going to make us
play better?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. But is he making his teammates better? No, says
Chicago's Ron Harper. ``He's got to learn to play with the guys he
has out there. If he does, they have a chance to be a very good
team in a few years,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   First-year forward Paul Pierce, who started the season strongly,
has lost nearly six points off his scoring average since being
named NBA Rookie of the Month for February. But as poorly as the
Celtics have shot the ball, it's defense and effort that have
killed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way out for us,'' Pitino said, ``only one
answer: Outwork your opposition. If we have character, we'll fight
our way out and get W's.''
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Kenny Anderson: ``We've taken enough lumps and we're
going to learn from them. Either that, or all of us are going to
start looking like Elephant Man.

 &HT;    Courtside with Charles Barkley
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Age and injury have stunted Charles Barkley's ability
to dominate. But nothing can keep the Houston Rockets forward from
spouting off. And so, we give you Barkley's ``State of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Eastern Conference: ``Let me tell you something. You take
Miami and Indiana and Orlando out of the East and you might as well
blow the rest of them up. They're terrible, and there's nothing you
can tell me different. We don't even pay attention to the East.
It's a dogfight out here (in the West) every night. Am I surprised?
Yeah, I'm surprised Miami and Indiana aren't 20 games ahead of
everyone else. And Orlando started fast, but they're folding now.
So you really have only two teams over there, and that's it. Two.''
</P>
<P>
   On the development of the Rockets, who added Scottie Pippen:
``I'm a little disappointed in Scottie. He has all the money, and
now he wants all the shots, too. I'll make that switch. I'll give
him all the shots and take half of his money.''
</P>
<P>
   On Houston's recent strong play, which includes a stretch of
seven wins in eight games: ``We've got the fourth-best record in
the West, and we haven't played that long together. We're going to
be good before the end of the season. We're playing better overall,
in every area. The chemistry is better.''
</P>
<P>
   WEEPING OVER SNUB
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz, who cry more than any team in the league, whined
about being pulled by NBC from their scheduled broadcast a week
ago. The Lakers-Orlando game was aired instead. Karl Malone said:
``To me, it's all about people wanting to sell a couple more
jerseys.'' Bryon Russell added: ``They always want to talk to us,
but then they don't give us any respect. We're still a pretty good
team. But they didn't show our game just because they wanted to
show Dennis Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, it's a demand thing. With Michael Jordan retired, the
Lakers _ with Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glenn Rice
_ are the league's marquee team.
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, it pours,'' said Vancouver coach Brian Hill
when center Bryant Reeves hurt his right knee, joining Doug West,
Lee Mayberry and Rodrick Rhodes on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what's happened, but all of a sudden we
believe,'' Toronto's Vince Carter said of his team's recent
confidence and good play, including a franchise-best five-game
winning streak.

 &HT;    Defensive line a draft target
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The finish line is in sight, but the hard part is
about to begin for the Falcons' scouting and coaching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and scouts have been visiting campus sites, working out
and interviewing prospects for the April 17-18 draft. They gather
Monday to begin discussing strengths and weaknesses of the existing
roster and what's available in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start by talking defense. If we get done with defense,
we'll talk about offense,'' said coach Dan Reeves. ``Otherwise,
we'll talk about offense the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has eight draft choices, two each in the sixth and
seventh rounds. The Falcons traded away this year's second-round
pick for since-waived wide receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a second-round choice creates more pressure to pick
a winner in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This draft is not as good as last year,'' said Reed Johnson,
the Falcons' director of college scouting. ``Last year, I thought
there were 90 good players ... There's more like 60 this year that
can make the team and be a factor for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' first-round choice is 30th overall, and they don't
pick again until 92nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is best player available ... but you're always
influenced by your needs,'' Reeves said. ``I would say defensive
line and the secondary always are a premium.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's draft is deep with offensive linemen and
quarterbacks. It is shallow in defensive linemen, where the Falcons
are shallow, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other than starters Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau, the
Falcons do not have a defensive end with NFL experience. The
Falcons love Florida linebacker-defensive end Jevon Kearse (6 feet
5, 262 pounds), but he'll be an early choice. The next best
prospects at end are considered to be Ebenezer Ekuban (6-3, 266) of
North Carolina and Patrick Kerney (6-5, 262) of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like everything about (Ekuban), and then he goes to the
Senior Bowl and forgets to show up,'' Johnson said. ``You wonder:
Was the game too big for him? Did he get scared? It's like he
wasn't even there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing (about Kerney) is he's going to get bigger. He
brings it every play,'' Johnson said. ``He takes advantage of the
situation. He knew (Georgia tackle Matt) Stinchcomb was hurt in the
(Peach) Bowl, and he said, `I'm not going to dance with him; I'm
just going to run over him,' and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ends that intrigue the Falcons are Lamar King (6-3, 299)
of Saginaw Valley State and Mike Rucker (6-4, 260) of Nebraska.
Robinson's fate
</P>
<P>
   Speculation continues that Atlanta will waive free safety Eugene
Robinson, who turns 36 today. Robinson's age and high salary-cap
figure ($2.3 million), in a secondary rife with big salaries, make
his release more likely. Robinson has asked his agent, Phyllis
Freed of Canfield, Ohio, to find out what's up.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta re-signed cornerback Ronnie Bradford, 28, two weeks ago
intending to move him to free safety.Bradford's cap number of
$862,000 combined with those of cornerback Ray Buchanan ($3
million), Robinson, cornerback Michael Booker ($1.62 million) and
newly signed strong safety Marty Carter ($1.42 million) count
$9,202,500 against the cap. That's 16.1 percent of the team's $57.3
million cap alllowance.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal chronicles
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson's agent, James Sims of Oakland, has
sent the Falcons a proposal for a contract extension. Anderson, 26,
is believed to be seeking a 5- to 7-year deal worth $25 million to
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Former Giants guard Greg Bishop probably will sign a two-year,
$4 million contract Monday or Tuesday. The team has just about
$600,000 left to spend under the cap; to create room, it is
tweaking the contract of quarterback Chris Chandler. ... Offensive
tackle Jose Portilla, the only undrafted college player to make the
team last year, will sign a two-year, $562,500 contract with
incentives related to playing time. ... The team's offseason
conditioning program, four days a week of weightlifting and running
for 15 weeks, begins Monday. Strength and conditioning coach Al
Miller expects 45-50 players. ... Fullback Bob Christian, who
suffered a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament on Dec.
13, is further along in his recuperation than running back Byron
Hanspard, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament and patella
tendon in his left knee in the final preseason game. ``Christian
should be ready (for training camp) with no problem,'' trainer Ron
Medlin said. ``Byron _ it's too early to say.'' Hanspard's status
could influence draft strategy. ... The Falcons have sold more than
7,300 new season ticket packages, and more than 80 percent of last
year's 29,715 season-ticket holders have renewed contracts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last two weeks, Police Headquarters in New
York City has provided an austere backdrop for a recurring drama:
the daily noontime engagement between police officers in protective
gear and protesters decrying police misconduct and brutality. Each
session ends with the arrests of dozens of people for participating
in the time-honored act of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, prompted by the death last month of an unarmed
black man struck by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four white officers,
are meant to recall memorable moments of struggle in American
history _ from Henry David Thoreau's refusal to pay a poll tax to
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s use of nonviolent
confrontation in the fight for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   But they also reflect the cordial choreography of street theater
that has come to define many demonstrations, with protesters and
police officers acting more like co-stars than adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The daily protests, the backdrop to the four officers'
indictment for murder last week, have certainly created stirring
images for the evening news and the morning newspapers that go
beyond the novelty of showing Susan Sarandon and Ossie Davis in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, in fact, has brought portraits of dignified
nonresistance: of Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, his mouth a thin
line of determination; of former Mayor David Dinkins, his eyes
reflecting sorrow and defiance. Their faces contrasted effectively
with the masks of indifference worn by the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Not captured in those images, however, were the offstage huddles
between lawyers for the protesters and high-ranking police
officials, often to confirm ground rules established in earlier
negotiations. The police politely explained that to get arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct the demonstrators would have to block
both entrances to the building.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist arrest. At
times the organizers have even provided the police with the names
of those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and, ultimately, the release of the
conscientious scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the entente that's been worked out with the police,''
said Ronald Kuby, a lawyer with two decades of experience in civil
protest who has negotiated with the police on the parameters of the
demonstrations. ``Both sides have actually developed a relationship
where they've learned to deal with each other in a candid way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Civil disobedience in the United States has matured since the
days of Thoreau. First came the influence of Gandhi, who advocated
a more coercive, confrontational approach to nonviolence _ in
particular, the participation of large numbers of people _ to
effect change.
</P>
<P>
   Then King, among others, introduced a liberal, Christian
sensibility to protest, as well as the recognition of the power of
images. A single photograph _ of fire hoses turned on civil rights
demonstrators by Police Commissioner Eugene ``Bull'' Connor in
Birmingham, Ala. _ could immediately convey the injustice of
segregation to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   James Tracy, the author of ``Direct Action: Radical Pacifism
From the Union Eight to the Chicago Seven'' (University of Chicago
Press, 1996), said that both Gandhi and King believed in being
candid with the authorities about their plans. That commitment to
openness, he said, was so prevalent by the early 1960s that peace
campaigners intent on obstructing the progress of a nuclear
submarine plant in Connecticut even allowed agents from the FBI to
attend their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-war protests of the late 1960s brought a more
confrontational style of civil disobedience to the fore, Tracy
said, one in which surprise was essential and negotiations with the
police were rejected. Since then, he said, ``A great deal of
tension over these two methods _ openness and surprise _ has tended
to break some organizations apart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that many movements continue to adhere to
the ``surprise'' approach to disobedience _ with good reason,
according to Mark Hannay, a spokesman in New York for Act Up, an
AIDS protest group. ``Once you begin the negotiations process, all
of a sudden the power dynamic shifts so that the police try to
control and almost define what your event is going to be,'' he
said. ``All of a sudden it becomes not your event.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Allan Hoehl, a police commander for the southern half of
Manhattan, has experienced both types of protests, and he obviously
prefers cooperation. ``When we meet with demonstrators, we ask
whether there's going to be civil disobedience,'' he said. ``If we
know when and how it's going to happen, we can make sure that no
one else jumps in, that there's no interference. It can go much
more smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in cases of coordination between protesters and the
police, neither side ever drops its guard. And both take comfort in
knowing that if necessary they can make life difficult for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kuby and Michael Hardy, the two lawyers helping the
Rev. Al Sharpton to organize the recent police protests, have made
it clear that the acts of civil disobedience are being staged in
front of police headquarters for symbolic purposes. And if the
police try to stop them, they and their hundreds of followers will
gladly stroll a few hundred yards to block traffic on Broadway _
inconveniencing motorists and requiring the services of many more
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they know that such an action will come at a
cost. ``So when the demonstrators are done saying, `We'll do
this,''' Kuby explained, ``the police will say, `And when you're
done, we'll do what we want to do.''' At the very least, that can
mean dragging those arrested through a booking process that can
take 24 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   That is why negotiations beforehand have become de rigueur for
protesters and police, Tracy explained. The action that results is
respectful of the law but emphasizes the need for a higher moral
principle. It is also so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police step in and say, `Those of you with children and
strollers, step away,' '' he said. ``Then newspaper people come
around, take pictures, and it's over.''

this,''' Kuby explained, ``the police will say, `And when you're
done, we'll do what we want to do.''' At the very least, that can
mean dragging those arrested through a booking process that can
take 24 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   That is why negotiations beforehand have become de rigueur for
protesters and police, Tracy explained. The action that results is
respectful of the law but emphasizes the need for a higher moral
principle. It is also so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police step in and say, `Those of you with children and
strollers, step away,' '' he said. ``Then newspaper people come
around, take pictures, and it's over.''

   You know about the Tower of Babel, the ambitious architectural
project that the Lord foiled in Genesis by rendering its
overreaching builders unable to communicate with one another. Now
consider its modern heir: the babble about towers spouted by
architects.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Kliment, former editor of Architectural Record, says
that much of the time even he can't figure out what the heck
today's architects and other high-concept designers are talking
about. In his book ``Writing for Design Professionals'' (W.W.
Norton, 1998), he pleads for clarity in proposals, letters,
brochures and professional articles.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, every profession has its useful private shorthand, he
says, and architecture is no exception. But when you start talking
about decontextualizing your intrinsic modularity _ designer-babble
terms that Kliment says he has encountered _ you know your
profession's in trouble linguistically.
</P>
<P>
   Below are some longer passages collected by Kliment for this
article.

Entertainment? New Architecture at the Millennium'' by Bruce Thomas

</P>
<P>
   Now, as the ``simulacrum'' continues to gain currency in
architectural theory and as the map of culture is being recharted
into cyberspace, tinkering with the architectural design process is
more than merely a matter of exchanging juxtaposition for
synthesis. Humanism may, as Eisenman and others so glibly contend,
already be gone, but its replacement is at best a highly
speculative alternative. As the raw power of media plays an ever
larger role in shaping the intellectual basis for much of the
emerging millennium's culture, we run the risk of building a new
architecture not on substantial foundations, but according to a
debasement of humanist ideals, what might be described as ``tabloid
humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) Crystal clear enough for you? Then try ``Beyond

<P>
   My aim here is to inquire into architecture's participation in
the construction of the information age in Silicon Valley. I intend
to situate the architecture of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties
within a theory of capitalist realism and analyses of the pragmatic
economics propelling development of the high technology office
campus. How does architecture operate free from history's burdens
and ideology's veils, yet beholden to utilitarian programs and
outrageous profit margins? What role does architecture have within
an information revolution where the notion of representation is
being radically redefined and dematerialized?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) The author's just warming up, continuing a few
paragraphs later:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if experimental architecture is not possible on
high technology campuses for all the reasons discussed above,
couldn't architecture be split between calculated program and
incidental program, between functional, profitable office zones and
other enclosures, extensions, excavations, and escarpments that
respond to the landscape? Instead of architecture representing the
information age, or popular culture as Venturi would have it,
couldn't architecture be more of a flickering between utilitarian
practices and ludic transgression? This second architecture,
directed toward the resonances of landscape and not the symbolism
of a particular company, would appeal to most firms needing space
in the Valley, and might go a long way toward overcoming the
real-estate conundrum of exit strategies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) Asia too has its conundrums, real estate and
otherwise. And architecturally it's not having much fun either, as
Cherie Wendelken suggested last year in Thresholds 17, a journal
published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of
Architecture:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years a new identity has emerged for Asia in
contemporary architectural discourse. In the writing of Rem
Koolhaas and others, Asia as an idea has become ephemerality,
megaform, placelessness, globalization. These notions displace _
even invert _ earlier European and American constructs of Asia as a
timeless or ancient non-modern realm against which to measure the
modern. Yet strangely, the new idea of Asia constructs an
embodiment of the postmodern _ a place of another extreme where
history is willfully abandoned, visual meaning is casually
discursive, and all built form is tentative. The city of Tokyo
becomes a discourse about ephemerality. The rebuilding of Singapore
becomes an emblem of cultural tabula rasa and bigness.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) It's enough to make you fear for the future of
the profession. And maybe you should. In the November 1997 Journal
of Architectural Education, Kelly Carlson-Redding of the University
of North Carolina employs the architect lingo of today to write of
the challenges facing the architects of tomorrow:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Architecture students today face a variety of complex and often
contradictory models of materiality in architecture. Ideas about
``honest'' materials and rational tectonics are still touted by
modernist and neo-modernist educators and practitioners, while many
urban and suburban environments are inundated with both
well-constructed and shamefully constructed postmodern buildings _
thin-skinned compositions in which pattern making overrides
materiality and extravagance is often substituted for interest. ...
Resurgent interests in expressive tectonics have led to fetishistic
fixations on exaggerated elements of structure, construction and
building systems. ...

<P>
   As educators we are fortunate to work with architecture students
in a time so rich in variety and possibility, but amid this wealth
of divergent propositions it is imperative that we help students
order their own theoretical and instrumental position with regard
to questions of materiality.

   How can you possibly rank national crises? Who's to say, ``Yep,
that one's an eight, but this has got to be a 10''? Do you measure
headline size, count talk-show references, or just throw up your
hands and await history's ruling?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, to hear Frank Meeks tell it. Just follow the
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever matters of state overwhelm, matters of the belly must
be dealt with in the quickest, most instantly gratifying way
possible. ``When Washington is in crisis, pizza sales soar,'' said
Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza stores in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly, on the pizza-crisis meter, are the biggies (not
appetite-adjusted, of course)? Well, the Capitol set its record _
1,500 Domino's pies _ on Impeachment Saturday, Meeks said. And when
the Lewinsky scandal broke, he said, ``things were rocking'' at the
White House _ to the tune of an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day,
compared with 50 on a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Pentagon set its record: more than 800 pies.
``Right as the bombs went off,'' Meeks said, orders flooded in from
the Pentagon and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But can any trend be spotted in the toppings chosen? Pepperoni
for spicy sex scandals, perhaps, or veggie-only for a health-care
crisis? No, said Meeks, ``but when there's a crisis, they load up
on the toppings.''

   Oscar's Hangover
</P>
<P>
   As a four-hour endurance contest, the 71st annual Academy Awards
seemed even longer than usual. By the time it was over, the
question of the night was, what were former Sen. John Glenn and
Gen. Colin Powell doing on stage? No one knew.
</P>
<P>
   The big upset was ``Shakespeare in Love,'' beating the
front-runner, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Miramax, the
quasi-independent company owned by Disney, won 10 Oscars, including
three for Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Gwyneth Paltrow
won best actress and Judi Dench best supporting actress for
``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn was voted best supporting
actor for ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the awards was more fun than the show itself.
Miramax and Dreamworks continued sniping at one another over how
much money the other spent on its campaign for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.'' A photograph in the trade
papers showed the three owners of Dreamworks _ Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg _ sitting together at a
post-Oscar party, looking somewhat unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   And Fernanda Montenegro, the Brazilian star who was nominated as
best actress for ``Central Station,'' had some blunt comments that
stung because many in Hollywood believed she was on target. She
told a Brazilian television interviewer that neither Ms. Paltrow
nor Benigni were especially worthy of the awards, and called Ms.
Paltrow ``this romantic figure, thin, pure, virginal.''

   For Detained Pinochet, A Partial Victory
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet's desire to end his house arrest in
England and return home to Chile got a boost when England's highest
court threw out the bulk of the charges that could be used in the
Spanish effort to extradite him to Madrid to stand trial for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old former Chilean dictator was arrested in October
and has been detained since then. His lawyers argued that the
lesser charges are not sufficient to hold him any longer.

   Jackson Says, `No Thanks'
</P>
<P>
   Campaign after campaign, supporters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
greeted the civil rights leader with the rallying cry, ``Run Jesse
Run!''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he could not be enticed. Jackson, who has run twice
for president, announced he would sit out the 2000 contest, saying
he would rather concentrate on persuading corporations to invest in
minority businesses. ``The time spent running for president is time
that cannot be spent doing something else,'' he said. ``I've got so
many issues I want to raise. I've got so many battles left to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Vice President Al Gore with only one rival for the
Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

   At Last, a Balloon Makes It
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones became the first
balloonists to circle the world nonstop. They were greeted in
Geneva by a thunderous cheer and a trumpeter playing the
``Triumphal March'' from ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his British co-pilot,
Jones, 52, completed a 19-day trip around the world in their
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon when they flew over an invisible finish
line at 9 degrees 27 minutes west longitude in Mauritania, then
touched down in the soft sands of southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   More than a score of pilots had tried to go around the world in
a balloon before. All failed.

   MIT Admits It's Tough on Women
</P>
<P>
   From Harvard to Stanford, top American universities are often
accused of discriminating against their female professors, and
usually respond with defensive denials. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology took a different, more scientific approach: It
gathered the data, quantified the problem and verified its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the institute _ the most prestigious science and
technology school in the country _ has responded with an
extraordinary admission from its highest officials that, yes, women
on the faculty have been systematically, though unintentionally,
short-changed. It found pervasive evidence that women came up short
on everything from hiring and tenure to the allocation of critical
resources like research money and lab space.

   Cruise Line Takes a Plea
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty in federal court in Los
Angeles to three counts of making false statements to Coast Guard
inspectors in an attempt to conceal the illegal dumping of oily
waste water into the Pacific Ocean in 1994. Prosecutors believe the
unexpected admission reinforces United States jurisdiction over
foreign cruise ships. Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest
cruise company, still faces potential dumping charges in New York
and Alaska. The industry is under congressional scrutiny on several
fronts, including whether to alter the tax-free status that saves
foreign ships plying U.S. waters billions of dollars a year.

   Oscar's Hangover
</P>
<P>
   As a four-hour endurance contest, the 71st annual Academy Awards
seemed even longer than usual. By the time it was over, the
question of the night was, what were former Sen. John Glenn and
Gen. Colin Powell doing on stage? No one knew.
</P>
<P>
   The big upset was ``Shakespeare in Love,'' beating the
front-runner, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Miramax, the
quasi-independent company owned by Disney, won 10 Oscars, including
three for Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Gwyneth Paltrow
won best actress and Judi Dench best supporting actress for
``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn was voted best supporting
actor for ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the awards was more fun than the show itself.
Miramax and Dreamworks continued sniping at one another over how
much money the other spent on its campaign for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.'' A photograph in the trade
papers showed the three owners of Dreamworks _ Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg _ sitting together at a
post-Oscar party, looking somewhat unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   And Fernanda Montenegro, the Brazilian star who was nominated as
best actress for ``Central Station,'' had some blunt comments that
stung because many in Hollywood believed she was on target. She
told a Brazilian television interviewer that neither Ms. Paltrow
nor Benigni were especially worthy of the awards, and called Ms.
Paltrow ``this romantic figure, thin, pure, virginal.''

   For Detained Pinochet, A Partial Victory
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet's desire to end his house arrest in
England and return home to Chile got a boost when England's highest
court threw out the bulk of the charges that could be used in the
Spanish effort to extradite him to Madrid to stand trial for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old former Chilean dictator was arrested in October
and has been detained since then. His lawyers argued that the
lesser charges are not sufficient to hold him any longer.

   Jackson Says, `No Thanks'
</P>
<P>
   Campaign after campaign, supporters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
greeted the civil rights leader with the rallying cry, ``Run Jesse
Run!''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he could not be enticed. Jackson, who has run twice
for president, announced he would sit out the 2000 contest, saying
he would rather concentrate on persuading corporations to invest in
minority businesses. ``The time spent running for president is time
that cannot be spent doing something else,'' he said. ``I've got so
many issues I want to raise. I've got so many battles left to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Vice President Al Gore with only one rival for the
Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

   At Last, a Balloon Makes It
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones became the first
balloonists to circle the world nonstop. They were greeted in
Geneva by a thunderous cheer and a trumpeter playing the
``Triumphal March'' from ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his British co-pilot,
Jones, 52, completed a 19-day trip around the world in their
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon when they flew over an invisible finish
line at 9 degrees 27 minutes west longitude in Mauritania, then
touched down in the soft sands of southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   More than a score of pilots had tried to go around the world in
a balloon before. All failed.

   MIT Admits It's Tough on Women
</P>
<P>
   From Harvard to Stanford, top American universities are often
accused of discriminating against their female professors, and
usually respond with defensive denials. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology took a different, more scientific approach: It
gathered the data, quantified the problem and verified its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the institute _ the most prestigious science and
technology school in the country _ has responded with an
extraordinary admission from its highest officials that, yes, women
on the faculty have been systematically, though unintentionally,
short-changed. It found pervasive evidence that women came up short
on everything from hiring and tenure to the allocation of critical
resources like research money and lab space.

   Cruise Line Takes a Plea
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty in federal court in Los
Angeles to three counts of making false statements to Coast Guard
inspectors in an attempt to conceal the illegal dumping of oily
waste water into the Pacific Ocean in 1994. Prosecutors believe the
unexpected admission reinforces United States jurisdiction over
foreign cruise ships. Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest
cruise company, still faces potential dumping charges in New York
and Alaska. The industry is under congressional scrutiny on several
fronts, including whether to alter the tax-free status that saves
foreign ships plying U.S. waters billions of dollars a year.

   A Call for Changes in the 737
</P>
<P>
   The rudder system of the Boeing 737 should be changed, the
National Transportation Safety Board said, to meet one of the
simplest principles of aviation: that every crucial part have a
back-up. The recommendation for the world's most popular airliner
was based on investigations of two crashes and several smaller
mishaps, and could be among the most far-reaching the board has
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   The board blamed the crash of USAir flight 427, a 737 that went
down on approach to Pittsburgh in 1994, on the failure of a single
hydraulic valve that it said should be made ``reliably redundant.''
All 132 people aboard that plane died.

   In Japan, a Ritual Suicide Strikes a Chord
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese manager shocked the nation when he committed
hara-kiri in a protest of the corporate restructuring that is
starting to take place across the country. Moments before he
slashed his stomach with a 14-inch fish-slicing knife, Masaharu
Nonaka had been in heated talks with the president of Bridgestone
Corp., one of the world's largest tire makers.
</P>
<P>
   The case is extreme, but Nonaka's ritual suicide strikes a deep
chord in Japan, which is suffering from record levels of
unemployment and a recessionary economy.

   A Windfall in the Budget
</P>
<P>
   Deficits have given way to surpluses, but budget politics in
Washington go on. Both the House and the Senate adopted Republican
tax-and-spending plans, putting Congress on a collision course with
the Clinton administration over how to divide the huge fiscal
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to bolster Social Security and provide a big
tax cut. Democrats want to bolster Social Security and split the
rest of the money among Medicare, new spending and a much smaller
tax cut. With the pie as big as it is, there is probably room for
compromise.

   Possible Clue On Missing Atheist
</P>
<P>
   With a former employee of the missing atheist leader Madalyn
Murray O'Hair in custody, charged with weapons violations,
investigators were hoping for a long-awaited breakthrough in the
perplexing 1995 disappearance of the 77-year-old woman, her son,
her granddaughter and $500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Waters, a convicted felon who also pled guilty in 1994
to theft from Ms. O'Hair's organization, American Atheists Inc.,
was arrested after an eight-hour search of his apartment in Austin,
Texas His lawyer told reporters that federal officials considered
Waters a suspect in the possible murder of the three missing
people.

</P>
<P>
   Two buildings, a continent apart, with crowds peppered with
celebrities. But there the similarities ended. At the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, film stars stepped smilingly in
for the Academy Awards ceremony. And at Police Headquarters in
Manhattan, former mayors, other politicians, union leaders, even a
few actors, gathered day after day to protest the shooting of
Amadou Diallo, the unarmed man who died in a hail of 41 police
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Could that be Police Commissioner Howard Safir
mingling with the Oscar luminaries? The very man who had said he
would have to skip a Monday hearing on the Diallo affair because of
what an aide called ``important, long-scheduled meetings''?
</P>
<P>
   Yes indeed. And Safir had headed west on a Revlon jet, slept in
the swankest-of-the-swank Peninsula Hotel, all as a guest of a
Revlon pal. Once spotted, he hopped the red-eye home and made it to
the hearing after all. An ethics investigation is pending.

   Dr. Jack Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder for
giving a lethal injection to a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's
disease. Kevorkian, who defended himself at the trial in Pontiac,
Mich., could be sentenced to life in prison. It was the 70-year-old
doctor's first murder trial. In the past, he has been charged only
with assisted suicide. He was acquitted three times and a fourth
case resulted in a mistrial.

   White House Offers China Plan
</P>
<P>
   The White House thought it had a plan to improve relations with
China: Get Beijing into the World Trade Organization, something the
Chinese have sought for more than a decade. But the Chinese never
wanted to pay the price _ lower tariffs on imports, an end to huge
trade barriers and protection for state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Chinese seem willing to play, and negotiations are
becoming furious in the run-up to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit
to Washington on April 8. But in the White House, some are getting
cold feet. Amid charges of spying and human rights violations, some
wonder whether Congress will torpedo the whole deal.

 &HT;    Cousy: `I feel sorry for Rick Pitino'
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Added to Rick Pitino's on-court problems with the
Celtics, team broadcasters Bob Cousy and Tommy Heinsohn remain on
the job despite the coach's efforts to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   So ask yourself if Cousy was crying crocodile tears when he
said, ``I feel sorry for Rick Pitino right now. Sometimes I think
he's going to have a nervous breakdown if he keeps going at that
pace.... He works 16 to 18 hours a day. He charts everything. There
are endless films to look at. Maybe he's trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Celtics slumping badly, Cousy continued, ``Hey, I
bought into a lot of it myself. They showed a big improvement last
year, and this year was going to be even better. They stole Paul
Pierce in the draft. Antoine Walker and (Ron) Mercer were a year
older. They picked up Kenny Anderson. But it hasn't happened. This
team has been a major disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the looking glass
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Pat Riley, laughing, on Phil Jackson's claim that
this year's champion will be tainted because of the lockout: ``I
still think it's the effects of that windowpane (LSD) he took in
1970. What does he know? He's stumping for Bill Bradley. Jackson
should have no opinion about the NBA. He's not in it. He would love
it to be tainted because he's the only one who tasted victory in
the last (three) years. He doesn't want to give anyone any
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you call
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury said he called Minnesota coach Flip Saunders but
denied saying he had made a mistake jumping to New Jersey. ``I
called and thanked him for everything he'd done for me as far as
being a better basketball player. ...I just did it out of respect.
...If he took it as something negative, I guess the pain is still
running deep down.''
</P>
<P>
   Noncontact defense
</P>
<P>
   Toronto coach Butch Carter had a simple strategy for beating the
Pistons last week. ``Just take it to the basket,'' he said, after
the Raptors overcame an 11-point deficit and won 103-101. ``They
won't take a charge.'' The Pistons took one charge the entire
night, while the Raptors made 13 layups or dunks. In the fourth
quarter, they scored 37 points and hit 13 of 16 shots, eight from
10 feet and in
</P>
<P>
   The shots will fall
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing missed another big shot, and the Knicks lost at
Sacramento on Wednesday, so the critical calls to WFAN radio in New
York are even more vociferous. Ewing's response: ``I'm going to
keep taking those shots. They have to start going in sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleading innocent
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nies whistled Christian Laettner for a Type 2 flagrant
foul, which calls for automatic ejection, against Jayson Williams
in the Pistons' game at New Jersey. ``Everyone in the whole arena
was surprised when all of a sudden Jack Nies made that call,''
Laettner said. ``I was surprised as anyone, but as you see, I just
ran off the court. You don't mess around with Jack Nies. He ... was
the only guy in arena who thought I should be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner was asked why he thought Nies had it in for him. ``I
don't know where it comes from,'' he said. ``His son (appears) on
MTV. Maybe that's it.''

   &UR; KOSOVO  &LR; (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Serbian forces stepped up
attacks against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo on Saturday as
NATO air operations rattled Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, in the
heaviest attacks of the campaign, allied officials said. ``The
Serbs have been torching villages,'' the British Defense Minister,
George Robertson, said in London. ``There are reports that the
Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration. There are
clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against the Albanian
population has started.'' By Craig R. Whitney. With photos and map.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-FORCE (Washington) _ Bill Clinton is a politician to his
core, a man of persuasion, not intimidation. He has always been
ambivalent about the use of force to accomplish his purposes, an
ambivalence that mirrors his still uneasy relationship with the
American military. By John M. Broder. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Undated) _ Profile of the Serbian leader:
Rarely can a historical turning point be established quite so
precisely as the one that occurred on April 24, 1987, when Slobodan
Milosevic, a veteran apparatchik best known for his organizational
skills, faced a crowd of enraged Serbs in a suburb of Pristina. As
they complained of being pushed back by police wielding batons, he
told them: ``No one will dare to beat you again.'' By Michael T.
Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As the price of
gasoline rose more than seven times and a prominent Serbian
journalist was arrested Saturday for offending new censorship
rules, the citizens of Belgrade appeared considerably shaken after
the heaviest night of NATO bombing in and around the capital. By
Steven Erlanger. Eds: Correspondent was ordered to depart
Yugoslavia on Thursday but was allowed to reenter the country early
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Anti-American reaction to the NATO
bombing grows in Russia. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>

   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ As United States and NATO aircraft
entered the fourth day of strikes on Serbian targets, President
Clinton said Saturday that allied forces must ``stay the course''
to prevent the war in Kosovo from spreading. By John M. Broder.

   KOSOVO-TURKEY (Istanbul) _ More than 3,000 ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo have arrived in Turkey in recent days, and Turkey is

 &HT;    Admiral's aching, and so is his game
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The decline of San Antonio's David Robinson took
another strange twist. He turned in three weak efforts last week,
shooting a combined 7-for-32.
</P>
<P>
   He had probably the worst game of his career against Golden
State (three points, five rebounds) before being benched for the
last seven minutes of a seesaw game for 6-foot-7 Malik Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Against Portland, Arvydas Sabonis piled up a season-high 28
points against Robinson, who in the past had success against him.
</P>
<P>
   Then against Vancouver, Greg Popovich benched him again for the
final seven minutes of regulation after he missed 10 of his first
12 shots. Robinson played in overtime and helped save the game with
a 17-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would not discuss his problems, Robinson apparently
has a sore ankle and trouble jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Avery Johnson said Robinson has always been prone to
hide his pain. ``He's a good teacher. He's taught me how to play
with injuries. The thing with Dave is, yes, some of it is his body.
And some of it is just trying to get his confidence back and find
his groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the ledge
</P>
<P>
   Denver nearly blew a 29-point lead against Seattle, but
prevailed after the Sonics cut the gap to one point in the fourth
quarter. ``If we had lost after having that lead,'' Nuggets coach
Mike D'Antoni said, ``I'd have been up on a ledge somewhere, and no
one would have been able to talk me down.'' After general manager
Dan Issel read that quote the next day, he told D'Antoni, ``If we
had lost that game, nobody would have tried to talk you down.''
</P>
<P>
   A happier Pippen
</P>
<P>
   After complaining about his role in the Houston offense, Scottie
Pippen has recanted. ``I feel much better. I feel like I'm being
utilized, and I'm able to be a big part of the team's offense. It
was probably my fault more so than anything. But this has allowed
me to have more leadership and control of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to shoot
</P>
<P>
   After Allen Iverson scored 41 points by taking 36 shots,
Shaquille O'Neal threw a thinly disguised barb at teammate Kobe
Bryant, who is equally unshy about firing away. ``Any shooter who
shoots the ball 36 times every night should be the leading scorer
in the league and should be an MVP candidate. I mean, I wish I shot
the ball 36 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy Clippers
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers waived James Robinson _ at his request _ after he
agreed to settle the last three years of his contract at $7.2
million. According to teammate Pooh Richardson, ``He told some of
the guys that it wasn't anything personal against them. He just
wanted out so bad that he'd do whatever possible to leave. He's
been in the league for six years and he felt that it was crucial at
this point of his career that he had a chance to prove that he
could still play.'' ... Rodney Rogers has reportedly told the
Clippers he won't be back. Lorenzen Wright has been unhappy since
camp and Portland wants him.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo mellows
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence P.J. Carlesimo has changed his ways since last
year's Latrell Sprewell choking incident in Oakland. ``He still
gets on people,'' Golden State guard Bimbo Coles said. ``As far as
that, he's the same person. But what's made him a better coach and
better for the players is, he takes in our input. It's not like
everything is his way. He asks us things about travel, about
practices, about how we want to play certain plays, which was
totally different last year. To me, it seems like he's made the
steps to become a better coach and a better players' coach, and
it's worked out.''

 &HT;    Red Wings GM goes for broke
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Detroit to make some moves before the trading
deadline wasn't merely expected _ it was necessary to wake up a
slumbering two-time champion. But after general manager Ken Holland
traded two No. 1 draft picks, two No. 2s, a No. 3, other
conditional picks and two young players for four players ages 37
(Chris Chelios), 35 (Ulf Samuelsson), 32 (Wendel Clark) and 32
(Bill Ranford), the belief is that the Red Wings might have
mortgaged their future. Yes, Holland probably improved the team's
chances to win the Cup this year. But this team already had age at
its core _ Steve Yzerman (33), Brendan Shanahan (30), Larry Murphy
(38), Igor Larionov (38), Uwe Krupp (33 and possibly finished with
a back injury) and Doug Brown (34). Holland talks about a win-now
philosophy and said, ``We wanted to strongly pursue another
championship next year and the next couple of years,'' which is
admirable. But if the Wings fall short, they have a major
housecleaning facing them, with five fewer prospects in the system.
The deal that made the least sense was for the Rangers' Samuelsson,
who is injured, can't play for at least two more weeks and probably
won'tbe re-signed after the season. Holland gave up second- and
third-round picks just minutes before the trading deadline. Ranford
is a projected backup for goalie Chris Osgood next season if the
Wings lose Norm Maracle to the Thrashers in the expansion draft.
Clark gives the team a leader and a physical presence. But two
firsts for Chelios at this stage of his career? ``That was way out
of our range,'' said Philadelphia GM Bob Clarke, who also pursued
the defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The New Math
</P>
<P>
   After buying out the remainder of Steve Duchesne's $11.25
million contract for $4.25 million before trading him to
Philadelphia, this is what the Los Angeles Kings were left with on
their accounting books: outlay of $7,451,219.30. Return on
investment: four goals ($1,862,804.80 each), 23 points ($323,966.05
each). ``I'm not sure if you'll see us too active in the free-agent
market in the future,'' Kings GM Dave Taylor said. ``You won't see
us enter into a four- or five-year contract and pay big dollars for
a player in their 30s anymore.'' Let's see if Taylor sticks with
that promise when Colorado's Theo Fleury becomes a free agent after
the season. ... Duchesne took a parting shot at Kings coach Larry
Robinson, whom the defenseman thinks tried to change his style of
play: ``I'm an offensive player. I've never been a very physical
player, but I try to stay in the way. It's great to have somebody
who knows exactly what type of player I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios, who signed a two-year, $11 million deal with Detroit,
said he did not force the Black Hawks' hand. But when he demanded a
contract extension, he, in effect, forced Chicago to make a move.
GM Bob Murray could not justify a team missing the playoffs two
years in a row and giving a player, even Chelios, at least another
$3.7 million for one year. ... The 2000 second-round pick San Jose
gave up for Montreal's Vincent Damphousse escalates to a
first-rounder if the forward re-signs with the Sharks as a free
agent. ``For the price we paid, it's a good risk,'' Sharks GM Dean
Lombardi said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was nothing symbolic about the arrest of
Rebecca Scanlon last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon is no criminal. She's a solid citizen and a hard
worker. She and a partner are opening a restaurant across the
street from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. For the past few years
they owned a restaurant, the New City Cafe, that was rated at times
by Zagat as one of the top 50 in the city. She is 32 years old and
the mother of a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   But New York is taking on the sinister coloration of a police
state, and in that environment almost anyone can be taken off the
street and thrown into the terrifying confines of ``the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon, driving her 1987 Subaru, was caught Tuesday morning
in one of the many sweeps and roadblocks being conducted by the
police around the city. This was a ``safety sweep'' at the
intersection of Classon Avenue and Fulton Street. Ms. Scanlon said
she saw about eight officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to write me up because I didn't have my seat
belt on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was on her way to pick up her partner and then meet
a construction crew at the site of the new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was late for an appointment,'' she said. ``This
has happened to me at least three other times. It usually takes 15
to 45 minutes. It's not pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was told the officers would let her go as soon as
they could. Her license and registration were checked and then an
officer walked back to the car and told her to step out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they said to me was, `Get out of the car, you're under
arrest.' And then they put me in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was upset and embarrassed. An officer patted her
down and asked if she was carrying any needles or other sharp
objects. ``People were gathering and watching, wondering what I had
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that it is widely believed that if a young white woman
is in the custody of the police in a predominantly black
neighborhood, she must have been trying to score drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Scanlon was taken away in handcuffs because she had
forgotten to pay a ticket for driving with a broken taillight.
That's it. A computer check showed that her license had been
suspended. Later it would be confirmed that Ms. Scanlon had never
been notified of the suspension. She was no intentional scofflaw.
When she moved recently she notified both the Department of Motor
Vehicles and the Post Office of her new address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just forgot to pay it,'' she said. ``Usually if your license
is in jeopardy you get some kind of notification.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of town we've become. The voters put an
ambitious zealot of a prosecutor in charge and now everybody's a
suspect. All sense of proportion has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Roane had a chilling story in Friday's Times about the way
the police have treated students and teachers at Rice High,
Harlem's only Roman Catholic high school. Roane wrote:
``Administrators said that Brother Tyrone Davis, who teaches
business law at the school and is the executive director of the
Archdiocese's office of black ministry, has grown so tired of being
stopped by the police that he now rarely leaves work without
donning his religious collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scanlon was fingerprinted and locked up at the 88th Precinct
stationhouse. She shared a small cell with another woman, a mother
of three, who was also arrested for a traffic violation. All of
Brooklyn breathed a sigh of relief to hear that these two had been
taken off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cops at the precinct told Ms. Scanlon she was going to be ``put
through the system,'' which meant she would be shackled and sent to
Central Booking with the real bad actors who had been arrested and
she probably would be jailed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Scanlon was not without resources. Her father is John
Scanlon, a prominent public relations man. He immediately got her a
lawyer, Matthew Dunson, and began calling friends and associates to
see if they could help get his daughter out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Several people called the precinct captain, James Guida,
including, according to Ms. Scanlon, a retired New York police
captain. It worked. Ms. Scanlon and her cellmate were finally
released about 7:30 p.m. after being locked up nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was kind of sick,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: BROKEN BONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
refiling to fix coding (nk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My father shot a man to death once.
</P>
<P>
   He and another police detective were sitting in the dark in the
middle of the night, staking out a drugstore in downtown
Washington. They had been tipped off that there was going to be a
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   When the two policemen surprised the thief, he pulled a gun and
shot at them. My father shot back, aiming to wound but killing
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Like many tough Irish guys, my father scoffed at psychiatrists.
But he saw one then. It was hard for him to believe he'd taken a
life, even though he was in a life-and-death business. He spent
three months at home. He couldn't sleep. He had trouble swallowing.
``I feel,'' he told my mother, ``like my throat is full of broken
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter, I always avoided police brutality stories. It was
not that I did not believe that police could abuse power in
sinister ways. It was just that I preferred not to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Giuliani is forcing me to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Police Headquarters last week to see the
demonstrations for justice in the death of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed African immigrant who was ripped apart by a sheet of
bullets after four police officers mistakenly thought the peddler
with the broken English and a stutter might possibly maybe resemble
a rapist they were looking for, and might possibly maybe be
reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo demonstrations grew after Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, whose force is facing cascading investigations, took a
junket to the Oscars on a Revlon plane. They grew even after it was
reported Thursday that the four officers had been indicted by a
Bronx grand jury on second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to poke fun at the radical chic air of the
demonstrations. The arrests, with veteran activists walking
jauntily in to be booked by elaborately polite officers, could have
been scripted by Tom Wolfe. Wednesday was Rabbi and Labor day.
Thursday was Susan Sarandon day. Friday was Jesse Jackson day.
</P>
<P>
   People mingled in front of the State Supreme Court Building as
if they were at a cocktail party in a New Yorker cartoon. ``Hi, are
you getting arrested?'' a woman asked a man.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a clipboard organized protesters from the City
University of New York. ``Is there anyone who hasn't been arrested
before?'' she called out chirpily.
</P>
<P>
   Young women, with the brio of Lakers cheerleaders, sang out,
``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Giuliani's got to go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gottfried, a Democratic state assemblyman from the Upper
West Side, boasted to Pete Grannis, a Democratic assemblyman from
the Upper East Side, ``My previous arrests were South Africa and
Soviet Jewry.'' Grannis tried to top him, murmuring that he'd been
``in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Al Sharpton, who organized the protests with
all those bobbing signs depicting the mayor with a little Hitler
mustache. It is so easy to dismiss the man who, in Tawana Brawley,
perpetrated one of the most damaging frauds in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the protests smacked of radical chic, and just
because the protesters didn't seem to have a precise goal in mind,
doesn't mean they were not important and right.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those moments where you see the ugly worms crawling
under the gleaming rock. It is a moment for white, middle-class New
Yorkers to acknowledge that those who are not white or well off are
paying too high a price for the safer, shinier city that Giuliani
has given us.
</P>
<P>
   When something disgraceful happened to an innocent man, the
mayor's reaction was grudging, defensive and totally lacking in
human kindness. Instead of standing tall for the police, he should
have gotten on his knees and begged forgiveness from the Diallo
family.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the mayor to acknowledge that sometimes there is
something even more important than how the police are feeling. He
has finally said the right things in this case. But it is time for
him to stop bristling and denying at every criticism, to see he has
more than a P.R. problem when nearly all the major black officials
in the city, and many white leaders, are willing to get arrested to
protest his Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The only question about Rudolph Giuliani right now is whether he
can transcend himself, whether he feels broken bones in his throat.

 &HT;    As others trade, Stars stand pat
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The second-most famous team headquartered in the
Dallas suburb of Valley Ranch had a relatively quiet week. The
belief was that a hockey team already carrying the name ``Stars''
on their jerseys didn't need another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching this team to see if what happened would
match our projections,'' general manager Bob Gainey said. ``There
have been some challenging times. But we've done quite well. That
kind of information allows you to go on and make your decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Tuesday's NHL trading deadline, the
decisions for Gainey were relatively easy. He would not trade
goalie Roman Turek, even if it increased the chances that the Stars
would have to expose the young backup or starter Ed Belfour in the
Thrashers' expansion draft. Gainey also decided he would not
significantly tamper with a roster that had built the league's best
record, despite a slight need for a defenseman and a speedy winger.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars made two minor acquisitions, picking up center Derek
Plante from Buffalo and re-acquiring Benoit Hogue from
payroll-trimming Tampa Bay. But for all intents and purposes, the
team that would make another run for the Stanley Cup was completed
last July, when owner Tom Hicks signed free agent Brett Hull.
Dallas had recorded the league's best record, 49-22-11, last
season. But after losing to Detroit in the Western Conference
finals four games to two and being shut out twice in the process,
the Stars' thinking was that Hull could make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third year in a row that Dallas will set a
franchise record for points. But if the Stars fall short again,
Gainey is sure to get heat for not doing more. Detroit made four
high-profile deals, landing Chris Chelios and Wendel Clark.
Colorado acquired Dale Hunter, after getting Theo Fleury earlier.
Philadelphia, desperate for a spark, is renting Mark Recchi and
Steve Duchesne for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had several offers for Turek. Tampa Bay offered four
players. Clark was on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never close to a deal,'' Gainey said. ``One of the
things teams try to do with trades is garner depth. Roman provides
that depth for us at the position that can be the linchpin of our
success in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey still might trade one of the two goalies after the season
and before the June 25 expansion draft. He also might attempt to
work a deal with the Thrashers that would keep both in Dallas. What
he wasn't going to do was mess with the biggest advantage the Stars
have in the upcoming playoffs: goaltending. Entering the weekend,
Dallas had scored the second-most goals in the league to Detroit _
210 to 205 _ but had allowed 42 fewer than the Red Wings and had
the league's best goals-against average, 1.98.
</P>
<P>
   Further, despite the belief that Hull was forced on Gainey and
coach Ken Hitchcock by Hicks and concerns that the star would cause
problems with team chemistry, neither has happened. Hull is second
on the Stars in goals (28) and points (50), despite missing 21
games with injuries. Dallas has such a huge lead in the overall
point standings that Hitchcock will be able to rest some regulars
in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our team is a little better than we were last year,
but Detroit is better now, and so are some other teams,'' Gainey
said. ``We still have to beat the best teams to prove ourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped short of saying the Stars have to win it. But if they
don't, he'll hear about it.

 &HT;    No deals for Carolina, Florida
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given that a playoff spot and the title of the weak
Southeastern Division is at stake, it was surprising that neither
Carolina nor Florida made a significant move before the trading
deadline. The Hurricanes, who have been in first place since Oct.
28, despite struggling in recent weeks, sought defensive help and
made pitches for Chicago's Chris Chelios (offering four players)
and L.A.'s Steve Duchesne, but GM Jim Rutherford backed off when
the asking prices were deemed to high. Referring to the Blackhawks'
move in getting two first-round picks from Detroit for Chelios,
Rutherford said, ``What they got for him pretty much answers any
questions about our position.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hurricanes' decision to remain pat could be rationalized,
Florida's couldn't. The Panthers were expected to overtake Carolina
after trading for Pavel Bure. But Bure has missed several games
with injuries, and Florida hasn't been significantly better with
him (5-4-2) than without him (6-7-4), going into the weekend.
Playing nine of their last 13 at home, the Panthers opened that
stretch Wednesday with a 2-1 loss to the New York Rangers. The
atmosphere in the National Car Rental Center was so dead, goalie
Sean Burke said, ``Sometimes being at home isn't as big a deal as
you might think.'' New blood was needed to shake up the team and
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Open market
</P>
<P>
   Detroit made the highest profile moves, but no team was busier
prior to the trade deadline than Tampa Bay. GM-coach Jacques
Demers, on a mission to slash the budget by $8 million, made six
deals that included jettisoning Bill Ranford ($3.087 million),
Wendel Clark ($1.4 million) and Benoit Hogue ($1.2 million). The
hack-and-slash summary: Demers traded seven players, a sixth-round
pick and other conditional picks for only three players,
conditional picks and ``future considerations.'' He dumped
approximately $6 million in salary. The kick is that Demers said
after the deals there is now ``stability'' in the organization and
maintained the Lightning has ``a bright future.'' The following
night, Tampa lost to Nashville, and Demers berated his players.
Captain Cooked
</P>
<P>
   When the Canadiens dealt Vincent Damphousse to San Jose, that
made five captains in a row the team has traded. Previous
sacrifices: Guy Carbonneau, Mike Keane, Kirk Muller and Pierre
Turgeon. The next victim? Nobody knows. A team spokesman said the
team captain might vary from game to game for the remainder of the
season. That was a collective sigh you heard in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL still favors Mario Lemieux's plan to purchase the
bankrupt Penguins. But Lemieux is seeking many of the same
financial concessions from the Civic Arena and local governments
that majority owner Roger Marino sought. ... Washington GM George
McPhee will draw high marks from players for fulfilling veteran
Dale Hunter's wish to be traded to a Stanley Cup contender
(Colorado, for a No. 2 pick). ``Right now I'm thrilled for him,''
McPhee said.

 &HT;    GM's inquire about possible deals
 &HT;    By Jeff Schutlz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General manager Don Waddell can't make any trades yet,
but that didn't stop about 10 of the league's GMs from contacting
him before the trading deadline about committing to possible deals.
``They would ask me things like, `If we pick up this player for the
rest of the year, is he somebody you might be interested in during
the expansion draft?' '' Waddell said. ``But I'm not interested in
making any deals now. It's not in our best interest. What if I
told, say, Florida, that there's a certain guy we wanted, and then
they went out and made a trade for a goalie that we wanted
instead?'' From the Thrashers' standpoint, the most interesting
aspect of the predeadline deals involved backup goaltenders the
team is looking to pluck in the expansion draft _ particularly
Dallas' Roman Turek and Detroit's Norm Maracle. But Waddell said,
``We understand some deals can still be be made before the draft.''
The expansion draft is June 25. ... Eight months ago, team
officials were on the record about having sold out of the two
top-priced tickets ($70 and $65) and nearly sold out of the next
two levels ($55 and $50). Suddenly, the Thrashers aren't divulging
any details about season tickets, other than to say total sales
have exceeded the NHL mandate of 12,000. Why the sudden secrecy?
Because of sluggish sales of club seats at the new arena, the
Thrashers are trying to convert season-ticket holders to a section
with essentially the same view but with waitress service. Any
converts would open up a ticket slot at their current level. Turner
Sports, which owns the Thrashers and Hawks, has been running
several radio ads for club seats of late. ... How much interest is
there in center Patrik Stefan of the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs?
When the potential No. 1 pick in the draft played a game in
Kalamazoo, Mich., the other night, 43 scouts representing 20 NHL
teams attended.

   TWO MINUTES: RON TUGNUTT
</P>
<P>
   Team, position: Ottawa, goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Update: Leads the NHL in goals-against average (1.72) and is
second in saves percentage (.930) and winning percentage (.662,
20-9-5).
</P>
<P>
   On success after struggles with Quebec, Edmonton and Montreal:
``Quebec gave me a chance to play. Unfortunately, they were going
through a rebuilding process. The Senators had already rebuilt by
the time I got here. I'm just in the right place at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   On key to turnaround: ``I have to credit (former Washington GM)
David Poile, who suggested I needed to go to the minors (with
Portland in 1995) to get some games under me and learn how to win
again. I figured I'd give it one year and if it didn't work out,
I'd move on and play in Europe. Fortunately, it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Ottawa's decision to rotate him and Damian Rhodes in goal:
``We understand the situation here is unique, but it seems to be
working, and you don't want to rock the boat. We have two goalies
fresh every game. The thing is, neither one of us (has) a big
ego.''
</P>
<P>
   On his relationship with Rhodes (a potential expansion pick of
the Thrashers): ``We don't talk about a lot of things other than
hockey and golf. They're the only two things we have in common. We
get along, but we don't exactly go out to dinner. It's kind of a
strange relationship.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If some adults doubt how difficult it is to
deliver educational messages to children through television, they
should have attended a recent conference here on creating positive
programming. Some children, ages 11 to 14, were asked if they
watched Jerry Springer. They all said yes. Asked if the show was
staged, these young viewers, wise to the ways of manipulation, said
yes again, with several adding that the staging increased the
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Children have never been more cynical about television, harder
to reach or as resistant to traditional programming than now, with
the proliferation of cable channels and the Internet. Yet this
comes at a time when the federal government has started an oddly
earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of deregulation,
requiring the networks to devote at least three hours a week to
educational programming. The rules specify the kinds of messages
that must be delivered and the age group at which they are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, passed by the Federal Communications Commission and
in effect for two seasons now, have created a quandary for network
executives, who are eager to comply but don't want to build, as one
executive said, a three-hour black hole in schedules that are
already being watched less and less by children whose taste for
irreverent humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has
made educational moralizing unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the cod-liver oil of educational
programming can compete with the french fries of pure
entertainment. Can Scholastic's ``The Magic School Bus'' on Fox
attract someone from Jerry Springer? So far, the answer seems to be
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of volume, the law has clearly met its goal. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard, who
participated in the conference on positive programming held by the
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences this month, said in an
interview that virtually all the stations in the country were in
compliance, some even offering four hours a week of educational
fare. The shows range from ``The Magic School Bus,'' an animated
program that teaches science to children 6 to 9 years old through
flights of fancy, to ``Hang Time,'' ``One World'' and ``Saved by
the Bell,'' dramas for teen-agers on NBC that frequently focus on
morals and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But few children or teen-agers are actually tuning in, experts
say. According to Nielsen Media Research, the highest-rated
educational show, ``Hang Time,'' which airs at 10:30 Saturday
morning, is watched by only 2.8 percent of the households with
televisions this season. Popular cartoons and pure entertainment
shows frequently pull in almost twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the shows' construction, which begins with the
curriculum and ends with the story, is antithetical to the creative
process. A compelling story, they say, should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   This structural awkwardness was evident at an NBC seminar
recently held at a hotel here. Various experts taught writers of
the network's educational programs, which are aimed at teen-agers,
how to build in important lessons and still be creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep thinking out of the box!'' exhorted Robin Schwartz, NBC's
executive in charge of the programs. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who offers
sexual advice on MTV's ``Loveline,'' added, ``To produce material
for teens, there cannot be a whiff of adult management of the
message. It has to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Karen Hill-Scott, a child development expert and an
adult who manages the messages on every one of the NBC educational
programs, showed a series of pie charts on last season's shows with
precise statistics on their treatment of the ``socio-emotional
domain'' and ``the cognitive domain.'' In the future, she said, the
writers had to develop more programs around anti-drug and
anti-smoking messages, among other themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything but show the lungs of the kid who
smokes,'' said Peter Engel, the executive producer of the NBC
Saturday programs. ``It's very, very difficult to do these shows.
You've got to do them in informational and educational ways, but if
they're not entertaining, nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the programming say that, on the plus side, a new
market is emerging for material that enlightens. ``I do measure the
results of the law by the fact that there's a generation of
programming that wouldn't exist without it,'' said Jeff Chester,
executive director of the Center for Media Education, based in
Washington. ``At the very least, the programs are benign. They
aren't violent or exploitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree it is impossible to measure whether the law's
real goal _ better educated children _ is being met, except in the
most general sense. ``This is like exercise,'' said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., one of the law's primary backers. ``We all know
you should exercise, and in the same way, kids should watch
educational television. I know it's not harmful, and I'm positive
it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many network executives say that if ``not harmful'' is the best
that can be expected, the money might be better spent elsewhere,
opening the television schedule to shows that more children might
actually view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wouldn't be doing this much without the law,''
said CBS senior vice president Martin Franks. ``The rule has been a
wonderful success in terms of quantity.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If some adults doubt how difficult it is to
deliver educational messages to children through television, they
should have attended a recent conference here on creating positive
programming. Some children, ages 11 to 14, were asked if they
watched Jerry Springer. They all said yes. Asked if the show was
staged, these young viewers, wise to the ways of manipulation, said
yes again, with several adding that the staging increased the
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Children have never been more cynical about television, harder
to reach or as resistant to traditional programming than now, with
the proliferation of cable channels and the Internet. Yet this
comes at a time when the federal government has started an oddly
earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of deregulation,
requiring the networks to devote at least three hours a week to
educational programming. The rules specify the kinds of messages
that must be delivered and the age group at which they are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, passed by the Federal Communications Commission and
in effect for two seasons now, have created a quandary for network
executives, who are eager to comply but don't want to build, as one
executive said, a three-hour black hole in schedules that are
already being watched less and less by children whose taste for
irreverent humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has
made educational moralizing unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the cod-liver oil of educational
programming can compete with the french fries of pure
entertainment. Can Scholastic's ``The Magic School Bus'' on Fox
attract someone from Jerry Springer? So far, the answer seems to be
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of volume, the law has clearly met its goal. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard, who
participated in the conference on positive programming held by the
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences this month, said in an
interview that virtually all the stations in the country were in
compliance, some even offering four hours a week of educational
fare. The shows range from ``The Magic School Bus,'' an animated
program that teaches science to children 6 to 9 years old through
flights of fancy, to ``Hang Time,'' ``One World'' and ``Saved by
the Bell,'' dramas for teen-agers on NBC that frequently focus on
morals and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But few children or teen-agers are actually tuning in, experts
say. According to Nielsen Media Research, the highest-rated
educational show, ``Hang Time,'' which airs at 10:30 Saturday
morning, is watched by only 2.8 percent of the households with
televisions this season. Popular cartoons and pure entertainment
shows frequently pull in almost twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the shows' construction, which begins with the
curriculum and ends with the story, is antithetical to the creative
process. A compelling story, they say, should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   This structural awkwardness was evident at an NBC seminar
recently held at a hotel here. Various experts taught writers of
the network's educational programs, which are aimed at teen-agers,
how to build in important lessons and still be creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep thinking out of the box!'' exhorted Robin Schwartz, NBC's
executive in charge of the programs. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who offers
sexual advice on MTV's ``Loveline,'' added, ``To produce material
for teens, there cannot be a whiff of adult management of the
message. It has to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Karen Hill-Scott, a child development expert and an
adult who manages the messages on every one of the NBC educational
programs, showed a series of pie charts on last season's shows with
precise statistics on their treatment of the ``socio-emotional
domain'' and ``the cognitive domain.'' In the future, she said, the
writers had to develop more programs around anti-drug and
anti-smoking messages, among other themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything but show the lungs of the kid who
smokes,'' said Peter Engel, the executive producer of the NBC
Saturday programs. ``It's very, very difficult to do these shows.
You've got to do them in informational and educational ways, but if
they're not entertaining, nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the programming say that, on the plus side, a new
market is emerging for material that enlightens. ``I do measure the
results of the law by the fact that there's a generation of
programming that wouldn't exist without it,'' said Jeff Chester,
executive director of the Center for Media Education, based in
Washington. ``At the very least, the programs are benign. They
aren't violent or exploitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree it is impossible to measure whether the law's
real goal _ better educated children _ is being met, except in the
most general sense. ``This is like exercise,'' said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., one of the law's primary backers. ``We all know
you should exercise, and in the same way, kids should watch
educational television. I know it's not harmful, and I'm positive
it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many network executives say that if ``not harmful'' is the best
that can be expected, the money might be better spent elsewhere,
opening the television schedule to shows that more children might
actually view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wouldn't be doing this much without the law,''
said CBS senior vice president Martin Franks. ``The rule has been a
wonderful success in terms of quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a little harder to judge whether it's been a
success in terms of quality. Because there's so much of this on the
air, the government has made it harder for a show to break through
the clutter. I'm not sure that's a great public policy outcome. You
might argue that we'd be better off funding scholarships with that
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest criticism of the federal rules is the
claim that television is best suited to conveying lessons
informally rather than through pie charts or government mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that the lessons have to be so formal,'' said
Meryl Marshall, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences and a speaker at the conference. ``What this seminar has
grown out of is a strong desire by the membership itself to be

<P>
   Emancipation was declared in 1863, but it is in this last decade
of the 20th century that historians and writers are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about
slavery are stripping away whatever is left of the velvety romance
of benign slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are
emphasizing efforts of the enslaved to escape or rebel and the
punishments they faced that ranged from branding to amputation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bleaker information emerges from the faded pages of
court records and antebellum divorce petitions. But among the newly
published books are some milder views expressed in the memoirs of
planters' wives, old handwritten diaries and slave narratives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the taboos have been lifted,'' said Lucinda
MacKethan, an English professor at North Carolina State University,
who helped arrange for the publication of ``Lyddy'' (University of
Georgia Press), an antebellum novel by a planter's wife, and
another wife's memoirs. ``For instance, talking about miscegenation
in families is no longer considered the horrible shaming thing that
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling, she added, ``that we don't know the full
story and we ought to go back and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We used to keep silent about it because there was a
social stigma attached to those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the burst in publishing about slavery has come in the
1990s, with 53 titles published last year and 16 published so far
this year, according to R.R. Bowker's Books in Print. In previous
decades, the yearly output of titles was less than 12 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the current interest in slavery goes beyond that of
academics and historians. There are also amateur sleuths and
genealogists like Robert Newman, an Ohio civil rights lawyer who
discovered the handwritten memoir of John P. Parker, a former slave
and conductor on the Underground Railroad. Newman, who tracked the
autobiography to a university archive from a footnote in a doctoral
dissertation, used the $75,000 advance from publication of ``His
Promised Land'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.) to purchase the Parker home in
Ripley, Ohio, for a museum.
</P>
<P>
   The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is scheduled to
open in 2003 in Cincinnati. The $80 million building will include
interactive exhibits enabling visitors to experience what it was
like to be a slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a cover off of something that's been covered along
time, then you generate a lot of curiosity,'' said Ed Rigaud, the
president and chief executive of the Cincinnati center. ``We're
taking the cover off.''
</P>
<P>
   The literature on slavery has distinct periods beginning with
the political activism of abolitionists, who after the 1830s
published books describing the mistreatment of slaves. The
publications provoked slaveholders into publishing
counter-narratives that portrayed slaves as intelligent people who
loved being part of the plantation family.
</P>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, workers at the Works Progress
Administration collected the oral histories of aging former slaves,
but the results were bland because white interviewers conducting
the research avoided the painful questions of brutality, violence
and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Those topics were often forbidden for the descendants of slaves
and slaveowners themselves. ``It's a part of history that as a
black I wasn't familiar with myself,'' said Mary Young, an
associate professor of English and Black Studies at the College of
Wooster in Ohio, whose family just didn't talk about slavery. She
has edited two books of slave narratives published by Franklin
Watts, ``All My Trials,'' a collection of histories from women, and
``Testaments of Courage,'' a history of men.
</P>
<P>
   But there are curious gaps in these narratives, Professor Young
said. The women may have talked easily about ``sassing'' their
owners, but they declined to talk about sexual exploitation and
cruelty. She said she had to dig for stories about a slave whose
ear was nailed to a post or a runaway who was punished with the
amputation of a foot.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation'' (Oxford
University Press), historians John Hope Franklin and Loren
Schweninger examined the brutal side of slavery after years of
researching old civil court records, divorce petitions and
newspaper advertisements offering descriptions of runaway slaves.
</P>
<P>
   From the divorce records filed by plantation wives, a picture
emerged that it was ``widespread and not uncommon for slaveholders
to have interracial sex with slaves in their late teens and 20s,''
Schweninger said. The runaway notices often revealed vivid
descriptions of the missing slaves: scars, whip marks, cropped ears
or branding on the forehead or back.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the historians calculated that slaveowners had to
contend with frequent escapes; they estimated that each year more
than 50,000 of the 2 million adult slaves tried to run away either
to the North or deeper into the South to be reunited with relatives
sold to new owners. But few succeeded in their escape, perhaps less
than 5 percent, Schweninger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of historians who believe that the vast
majority of slave owners were pious Christian men devoted to their
families,'' Schweninger said. ``I think people are going to take
umbrage at how we explore this, but we use evidence and the
evidence is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ball, whose book ``Slaves in the Family'' (Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux) won the National Book Award for nonfiction last year,
knows firsthand how difficult it is to probe for information about
slavery. When he inquired into the history of his famous
slaveholding family, one cousin scolded him, saying, ``This will
court anger and it will divide people.'' When he interviewed
descendants of the Balls' slaves, one elderly woman explained the
logic for silence: ``The older parents come under such strain, with
slavery, until they didn't tell the children things they should
have told them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball said his book lectures have turned into miniature town
meetings about race. ``The feeling I get is that people now welcome
the permission to talk about the hard stuff in my book,'' he said.
`` `Slaves in the Family' talks in thorough detail about the
purchase and sale of children, black and white sex, the slave
ships. It means that people want to find a way to talk about this
inheritance and the story I tell seems to help. There's too much
silence about it.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 28, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic rose to
power on the issue of the minority Serbs in Kosovo, the province
from which Serbs derive their defining myths of nationalism,
victimization and endurance. Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem, the
holy touchstone and center of their existence as a nation despite
all the defeats and travails of history. It is so deeply ingrained
in Serbian mythology that the West seems to have miscalculated
Milosevic's ability to abandon the issue even if he wanted to. By
Steven Erlanger. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-REVIEW (Undated) _ In trying to bring the Serbs to
heel, NATO has unwittingly married itself to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is widely seen as a terrorist group. Although the KLA's
atrocities are dwarfed by those of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the fact that it has emerged to speak for Kosovo's Albanians, and
the fact that NATO is bombing Serb targets in Kosovo, reveals a
great deal about the moral ambiguities facing outsiders who wade
into the Balkans. By Chris Hedges. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW (New York) _ The protests and arrests
at police headquarters have gotten much media coverage. Less
attention has been given to off-stage huddles between the
protesters' lawyers and police officials, often to discuss ground
rules. The police politely explained that to get arrested for
disorderly conduct, the demonstrators would have to block BOTH
entrances. In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist
arrest. Organizers have even provided police with the names of
those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and the release of the conscientious
scofflaws. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CONDUCT-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the candidates are to
be believed, the 2000 presidential campaign will be a high-toned,
polite affair. But while candidates sense that people are repulsed
by the vitriolic discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that
attacks can boomerang _ no one believes that the days of dirty,
dark politics are over. In this first post-impeachment campaign,
the trick will be to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do
so. By Richard L Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SLAVERY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slavery ended in the 1860s, but
it is only the 1990s that historians and others are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries. A
proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about slavery
are stripping away what is left of the velvety romance of benign
slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are emphasizing
the slaves' efforts to escape or rebel. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   B52-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most remarkable aircraft taking part
in NATO's strikes at Serbia is also the oldest: the B-52.
Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the production
line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force, old and slow
but still able to deliver a terrific punch anywhere in the world.
And, incredibly, the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not
expected to retire until 2044, when they will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-THEFT-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The end of the Cold War has led to
an arms race between the people who make cars and the people who
steal them. It has changed the auto theft industry by opening up a
huge new market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this business
have become more sophisticated; so have the counter-measures
designed by automakers to stop them. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S-MAGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Changes in Glamour, echoed in
other women's magazines, is part of a larger retreat _ not a
backlash of men against women but of women against feminism _ that
vexes feminist theorists and cheers conservatives. By virtue of the
articles they choose to publish, youthful women's magazines like
Cosmopolitan and Glamour seem to argue that their reader doesn't
want or need feminism; that she doesn't care much about Washington
or affirmative action, and that she isn't angry about being cheated

   EDUC-TV-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The federal government has
started an oddly earnest experiment, a counterpoint to this age of
deregulation, requiring TV networks to devote at least three hours
a week to educational programming. The rules have created a
quandary for network executives, who want to comply but don't want
to build a three-hour black hole in schedules that are already
being watched less and less by children whose taste for irreverent
humor, violence and other forms of entertainment has made
educational moralizing unappealing. By James Sterngold.

   PIZZA-CRISIS-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``When Washington is in crisis,
pizza sales soar,'' says Frank Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza
stores in the D.C. area. When the Lewinsky scandal broke, the White
House was ordering an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day. The Capitol set
its record _ 1,500 pies _ on Impeachment Saturday. As the bombing
of Serbia began, the Pentagon set its record: over 800 pies. By
Hubert Herring.

   SHAKESPEARE-HEADLINES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ How have the media
been recycling the Bard-isms in the midst of Shakespeare's
pop-culture renaissance? Let us count the ways, with selected
newspaper headlines, starting with last week's Oscar awards, at
which `Shakespeare in Love' won Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Stephen Kliment, former editor
of Architectural Record, says he often can't figure out what
today's architects and other high-concept designers are talking
about. In his book `Writing for Design Professionals,' he pleads
for clarity in proposals, letters, brochures and articles.

   OPEC-WHY-REVIEW (Vienna) _ OPEC and its oil embargoes had
considerable impact in the 1970s because a measure of anti-American
sentiment could be counted on. But in the '80s and '90s, divisions
among the Mideast oil producers (and alliances with the U.S. after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production began in Alaska and the North Sea. Now a
new political factor has taken hold, uniting OPEC's members as
never before and overcoming much of their rivalries: the cost to
their countries of low oil prices. By Youssef Ibrahim.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 28, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic rose to
power on the issue of the minority Serbs in Kosovo, the province
from which Serbs derive their defining myths of nationalism,
victimization and endurance. Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem, the
holy touchstone and center of their existence as a nation despite
all the defeats and travails of history. It is so deeply ingrained
in Serbian mythology that the West seems to have miscalculated
Milosevic's ability to abandon the issue even if he wanted to. By
Steven Erlanger. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-REVIEW (Undated) _ In trying to bring the Serbs to
heel, NATO has unwittingly married itself to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is widely seen as a terrorist group. Although the KLA's
atrocities are dwarfed by those of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the fact that it has emerged to speak for Kosovo's Albanians, and
the fact that NATO is bombing Serb targets in Kosovo, reveals a
great deal about the moral ambiguities facing outsiders who wade
into the Balkans. By Chris Hedges. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW (New York) _ The protests and arrests
at police headquarters have gotten much media coverage. Less
attention has been given to off-stage huddles between the
protesters' lawyers and police officials, often to discuss ground
rules. The police politely explained that to get arrested for
disorderly conduct, the demonstrators would have to block BOTH
entrances. In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist
arrest. Organizers have even provided police with the names of
those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and the release of the conscientious
scofflaws. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CONDUCT-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the candidates are to
be believed, the 2000 presidential campaign will be a high-toned,
polite affair. But while candidates sense that people are repulsed
by the vitriolic discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that
attacks can boomerang _ no one believes that the days of dirty,
dark politics are over. In this first post-impeachment campaign,
the trick will be to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do
so. By Richard L Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SLAVERY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slavery ended in the 1860s, but
it is only the 1990s that historians and others are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries. A
proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about slavery
are stripping away what is left of the velvety romance of benign
slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are emphasizing
the slaves' efforts to escape or rebel. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   B52-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most remarkable aircraft taking part
in NATO's strikes at Serbia is also the oldest: the B-52.
Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the production
line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force, old and slow
but still able to deliver a terrific punch anywhere in the world.
And, incredibly, the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not
expected to retire until 2044, when they will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-THEFT-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The end of the Cold War has led to
an arms race between the people who make cars and the people who
steal them. It has changed the auto theft industry by opening up a
huge new market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this business
have become more sophisticated; so have the counter-measures
designed by automakers to stop them. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S-MAGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Changes in Glamour, echoed in
other women's magazines, is part of a larger retreat _ not a
backlash of men against women but of women against feminism _ that
vexes feminist theorists and cheers conservatives. By virtue of the
articles they choose to publish, youthful women's magazines like
Cosmopolitan and Glamour seem to argue that their reader doesn't
want or need feminism; that she doesn't care much about Washington
or affirmative action, and that she isn't angry about being cheated
out of day care. By Alex Kuczynski.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _This year the Pennsylvania power company AmerGen
purchased the nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, which prompted,
well, some strange reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, 'You bought what?' '' said Ralph DeSantis of
AmerGen. ``We get that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen's investment in Three Mile Island, which only a few
years ago would have seemed as likely as buying up steam threshers,
is one of several signs that the nuclear power industry seeks to
make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Three Mile Island, which 20 years ago was the scene of the
nation's worst nuclear reactor accident, stopped the nuclear
industry cold in the United States. The disaster in Chernobyl in
the Ukraine underscored the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Since the partial meltdown of reactor No. 2 at Three Mile Island
on March 28, 1979, there have been no new nuclear plants planned or
built in the U.S. Many plants under construction at the time,
including the Zimmer power plant near Cincinnati in 1982, were
converted to coal.
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen is buying reactor No. 1 at TMI, which DeSantis points
out has continued to operate without incident for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that nuclear power, long one of the favorite
targets of environmental groups, could see a resurgence is,
ironically, the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials point out that the United States cannot meet
the stringent clean air goals outlined in the Kyoto Agreement
without nuclear power, which does not emit the so-called
``greenhouse gases'' of traditional coal-powered plants.
</P>
<P>
   John Kane, vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an
industry lobbying group, said nuclear energy will be the ``nation's
workhorse in helping to achieve air-quality goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has included about $17 billion in the
most recent budget.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in Miamisburg,
Ohio, last week, said that nuclear energy ``has a place'' in the
country's power picture.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is moving toward an answer to one of the
major problems associated with nuclear plants, disposal of high
radiation spent fuel. Congress is considering a bill to have the
government take possession of all the old nuclear waste, now stored
in various spots around the country, and disposing of it at its
deep mountain burial site in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the 104 nuclear power plants, more than
any other country, but they supply less than 20 percent of the
country's electricity. France, with just 59 reactors, gets 78
percent of its power from nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say that safety in U.S. nuclear plants has
improved since Three Mile Island, which dramatically displayed
deficiencies in operator training and warning instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, established by the
industry after TMI, reports that the number of ``significant
events'' or potential shutdowns at nuclear plants fell from a high
of 2.38 per unit in 1985 to just 0.10 per unit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data prove it _ nuclear plants are safer and more reliable
than ever,'' said Joe Colvin, president of the Nuclear Energy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure the industry's safety record has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the industry by the Union of Concerned Scientists
found that five plants were shut down for more than a year to fix
safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently the industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
have forgotten about Three Mile Island,'' said David Lochbaum of
the scientist group.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Concerned Scientists recommend that the industry:
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop risk studies based on all information
</P>
<P>
   _ Respond more quickly to warning signs
</P>
<P>
   _ Communicate more openly with the public on safety matters
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the aging of current nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 27 reactors closed after operating for an
average lifetime of 15 years, according the Safe Energy
Communication Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The council reported that a national opinion survey found six
out of 10 voters opposed building new nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-nuke groups may not be the only obstacle facing the
industry. Utility deregulation and low prices for oil and natural
gas may end up making nuclear power too expensive to compete.

 &HT;    Remembering TMI two decades after the accident
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In a matter of eight seconds in the predawn hours
of Wednesday, March 29, 1979, the nuclear power plant at Three Mile
Island in Pennsylvania went from normal operation to the brink of a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later there is still intense debate over the health
and environmental impact of the United States' worst nuclear
accident. The accident, in which the plant's radioactive fuel rods
were exposed and more than one third melted, effectively halted the
growth of nuclear power in this country.
</P>
<P>
   While 104 existing plants continue to operate, there have been
no new plants built since 1979. And many plants under construction
at the time, including the Zimmer plant partially owned by Dayton
Power &AMP; Light, were converted to coal.
</P>
<P>
   However, things could be changing.
</P>
<P>
   With coal-fired plants under fire for not meeting strict federal
clean air standards, the nuclear power industry is showing signs of
being reborn. Some industry and government representatives believe
the nation cannot meet air standards to curb global warming without
nuclear power in the mix. In fact, TMI 1 _ not the unit involved in
the accident _ was recently sold to a Pennsylvania power company.
TMI 1 has operated without incident since shortly after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power plants emit none of the so-called ``greenhouse
gases'' that spew from coal plants, but nuclear plants still
haven't successfully solved the problem of nuclear power, most
importantly disposing of the used, spent nuclear waste. The shadow
of Three Mile Island, and the even longer shadow of the accident at
Russia's Chernobyl plant, still hover over the industry. While
industry and government regulatory agencies like the Department of
Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission downplay the damage
done at Three Mile Island, outside Harrisburg, Pa., there are some
researchers who think the health effects of the accident were much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years is time enough for some hard-to-detect cancers to
start showing up. Researcher Steve Wing, an epidemiologist at the
University of North Carolina, thinks he sees statistical
indications that cancer deaths have increased in the areas downwind
from Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand the issues, first it is necessary to revisit
what happened on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and the investigations
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. on Day 1 of the accident, a pump supplying water to
TMI-2's steam generator stopped operating. Water serves two
purposes in a nuclear plant like the one designed by Babcock &AMP;
Wilcox at Three Mile Island: It supplies steam to the plant's
electric generator and cools off some of the intense heat produced
by the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's safety system shut down the steam generator. As the
reactor's coolant water temperature increased, a valve on top of a
containment tank opened as it was supposed to, releasing some of
the pressure. The valve was supposed to close 13 seconds later, but
in the first of a series of instrument failures and poor
communication between plant operators, it remained open for nearly
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Operators in the control room believed the valve was shut and
did not pump needed coolant water into the reactor. A ``loss of
coolant accident'' was in progress. Eventually, nearly one-third of
the plant's coolant water escaped through the valve.
</P>
<P>
   At about 6 a.m. some of the casings around the reactor's fuel
rods ruptured, partially uncovering the rods and sending
radioactive gas into the coolant water. Eventually, one-third of
the rods would melt down. The reaction also produced a bubble of
hydrogen in the containment building, which produced great concern
of an explosion for several days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   As radiation detection alarms went off all over the plant, the
incident was declared a general emergency at 7:20 a.m. Radiation
was released to the containment building and to the environment.
Estimates of how much radiation escaped into the air outside the
plant vary. Industry and government sources found that radiation
levels outside remained low throughout the accident. Critics
believe the releases could have been much higher downwind of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   WKBO, a radio station in Harrisburg, reported the story of TMI-2
at 8:25 a.m. Miscommunication added to the crisis. While officials
were aware of low-level releases to the environment, public
relations people from Metropolitan Edison, the plant owner, were
telling reporters there had been no release. The report added to an
atmosphere of mistrust. Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton, who in
the next three days would weigh whether to evacuate 600,000 people,
was also not quickly informed of the release.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 2 of the accident, some children under 2 and pregnant
women were told to leave the area downwind of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Day 2, radiation levels measuring 3,000
millirems per hour were recorded above the plant. (An average
X-ray, by comparison, measures 10 millirems.) Also, Met Ed released
water from showers, toilets and laundry facilities into the
Susquehanna River, some of it contaminated. Company officials did
not inform the reporters _ who by now numbered in the thousands _
of the release, adding to the level of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials
received the results of an analysis that showed damage to the
reactor core was more substantial than anticipated. There was a
possibility of greater radiation releases.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Scranton eventually decided that no evacuation was needed,
but continued to advise pregnant women and preschool children to
stay more than five miles from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, March 31, Day 4 of the accident, concern about a
possible explosion of the hydrogen bubble reached its peak, but
officials later determined that not enough oxygen was being
generated to cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous operator mistakes and miscommunications, coolant
water was restored to the reactor core, bringing it under control.
Today, TMI-2 remains in cold, monitored storage while its sister
reactor continues to produce electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history has
been the subject of hundreds of studies, but some question their
validity.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials concede that the accident was a result of
poor operator training and inadequate instruments _ faults they say
have since been addressed at the nation's nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit by 2,000 people living downwind of Three
Mile Island was dismissed in 1996 in U.S. District Court, and is
currently being appealed. Judge Sylvia Rambo ruled that there was a
``paucity'' of evidence that the accident caused ill health
effects.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Carolina researcher Wing, at the request of
the litigants, re-examined data from a 1990 Columbia University
study that found no increased cancer rates after Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the January 1997 journal, Environmental Health
Perspectives , Wing found lung cancer incidence elevated 300-400
percent and leukemia rates up by 600-700 percent among those in the
direct path of the radiation plume released at Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   The report touched off a lively debate on methodology and
statistics between the authors of the two major studies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wing and the Columbia researchers, however, say further
health studies need to be done. The data used for both was
collected between 1981-85, too soon for some cancers to make an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said the Columbia report errs in assuming too low an
exposure rate from the accident and not including enough cancers.
Industry officials say that more than a dozen health studies since
1979, including a Pennsylvania Health Department registry of 35,000
people living near the plant, show no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more attention needs to be paid to it,'' Wing said.
``I don't feel the book should be closed at all. There is something
to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 book, Deadly Deceit by Dr. Jay M. Gould and Benjamin
Goldman, also claims that cancer and mortality rates in the areas
closest to Three Mile Island are higher than reported and suggest a
link to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of Wing's study, he said, is that it looked
at rates both upwind and downwind of the accident, and the rates
downwind are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes our re-analysis so interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said that in addition to collecting more health data, the
whole process of the nuclear regulatory agencies should be opened
up to encourage more community participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the first to say that our study doesn't prove by
itself that there were high-level radiation exposures, but it is
part of a body of evidence that is consistent with high
exposures,'' Wing said. ``The cancer findings, along with studies
of animals, plants and chromosomal damage in Three Mile Island area
residents, all point to much higher radiation levels that
previously reported.''

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is a politician to his core, a man of
persuasion, not intimidation. He has always been ambivalent about
the use of force to accomplish his purposes, an ambivalence that
mirrors his still uneasy relationship with the American military.
</P>
<P>
   And when he is forced by events _ or by his own threats _ to use
American military might, as he did this week in Yugoslavia, he does
so only reluctantly, and tentatively. He sets limited ends and
applies limited means, doing everything he can to minimize the risk
to American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He uses stand-off weapons in remote-control combat, keeping
pilots tens of thousands of feet above their targets and missileers
hundreds of miles away from theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adopted this low-risk, high-technology approach to
warfare after President Bush's last military foray became his first
_ the dispatch of soldiers on a humanitarian mission to Somalia _
and ended in humiliation and bloodshed. The other times Clinton
deployed large numbers of ground troops, in Haiti and in Bosnia,
came only after he received assurances they would not engage in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Clinton administration's use of power surely
reflects the evolution of military technology, but the thinking of
the commander in chief is an even stronger factor.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering office, Clinton has employed force or the threat
of force as a tool of foreign policy a dozen times. But he has
never articulated what could be called a ``Clinton Doctrine'' that
guides his foreign policy or that informs his decisions to use
force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, reflecting the range of problems he is addressing,
Clinton has drawn on a dozen different rationales for using power
in the pursuit of peace. Critics say the wide-ranging aims amount
to no aims at all; the Clinton Doctrine, they say, is expediency
and an ingrained aversion to conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the president has come to formulating a foreign
policy doctrine was in his first inaugural address, at a time when
he was criticizing Bush's reluctance to use force to halt the
ethnic slaughter in Bosnia and was promising a more muscular
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and
conscience of the international community is defied,'' the newly
elected Clinton said on Jan. 20, 1993, ``we will act _ with
peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   His words were a conscious echo of President Kennedy's vow in
his 1961 inaugural address to ``pay any price, bear any burden'' to
ensure the survival of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But time and the tides of history have tempered Clinton's
resolution. He did not act with force in Bosnia until 30 months
later, after tens of thousands more civilians died, in part because
the Europeans were unwilling to intervene in the charnel of their
own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 18 dead Army Rangers in Somalia in 1993 and Saddam
Hussein's continued defiance in Iraq have left the president
chastened.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in what could be heard as more apology than
explanation for his dispatch of American planes and missiles to
Yugoslavia, Clinton said somberly, in a speech to a federal
employees union: ``Now, I think if the American people don't know
anything else about me, they know that I don't like to use military
force, and I do everything I can to avoid it. But if we have to do
it, then that's part of the job, and I will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has. The president launched cruise missile attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan to punish suspected terrorists; he acted in
Bosnia and Kosovo to deter a dictator and stop genocide; he ordered
an invasion of Haiti to restore an elected leader to power; he
bombed Iraq numerous times to compel compliance with U.N. mandates
or in retaliation for suspected terrorist acts. In some cases, as
in the Balkans, the reasons included preventing wider war and
stemming the flow of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   While this may appear a grab bag of rationales, Sandy Berger,
the president's national security adviser, said in an interview on
Friday that they represent a consistent set devised over the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we have confronted is whether military force can
be an instrument of American national interest in situations short
of all-out war,'' Berger said. ``The president has rejected the
idea that the choices in Kosovo are invading Serbia or watching the
Kosovars get slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was willing to order U.S. forces into limited
action in this instance and in others, Berger said, after he was
satisfied that the national interest was at stake, that the mission
was achievable at an acceptable cost, that the goals are clear and
that all peaceful means have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Clinton agonizes over these decisions and acts
only when the consequences of inaction are ``truly catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's restrained criteria for the use of force
replaced an earlier foreign policy formulation _ ``assertive
multilateralism'' _ that harnessed American decision making to that
of the United Nations and other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
   That approach had been ridiculed as wishy-washy and unbecoming
to the globe's sole superpower, and critics said Clinton would be
sacrificing American sovereignty to the bureaucrats and
blue-helmeted peacekeepers of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the roots of Clinton's martial reticence lie in his
personal history, some in his tenuous political position and some
in the inherent instability in the world that he inherited in the
dust of the Cold War.

 WASHINGTON: Cold War.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton says his instincts as a conciliator stem from his youth,
when he was forced to intercede to stop his alcoholic stepfather
from abusing his mother. He has said he wants to be remembered as
the ``repairer of the breach'' described in the book of Isaiah.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, a bearded Bill Clinton avoided the draft and
organized protests against the Vietnam War. He wrote the commander
of his home-state ROTC unit that he loved his country but
``loathed'' the military.
</P>
<P>
   He further alienated the armed forces when, shortly after taking
office, he moved to end discrimination against gay people in the
military. He was rescued by a face-saving compromise engineered by
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, but
lasting damage was done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former Naval aviator and
prisoner-of-war in Vietnam, said that the mutual suspicion between
Clinton and the military has abated somewhat, ``but there's still
not a great deal of respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel are particularly galled by the apparent
double standard applied to sexual misconduct in the White House and
in the armed forces, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like it,'' McCain said, ``but it doesn't affect
their day-to-day work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although White House aides emphatically deny it, the friction
with the Pentagon has in some ways shaped Clinton's deliberations
on the use of force and the way he has applied it.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly after the episode in Somalia, when the humanitarian
relief mission deteriorated into a firefight with armed bandits in
Mogadishu, Clinton has been reluctant of sending ground forces into
a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   He was prepared to dispatch 15,000 troops to Haiti to restore
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power forcibly, but the planned
invasion became a bloodless occupation after a last-minute deal was
brokered by Powell and former President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his military operations have involved
high-technology, relatively risk-free strikes from afar. Since last
August, Clinton has rained ordnance on Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq
and, now, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   American peacekeepers remain in Bosnia, but they did not arrive
until the parties agreed to lay down their arms in 1995 and no
American serviceman or woman has been killed in combat there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of 1993, Clinton was very affected by the
view that Americans don't care about foreign affairs,'' said
Michael Beschloss, a historian in Washington. ``He has been more
quiet about foreign policy than any president since Hoover, and
that makes it tougher when he needs to use force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk to the American people about Haiti until 72
hours before the invasion was to begin,'' Beschloss said. ``It was
the same thing here. We haven't heard him talk about Kosovo
consistently, so when it happened the American people didn't
understand the frame of reference or the need to use force.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One result has been public skepticism about the Balkan
operation. Polls show that Clinton's overall approval ratings have
remained high, but public support for his handling of foreign
policy has slipped since he ordered the airstrikes against Kosovo
and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, presidential approval ratings benefit from a
``rally 'round the flag effect,'' a surge of public support that
typically accompanies foreign actions. For example, Clinton's
approval rating jumped 7 percentage points after the airstrike on
Baghdad in 1993, and rose by 9 percentage points after the
occupation of Haiti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But a CBS News poll, conducted after the president's speech to
the nation on Wednesday, showed a decline in support for his
handling of foreign affairs to 60 percent from 69 percent in
January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Clinton count on the unquestioning support of Congress
when he commits American forces to combat. When he ordered an
attack on Iraq last December just as the House was to vote on two
articles of impeachment against him, the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, and other leading Republicans openly questioned the
timing and Clinton's motives.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been shocking in an earlier day or under a
different president.
</P>
<P>
   It is that very climate that helps explain why Clinton chooses
to project power mostly from a safe distance. A major commitment of
ground forces _ with potentially large loss of life _ is difficult
to contemplate for a president who engenders such distrust, not
only among his adversaries, but among his allies as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton vacillates a lot,'' said a former senior military
officer who served at the National Security Council during
Clinton's first term, ``because of the political capital he doesn't
have and has never had.''
</P>
<P>
   In politics as in war, the side with the stronger army dictates
the terms of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standard U.S. military doctrine says that you create the
conditions to force the battle to be fought on your terms,'' the
officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But Clinton has
never been good at dictating terms, either at home or abroad.
That's why there is no `Clinton Doctrine' as such. It's the
doctrine of the day, whatever you have to do right now to get by.''

NEW FAST-SPREADING VIRUS TAKES INTERNET BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A rapidly spreading computer virus forced
several large corporations to shut down their e-mail servers on
Friday night as it rode the Internet on a global rampage, several
leading network security companies reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The security companies said early reports of the virus, which is
carried by e-mail, led them to believe that tens of thousands of
home and business computers had been infected on Friday alone. The
virus reproduces itself exponentially, they said, trying to use
each infected message to send 50 more infected messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest-spreading virus we've seen,'' said Srivats
Sampath, general manager for the McAfee Software division of
Network Associates, a Santa Clara company that makes anti-virus
software.
</P>
<P>
   Network security experts said that the virus appeared to do no
harm to the machines it infected and that individuals could easily
disable it. But they said its purpose is to interrupt networks by
replicating itself so rapidly that it overwhelms networks and
e-mail servers, the electronic post offices that direct message
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail infected with the virus, which its creators call Melissa,
has a topic line that begins, ``Important Message From.'' Next is
the sender's name, which is often the name of a friend, fellow
worker or someone else known to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The message within the e-mail is short and innocuous: ``Here is
that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)''
Attached to it is a 40,000-byte, or 40K, Microsoft Word document
named list.doc.
</P>
<P>
   When the recipient opens list.doc, the Melissa virus
automatically searches for an e-mail address book. It then sends a
copy of itself _ the message and attachment _ from the recipient to
the first 50 names it finds in the recipient's address book, which
accounts for the rapid acceleration across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is known to spread rapidly with two popular e-mail
programs, Microsoft Outlook and a slimmed-down version of the same
program, Microsoft Outlook Express, which is part of the Windows 98
operating system and is often installed with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Network security administrators said they had seen no evidence
that Melissa was able to open and use the address books in other
e-mail programs, but they did not rule out the possibility that it
could and would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-virus software makers posted software on their Web
sites that their customers can download to detect the virus-encoded
message and refuse it.
</P>
<P>
   A fix for the general public was available on
http://www.sendmail.com, the Web site of Sendmail, the Emeryville
company whose post-office software is often used to direct mail on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Allman, a co-founder of Sendmail, said he was concerned
that the problem would worsen on Monday morning when employees find
these messages in their e-mail in-boxes. ``This will get into a lot
of mail boxes and lay dormant,'' he said. When employees come in at
8 a.m. and read these messages, it will cause an explosive growth
of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman characterized the virus' virulence as ``not the worst I'd
seen, but it's pretty bad.'' He added, however, that it appeared to
be the fastest-replicating virus he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can avoid contracting or spreading the virus simply
by not opening the attachment that accompanies the e-mail. Opening
the message alone will not cause the virus to copy the address list
and send itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, users can disarm the virus by disabling the type
of program that contains it _ ``macros,'' which are small
applications used to automate tasks in Microsoft Word documents.
Disabling macros in Microsoft Word will render the virus
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Microsoft said they were not certain of the
magnitude of the virus and emphasized that it could be easily
disarmed. Adam Sohn, a company spokesman, said, ``If folks are
careful about what runs on their machine, they'll always be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus overwhelmed employees on Friday at GCI Group, a public
relations firm with offices throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One contract employee, who exchanges mail with a number of
company employees, said she received more than 500 messages during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hosed my entire day,'' said the employee, Leigh Anne
Varney. ``You can't print the words I used. I've never had this
happen before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This hardly is the first virus to attack and spread
automatically via e-mail, but it is the first to move from being a
controlled, essentially experimental form ``into the wild,'' said
Dan Schrader, director of product marketing for Trend Micro, an
anti-virus software maker in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid spread of the program was reminiscent of a 1988
program, known as a worm, written by Robert Tappan Morris, then a
graduate student in computer science at Cornell University. Morris'
program spread through the Internet with remarkable speed,
ultimately disabling more than 6,000 computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Internet was tiny in 1988 compared with the size of
today's network. As a result the potential for the spread of the
program is truly vast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen anything impact this many people on the
Internet in a long time,'' said Schrader. He said that three of his
company's customers had temporarily shut down their e-mail servers
to delete the infected mail.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wrote the virus also left the message ``W97M _
Melissa.'' The note said the virus was created by ``Kwyjibo,''
which Trend Micro officials speculated is a reference to the
television show ``The Simpsons.'' In an episode of the Simpsons
titled ``Bart the Genius,'' Bart Simpson wins a Scrabble game by
using the ``word'' Kwyjibo.
</P>
<P>
   The theory dovetails with a second impact of the virus: Once the
virus has infected a computer, it will type a message on the screen
when the time of day corresponds to the date (on March 26 it would
be 3:26). The message reads: ``Twenty-two points, plus
triple-word-score, plus 50 points for using all my letters. Game's
over. I'm outta here.''

 &HT;    Redskins sale not a done deal
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As NFL owners continue to scrutinize the heavily leveraged $800
million bid of Howard Milstein to purchase the Washington Redskins,
they are taking increasing note of the manner in which he has
operated the NHL's New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear they don't like what they have witnessed the past few
weeks. With the Isles doomed to a fifth consecutive season missing
the playoffs, the club has traded six players since March 9, paring
$6.45 million from the payroll. The result is a barely competitive
team that features six rookies and six other players with less than
100 games of NHL experience. General manager Mike Milbury recently
conceded the team ``doesn't have a plan'' for the future.
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised if Daniel Snyder, a partner to
Milstein and man viewed with more favor by the league, splits and
attempts to buy the Skins himself. The more likely scenario is that
the trustees for the estate of late owner Jack Kent Cooke put the
team back on the market and Phoenix businessman Sam Grossman lands
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an example of how awkward things are for current
Redskins management while the team's future is in limbo occurred at
Champ Bailey's workout in Athens last Wednesday. The session was
attended by current Redskins GM Charley Casserly and Vinny Cerrato,
the man who could replace him. Cerrato is former personnel director
with the 49ers and was hired as a consultant by Milstein to monitor
team activities.
</P>
<P>
   Helping hand
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler is taking an off-field role in improving the
Falcons' on-field outlook. The veteran quarterback reshuffled his
contract Friday, agreeing to take about $3 million of his $3.5
million salary for 1999 as a signing bonus. The nifty bit of
bookkeeping created more than $3 million in salary cap room for
Atlanta. It will enable the Falcons to sign guard Greg Bishop and
pursue more free agents. The team remains tempted by Cincinnati
free agent cornerback Ashley Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Go Ricky
</P>
<P>
   The most debated player in the draft continues to be Heisman
tailback Ricky Williams of Texas. New Orleans GM Billy Kuharich and
coach Mike Ditka last Tuesday raised their offer _ all six
selections in this year's draft and first- and third-round choices
in the 2000 draft _ for Williams. But the team most likely to
consider such a blockbuster swap, Indianapolis, suddenly is hot for
Williams as well. The Colts braintrust will attend the workouts of
only two players, Williams and Bailey. It now appears the Colts,
who own the No. 4 pick, feel that may be too high to take Southern
Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne, who had only an average workout
last week. The Colts granted agent Rocky Arceneaux permission to
seek a trade for incumbent tailback Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Upset that league owners still have made no proposal to NFL
Coaches Association executive director Larry Kennan for improving
benefits, assistants for some teams want to escalate pressure.
Kennan, though, has calmed constituents and feels an offer will be
made at the May owners meetings in Atlanta. ... Florida linebacker
Jevon Kearse had a tremendous workout for scouts last week. At his
campus session, the 255-pounder clocked a 4.43 time in the 40 and
had a 40 1/2-inch vertical jump. ... Raiders owner Al Davis is
carrying a league-high $11 million in ``dead money,'' dollars that
count against the '99 salary cap for players no longer with the
team. ... Players whose draft stock is on the rise: C Damien Woody
(Boston College), OT Luke Pettigout (Notre Dame), DE Patrick Kerney
(Virginia), RB Shawn Bryson (Tennessee), OG Brandon Burlsworth
(Arkansas), SS Rich Coady (Texas A&AMP;M), LB Barry Gardner
(Northwestern), QB Shaun King (Tulane) and LB Mike Peterson
(Florida). ... If Ditka can't land Williams, he may attempt to deal
up a few spots and take UCLA quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants
</P>
<P>
   How one NFC personnel director rated the top players remaining
in the unrestricted free agent pool: LB Jamir Miller (Arizona),
Ambrose (Cincinnati), DE Derrick Alexander (Minnesota), OT Wayne
Gandy (St. Louis), CB Ryan McNeil (St. Louis), DT Jerry Ball
(Minnesota), LB Marvcus Patton (Washington), WR Sean Dawkins (New
Orleans), LB Anthony Davis (Kansas City) and QB Jeff George
(Oakland).
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   San Diego rookie coach Mike Riley on how quarterback Ryan Leaf
will handle the addition of veteran Jim Harbaugh: ``It may be a
blow to him. There's still a bit of shell-shock from last year, but
I hope he'll realize this takes the microscope off him for a little
while.

   Antagonisms between Serbs and Albanians have marked Kosovo's
history since the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Christian
Serb forces seized the province in October 1912 during the first
Balkan War. Massive recriminations against local Muslim Albanians
followed, including the burning of villages and forced conversions,
which were described by reporters, including the Vienna
correspondent of the Ukrainian newspaper Kievskaia Mysl, Lev
Bronshtein, later known as Leon Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Serbs made up about 25 percent of a population of
about 300,000; most of the rest were Muslims who identified
themselves as either Turks or Albanians. An estimated 20,000
Albanians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Serb rule, periodic revolts by Albanian guerrillas known
as kacaks broke out. The government confiscated land for Serb
settlers, many of whom formed armed bands known as chetniks to
fight the kacaks. Perhaps 70,000 Serbs settled between the wars;
nearly 100,000 Albanians were driven out.
</P>
<P>
   When Italy and Germany occupied Kosovo in 1941, the Albanians,
armed by the fascists, forced out at least 40,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tito's partisans took the province, after quelling a
rebellion that left as many as 10,000 Albanians dead. Tito largely
suppressed ethnic rivalries and in 1974 granted Kosovo autonomy;
harassment of Serbs increased and perhaps as many as 50,000 left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic, then Serbia's president, revoked
Kosovo's autonomy. Some 200,000 Serbs were left _ 10 percent of the
population.

   Antagonisms between Serbs and Albanians have marked Kosovo's
history since the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Christian
Serb forces seized the province in October 1912 during the first
Balkan War. Massive recriminations against local Muslim Albanians
followed, including the burning of villages and forced conversions,
which were described by reporters, including the Vienna
correspondent of the Ukrainian newspaper Kievskaia Mysl, Lev
Bronshtein, later known as Leon Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Serbs made up about 25 percent of a population of
about 300,000; most of the rest were Muslims who identified
themselves as either Turks or Albanians. An estimated 20,000
Albanians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Serb rule, periodic revolts by Albanian guerrillas known
as kacaks broke out. The government confiscated land for Serb
settlers, many of whom formed armed bands known as chetniks to
fight the kacaks. Perhaps 70,000 Serbs settled between the wars;
nearly 100,000 Albanians were driven out.
</P>
<P>
   When Italy and Germany occupied Kosovo in 1941, the Albanians,
armed by the fascists, forced out at least 40,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tito's partisans took the province, after quelling a
rebellion that left as many as 10,000 Albanians dead. Tito largely
suppressed ethnic rivalries and in 1974 granted Kosovo autonomy;
harassment of Serbs increased and perhaps as many as 50,000 left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic, then Serbia's president, revoked
Kosovo's autonomy. Some 200,000 Serbs were left _ 10 percent of the
population.

CLINTON SAYS NATO ALLIES NEED TO `STAY THE COURSE'

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As United States and NATO aircraft entered the
fourth day of strikes on Serbian targets, President Clinton said
Saturday that allied forces must ``stay the course'' to prevent the
war in Kosovo from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that Serbian troops
have continued to attack civilians and burn villages in the
province of Kosovo, a region of Serbia with a large ethnic Albanian
population that seeks greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the aim of the allied military operation is to halt
the repression in Kosovo and to keep the war from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, and we will, continue until Serbia's leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity
to make war,'' Clinton said. Milosevic is the president of
Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the major entity.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in an address to the nation Wednesday night announcing
the start of the air campaign, Clinton referred to the Balkans as a
``powder keg at the heart of Europe'' that has ignited wider war
before in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have learned the hard way that our home is not that
far from Europe,'' the president said Saturday. ``Through two world
wars and a long Cold War, we saw that it was a short step from a
small brush fire to an inferno, especially in the tinderbox of the
Balkans. The time to put out a fire is before it spreads and burns
down the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been smoldering since it unraveled after the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. NATO and the United States
have intervened with force twice _ in Bosnia in 1995 and now in
Kosovo _ when the killing became intolerable and the Serbian
leadership refused to accept settlement terms dictated by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Saturday, as he has said several times this week,
that the United States acted now ``to prevent a wider war we would
have to confront later, only at far greater risk and cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the American goal was a peaceful and united Europe,
but that achieving that end now requires the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to fight in order to end the fighting,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the skill and courage of American forces engaged
in the conflict _ pilots, technicians, air traffic controllers and
mechanics. He said that all 19 members of NATO are contributing to
the effort, some with combat aircraft, others with bases, money or
support personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo had accepted a
peace agreement negotiated at Rambouillet, outside of Paris, two
weeks ago that would grant them autonomy but not independence.
Milosevic's refusal to sign the accord and his stepped-up campaign
of force in Kosovo were the triggers for this week's military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked these people of Kosovo to accept peace, and they
did,'' Clinton said. ``We promised them we would stick by them if
they did the right thing, and they did. We cannot let them down
now.''

AROUND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MOSCOW, A NIP OF COLD WAR IS IN THE
AIR

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Caught up in the belligerent hysteria that has filled
the sidewalks in front of the American Embassy here for the last
three days, Aleksei Yermakov could not have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around, there are only young people,'' said Yermakov, a
40-year-old interpreter, grinning at the black-jacketed youths
shouting obscenities and throwing eggs, beer and paint at the
embassy's mustard yellow walls. ``Isn't it wonderful?''
</P>
<P>
   Yermakov came here on Wednesday night as NATO launched its first
bombs against Yugoslavia. By his account, things got off to a nasty
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climbed up on embassy cars, jumped on them, scratched
swastikas on them,'' he said gleefully. ``We went down to the gate
where the employees live. One came out to move his car. We
surrounded him, and he had to call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other protesters, Yermakov came to the U.S. Embassy to
show his support for the Serbs, seen here as Slavic Davids under
attack by an American Goliath. But those centuries-old sympathies
are only one reason for the sudden outbreak of a virulent
anti-American virus in Moscow last week.
</P>
<P>
   For many Russians, the issue was not so much the rediscovery of
an old Slavic brotherhood as the re-emergence of a familiar enemy:
Uncle Sam. If during the Cold War Soviet propaganda warned about
creeping American hegemony, today, as the American-led forces of
NATO launched wave after wave of missiles at Yugoslav targets, it
seemed to some here as though that hegemony had taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do many Russians see NATO's use of force as wrong,
misguided or criminal. They also view it as a reminder of their
powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is a great country,'' said Yermakov, turning serious.
``The main thing is to respect ourselves. I look at the Serbs and I
am jealous. They have such faith in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Manilov runs an ad hoc recruitment center for volunteers
signing up to fight for Serbia, set up under the auspices of the
political party headed by the ultranationalist Vladimir V.
Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men understand that today it's Serbia, tomorrow it could
be Russia,'' he said. ``NATO could decide to interfere anywhere _
in Chechnya, for example,'' he added, referring to the Russians'
own breakaway region in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hatred of the American people,'' chimed in a young
man, sitting at a table nearby, waiting to sign up volunteers. ``It
is the American government that wants to take over all of Europe.
They are bringing their own order to Yugoslavia by the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a government formed by Washington, and they are
doing it with military force,'' added the young man, who declined
to give his name. He was alluding to the leaders of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority, who have signed a proposed peace accord for the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Manilov, about 350 people had signed up at the
Moscow volunteer center, where a row of military boots and other
gear were on display beneath a big television screen blaring the
latest news from Yugoslavia. He claimed that more than 10,000 had
signed up at recruitment centers around Russia, where they now
await visas to Yugoslavia and further orders.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Gusev, 21, a disk jockey at a Moscow nightclub, came to
the center dressed in jeans and a camouflage jacket. ``What is
going on is out of control,'' he said. ``I don't understand how you
can bomb like this. It reminds me of Hitler. The Germans attacked
in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such one-sided perceptions of the conflict are not so strange,
given the information about Kosovo available to the average
Russian, said a political analyst, Andrei Piontkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would join this hysteria too if I only watched Russian
television,'' he said. ``Then my perception would be of a small
Serbian nation attacked by an armada led by the most powerful
country in the world. Nobody here knows much about the atrocities
against Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, of course, the main issue is the impression that has been
made very clearly that Russia is not playing in the superleague,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a definite Cold War ring to the reaction in Moscow.
Communist Party chiefs fulminated against imperialistic aggression,
the foreign minister lectured the West on its lack of morality, and
at a news conference the chief of the General Staff, Anatoly
Kvashnin, took out his pointer and went to the map to show the
pattern of what he termed enemy strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference between this and the Cold War era is that
this time Russia is no longer a key player. Its military is not
involved in the conflict, and its diplomacy has yet to make an
impact on its outcome. The television reports of the all-night
vigils being kept at the Ministry of Defense seemed almost
poignant, a Sunset Boulevard performance by a former superpower.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, for all the operational information
generated by the Russian general staff, much of it turned out to be
wrong _ like a statement attributed to Defense Minister Igor D.
Sergeyev that NATO was preparingto send in 22,000 ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a rundown on the first night of NATO action, Kvashnin
noted at a news conference that the Russian military had
``preliminary information'' that two NATO fighter jets _ a Tornado
and an F-16 _ and several cruise missiles had been downed. ``For
some reason,'' he said ominously, ``nothing is being said about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the reason for NATO's silence was that the
downings _ also reported by Yugoslavia's state-controlled news
media _ had not taken place. To some, the general's fumbling
performance was a sign that Moscow's generals were going through
old, outdated motions, trying to puff up their role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, there is nothing strange about the fact that the
general's speech was muffled and confused,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, a Russian journalist and defense analyst. ``I believe
they are all having a 24-hour party, celebrating the return of the
enemy. They are having a really good time. They are pretending that
they are more important than they really are.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview last week, Prime Minister Yevgeny M.
Primakov insisted that Russia was not being left on the sidelines,
noting that Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain was waiting for
his call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are turning to us, they are turning to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others were drawing more ominous conclusions about the
political shift in Russia. ``The side effect of the strikes is the
long-awaited breakthrough of `new political thinking' in Russia,''
wrote Leonid Radzikhovsky, a columnist in the newspaper Segodnya.
``This something new is something old that was not completely
forgotten _ xenophobia, envy-hatred toward America, an inferiority
complex of a former empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that the strikes will give, in the end, a real
and bloody justification for hatred of the `blood-stained West'
that has been accuumulating for a long time,'' he wrote, noting the
triumphant ``roar of delight'' from Russian generals and Communist
Party chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the roar of winners,'' he added. ``It is a political and
psychological victory over the more important enemy _ over Russia,
its society, its people.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Russian military's newspaper, ran a
front-page article pointing to the NATO strikes as proof of what
the newspaper said was Washington's illusion that it can still lay
claim to the role of ``world dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why it is like another sign from heaven for Russia,''
the commentator Vadim Markushin wrote. ``It is time to use our own
mind, time to look after ourselves, our economy and our security,
and the strengthening of our armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to understand at last that neither the West nor
anyone else can in principle be interested in a strong Russia,'' he
wrote, before making a pitch for a regathering of the old Soviet
empire, starting with Belarus and Ukraine, Russia's two Slavic
neighbors. ``We should speed up the creation of a union with
Belarus, come up with a clear intitiative in respect to a reunion
with Ukraine (let us not be afraid of this radicalism) and turn the
Community of Independent States into a community in the real, not
just formal, meaning of the word.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At shabby Istanbul hotels where refugees from
the conflict in Kosovo are arriving by the hundreds, the men drink
tea and chain-smoke to keep the tears away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to leave everything behind, including our parents and
our brothers and sisters,'' said one of them, a strapping auto
mechanic in his mid-20s, as he stood in a dim corridor. ``We had
neighbors who were murdered with knives. At any moment our parents
...''
</P>
<P>
   At this the man broke down into sobs, retreated into his room
and collapsed onto a bed. His wife, standing outside, began weeping
softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pristina used to be such a nice place,'' she said, referring
to the capital of the Serbian province of Kosovo. ``Now every house
and every mosque is on fire. Serbian families write `S' on their
doors. If you don't have an `S,' the Serb gangs come to burn and
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In this family, the husband refused to give his name, saying he
feared reprisals against relatives left behind. The woman, who gave
her first name as Lume, said she considered herself ``amazingly
lucky'' to have been able to escape.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo have arrived in
Turkey in recent days. Most have melted into the large Albanian
community in Istanbul, and others like Lume and her family will
probably find refuge in private homes soon.
</P>
<P>
   Several million people in Istanbul are of Albanian extraction, a
legacy of the centuries when Albania was under Ottoman rule, and
many people here feel an instinctive solidarity with anyone who
comes from there.
</P>
<P>
   Although some countries have been reluctant to accept refugees
from the current wave of turmoil in Kosovo, Turkey has opened its
arms. Turks consider their country a logical haven for Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, whom they see in part as Muslim victims of
Christian oppression. Headlines over newspaper stories reporting
their arrival declare ``They Have Nowhere Else'' and ``Emigration
or Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have vowed to accept and provide for all
refugees from Kosovo who are able to make their way here. They have
strongly supported the bombing campaign by NATO, of which Turkey is
a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of the NATO operation is to break Yugoslavia's ability
to wage war,'' President Suleyman Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees interviewed in Istanbul described harrowing 30-hour
trips in buses crammed with 80 or more people. Several said their
money and valuables had been stolen or extorted from them by police
officers who stopped them as they crossed Serbia. From Serbia, they
drove through Bulgaria to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some buses were allowed only to take women and children,''
said a driver who, like other refugees, declined to give his name.
``Others were turned back altogether. Some have just disappeared.
The ones that make it are full of screaming children and people who
have driven through areas where homes are on fire and bombs are
going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Several refugees said they could not imagine returning home
until foreign troops were on the ground to protect them.
Yugoslavia's refusal to admit such a force set off the current wave
of bombing. There seems little prospect that the United States or
other outside countries will send ground troops to Kosovo as long
as Yugoslav units are there and ready to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   At a camp near Istanbul formerly used to shelter Bosnian
refugees, the Turkish authorities are preparing to house several
hundred families from Kosovo. It has not been necessary to use the
camp so far, however, because many families in Istanbul have
volunteered their hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several waves of emigration from Albania to
Turkey over the years, so many of these refugees have relatives
here,'' said Nusret Kallura, who emigrated seven years ago and is
now helping to arrange shelter for new arrivals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he spoke, he took calls on a cell phone from bus drivers,
disoriented refugees and others caught up in the exodus. He said he
expected that 800 to 1,000 refugees from Kosovo would arrive in
Turkey each day for at least the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every group that arrives has new stories about the lawyer who
was killed with his two sons, or about the 22 teachers who were
shot, or some other atrocity,'' Kallura said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people in Turkey are opening their hearts and homes. We
even have families who say they don't have relatives coming, but
they'll take people they don't know. All of us feel that if we or
our parents or grandparents hadn't left in time, this could be
happening to us.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Serbian forces stepped up attacks against
ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo on Saturday as NATO air
operations rattled Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, in the heaviest
attacks of the campaign, said allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages,'' said British Defense
Minister George Robertson in London. ``There are reports that the
Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration. There are
clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against the Albanian
population has started.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, for the first time, people heard large explosions
before air-raid sirens sounded, suggesting that Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system has been damaged around the capital,
as NATO has asserted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that
allied forces must ``stay the course'' to prevent the war in Kosovo
from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, and we will, continue until Serbia's leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity
to make war,'' Clinton said. Milosevic is president of Yugoslavia,
which consists of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday there were no visible signs that Milosevic was backing
off. All of Serbia's television channels played patriotic themes
Saturday and broadcast news coverage of NATO attacks and of
protests against them in Greece and Russia. Reports that at least
four NATO planes were shot down were later denied by NATO, but the
denials were not shown on television there.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Serbian troops continued their rampage against the
ethnic Albanians, burning homes and villages and rounding up
Albanian men. There were continued reports, still unconfirmed, of
forced marches, beatings and mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happening because of NATO,'' Robertson said.
``This violence was going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   Only continued air strikes by the allies can halt the Serbian
offensive, Robertson said, adding, ``We are now targeting the
headquarters and command and control centers that are clearly
critical in carrying out these attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies planned to continue bombing those targets and
anti-aircraft defenses throughout Yugoslavia on Saturday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain said in a Brussels briefing
that in operations that ended before dawn Saturday, ``some of the
airplanes turned back because of the weather, but manned aircraft
did get through to their targets last night.'' In all, 249 allied
planes took to the air Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs dropped from aircraft and warheads of cruise missiles
struck military targets around Belgrade, the southeastern Serbian
city of Nis, and six areas in and around Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have given only sketchy accounts of damage from
its air raids because they say it will take time to analyze
photographs taken after the attacks. And without people on the
ground, they say, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and other officials warned Milosevic on Saturday not
to try to retaliate by attacking international peacekeepers in
neighboring Bosnia or Macedonia. About 12,000 allied soldiers in
Macedonia are preparing for missions to enforce a peace agreement
in Kosovo if, as the allies hope, the bombing forces Milosevic to
accept one.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no sign of being ready to do that Saturday as the
Serbian offensive against ethnic Albanian positions in Kosovo
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have no confirmation, a campaign of killing, looting,
harassment and intimidation of ethnic Albanians is possible,''
Wilby said. Jamie Shea, the alliance's chief spokesman, said the
allies had received unconfirmed reports of large-scale Serbian
actions against thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know a large number of Albanian women and children were
pushed across the Albanian border without any men, which suggests
that ethnic cleansing is taking place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, he added, will do their best to see that Serbian
authorities who may be responsible for atrocities against civilians
will be prosecuted for them by the international criminal tribunal
in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   With all international observers out of Kosovo for more than a
week, allied officials said they had no way of checking reports
from ethnic Albanian journalists and others of multiple atrocities
against civilians by Serbian army soldiers and Interior Ministry
policemen in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here disputed Serbian news reports that two NATO
planes had been shot down Friday night. ``All NATO aircraft have
returned safely to their bases,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade television broadcast images showing the Yugoslav
capital almost deserted by shoppers Saturday after heavy overnight
missile raids aimed at military targets on the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Stinging chemical fumes wafted over parts of the city Saturday
after allied warplanes bombed a rocket fuel depot in the Ibarska
Magistrala area in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation that
signed the peace agreement that Milosevic refused to accept in
Paris earlier this month, said that Serbian military and police
sweeps through Kosovo could only be stopped by sending in NATO
ground forces, an Austrian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and European officials at the alliance headquarters
here said Saturday that none of the alliance's 19 countries were
even considering such a step, and military officials at command
headquarters in Mons said that the alliance's political authorities
had not asked them to prepare for an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no current plans for ground operations,'' said Wilby,
adding later, ``Currently, there are no plans for us to take on
ground operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   French Defense Minister Alain Richard told the daily Le Figaro,
``Sending ground troops in is foreseen only in the context of
implementing a political agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, the chief of the British Defense
Staff, said in London that the bombing of army and police
headquarters last week had already significantly disrupted Serbia's
ability to continue the offensive in Kosovo. ``We know the Yugoslav
army has been badly rattled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the integrated air defense systems of
the Yugoslavs have been severely degraded,'' the general added.
``I'm not, certainly, saying that he has lost his ability to hit an
aircraft, but he's going to find it much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes have shot down five of the most advanced
fighter-bomber aircraft in the Yugoslav arsenal, MiG-29s.
</P>
<P>
   Adding details to earlier accounts of a dogfight Friday
afternoon in which two NATO F-15s shot down two advanced MiG-29
Yugoslav planes over Bosnia, Wilby said the MiGs had apparently
intended to try to lure the NATO planes across the border into
Serbia to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aircraft turned toward them in rule-book fashion and shot
them down,'' he said. The wreckage of one lies in a minefield in a
sector of Bosnia patrolled by Russian troops serving with the
alliance-led peacekeeping force, he said, and the other MiG went
down in an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the pilots was not known Saturday. If Russian
soldiers found a surviving pilot, Wilby said, he was sure they
would turn him over to allied authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's continued participation in the Bosnia operation came
under question Saturday after Moscow threw out the alliance's
liaison officer in Moscow. Russian cooperation with the alliance
has been suspended since the allies began the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the allies kept attacking air defense targets Saturday,
releasing pictures of damage done to a surface-to-air missile site
in Jakovo outside Belgrade and of a Serbian airfield at Batajnica
showing a number of hangars destroyed, officials in Brussels said
that air power could offer no absolute protection to Albanian
civilians against the reported thuggery and repression now believed
to be under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the trigger for our action _ the desire to prevent a
humanitarian catastrophe,'' Shea said. ``As air operations evolve
in the coming hours, and coming days, we will be in a good position
to severely disrupt and hinder the Yugoslav army and Interior
Ministry police sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's resolve to continue this operation until its objectives
are achieved remains absolute,'' he said, disputing any suggestion
that second thoughts expressed in Athens, Prague, Rome and some
other allied capitals had already numbered the operation's days.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Accounts filtering out of Kosovo from
refugees and the few telephone calls that can be made into the
province from neighboring Macedonia tell of dozens of killings,
particularly of ethnic Albanian intellectuals, and burning of
houses, shops and markets in major towns.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army
and Serbian forces has also intensified, and has moved to at least
one town, Djakovica, in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians in the town have described the armed rebels as
occupying the new part of town, an area of modern high-rises, while
Serbian forces have control of the old town, an area of narrow
streets and small houses on the south side.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have had tank positions on the edge of the old
town, from which they have shelled the area close to the border
with Albania. The rebel army has been active in the region under
the leadership of a commander known as Ramush.
</P>
<P>
   Taulant, a young ethnic Albanian working in Skopje, said he had
spoken to his cousin in Djakovica by telephone at midday on Friday.
The cousin, Genc, 40, a father of four, said Serbian forces had
shelled the old part of town and then moved in to burn houses and
shops. Taulant spoke on condition that only first names would be
used, so the police would not be able to trace his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Genc went on foot on Friday to investigate whether his own house
in the old part of town had been affected. It was still standing
undamaged, but he said ``All the old part up to my house was on
fire,'' Taulant recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are starting to burn the small market,'' Taulant
said. ``From the way he described it, the houses were set on fire
by hand, and not from the shelling.'' Their telephone conversation
broke off abruptly when Genc said Serbian forces were shelling his
own neighborhood in the new part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Genc also told his cousin that the police were searching house
to house but had not yet come to his area and that he had not seen
any police in the streets. A local artist, Adi Shehu, had been
killed, Genc said, saying he had talked to the man's neighbors.
There was no way to confirm this account.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from elsewhere in Kosovo suggest that killing and
burning continue. Serbian forces have also unleashed a heavy
assault on rebel positions in northern Kosovo, reportedly with
devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is in a really bad situation in the north,'' said a
Western diplomat who is tracking developments from neighboring
Skopje. ``They have lost ground. Infantry can only hold out against
heavy armor for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The most heavily contested area in northern Kosovo is around the
towns of Podujevo and Mitrovica and in the Cicavica mountains, 25
miles northwest of Pristina, where Serbian forces have conducted
the main thrust of their offensive against the Kosovo Liberation
Army over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomat also said there were credible reports
emerging of as many as 50 killings of ethnic Albanians in the town
of Mitrovica and in Pristina, the capital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians in Skopje have managed to confirm the death of
the human-rights lawyer Bajram Kelmendi, speaking to someone in
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, who had actually seen the body.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi and his two sons were arrested and taken away by
uniformed police on Wednesday night, the first night of the NATO
bombing. His wife and the wife of the elder son told foreign
journalists on Thursday that five policemen burst in at around 1
a.m., threatened to shoot and ordered them to lie on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The two women said the police demanded money, saying they would
kill the children if Kelmendi did not hand it over. Then, the women
related, they took the men off, telling Kastriut, the elder son,
30, to kiss his wife and children goodbye as he would not see them
again.
</P>
<P>
   The three bodies were found dumped on the road by a gas station
on the edge of Pristina on Friday, the New York-based group Human
Rights Watch has said.
</P>
<P>
   An unconfirmed report from an ethnic Albanian journalist in
Pristina said that a well-known surgeon from Djakovica, Izet Hima,
was also reported to have been found killed.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian state television said 30 people were reported dead in
the town of Orahovac, and more than 20 in Suva Reka.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone lines into and within Yugoslavia were heavily
overloaded or out of order Saturday, and it appeared that few calls
had reached Kosovo since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The few foreign journalists who have remained in Pristina or
managed to return since journalists from NATO member countries were
expelled on Thursday have been confined to their hotels or houses,
virtually unable to work.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving storm center southeast of Long Island will promote
cool, damp weather from central New England to the Middle Atlantic
coast. Clouds and patchy rain will reach as far to the north and
west as the central Hudson River Valley and the eastern Susquehanna
Valley in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The rain may be mixed with wet snow at times over the higher
ground. Onshore breezes will average 15 to 25 miles an hour with
higher gusts near the southern New England coast. Meanwhile,
tenacious high pressure over Quebec will promote plentiful sunshine
from northern New England to the eastern parts of the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening onshore winds circulating between high pressure in
the Southeast and low pressure in the Rio Grande Valley will draw
moist air from over the western Gulf of Mexico into the southern
Plains. Widespread showers and thunderstorms will spread over most
of central and eastern Texas during the day the showers will reach
eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will precede a cool front as it moves across
the northern Mississippi Valley. Farther east, the day will begin
with ample sunshine over much of the central parts of the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley, but clouds and showers will arrive
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, an approaching front will send showery rain toward
the Washington and Oregon coasts Sunday afternoon. Snow will
develop later Sunday in the Cascade and Bitterroot mountains.
Meanwhile, the Southwest will be sunny and warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Slow Storms  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The season of slow storms has begun. For the next two months,
the jet stream will vacillate, retreating north as warmer air
arrives from the Tropics, or surging south as the last chilly air
masses empty from the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Like a flooded river leaves behind pools of standing water once
it recedes into its banks, the jet stream often leaves behind
stagnant pools of cold air when it retreats north. These high-level
cold pools favor the development of storms. During the next several
days, a sluggish low pressure zone over the Mediterranean Sea may
hamper military operations in the Balkans. &QL;

DO BOMBS FAIL EVEN AS THEY FALL?

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of multiplying atrocities filtering out of Kosovo, bad
enough news on purely humanitarian grounds, convey a still bleaker
message for allied policy makers trying to stem the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed accounts reaching Central European capitals _ taken
as fact or something close to it by allied officials, despite a
lack of confirming details _ indicate strongly that three days of
bombing raids have so far utterly failed to achieve even the modest
goals set by NATO and spelled out on Wednesday by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As one European diplomat said, ``we have to confront the
possibility that the air campaign, by forcing the independent
observers and Western journalists out of Kosovo, has given the
Serbs a sense that they can do whatever they like without anyone
being able to prove that they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, unless the tide turns soon, an exit strategy for
Clinton and other leaders may be harder than ever to develop. That
has long been a major fear of some of his congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea of bombing was first considered, some officials in
Washington suggested that it could be used to force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the NATO peacekeeping force
in Kosovo that he adamantly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion of the peacekeeper element in the proposed peace
settlement negotiated at Rambouillet, France, caused him to reject
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton came to believe that it would be tactically wiser to
set goals for the air strikes that might be more readily achieved.
So he said last week that the purpose of the bombing was to bolster
NATO's credibility, to deter Milosevic ``from continuing and
escalating his attacks'' in Kosovo and, if needed, to severely
damage his war-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has succeeded in sending the message that it takes the
atrocities against ethnic Albanians seriously. But Milosevic has
not been deterred by the bombs and cruise missiles that the allies
have flung at him, and if his conventional war-making capacity has
been hurt, the ability of his paramilitary forces to spread havoc
in Kosovo remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, an American,
acknowledged on Friday that allied air strikes could not in the
short term protect the ethnic Albanians from attacks by the Serbian
paramilitaries, and other officials said they wondered whether that
could ever be done without the introduction of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies are opposed to sending in troops unless they are
invited by the Milosevic government; one NATO staff study
reportedly indicated that it would require a huge deployment,
perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 troops, to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, the British defense minister, conceded
Saturday in London that what he called ``an all-out Serb offensive
against the Albanian population'' had begun, and said he had
reports that ``the Serbs are bombing villages to the point of
obliteration.'' But he insisted: ``This is not happening because of
NATO. This violence was going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood of apprehension in this region was heightened by the
intrusion of Serbian warplanes into Bosnian airspace _ MIG fighters
on Friday, helicopters Saturday. From the beginning, the countries
that border on Yugoslavia have worried about the Kosovo trouble's
spilling across their borders, and of course the Clinton
administration is particularly concerned about anything that
threatens to disrupt the hard-won peace settlement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, which borders Kosovo on the south, is especially
vulnerable to the unrest. It could be flooded with refugees, and
its fragile multi-ethnic balance could be upset. At present, about
a quarter of its population of 2.2 million is made up of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get nervous in Hungary,'' an official in Budapest said,
``because one of our main cities, Seged, is just a few kilometers
from the northern border of Yugoslavia. But if shivers run down our
spines, think of the tremors they feel in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Western alliance has responded to the reported
torching of villages and forced marches only with threats to haul
the perpetrators before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. There
has been no military counterthrust.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's evident intention is to concentrate on the Serbs' radar
and antiaircraft, and to try at the same time to shoot down or
destroy on the ground as many Serbian planes as possible. Only
later would the objective be shifted to targets in Kosovo. At the
start of the air strikes, senior military officers said it could
take a week or more to finish the first phase.
</P>
<P>
   But if the slaughter in Kosovo continues, the ``ethnic
cleansing'' could be largely complete in a short period, and NATO
could lose public support before it can even attempt the tactically
difficult attacks on Kosovo. The goals there are more difficult to
achieve because of the dispersal of the paramilitary forces and
their supplies, and because the terrain and small-scale targets
would require pilots to fly at dangerously low altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Greece and Italy have expressed the view that it is time to wind
up the bombing campaign. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has
worked hard to preserve a semblance of unanimity in the alliance,
but he himself has said the air strikes should last for a matter of
days rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there seems to be little strategic room for an early bombing
pause. That would only convince Milosevic that he had won, allied
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the apparent softening of resolve in some European
capitals suggests that the prospect of more or less open-ended
strikes by NATO warplanes is slim. If the bombing campaign does not
stop Milosevic, some administration officials have been saying, the
answer is more bombing. From the European perspective, at least,
that is beginning to ring a little hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's accelerated campaign in Kosovo calls into question
another possible endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have suggested that, failing an
agreement by the Serbian leader to return to the bargaining table,
the best thing to do would be to announce that his military
capacity had been degraded and call off the raids. But that would
not sound very convincing if the Serbs were still on their bloody
rampage in Kosovo, which is what the whole policy was meant to
stop.

HIGH COURT FACES MOMENT OF TRUTH IN FEDERALISM CASES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Me., Fla., Ga. )   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning with an argument this week in an obscure
case about overtime pay for state probation officers in Maine, the
Supreme Court is setting out on an extended foray along the border
that separates federal authority from state prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the court decides a series of cases extending
through the remainder of its current term and into the next, that
border could be redrawn. Already it is increasingly unstable and
ill-defined, the result in large part of the court's own recent
decisions, as a narrow majority has coalesced around a view of
federal authority more limited than the Supreme Court has held in
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the view of legal scholars who study the court's
federalism decisions and lawyers who handle cases in this area, the
court has reached a moment of truth, the point at which the
justices will have to distill the loose and sometimes extravagant
language of their recent decisions and show what they really mean
to do.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the high-profile federalism battles of recent
years, over such issues as congressional term limits or the Brady
gun-control law. This is day-to-day, bread-and-butter federalism,
the federalism not of theory but of practice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Alden vs. Maine, the case set for argument on
Wednesday, the question is whether state workers can go to state
court to sue a state for violations of federal labor law, in this
case the failure to pay time and a half for overtime. Since recent
Supreme Court precedents have barred suits of this type in federal
court when the defendant is a state, states would be immune from
labor-law suits filed by their employees, if the justices agree
with Maine's high court that the state courts are closed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the court will hear arguments in two cases, one on
whether states can be sued for patent infringement and the other on
whether they can be sued for for engaging in false advertising in
violation of federal law. For their next term, the Justices have
accepted a case on whether states can be sued by their employees
for violations of the federal law against age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen federalism cases have been filed at the court
in recent months, with others moving quickly through the legal
pipeline. The individual cases, embedded in various strands of the
Supreme Court's elusive and highly technical federalism doctrines,
might not be of much general interest standing alone; occasional
skirmishes along the federal-state border are a staple of the
court's docket. But the whole in this instance is greater than the
sum of its parts, making it clear that profound issues of state
sovereignty and of the supremacy of federal law are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of new cases is the direct result of the court's
recent federalism initiatives, which sent powerful signals, both to
the states and to the lower courts charged with interpreting the
Supreme Court's work, that the rules of the game were changing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1995 decision, United States vs. Lopez,
overturning the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, was the first
time since the New Deal that the court found Congress to have
exceeded the bounds of its constitutional authority to regulate
interstate commerce. The legislative goal of keeping guns away from
schools did not fall within the limited authority the Commerce
Clause conferred on Congress, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the court turned its attention to the 11th
Amendment, which gives the states immunity in federal court against
certain kinds of lawsuits. In Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, the court
expanded that immunity, overturning one of its own precedents in
order to rule that Congress had no authority under the Commerce
Clause to pass a law permitting states to be sued in federal court.
The decision struck down a law that permitted Indian tribes to sue
states to force negotiations over tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, the court ruled that a provision of the Brady
gun-control law, requiring local sheriffs to perform background
checks on would-be gun purchasers, violated state sovereignty by
``commandeering'' state employees to do the federal government's
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, Printz vs. United States, was based on the 10th
Amendment, a provision the Supreme Court had ignored for most of
its history before its episodic revival over the last 25 years as
an occasional limit, of uncertain dimensions, on federal authority
over the states.
</P>
<P>
   As the legal system absorbed this string of decisions, the
federalism climate quickly began to change. States became vigorous
in asserting defenses to suits brought under federal law, and the
lower courts began to respond sympathetically, pushing the envelope
of state immunity even beyond what the court had found necessary.
As that dynamic of action and reaction begins to fill the court's
federalism docket once again, one question is whether the justices
like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense in which the justices have backed themselves
into a corner on federalism, and now their chickens are coming home
to roost,'' Thomas W. Merrill, a law professor and federalism
expert at Northwestern University, said recently. Merrill said that
the cases now before the court carry the logic of the earlier cases
to a kind of extreme that ``I can't help but think is going to make
the swing votes on the court a little queasy.''
</P>
<P>
   All the recent cases were decided by 5-4 votes, with a majority
comprised of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Of the majority,
Kennedy is widely seen as the justice most likely to put the brakes
on a drive toward state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The case to be argued on Wednesday, Alden vs. Maine, No. 98-436,
offers an interesting test. Maine, joined by 36 states that filed a
brief as friends of the court, is defending a 1998 ruling by the
Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which said that the state courts
cannot hear a suit by 65 state probation officers and juvenile case
workers. The plaintiffs say that under the Fair Labor Standards
Act, they are entitled to overtime pay that the state has refused
to provide.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Under the Supreme Court's Seminole Tribe decision, it is clear
that the suit cannot be heard in federal court, where it was
originally filed. But Congress provided that Fair Labor Standards
Act suits can also be brought in state court. Maine's high court,
however, interpreted the Seminole Tribe ruling as a statement not
only about the jurisdiction of the federal courts, but about deeper
principles of state sovereign immunity that closed the state
courthouse doors as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Amendment is phrased as a limit on ``the judicial power
of the United States'' and does not mention state courts; the
Supreme Court has never interpreted it as providing state-court
immunity. But Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Seminole Tribe
case did refer to the ``the background principle of state sovereign
immunity embodied in the 11th Amendment,'' a powerfully ambiguous
phrase which Maine has seized in its Supreme Court brief in the
Alden case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the 11th Amendment is simply the embodiment of the
background principle of state sovereign immunity,'' the state is
telling the court, ``there is no principled basis upon which to
distinguish congressional authorization of suits by private parties
against unconsenting states in state court from such suits in
federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine's brief has borrowed phrases from the court's decision in
the Brady Act case, telling the justices that the federal
government should not be permitted to ``commandeer'' the state
courts for the administration of a federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has joined the Maine state workers in
appealing the state court's immunity decision. The brief filed by
Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman tells the court that the decision
``is of profound concern to the United States'' and a direct threat
to the concept of the supremacy of federal law. ``Any interest the
state has in asserting immunity in this case must give way to the
overriding interest in the vindication of federal law,'' the
government's brief asserts.

   Another aspect of the Seminole Tribe decision is in dispute. The
ruling suggested that despite the new limitations on its authority
under the Commerce Clause, Congress retained the power to abrogate
the states' 11th Amendment immunity under its authority to pass
laws guaranteeing the individual rights protected by the 14th
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta
disagreed, finding 11th Amendment immunity for the states in suits
under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The
government's appeal of that ruling is United States vs. Kimel, No.
98-796. The other pending cases are College Savings Bank vs.
Florida, No. 98-149, and Florida vs. College Savings Bank, No.
98-531, raising immunity questions under federal patent and
trademark law.

IN RENAULT-NISSAN DEAL, BIG RISKS AND BIG OPPORTUNITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   TOKYO _ In taking a stake in the troubled Nissan Motor Co.,
Renault, the stodgy French car company that has tried to become a
formidable force in Europe, has embarked on a risky business gamble
to strengthen the global competitiveness of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal attempts to balance the differing needs of a Japanese
auto company and a Western one. While some American and European
companies have teamed up to better conquer world markets, some of
the smaller Japanese and European auto companies have largely sat
on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been restrained by their culture and their
reluctance to fully embrace change. Renault, on the other hand, has
had a history of failed engagements and marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance takes a step toward resolving Nissan's substantial
financial difficulties while allowing its management, which has
produced boring cars and sizable losses, to save face _ not an
insignificant issue in the culture of corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And it seeks to insulate Renault from Nissan's financial woes
while giving it access to the Japanese company's advanced
engineering and technical skills. It also provides significant car
making capacity in important markets like the United States and
Mexico where Renault is not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you will have great expectations for this alliance,''
said Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the two companies seemed well aware that their new
partnership may raise as many challenges as it seeks to resolve.
``We know the problems confronting our companies will not work
themselves out through this alliance,'' said Louis Schweitzer,
Renault's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, both companies would use it as a tool to
overcome their respective hurdles. He predicted that the potential
synergy of the deal, including joint parts procurement, combined
sales and marketing operations and the exchange of models to round
out each company's product lines, would reduce costs on a combined
basis by $3.3 billion in the two years from 2000 to 2002 regardless
of the effect of cost-cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
   For Renault, the partnership represents a chance to vault into
the automotive big leagues at a time when the global auto business
is evolving into a handful of huge global players. If combined,
Renault and Nissan would be the world's fourth-largest car maker
after General Motors, Ford and Toyota, with 9.1 percent of the
global market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Renault has stepped into the big leagues by
buying stakes in American Motors, which owned Jeep, Mack Trucks and
Volvo of Sweden. Only the Mack truck deal a decade ago was
successful. The Volvo deal produced board room clashes before it
was officially consummated. Renault ended up selling American
Motors to Jeep in 1987 after a rocky relationship.
</P>
<P>
   For Nissan, the deal brings in much-needed new capital and gives
it access to the cost-cutting, product development and efficient
procurement know-how that have become Renault's claims to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Renault will pay 643 billion yen, or $5.4 billion at current
exchange rates, to buy new stock that will give it a 36.8 percent
stake in Nissan and to purchase a 22.5 percent stake in Nissan's
struggling truck subsidiary, the Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Schweitzer
said the deal to buy a portion of Nissan's stake in Nissan Diesel
came up only in the final stages of discussions, which started last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Nissan also has a right to buy some of the 44
percent stake in Renault owned by the French government and Renault
is likely to make Hanawa a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Renault has also agreed to refinance Nissan's short-term debt
for five years in exchange for warrants that it could use to raise
its Nissan ownership to 44 percent. That percentage would still be
less than is required to have control of the Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nissan recovers, we did not want it to be controlled by
another company,'' Schweitzer said. ``We did not think that would
be good for Nissan.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault will use $2 billion in cash and raise the rest from its
banks, Schweitzer said. He said Renault aimed to pay off the debts
it will incur as a result of the Nissan deal in three years.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the money will be used to pare away some of
Nissan's 4.3 trillion yen, or $37 billion, in publicly disclosed
debts. The investment includes the transfer of Nissan's European
auto-financing operations to Renault, which in and of itself will
wipe 38 billion yen, or $322 million, off Nissan's balance sheet, a
Nissan spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting part of the deal involves three top
Renault executives _ Carlos Ghosn, Patrick Pelata and Thierry
Moulonguet _ who will resign from the French company and take
senior positions at Nissan, which has one of the most bureaucratic,
hierarchical cultures in corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about potential culture clashes cropped up repeatedly
at the two companies' press conference Saturday afternoon, which
one reporter compared to having sushi with Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa, whose name became ``Anawa,'' in the voice of the French
interpreter, said he and Schweitzer had dined together on many
cuisines, all of which they had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But how well the patrician Japanese executive will enjoy the
scrutiny and advice of his new second-in-command, Ghosn, remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn (pronounced go-en), a well-liked Brazilian who currently
is second in command at Renault, will take responsibility for the
day-to-day operations of a company whose sales in Japan have been
slipping even as the deterioration in the overall car market seems
to be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   As chief operating officer, he will report to Hanawa, who will
use the title president in Japan and that of chief executive
officer when on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Pelata will become Nissan's executive vice president in charge
of product planning and strategy, a portfolio similar to that he
holds at Renault. He will take on the task of infusing Nissan's
cars with more flair and overhauling its costly production process.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest task goes to Moulonguet, a hard-nosed,
no-nonsense financial expert who will become Nissan's deputy chief
financial officer. Although he officially reports to Tadahiro
Shirai, Nissan's chief financial officer, Moulonguet is expected to
focus on Nissan's costs and hack away its mountain of liabilities,
parts of which are not publicly reported thanks to lax Japanese
accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, Pelata and Moulonguet, who will sit on Nissan's board,
will be Schweitzer's eyes and ears in Tokyo, and as such, will have
leading roles in trying to shape a recovery for Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   But Schweitzer cautioned repeatedly that they are not meant to
be a cure for Nissan's ills. ``The turnaround of Nissan will have
to be achieved by Nissan itself,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, Nissan officials say, the company is considering fuller
disclosure of its myriad financial problems, in part to satisfy
changes in Japanese accounting rules and in part because there is a
growing belief that Nissan must openly confront its difficulties if
it is to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   The Renault executives will also encourage Nissan to procure
parts on a global basis, rather than primarily from the satellite
of suppliers and affiliates here whose costs, and thus prices, are
higher than their non-Japanese competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships will be hard to eliminate, however, as
Nissan's fortunes are tangled up with the performance of its
affiliates because it has financial stakes in them.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said the two companies were already prepared to start
several joint production and procurement projects. Renault will
begin manufacturing its cars in Nissan's plants in Mexico and
Southeast Asia, while Nissan will use Renault's factories in South
America.

MAKERS OF WOMEN'S DRUGS CLASH WITH FDA ON MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.) (With DRUG-COMPANIES-ADS) 
(lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two drug companies seeking to tap the vast market of
postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, heart disease and
bone loss have clashed with each other and run afoul of the Food
and Drug Administration over their marketing practices, prompting a
flurry of lawsuits, government warning letters and accusations that
inaccurate assertions could endanger women's health.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are millions of American women who are
trying to determine whether there is any drug they can take after
menopause that does not bring on as many problems as it is supposed
to solve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the feuding companies is Zeneca, maker of tamoxifen,
which is prescribed to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in
high-risk postmenopausal women. Zeneca is a British company with
offices in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, which also goes by the brand name Nolvadex, has been
in use for many years to treat breast cancer, and when it received
additional approval last spring for use in risk reduction, it
became the only drug approved in the United States to lower the
incidence of any form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The other combatant is Eli Lilly and Co., based in Indianapolis.
Lilly marketed the drug raloxifene last year under the brand name
Evista, to prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, also in
postmenopausal women. The disease is a major cause of broken bones
in elderly women, including fractures in the hips and spine that
can be crippling and even life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca, which filed suit against Lilly on Feb. 25 in U.S.
District Court in New York, wrote to thousands of doctors in the
United States and posted a letter on its Web site asserting that
Lilly's sales representatives had falsely told doctors that Evista
could prevent breast cancer and had created a widespread
misperception that Evista could be used in place of Nolvadex.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly countersued on March 19, denying the accusation and
demanding that Zeneca stop its comments about Lilly's sales force.
The case is scheduled to go to court in May.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had already written to both companies in January,
accusing them of placing misleading advertisements in consumer
magazines and telling them to stop. Lilly was said to have implied
that Evista could prevent breast cancer and Zeneca was told it had
wrongly omitted mention of the risks of Nolvadex, which include
blood clots and a slight increase in the risk of uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the drug agency said that it could seize a
product or obtain an injunction against ads that violate
regulations but that those measures were rarely taken. Both Zeneca
and Lilly said they had stopped using the offending ads and other
promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings to Lilly and Zeneca are striking because the
companies are the first to jockey for position in an enormous and
potentially lucrative new market: cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer is not the most frequent problem facing women,
but it's the one that concerns them most,'' said Dr. Wulf Utian,
director of obstetrics and gynecology at the University Hospitals
of Cleveland, who has no connection to either company. Even though
far more women die of heart disease than breast cancer, women worry
more about the issue of which drugs or hormones might cause breast
cancer or prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very confusing for women, and also very confusing for
average practitioners,'' Utian said. ``There is a huge need for
additional studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The first treatment approved for problems associated with
menopause was estrogen, which is now available in a variety of
formulations. In addition to relieving hot flashes, insomnia and
other problems, estrogen has also been shown to prevent bone loss
and reduce the risk of heart disease and possibly Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But estrogen has a downside: Many women are afraid to take it
because it may cause a slight increase in the risk of breast
cancer. And unless it is combined with another hormone,
progesterone, it can also increase the risk of uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Evista, often described as a ``designer'' estrogen, is an
estrogenlike molecule developed with the hope of mimicking some of
estrogen's good points while avoiding its bad ones. It was approved
in late 1997 and marketed in 1998, earning $144 million for Lilly
in its first year, a spokeswoman for the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Evista reduces bone loss only about half as well as estrogen,
but its selling point was that studies indicated that it might not
increase the risk of breast or uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The osteoporosis studies also suggested that Evista might
actually reduce the risk of breast cancer, but those findings were
considered inconclusive because the studies were relatively short,
they were not designed to evaluate breast cancer and they did not
include women at high risk for the disease. For that reason, the
FDA approved Evista only for osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But once a drug is on the market, doctors are free to recommend
it for any condition, whether it has been approved for that use or
not, a widespread practice known as ``off-label'' prescribing.
</P>
<P>
   It is that freedom that Zeneca has accused Lilly of trying to
exploit. Mary Lynn Carver, a spokeswoman for Zeneca, said company
officials had noted that even before Evista was approved for
osteoporosis, Lilly had asked the FDA to consider data on breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of incursions onto its turf, Zeneca kept tabs on Evista,
Ms. Carver said, and Zeneca sales representatives routinely asked
doctors what Lilly representatives had been telling them in their
offices during the private ``detailing'' visits that are an
important source of drug information for many doctors. What the
Zeneca representatives heard led to the lawsuit, Ms. Carver said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed by Zeneca state that Lilly sales
representatives had tried to mislead doctors into believing that
Evista had been proved to prevent breast cancer and could be
prescribed instead of Nolvadex for high-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sekston, a spokeswoman for Lilly, said, ``We deny all
allegations of wrongdoing that have been put forth in Zeneca's
lawsuit.'' Lilly has filed a legal response as well as the
countersuit, she said. ``We want to stop Zeneca from making false
allegations about our sales force.'' In addition, she said, Lilly
is asking the court to force Zeneca ``to run corrective ads to take
back the statements they've already made.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lilly intended to stop making assertions about breast
cancer, she left the door open, saying: ``FDA does allow for
disclosure of data around a scientific meeting. It can be discussed
in meetings and peer-to-peer forums.'' Lilly researchers have
presented breast-cancer data from the osteoporosis studies at
several medical meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition,
an advocacy group in Washington, said, ``I have been to medical
conferences where doctors have gotten up and spoken of raloxifene
as a miracle drug.'' They seem to believe that it has been proved
to prevent breast cancer and ward off heart disease, she said,
adding, ``I don't know where it's coming from, but there certainly
is a lot of talk out there about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, beyond the reach of the FDA, Lilly
has promoted Evista to prevent breast cancer and heart disease. In
the February issue of a Canadian journal for pharmacists, an ad
said, ``Reduces the incidence of breast cancer'' and ``improves the
lipid profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Evista is currently being studied in women at high risk for
heart disease, but results are not expected for several years. To
determine whether the drug can reduce the risk of breast cancer, a
five-year nationwide study of 22,000 women is planned to begin this
spring, comparing Evista with tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leslie Ford of the National Cancer Institute said, ``Only
through that trial, a head-to-head comparison, will we really have
the answer.''

GIULIANI MEETS WITH BLACK LEADERS, MAKING THE ROUTINE SEEM
MOMENTOUS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note language 8th graf, ``After the election ...) 
 (rk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time and again, the Giuliani administration has
demonstrated the ability to make the routine seem unusual, and the
bizarre seem mundane.
</P>
<P>
   How else could a meeting between the mayor and the city's
highest-elected black official take on the significance of a
Botha-Mandela sit-down? How else could a mayor have refused to meet
that leader for more than a year?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's session last week with C. Virginia
Fields, the Manhattan borough president, was viewed as so
extraordinary that the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who
arranged the meeting, somehow emerged as the great healer of City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Then came word that the mayor had agreed to meet with state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, another black leader he had rebuffed
for years, and would soon be inviting other people of color to
Gracie Mansion for face-to-face chats.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven weeks after the Amadou Diallo shooting began
roiling race relations in the city, the administration decided that
the time had come to, as one aide put it, ``build bridges'' and let
the ``healing process'' continue. And so Giuliani was poised to be
congratulated for meeting elected city and state officials _
activities that might normally be considered an expected duty of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the praise has been muted by healthy
skepticism. ``How come now?'' asked Bill Lynch, the chief of staff
to former Mayor David N. Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Giuliani had previously talked of improving
relations between the police and minorities _ immediately after the
brutalization of Abner Louima, allegedly by the police in the
summer of 1997, and just before his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election he said, `The hell with this,' '' Lynch
said, reflecting the opinion of other black leaders in the city.
``And you say, `Trust him now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers say the lingering distrust reflects the
way the mayor's Mr. Outside persona has turned against him at
perhaps his most vulnerable moment in public office.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, he refused to build the bridges now
hastily under construction to the city's black and Hispanic
neighborhoods; he gloried in every Police Department triumph and
belittled complaints against the force, and he exuded a
my-way-or-the-highway style of governance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say, the mayor's strengths hint of weakness. Last
month's shooting death of Diallo, an unarmed black man, by four
white police officers in a hail of 41 bullets raised questions
about race-tinged aggression within his beloved Police Department,
exposing his poor relations with minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden outreach to black and Hispanic leaders _ on the heels
of his dismissive comments about their motives _ tests his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're finding now is that Rudy's support among
elected officials was obviously thinner than he realized,'' said
Mitchell Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at
New York University. ``A mayor of New York has to be responsive to
everyone. And the Giuliani administration did not recognize that
you cannot govern the city and ignore'' black and Hispanic
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a really tough one for the mayor to
empathize with,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center
for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York. ``It's tough not only because his heart is with the
police and the criminal-justice system, but it's tough because he
doesn't hang around in places where there are a lot of black and
Dominican and West Indian and Puerto Rican young men to get to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, his critics suggest, that is why Mr. Outside now seems
so alone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many analysts say the mayor at first acted as best he could,
given the social and political nightmare presented by the Diallo
shooting. Even though the four officers reportedly have been
indicted on charges of murder _ the grand jury's decision is
expected to be announced this week _ the city still has heard only
one side of what happened that night in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor for all the city, as he and his aides like to put it,
Giuliani thought it best to urge calm, to defend what he considers
to be an exceptional Police Department, and to express sorrow for
the loss of a young street peddler from West Africa. ``The mayor is
being balanced,'' said a senior adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``He is doing exactly what you want a leader to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But each day demonstrated that the case symbolized so much more,
from the fear that many black and Hispanic residents harbor for the
Police Department to the simmering resentment they hold for
Giuliani. And the mayor reverted to the rigid style that had won
him a high job-approval rating and the acclaim of national
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the daily acts of civil disobedience staged by the
Rev. Al Sharpton outside Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan as
``silly'' and ``highly partisan''; he ridiculed the demand that the
officers be arrested _ something he rightly pointed out was not his
decision _ and generally ignored the larger statements being made.
His defense of the police seemed gradually to mute his expressions
of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has a moral stance that there's a right and a wrong
here, and the police are generally doing the right thing, and he's
not going to back off from that just because it's politically
unpopular,'' Mollenkopf said. But in politics that approach can be
both refreshing and problematic, he added. ``It's clear that by
imposing higher standards in lots of areas, the mayor has gotten
the city to clean up its act. But moral absolutism is hard to
swallow in hard doses.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Mario Cuomo agreed. ``You pay a price for his kind
of constant pressure, his constant in-your-face,'' he said. ``It
gets things done, it's aggressive and it's strong. And people do
react to strength. There's also a downside to that. When you're in
people's faces, you irritate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By last week, it had become obvious to the mayor and his aides
that the Mr. Outside act had worn thin. Respected political and
civic leaders, including those previously allied with the
administration, were being arrested outside police headquarters.
His job-approval rating had plummeted. Suddenly, Ms. Fields and
McCall were welcome at Gracie Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the state's Liberal Party and
one of the mayor's closest advisers, answered the question ``What
happened?'' by citing what he considered to be a ``confluence of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the Democrats that dominate city politics
outside the mayor's office seized on the case with the aim of
crippling Giuliani politically. While talking of ``healing and
reconciliation'' at the daily protests, he said, they demanded that
he do the impossible and ensure the arrests of the four officers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said, resentment lingers over Giuliani's decision in
his first term to ``treat all New Yorkers as one.'' The mayor acted
on this promise by disbanding a network of advisers to ethnic
neighborhoods that had been established by previous
administrations. Leaders from those neighborhoods say the decision
ended their access to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Harding said, ``people are not looking at his mayoral
actions but are focused on his rhetorical style.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the term-limited mayor has changed his actions and
tempered his rhetorical style, just as speculation intensifies over
his possible candidacy for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with black and Hispanic members of the City
Council on Friday, for example, the mayor emerged from Gracie
Mansion to tell reporters how productive it had been. ``It might be
I made a mistake in not having more meetings like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several black leaders, though, said they are skeptical of
Giuliani's recent epiphany. They said they hope to use the Diallo
incident both to change the city's police culture and to register
more minority voters throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's playing to his base and trying to show them that
he is a rational guy, and that he is now meeting with some
blacks,'' Lynch said. ``But that's all he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's aides assert that Giuliani is trying. To that
end, there was a late addition to Sunday's mayoral schedule: he
would be meeting with Priscilla A. Wooten, a black City Council
member, and other civic leaders at a diner in Brooklyn. And after
that meeting, there would be a press conference.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes intensified their assault on Serbian
targets Saturday and began for the first time to attack ground
units of the Yugoslav army and security forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air operations rattled Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, as
Serbian forces continued a campaign against ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo. Numerous reports of atrocities, still
unconfirmed, of mass executions and of forced marches reached
Western capitals and prompted the decision to attack Serbian forces
in the field, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials in Brussels announced the
escalation of the air war and the shift in strategy Saturday
afternoon after a series of conversations among President Clinton,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair French President Jacques Chirac
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total unity that the campaign was moving as planned
and that it was important to move to a new phase of the air
campaign, including focusing on forces in the field,'' said White
House spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton believes that Slobodan Milosevic's continued
repression and continued instransigence remain an obstacle to
resolving this crisis and thus it was necessary to move forward in
broadening the scope of the air assault,'' Leavy said. Milosevic is
the president of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the major
component.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shift from leveling Yugoslav air defenses and
military installations in Serbia to trying to destroy Serbian
military units in the field came as evidence suggesting a campaign
of brutality in Kosovo mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages,'' said British Defense
Minister George Robertson in London. ``There are reports that the
Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration. There are
clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against the Albanian
population has started.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesman in Brussels, cited reports that
large groups of Kosovo Albanians _ conspicuously lacking adult men
_ have been spotted under the guard of Serbian forces. ``Dark
things are happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarming reports, administration officials insisted
that they were not planning to use U.S. or NATO ground troops to
halt any killings and punish Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops,'' said Vice President Al Gore in
response to a question while campaigning in New Hampshire. ``I
believe that we can achieve our objectives with the use of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, for the first time, people heard large explosions
before air-raid sirens sounded, suggesting that Yugoslavia's air
defense system has been damaged around the capital as NATO has
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said that the extensive damage to Yugoslav
defenses made it safer to employ the lower-flying aircraft that
will be needed to attack moving forces on the ground such as tank
and artillery units.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that allied
forces must ``stay the course'' to prevent the war in Kosovo from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children,'' Clinton said. ``We must, and we will, continue until
Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, accepts peace or we have
seriously damaged his capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no visible signs Milosevic was backing off. On
Serbian television, patriotic themes were broadcast along with
coverage of NATO attacks and news of protests against them in
Greece and Russia. Reports that at least four NATO planes were shot
down were later denied by NATO, but the denials were not shown on
television there.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian province of Kosovo, the center of the conflict
that led to the attacks that began on Wednesday, Serbian troops
continued their rampage against the ethnic Albanians, burning homes
and villages and rounding up ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happening because of NATO,'' Robertson said.
``This violence was going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   Only continued air strikes by the allies can halt the Serbian
offensive, Robertson said, adding, ``We are now targeting the
headquarters and command and control centers that are clearly
critical in carrying out these attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies planned to continue bombing those targets and
anti-aircraft defenses throughout Yugoslavia on Saturday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is not very good,'' Air Commodore David Wilby of
Britain said in a Brussels briefing. In operations that ended
before dawn Saturday, he said, ``some of the airplanes turned back
because of the weather, but manned aircraft did get through to
their targets last night.'' In all, 249 allied planes took to the
air between Friday and early Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs dropped from aircraft and the warheads of unpiloted cruise
missiles struck military targets around Belgrade, the southeastern
Serbian city of Nis, and six areas in and around Kosovo, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have given only sketchy accounts of damage from
its air raids because they say it will take time to analyze
photographs taken after the attacks. And without people on the
ground, they say, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and other officials on Saturday warned Milosevic not
to try to retaliate by attacking international peacekeepers in
neighboring Bosnia or Macedonia. About 12,000 allied soldiers in
Macedonia are preparing for missions to enforce a peace agreement
in Kosovo if, as the allies hope, the bombing forces Milosevic to
accept one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He showed no sign of being ready to do that Saturday as the
Serbian offensive against ethnic Albanian positions in Kosovo
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have no confirmation, a campaign of killing, looting,
harassment and intimidation of ethnic Albanians is possible,''
Wilby said. Shea, the alliance's chief spokesman, said the allies
had received unconfirmed reports of large-scale Serbian actions
against thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know a large number of Albanian women and children were
pushed across the Albanian border without any men, which suggests
that ethnic cleansing is taking place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, he added, will do their best to see that Serbian
authorities who may be responsible for atrocities against civilians
will be prosecuted for them by the international criminal tribunal
in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   With all international observers out of Kosovo for more than a
week, allied officials said they had no way of checking reports
from ethnic Albanian journalists and others of multiple atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here disputed Serbian news reports that two NATO
planes had been shot down Friday night. ``All NATO aircraft have
returned safely to their bases,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade television broadcast images showing the Yugoslav
capital almost deserted by shoppers Saturday after heavy overnight
missile raids aimed at military targets on the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Stinging chemical fumes wafted over parts of the city Saturday
after allied warplanes bombed a rocket fuel depot in the Ibarska
Magistrala area in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation that
signed the peace agreement that Milosevic refused to accept in
Paris earlier this month, said that Serbian military and police
sweeps through Kosovo could only be stopped by sending in NATO
ground forces, an Austrian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and European officials at the alliance headquarters
here said Saturday that none of the alliance's 19 countries were
even considering such a step, and military officials at command
headquarters in Mons said that the alliance's political authorities
had not asked them to prepare for an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no current plans for ground operations,'' said Wilby,
adding later, ``Currently, there are no plans for us to take on
ground operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   French Defense Minister Alain Richard told the daily Le Figaro,
``Sending ground troops in is foreseen only in the context of
implementing a political agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, the chief of the British Defense
Staff, said in London that the bombing of army and police
headquarters this week had already significantly disrupted Serbia's
ability to continue the offensive in Kosovo. ``We know the Yugoslav
army has been badly rattled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the integrated air defense systems of
the Yugoslavs have been severely degraded,'' the general added.
``I'm not, certainly, saying that he has lost his ability to hit an
aircraft, but he's going to find it much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes have shot down five of the most advanced
fighter-bomber aircraft in the Yugoslav arsenal, MiG-29s.
</P>
<P>
   Adding details to earlier accounts of a dogfight Friday
afternoon in which two NATO F-15s shot down two advanced MiG-29
Yugoslav planes over Bosnia, Wilby said the MiGs had apparently
intended to try to lure the NATO planes across the border into
Serbia to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aircraft turned toward them in rule-book fashion and shot
them down,'' he said. The wreckage of one lies in a minefield in a
sector of Bosnia patrolled by Russian troops serving with the
alliance-led peacekeeping force, he said, and the other went down
in an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the pilots was not known Saturday. If Russian
soldiers found a surviving pilot, Wilby said, he was sure they
would turn him over to allied authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's continued participation in the Bosnia operation came
under question Saturday after Moscow threw out the alliance's
liaison officer in Moscow. Russian cooperation with the alliance
has been suspended since the allies began the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the allies kept attacking air defense targets Saturday,
releasing pictures of damage done to a surface-to-air missile site
in Jakovo outside Belgrade and a Serbian airfield at Batajnica,
officials here said that air power could offer no absolute
protection to Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the trigger for our action _ the desire to prevent a
humanitarian catastrophe,'' Shea said. ``As air operations evolve
in the coming hours, and coming days, we will be in a good position
to severely disrupt and hinder the Yugoslav army and Interior
Ministry police sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's resolve to continue this operation until its objectives
are achieved remains absolute,'' he said, disputing any suggestion
that second thoughts expressed in Athens, Prague, Rome and some
other allied capitals had already numbered the operation's days.

MINISTER IS SUSPENDED FOR OFFICIATING IN GAY CEREMONY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Neb)   (rk) 
 By   GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A United Methodist Church minister in Chicago, convicted of
breaking church law by officiating at the union of two gay men, has
been suspended from his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for the Rev. Greg Dell, which is to take effect in
July, was handed down by a jury of 13 Methodist ministers shortly
before midnight on Friday in the suburban Chicago church where the
trial began on Thursday. Earlier Friday, the jury found Dell guilty
of disobeying his denomination's ``order and discipline'' by
performing the ceremony last year.
</P>
<P>
   In handing down the penalty, among the toughest options
available, the jury said the suspension would end when Dell
submitted a written pledge to his bishop promising not to officiate
at another same-sex union, as long as the rule against the unions
remained.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, Dell, 53, said he would never sign such a
document, a stand reflecting his oft-repeated statement that he
would not stop officiating at same-sex unions, because to do so
would contradict his understanding of his responsibilities as a
pastor to all the people in his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's conviction is the first under a 1996 United Methodist
rule forbidding ministers to conduct same-sex ceremonies. As such,
it is a landmark within the denomination that, with 8.5 million
members, is the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination,
after the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was closely watched by Methodists, whose generally
centrist church contains a strong liberal wing with many members
who openly dissent from the rule against same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the issue will likely shift to northern
California, where a Methodist bishop filed a formal complaint on
Tuesday against 69 ministers who jointly officiated at the union of
two women in Sacramento in January, in a show of defiance against
the prohibition of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The cases derive from a sentence _ ``Ceremonies that celebrate
homosexual unions shall not be conducted by our ministers and shall
not be conducted in our churches'' _ that was inserted into the
denomination's rule book, ``The Book of Discipline'' by the
Methodists' top policy-making body, the General Conference, three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sentence was placed in a section of the book
containing advisory statements on such subjects as the environment,
racism and the use of tobacco, some Methodists viewed it as not
legally binding. In March 1998, in the only other trial held on the
issue, a Nebraska pastor, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, was narrowly
acquitted of disobedience to church law after his lawyers argued
that the sentence was advisory.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 8, 1998, the church's Judicial Council, its highest
court, ruled that the sentence was binding. Six weeks later, Dell
conducted the service, which had been planned for several months.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Dell, who is married with an adult son and has
served as a minister for three decades, said his church, Broadway
United Methodist Church in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, has a
congregation that is about 30 percent gay and lesbian. To deny
those members any service that he would render to heterosexual
congregants, he said, would be discriminatory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jury initially scheduled Dell's suspension to begin July 1.
But retired Bishop Jack Tuell, a trained lawyer who acted as the
judge, agreed to delay the suspension until July 5, to allow Dell
to perform a wedding on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop denied a request from Dell's counsel that the
suspension be delayed until after Oct. 23, the date of another
wedding Dell had been scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks afterward, Dell called the sentence a product of
``moralistic rigidity'' within the church. He said he would likely
appeal it and his conviction to the church's regional
jurisdiction..
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, an Illinois pastor who served
as prosecutor, said he was ``very proud of the way the jury
deliberated to make this decision.'' He added, however, he would
have preferred a promise from Dell not to perform any more same-sex
ceremonies.

A SECRETIVE ARMY GROWS TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In late 1997, President Jiang Zemin announced that
China would cut the People's Liberation Army, then 3 million
strong, by half a million troops as part of China's drive for a
leaner, more advanced military that could both defend the homeland
and reinforce China's image as a power in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   What the president did not say was that as the army shrank,
another, more secretive branch of the military, dedicated to
internal stability, was already expanding. At the very time of
Jiang's speech, it was absorbing 14 army divisions, or more than
100,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the People's Armed Police, a national force
trained in riot control, reflects the leaders' growing
preoccupation with domestic unrest. It also reflects their wish to
avoid having to resort to army combat troops to quell popular
demonstrations, as occurred in 1989 around Tiananmen Square with
disastrously bloody results.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, according to witnesses and other accounts,
armed police units were called out to help the ordinary police
contain many of the hundreds of demonstrations and protests
reported around China. The armed police have also battled ethnic
separatists in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang, and have
long been used to help control Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The protests bubbling up around China, almost always centered on
economic complaints, have generally been small, and dispersed
peacefully. But with urban unemployment soaring and farmers restive
over high taxes and corruption, Jiang has proclaimed domestic
stability as this year's No. 1 priority. And he apparently looks to
the force he has built up _ now 1 million strong, Western analysts
say _ to keep any unrest from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a major force for maintaining state security and social
stability, the People's Armed Police shoulders a massive and
formidable burden,'' he said on a visit to an armed police barracks
in Beijing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two China experts from the U.S. military stated the
force's purpose even more baldly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By increasing the size of the People's Armed Police, the
leadership in Beijing implicitly acknowledges that internal unrest
is a greater threat to the regime's survival and Chinese economic
modernization than is foreign invasion,'' said John F. Corbett Jr.,
an American officer, and Dennis J. Blasko, writing in China
Strategic Review, a journal published in Washington. Corbett, who
works in the Pentagon, and Blasko, now a consultant, both
previously served as military attaches in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of the People's Armed Police, which was formed in the
early 1980s from a combination of army and public security units,
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Western riot policemen, the People's Armed Police officers
are supposed to control demonstrations with minimal violence _
preferably with intimidation, shields and sometimes tear gas,
although they carry guns and have heavier weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion and upgrading of the force accelerated after 1989,
when it may have numbered about 600,000. That year, the armed
police's failure to disperse student demonstrators in Beijing
forced the leaders to call in combat units, which killed hundreds
of civilians and did lasting damage to China's image as well as to
army morale.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian police sometimes carry weapons too, but operate under
command of the Public Security Ministry rather than the military,
as most People's Armed Police units do.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been only too happy to shed an unpopular mission
for its regular forces. Freed from worry about crowd control, which
requires entirely different skills and equipment, the People's
Liberation Army ``can concentrate on becoming a modern, externally
oriented force,'' said David Shambaugh, a China expert at George
Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the armed police may also give Jiang, who had
no military experience, an important personal base of power,
outside experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments of the armed police to quell unrest are rarely
announced, but there is evidence that they have been in action
numerous times around China in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   State news media often portray the armed police in more benign
roles _ like working alongside regular soldiers to pile sandbags
during last summer's record floods.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, 9,000 armed police were sent to help existing
forces ranged against a violent separatist movement in the western
province of Xinjiang. In rural Hunan in January, hundreds of armed
police officers dispersed a crowd of many thousands of angry
farmers by lobbing tear-gas grenades and charging with clubs,
villagers said. One man was killed by an exploding gas grenade and
dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Most demonstrations have ended peacefully. But Western analysts
question whether the People's Armed Police would be up to its job
in the event of large-scale unrest, particularly if the job of
controlling it falls to the underequipped, poorly trained units
deployed in areas far from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is whether the People's Armed Police is up to
the task,'' said a Western analyst who has closely studied the
armed police, and spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Because of a
limited budget and long-term quality and management problems, i's
still debatable whether they can perform well in a major crisis.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, armed police officers guard embassies and constantly
patrol Tiananmen Square. Other armed police units are involved in
border defense, and guarding power plants and important sites like
gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   But some 730,000 of the 1 million armed police are primarily
charged with maintaining public order, according to the latest
estimate by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1989 debacle, numerous army units have transferred to
the armed police, mostly the lowest-ranking infantry and artillery
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the dregs'' of the army, said James Mulvenon, a
military expert with Rand Corp. in Washington, of the 14 divisions
shifted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much training and support these transfers and
new recruits have received for their increasingly delicate role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much evidence'' that the People's Armed Police
``has really improved its operational capabilities very much since
1989,'' Mulvenon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, in an apparent effort to improve management
and training, control of most units was shifted from the Ministry
of Public Security to the Central Military Commission. The top
officers have been drawn from the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But outside experts believe that command is relatively
decentralized, and that provincial political leaders have
considerable say over how the armed police troops are used.
</P>
<P>
   As with the regular army, corruption and extensive involvement
in outside businesses have weakened many units, and the armed
police have been ordered to relinquish business activities.
</P>
<P>
   The armed police were already chronically underfunded, Mulvenon
said, in part because they must draw money from several different
sources that have no control over their operations. The costs are
shared among provincial governments, the Ministry of Civil Affairs
and Public Security Ministry, among others.

U.N. TO CREATE OWN SATELLITE PROGRAM TO FIND ILLEGAL DRUG CROPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Nations program charged with reducing illicit drugs
is creating its own satellite monitoring system to identify the
cultivation of narcotics in the major source countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. International Drug Control Program received the
go-ahead last week at the annual meeting in Vienna of the world
body's Commission on Narcotic Drugs, getting unanimous approval
from the 53 member countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring a satellite capability is important for the program
because a more accurate assessment of the illicit drugs being
cultivated would provide a universally accepted benchmark against
which countries' promises to reduce drug production could be
measured. The targets were set at a special session of the General
Assembly last June.
</P>
<P>
   More intensive satellite surveillance would also expose the
so-called balloon effect in which illicit crops reduced or
eradicated in one region or country tend to shift to another.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the drug control
program, said that the European Space Agency will provide the
satellites and technical expertise to monitor the drug crops for
member countries, and the European Commission has agreed to pay
some of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the satellite monitoring could cost as little
as $15 million a year, and would start in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time the international community will have a
very reliable instrument to measure the extent of illegal crops,''
Arlacchi said in a telephone interview from Vienna. The program
will confirm its satellite findings with more detailed surveys on
the ground and with aerial photographs by conventional aircraft,
Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   He has set a goal of eliminating drug cultivation in 10 years
through a combination of eradication and development programs
inducing farmers to switch to less lucrative but legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the United States provided satellite information
gathered by the Central Intelligence Agency, Arlacchi said. But the
CIA's overflights did not focus specifically on coca and opium
cultivation and the spy agency also did not share its remote
sensing methodology to explain its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's conclusions have opened it to charges of political
bias from some drug-producing countries. For example, the Colombian
government said that it eradicated 123,500 acres of coca last year,
mostly by aerial spraying. The CIA reported that only 14,000 acres
were eradicated, prompting protests from the Colombians, Arlacchi
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Commission on Narcotic Drugs met last week, Colombia
asked the counter-drug program to help provide governments with
tools to monitor illicit drug-growing.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United Nations is generally viewed as impartial, its
satellite monitoring could end such controversies by creating a
surveillance system with a uniform methodology accepted by member
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations counter-drug program has enjoyed better
access to drug-growing regions than the United States and other
countries trying to stop narcotics at their source. But coming up
with an accurate count is difficult in regions that are remote or
ravaged by warfare.

   The satellite monitoring for the United Nations will concentrate
on five countries that produce more than 90 percent of the raw
ingredients used to manufacture heroin and cocaine. They are
Myanmar (formerly called Burma) and Afghanistan, the foremost
sources of opium, and Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, which grow almost
all of the coca leaf.

U.S. BASEBALL TEAM IN CUBA DOESN'T MEAN COUNTRIES ARE GETTING ANY
FRIENDLIER

<P>
   HAVANA _ Despite the excitement over the Baltimore Orioles'
exhibition game here and the veneer of openness it conveys,
American baseball comes to Cuba in a climate of heightened
political repression.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed this year tightens the reins on both dissent and
press freedom and specifically makes it a crime to engage in
conduct that supports American policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the feel-good nature of an event that exemplifies
the Clinton administration's stated efforts to reach out to the
Cuban people, the Orioles come less than three months after the
president rejected bipartisan calls to review the 37-year-old trade
embargo against Cuba and its failure so far to bring
democratization here.
</P>
<P>
   So when two prominent ``people to people'' exchanges _ the
Orioles game and a joint concert by more than 100 Cuban and
American artists _ play on Sunday, the backdrop will not be
rapprochement but one of the chillier periods of the Cold War
relationship between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty bad,'' an American official said of the
relations. ``They're not trying to accomplish anything with us or
do anything constructive at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Toledo, a member of the National Assembly and dean of
the law school at Havana University, concurred. ``There's no
evolution in the relations,'' he said in an interview. ``They are
where they've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   International human rights monitors said Cuba's latest
retrenching only served to underscore how little the situation has
changed, even after Pope John Paul II, during his visit here last
year, urged Cuba to open up to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because of the high expectations raised by the
pope's visit, the Cuban government now finds itself the target of
international condemnation over its new curbs and the recent
sentencing of four dissidents charged with sedition.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown is widely regarded as an attempt to assert control
in response to growing internal dissent and in anger at the
measures that the Clinton administration instituted last January in
lieu of a fundamental re-evaluation of American policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps taken by Washington, like allowing more dollars to
flow to Cuba, aim at providing direct help to Cubans, but officials
here argue that the true goal is destabilization.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva,
delivered on Wednesday and reprinted in full this week by the
government newspaper Granma, Vice President Carlos Lage defended
the crackdown, citing ``exceptional'' conditions caused by American
efforts to ``destabilize the country and liquidate the socialist
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of judging Cuba and its revolution, it can't be
forgotten that ours is not just any country,'' Lage said.
</P>
<P>
   International rights monitors say such a reaction is to be
expected, particularly when a government perceives a loss of
control. Cuba's control has been slowly eroding because of
increasing contacts with the outside world through family visits
and tourism, and more access to dollars, which makes Cubans less
economically dependent on the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction of the regime is totally predictable.'' said Jose
Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of
Human Rights Watch in Washington. ``The big challenge is to keep
cool heads and keep going, trying to have a flexible policy toward
Cuba and to pressure, in a concerted way, the Cuban government to
improve human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   This week two groups, the Press Association, whose membership
list stretches from Canada to Argentina, and the Committee to
Protect Journalists, which is based in New York, cited Cuba as
being among the worst violators of press freedoms. Amnesty
International says that the number of political prisoners in Cuba
has declined but that at least 350 remain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They include Vladimiro Roca, Felix A. Bonne, Rene Gomez Manzano
and Marta B. Roque, who were sentenced this month to terms from 3{
to 5 years for sedition after issuing a document urging the
Communist Party to allow political pluralism and an impartial legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be in prison just for having an opinion,'' said
Magaly de Armas, wife of Roca, who is 56. ``Vladimiro says his
father always taught him to put his ideas into practice if he was
sure of them, and to follow ideas, not men.'' Roca is the son of a
revolutionary leader, Blas Roca, who died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In a public response to the international uproar over the
sentences, Cuban officials said in Granma that the four were
sentenced not because of their opinions but because they served the
goals of American officials by meeting with them, calling for a
boycott of elections and other such ``subversive'' actions.
</P>
<P>
   Laws passed last February to protect ``national independence and
the economy of Cuba'' present critics of the government with ever
harsher penalties.
</P>
<P>
   While the anticrime segments, addressing new crimes like money
laundering and stiffening penalties for drug trafficking and
prostitution of minors, are accepted by many as necessary, another
portion of the legislation has left dissidents and independent
journalists with what one called ``psychological paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   This section imposes sentences of 7 to 15 years on anyone who
provides information ``to facilitate the objectives of the
Helms-Burton law, the embargo and the economic war against our
people'' _ basically, the American sanctions. Fines and up to eight
years in jail can now be imposed on those possessing or
disseminating ``subversive'' American material.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone collaborating with newspapers, radio, television and
other ``foreign'' media to further the American goals faces as much
as five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick of this law is its ambiguity,'' said Raul Rivero,
head of Cubapress, a news agency of 27 independent journalists who
have continued working with American and other foreign news media.
``The problem is you never know when you're `collaborating.' Even a
love letter could be interpreted that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate of fear, the sports and cultural exchanges from
the United States are going forward to impress American values on
Cuban people directly, a senior Clinton administration official
said. The official said those and other contacts, like visits and
remittances from Cuban-American relatives, have helped make Cubans
less willing to accept their government.
</P>
<P>
   But while many here regard the exchanges as positive, some
Cubans said they expect no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness is already there,'' noted Manuel Cuesta,
secretary general of a social democratic organization whose goal is
recognition as a political party. ``That is why so many leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivanco, of Human Rights Watch, said the U.S. embargo, which is
promoted with zeal by the politically influential, right-wing
Cuban-American lobby, has divided the international community and
prevented many countries that care about human rights from
coalescing with the United States for a unified response to Cuba.
He said that is about the only pressure that could make the Cuban
government budge.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials say the embargo will remain as long as
President Fidel Castro wants it lifted on his terms, without making
any reforms.
</P>
<P>
   At a construction site here where baseball was the topic of
conversation one recent afternoon, workers turned laconic when
asked whether they thought Sunday's game, the first showdown
between Cuba and an American Major League team since the
revolution, would improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally one of them, Julio Martinez, a 34-year-old mason, spoke
up and said: ``In the field of sports, we're getting closer. What
it does in other fields I don't know because that's none of my
business.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Ejected from his homeland at gunpoint
Saturday, Zelfi Skreta shuffled stunned in a cold gray drizzle
through this border checkpoint from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   All he possessed were the worn clothes on his back and the
Yugoslavian passport in his hand. In his native Albanian, the
63-year-old farmer told a harrowing story of leaving his embattled
Kosovo village in the morning hoping to find safety in the larger
border town of General Jankovic(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   He said he and two friends wandered the roads near the border
until they encountered Serb soldiers who stopped them and commanded
them to leave Kosovo immediately and head into neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The flesh under his right eye was swollen and purple. ``A
soldier did this,'' he said, gesturing gingerly to the bruise. ``He
hit me with his fist and then his gun.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was struck because he asked to return to his village
of Seciste. ``They said, 'Go to Macedonia.'''
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers and police went door-to-door Saturday through
towns and villages across the Varda River from this isolated border
crossing ordering residents to pack up and head to Macedonia, said
Kosovar Albanians who were streaming across the border by late
afternoon. The river of Kosovo refugees into Macedonia -- estimated
at 16,000 -- has continued to swell since NATO air strikes began
against Serb military targets on on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they had been given two hours to leave or risk being
shot. Others said they were afforded five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came to my home and said you have to go,'' said
Suma Bacis, 71. ``They said if you don't go we will kill you. The
army is stealing everything we left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   One man said he asked Serb police to wait while he searched for
his passport. He was told he wouldn't need it and was commanded to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, Ahmed Kalisi, said old men who were too frail
to walk were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   By sundown all that remained in General Jankovic were heavily
armed Serb troops. The town, about 20 miles from the Macedonian
capital of Skopje, lies in the path NATO ground forces in Macedonia
would take to enter Kosovo. It rests on one of the few good roads
that snakes through the steep mountains that rise between the
troubled countries.
</P>
<P>
   Residents on the Macedonian side of the border said Serb
soldiers have increased patrols in recent nights, and they said
they've seen them planting landmines.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down the road from the Blace checkpoint, Italian
troops have taken up positions in rutted fields with several
armored personnel carriers and mechanized artillery. Nearby,
Macedonian farmers pushed plows behind huge horses and cast seeds
on the broken soil by hand.
</P>
<P>
   With conditions in Kosovo deteriorating rapidly as the U.S.-led
NATO escalate, ethnic Albanians are stepping up their exodus into
neighboring Macedonia, where officials have shown considerable
ambivalence about welcoming them.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials have expressed fears that the influx of
Albanian refugees could jar the delicate ethnic balance that
supports a fledgling democracy in Macedonia, a former Yugoslavian
republic. About 40 percent of Macedonia's population of about 2.2
million are ethnic Albanians. The NATO strikes already have raised
tensions, with the tiny Serb minority staging violent
demonstrations here outside the embassies of Britain and the United
States. The U.S. embassy here has been surrounded by spools of
razor wire and President Clinton has ordered 100 heavily armed
Marines there to help protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that about 20,000 refugees have come to
Macedonia, but the number is probably greater. The Kosovar
Albanians are difficult to track because they move in with
Macedonian Albanians rather than creating large refugee camps as
they have in Kosovo and neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia officials also worry the Serbs may retaliate because
Macedonia is the base for the 10,000 NATO troops destined for
Kosovo if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bows to Western
pressure and accepts them.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities have forced the refugee flow to Macedonia by
sealing the Kosovo border with Albania, which was rich with supply
routes for arms bound for ethnic Albanian guerillas seeking
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Britain and the United States have accused Belgrade
of launching a full-scale offensive against Kosovo separatists in
the wake of the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, describe
a chaotic nightmare with Serbs and Albanian guerrillas engaged in
house-to-house combat. There have been numerous reports of
explosions in the central city. Serbs also have been accused of
killing ethnic Albanian intellectuals and destroying non-Serb
property.
</P>
<P>
   NATO pledged to pursue war criminals in Serbia amid reports that
Serb forces were retaliating against ethnic Albanians for the NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have reports coming out,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told BBC radio. ``We will have evidence to initiate war crimes
prosecutions in the future against those who are carrying out these
massacres. There will be no impunity for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With foreign observers and reporters ejected from Kosovo, there
is little outside contact with Pristina. Phone lines and cellular
phone systems have been destroyed in the NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign workers for international relief agencies, which were
plentiful in Pristina before the attacks, have fled to Skopje.
There is only dire speculation about the condition of more than
100,000 refugees within Kosovo displaced by nearly a year of
fighting. Convoys led by foreign groups had been their only source
of food and water.
</P>
<P>
   When the aid groups left after the bombing started they left
their stores of food and other supplies in warehouses in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cook of World Vision expressed a common concern about the
fate of local people in Pristina who had been hired by the aid
agencies, who were at times at odds with Serbian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from our people for days,'' he said. ``I'm
quite worried.''

JAPAN WEIGHS FORMAL STATUS FOR ITS FLAG AND ANTHEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government is trying to rehabilitate the
flag of the rising sun and the national song of praise for the
Emperor, giving them legal status despite criticism that in World
War II they were emblematic of Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is preparing legislation to make
them the national flag and national anthem, although it is unclear
when the bill might actually become law.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, or hinomaru, and the song, called Kimigayo, have been
widely used in the postwar period. The hinomaru flies above
government offices and is used at state banquets, and Kimigayo is
played at sumo matches and at Olympic medal ceremonies when
Japanese athletes win.
</P>
<P>
   So their legal adoption would not make much practical
difference, beyond perhaps standardizing their forms. The
dimensions of the flag's design _ a red sun in the center of a
white rectangle _ varies, and there are several version of the
song.
</P>
<P>
   But formalizing them has been controversial because of the
associations with the war, and until now Japanese governments have
shied away from giving them legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and his Cabinet officials argue that the sensitivities
left over from the war have faded enough both within Japan and
abroad to allow the present situation to be formalized. Still, in
the last few days Obuchi has signaled that he may proceed
cautiously because of criticism at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to follow the trend of public opinion, and the opinion
of the mass media,'' Obuchi told Japanese television last week.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to raise the issue attests to Japan's growing
self-confidence, its discontent with the ambiguities left by the
war, its frustration with the criticism that erupts whenever it
tries to assert pride in its past, and its diminishing concern with
taboos connected to history.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and other officials note that there is nothing
intrinsically militaristic about the flag or anthem; the roots of
both go back many centuries. Kimigayo has no rockets' red glare or
bombs bursting in air or other war images. It is an ode to the
Emperor, a prayer for him to reign ``until the pebbles of today
have merged into boulders whose sides are lined with moss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The song is understood as a prayer for the peace and
longstanding prosperity of the nation, with the Emperor
personifying the integration of people and country,'' Obuchi told
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the war left the flag and song as inextricably
linked to brutality as the swastika in Germany. So Japanese
pacifists and some countries in Asia have expressed concern about
the idea of giving them legal status.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bear testimony to a militaristic past which proved to be
the bane of Asia and indeed of Japan itself,'' said the Singapore
Straits Times in an editorial. It added that ``Tokyo has rekindled
a divisive national issue that may have repercussions for its image
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japan Teachers Union, which traditionally has leaned left
and been hostile to the flag and song, adopted a resolution urging
the government to wait until a consensus has been reached, but it
did not rule out the move. The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's most
influential newspaper, took a similar editorial position, urging
the government to ``steadily win consent from the public'' before
pushing the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago or 20 years ago, I would have opposed this,''
said Yasuaki Onuma, a Tokyo University law professor who has
organized programs for Japanese to help Korean and other victims of
World War II. ``But frankly speaking, whether we should have this
as a customary rule or as a statutory rule does not seem so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Education Ministry has called for the flag and
song to be used in school graduations, and that is usually where
disputes arise. Prime Minister Obuchi decided to push for the law
after a high school principal killed himself Feb. 28 after being
caught in the middle of a dispute about whether to include Kimigayo
at this year's commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legislation will not address another void left over
from history: officially, Japan has no head of state. The functions
of head of state are usually taken up by the emperor, but putting
that into law would require a constitutional amendment, and for
now, no one is even talking about it.

HOPES FOR A MEMORIAL EBB WITH `PRIVATE RYAN' LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By IAN ZACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Va. _ Bob Slaughter hasn't bought a movie ticket since
his wife dragged him to see ``The Sound of Music'' way back in
1965. ``I have no interest whatsoever in that stuff,'' Slaughter, a
74-year-old retiree, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Slaughter, a crusading D-Day veteran, still found himself
glued to his television set last Sunday night for the interminable
Academy Awards broadcast, during which he rooted _ in vain, it
turned out _ for the Steven Spielberg film ``Saving Private Ryan''
to take home Best Picture honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up till 1 o'clock or 1:30,'' he said. ``I was
disappointed that picture didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   So were the other board members of the National D-Day Memorial
Foundation, of which Slaughter is chairman, at its headquarters in
this city of 6,400, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was hoping that an Oscar sweep for the D-Day epic
would help it reach a $12 million fund-raising goal for the
construction of a major national memorial, a rarity outside
Washington. Congress chose Bedford as the site for the sprawling
nine-acre D-Day memorial in 1996, a nod to the community's
sacrifice on June 6, 1944, when it lost more men per capita in the
Normandy invasion than any other place in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The project, though, has fallen behind schedule. The foundation
has raised more than $8 million, but about $3 million of that
exists only as pledges and, without enough cash on hand, the
memorial's planners have postponed construction.
</P>
<P>
   The dedication of a ceremonial granite victory arch at the base
of the memorial, which had been planned for the 55th anniversary of
D-Day in June, has been delayed. And the completion date for the
memorial of June 6, 2000, is now in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, World War II veterans are not getting any younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men are all so anxious to see it,'' said Lucille Hoback
Boggess, who serves on the Bedford County Board of Supervisors and
who lost two brothers, ages 30 and 24, on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five Bedford men, including Raymond and Bedford Hoback,
were members of A Company, 116th Regiment of the 29th Infantry
Division, a Virginia National Guard unit that was part of the
invasion's first wave. Nineteen Bedforders were killed in a hail of
bullets soon after they leaped off landing boats on the shores of
Normandy. Two more died later in a day of ferocious fighting. At
the time, Bedford's population was only 3,200.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only two of Bedford's men from A Company survive.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's film, which captured the carnage and chaos of the
D-Day landing like no other, has brought the memorial project
untold publicity. The foundation had hoped to catch a final
windfall from the Oscars, and in anticipation of an Academy Award
for the film, placed a full-page advertisement in USA Today on
Monday. The advertisement began, ``It took our generation's
greatest storyteller to tell their generation's greatest story,''
and included a phone number to call, (800) 351-DDAY.
</P>
<P>
   Three pages away, the American Battle Monuments Commission,
raising money to build the National World War II Monument on the
Mall in Washington, ran its own full-page advertisement, featuring
Tom Hanks, the film's star. ``I guess they had the same idea we
did,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The D-Day memorial foundation's staff of five, working out of an
old corner newspaper office just down the block from Granny Greer's
General Store in downtown Bedford, has attracted some wealthy
donors for the memorial, including Charles Schulz, the ``Peanuts''
comic strip creator and a World War II veteran, who gave $1 million
and agreed to serve as chairman of the fund-raising drive.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the highest hill in Bedford remains just that, with two
wooden poles marking the place in the red clay where the victory
arch is to be place.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's design has all the grandeur of a Washington
memorial, made more impressive by the surrounding peaks of the Blue
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The green, white and black arch _ inscribed with the invasion's
code name Operation Overlord _ will rise 44 feet, 6 inches, for the
year, month and day of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the arch will be two plazas that will depict
Allied soldiers in bronze. Several grim-faced soldiers will be
shown wading through water onto the beach, while others will be
shown scaling the German fortress on their way to reaching the
arch. A 33,000-square-foot education center is also planned.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials expect more than 200,000 visitors annually
at the site, a four-hour drive southwest of Washington, and private
developers already have bought up much of the surrounding land,
expecting a market for hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   William McIntosh, the foundation's vice president for education,
hopes the memorial will show that the nation's heart exists outside
the Capital Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this could serve as a model for other national memorials
outside of Washington, then that would be a valuable thing,'' he
said. ``Right now, the implication is you can't be in the nation
unless you're in Washington. But the nation can be in Montana, the
nation can be in Pennsylvania, the nation can be in Virginia.''

A WARTIME SWEDISH TALE, IN REVISION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The setting: wartime Stockholm; neutral
capital, nest of spies. The players: two brothers, scions of
Sweden's mightiest business dynasty, one dealing with Hitler's
Germany, the other with Churchill's Britain. The question: whose
side were they on?
</P>
<P>
   More than a half century later, when Europe has been hit with a
wave of self-questioning over its wartime morality, the answer
might seem just one more footnote to history. But the brothers were
Wallenbergs _ prominent among the power elite that runs this land
and leaders of a business whose tentacles stretch across Europe. So
the answer has implications for the future of that business and for
the country's view of its own neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob Wallenberg was accused of a number of things over the
last couple of years, so we have gone back and looked for
answers,'' said his 43-year-old great-nephew, also called Jacob
Wallenberg. He is the chairman of the family bank, SEB, and a
senior figure in Investor AB, the family's financial arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are intending to do is answer those points,'' he said.
``It is a direct response to the discussion that has been prevalent
in Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Wallenberg often evokes a distant cousin of the
financial players. Raoul Wallenberg was a diplomat who saved many
Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary and who disappeared in the Soviet
Union at the end of the war to meet a fate that has never been
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In that era, the brothers Jacob and Marcus were, among many
other things, the owners of the factories that supplied roller
bearings to Hitler's war machine until 1944. They also sold roller
bearings to England.
</P>
<P>
   Their wartime dealings with Robert Bosch GmbH, a German company
founded in 1886 that became a world leader in automotive
electronics, provoked an uproar immediately after the war over a
transaction involving an American subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another story, known to historians for decades, yet
only now emerging with texture and detail from the Wallenberg
family archives. The family has been offering those details on the
Internet to try to deflect any suggestion that the family tree is
tainted with collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of those two brothers, who were not simply doing
a neutral country's business with Germany and England. They used
their unique position to provide a clandestine, risky and
high-level link between conspirators seeking to overthrow Hitler _
among them Carl Goerdeler, the mayor of Leipzig _ and close
advisers to Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Even as that story emerges, some historians suggest other
details may follow as more archives are opened. The family
business, which began with a Stockholm bank in 1856, has grown and
diversified and now accounts for about 40 percent of the Swedish
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wallenbergs were very shrewd businessmen, and I don't
think there was any sentimentality in their dealings with
Goerdeler,'' said Klemens von Klemperer, a historian at Smith
University who published a major work in 1992, ``German Resistance
Against Hitler: The Search for Allies Abroad, 1938-1945'' (Oxford
University Press).
</P>
<P>
   It was not until two years ago, when researchers chanced upon
sealed envelopes that had been kept in a vault apart from the
family archives, that many of the details emerged, said Anders
Perlinge, the family's chief archivist. They bore instructions that
only Jacob or Marcus should open them.
</P>
<P>
   Their descendants approved opening the envelopes. Inside, the
researchers found remarkable correspondence that offered insights
into a triangular relationship between Goerdeler, the Wallenberg
brothers in Stockholm and, in London, Charles Hambro, a peacetime
banker and wartime spy close to Churchill and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The letters trace a desperate effort by Goerdeler to contact
Churchill and to win his support for an effort to overthrow Hitler.
When the doomed attempt was made, on July 20, 1944, Goerdeler was
among those arrested and executed.
</P>
<P>
   He first came into contact with the Wallenbergs before the war
as an adviser to the Bosch company in Stuttgart, which had close
ties with the Wallenbergs' firm. After the outbreak of war, Sweden
appointed negotiators to address its trade with the belligerents
under requirements of international law dealing with neutral
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Wallenberg was named as a negotiator with Germany because
he spoke the language and had business ties there, said Ulf Olsson,
a historian at Goeteborg University, and Marcus was appointed
Britain, where he had similar connections.
</P>
<P>
   Their companies, particularly the SKF ball bearing plant, thus
became part of a web of deals in which Sweden traded iron ore and
other products for German coal, coke and chemicals in transactions
financed partly by looted Nazi gold, according to several recent
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ruth, former editor of the Dagens Nyheter daily newspaper,
which has campaigned in recent years for openness about Sweden's
dealings with the Third Reich, the brothers ``had a double
function.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were privately defining their business interests in
relation to the Allies and the Germans,'' he said. ``And they were
also diplomats defining official Swedish policy.''
</P>
<P>
   At another level, however, the Wallenbergs were playing an even
more complex game, according to a new study of the affair by Gert
Nylander, who was for many years the chief Wallenberg family
archivist.
</P>
<P>
   According to his study, which draws on the recently discovered
documents, ``business'' meetings between Carl Goerdeler and Jacob
Wallenberg were known to both the Nazi regime and the Swedish
government. But the meetings _ in Berlin and Stockholm between 1939
and 1943 _ were also a forum for ``concrete efforts at establishing
contacts between the German opposition and the British government,
with the active participation of the Wallenbergs,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   German generals who opposed Hitler wanted several commitments
from Churchill, including that allied bombing raids would cease
during a coup attempt and that there would be a chance to negotiate
peace terms. Churchill made no promises but did not discourage the
plotters, the latest Swedish documents suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The documents have been posted on a Web site
(http://arkiv.wallenberg.org), published in German and Scandinavian
historical journals and translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   But they have not answered everyone's questions. When a Swedish
historians' commission published findings on their country's
dealings with the Nazis, Salomo Berlinger, a member representing
Sweden's Jews, said ``more research should be done'' into the role
played by Swedish wartime business establish ``whether it prolonged
or contributed to prolonging the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johannes Tuchel, director of the German Resistance Memorial
Center in Berlin, ``The last word about the Wallenbergs has not
been spoken.''

DOCTORS TACKLE SCARS OF NAIROBI BLAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Spain)   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ ``You know, when you have the scars,'' Rebecca
Gicuku said, ``everybody is staring at you. They tell you, `Sorry.'
I don't feel comfortable. It reminds me of the horrible day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gicuku, 27, was composed enough to talk as a doctor dug two
incisions the shape of the letter W into her forehead. She winced.
The anesthetic was not working well.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed worth the pain. The doctor was a plastic surgeon
smoothing down two bulbous scars, evidence in flesh of the bomb
blast that killed more than 200 people on Aug. 7 and wounded 5,000
others.
</P>
<P>
   When terrorists destroyed the U.S. Embassy here, doctors worked
around the clock for three straight days. They had no time to worry
about being neat. But this month a team of plastic surgeons _
Kenyans, Americans and Spaniards, along with a crew of
anesthesiologists from New York and New Jersey _ have been going
beyond those life-saving efforts, hoping to erase the physical
scars from some 350 survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional scars are a different matter. But the surgeons
hope that lessening some of the surface wounds might open the way
to a deeper healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try to bring you back to where you were,'' Dr.
Meshach Omguti, the chief of plastic surgery at Jomo Kenyatta
National Hospital, assured Ms. Gicuku as he began to stitch up her
forehead. A secretary, her face and chest were blasted with glass
from her office window.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will never forget the day the bomb blast occurred,'' he
said. ``It changed lives. But this helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Furnas, a surgical technician from Orange, Calif.,
whose husband, David, put together the team of four American
surgeons, said: ``We're doing more than repairing scars. We're
giving them an ego boost, a psychological boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery may not seem like the first concern for bombing
victims. But soon after the bombing a group of doctors from the
African Medical and Research Foundation decided that hundreds of
people would need reconstructive surgery, some of it cosmetic and
some of it a medical necessity. The foundation runs East African
Flying Doctors Services, a group of surgeons who travel to rural
areas fixing problems like cleft palates.
</P>
<P>
   The group raised money and recruited six foreign surgeons and
eight anesthesiologists and technicians, all of whom donated their
time and most of whom had experience working in poor parts of the
world (The United States government gave half a million dollars to
the program; British Airways donated air fare; Kenyatta hospital
supplied some staff members and operating rooms, and various drug
and equipment companies gave tens of thousands of dollars in
medicine and machines).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Ratner, for example, a 49-year-old anesthesiologist
from Manhattan, has made several medical trips to a village in
northern Kenya, and so jumped at the chance to head up the
anesthesiology team these past weeks. Seeing patient after patient
_ blinded, deaf, riddled with shrapnel _ made him realize just how
destructive the bomb was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt badly before,'' Ratner said. ``But when you see
all the scars and the tragedy, you see that there are human beings
involved and it's not just a sound bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Each doctor operated on half a dozen or more people a day. Much
of the work has been picking out pieces of glass, some the size of
silver dollars, from the victims' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   As she lay on an operating table, Millicent Maina, 37, described
how two pieces of glass in her right knee sometimes made her feel
as if flies were creeping over her. At other times it sent pain up
her leg.
</P>
<P>
   Furnas, who teaches at the University of California at Irvine,
cut both pieces out.
</P>
<P>
   There were far more serious cases, like those of two patients
who by coincidence also have the last name Maina and share a first
name as well, David.
</P>
<P>
   The younger David Maina is 13, and had been sitting on a bus
across the street from the embassy when the bomb went off. His jaw
was nearly ripped off, and despite an earlier operation his mouth
could barely close.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Furnas, 67, who is tall and white-haired, grafted
some skin from David's groin onto his face, tightening his mouth,
smoothing out some scars and setting the stage for later operation
that will rebuild the bones of his jaw. He said he felt better, but
five days after the operation, it would be too much to say he felt
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some pain here.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other David Maina is a 55-year-old cab driver who was
standing next to his Mercedes when the bomb when off, taking off an
ear and burning big patches of his scalp and chest.
</P>
<P>
   The work on Maina was extensive: Surgeons implanted what amounts
to a balloon under his scalp to stretch the skin so it ultimately
can be sewn up over his head scars.
</P>
<P>
   But his own wish for the operation was more basic. He wanted his
ear reshaped so it would once again support his glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better now,'' he said, and the operation has been one of
the few bright spots since the blast: He has not been able to work
or pay rent and, half blind, he cannot drive a cab again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blast has destroyed me completely,'' he said. ``Even the
car I was using had a loan on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's ward, Patricia Ouko, a 50-year-old mother of
seven children, said life had been hard since the explosion, when
the window beside which she was typing exploded and sent glass
shrapnel into her forehead. She is filled sometimes with ``bad
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you wake during the sleep without knowing why,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though her head was still bandaged, she said she was happy with
the operation and invited a visitor to look in her file at a
photograph of the dark marks on her brow. It would all be
different, she said, when the bandage came off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least,'' she said, ``I won't hear any remarks about my
face.''

   A dozen zoo workers and visiting children, most of them Navajo,
watch intently from outside the bear's enclosure, and Bender
improvises a bear anatomy lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Yogi and 77 other animals in the seven-acre zoo in
northeast Arizona has brought an unusual controversy to the Navajo
people and to Kelsey Begaye, the tribe's new president. Although
the issue seems simple _ even humorous, to outsiders _ it signals
the stresses among the reservation's 175,000 Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with economic depression, political instability and
technological advances, many Navajos are turning for guidance to
their traditions and culture. But in this case, the assertion of
tradition and the cultural reverence for animals have combined to
put the future of the 36-year-old zoo in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culture shock that we're experiencing,'' said Harry
Walters, a Navajo who is an anthropologist and the chairman of the
Center for Dineh Studies at Dineh Community College, about 50 miles
north of Window Rock. ``Dineh'' is Navajo for ``the people,'' what
members of the tribe call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began on Jan. 11, the last day in office of the
tribe's outgoing president, Milton Bluehouse. He ordered the zoo
closed and its animals set free, saying that he gave the order
because two Navajo women reported to him that Holy People _ a
reference to Navajo deities _ had appeared to them and issued a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The deities, the women told him, had said that the Navajo people
were not living according to tradition and that they were upsetting
the natural order by keeping animals caged in the zoo. Located in
Window Rock, the capital of the Navajo Nation, the zoo is behind
the Navajo Museum, amid imposing red sandstone cliffs and
monoliths.
</P>
<P>
   The sightings of the Holy People are similar to appearances of
Mary in Western Europe, but with a critical difference, Walters
said. ``Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw
it was nuts or not _ that's what a Westerner would do _ we look at
it as a message: `Are we going the way we should?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest over the zoo's closure surprised Navajo officials.
During Begaye's first month in office, he received more letters on
the zoo than on any other issue, said Tina James, his press
officer. Most were from Navajo children wanting the zoo to remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   Begaye quickly but temporarily reversed Bluehouse's order, and
no animals were released. But the controversy flared on Navajo and
English-language talk radio and in regional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Foster, Begaye's chief of staff, met with the Navajo
Nation's Hataalii Advisory Council, a group of medicine men, which
declared that it would be disrespectful to discuss the animals'
fate while they were sleeping or hibernating. The group imposed a
period of silence until the first thunderstorms, which generally
come in April, Ms. James said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said that the president would consult with the tribal
council's natural resources committee before making a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials are considering scenarios other than closing
the zoo, including letting the current population die and not
accepting other animals. Another option is to rename the zoo,
because ``zoo'' is considered disrespectful to the animals, and to
call it a natural resources center. Shuttling between meetings with
his new staff recently, a harried Begaye said, ``By not closing it,
we're saying leave it open.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a difficult time for the Navajo Nation.
Last year, the tribe had four presidents, including two who
resigned because of financial questions.
</P>
<P>
   While other tribes have looked to gambling to boost their
economies, Navajos have twice voted against casino development.
Begaye has characterized economic conditions on the
27,000-square-mile reservation, the biggest in the United States,
as worse now than during the Great Depression. Unemployment stands
at 46 percent, per capita income is $5,600, and the reservation's
poverty rate is 56 percent. Revenue from natural resource
development last year dropped by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That the zoo's animals have become caught up in the tribe's
stresses is not surprising. Animals are central to Navajo culture
and religious beliefs, an integral part of the natural order, the
cycles of life that maintain balance.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition strictly governs the treatment of animals, including,
for instance, how to use or dispose of every part of a deer. Grave
consequences can be expected from sport hunting, because it
violates the natural order that ensures rain, bountiful crops and
effective ceremonial life, Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use these living things,'' he said, ``we do it within
this order, so we don't upset the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Navajos speak fondly of animals, and the term ``respect'' creeps
into conversations about animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play with bear cubs, when I was 4 or 5,'' said
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   But by tradition Navajos do not keep animals enclosed, even
inside their homes as pets, although cats, dogs and horses may live
outside, around a house. The Navajo language does not have a word
for ``pet'' and uses instead a variant of the word for ``horse,''
an animal that was introduced by Europeans, Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   This is how he described the philosophical underpinning of
Navajo attitudes toward animals: ``The environment is part of you.
The space you occupy is a part of you. May there be beauty all
around me. This is where we are.''

</P>
<P>
   At the zoo, Bender and Loline Hathaway, the curator, tuck in
Yogi and then check the cougars and wolves. There are no exotic
animals at the zoo, which houses only species that are known to
Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Bender and Ms. Hathaway, who are both white, said that many of
the animals would perish if they were released. Some, like the
eagle with an amputated wing, were brought to the park because of
injuries that still cause problems. Others like Gummer, the
toothless resident coyote, are geriatric.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of animals like the cougars, which have lived at
the zoo since they were cubs, is hard to predict. If they were to
fend for themselves for the first time, attacks on people might
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Because of federal wildlife regulations, species like the eagle
and wolf are protected and cannot be released.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hathaway, who has directed the zoo for 16 years, said
visitors signing the guest register overwhelmingly support keeping
it open. Two visitors who wanted it closed were animal rights
advocates from Boston who took pictures to include in a mural they
were making there.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was founded in 1963, when New Mexico game and fish
officials gave a bear to the tribe. As stray and injured animals
were brought to the zoo, it grew, with tribal financing. Over the
decades, Navajo schoolchildren have visited, and medicine men have
gathered eagle and hawk feathers to use in ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more relaxed then,'' said Martin Link, an
anthropologist who was the first director of the Navajo Museum and
became a de facto zoo director when he took in that first bear. In
February, the Navajo Department of Natural Resources gave Link, who
is white, an award for his service at both the museum and the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Link said he was not surprised at the controversy over the zoo.
``As basic culture changes and parts of it start to disintegrate,
the things that hold on are the negative aspects: `Don't do
that,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all traditionalists favor closing the zoo. Anderson Hoskie,
a medicine man who uses traditional healing practices in his work
with Navajo substance abusers, said some medicine men have looked
to the spirits of the zoo animals to guide and protect them, and he
has used the eagle to perform the rare Eagle Chant ceremony for
general health protection.
</P>
<P>
   As Hoskie talked about the ancient healing ceremony, a hundred
yards away in a meeting room, tribal managers were attending a
seminar on the year 2000 computer problem given by Johns Hopkins
University. The juxtaposition might jar outsiders, but Walters
points out that over the centuries, Navajos have successfully
absorbed new ways of doing things, from raising sheep to computer
technology. The problem now, he said, is that ``we're changing so
suddenly that we have these clashes.''

PINOCHET FACES 33 NEW COUNTS IN EXTRADITION CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Spanish judge whose extradition request has kept
Gen. Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in London for the past
five months sent British prosecutors 33 new charges of human rights
abuses against the former Chilean dictator on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, said that all the new allegations
relate to a period beginning in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That date became critical to Pinochet's future Wednesday when
England's highest court, the Law Lords, ruled that the decision on
whether to proceed with the extradition case could be based only on
crimes alleged to have occurred after that date.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year in which torture overseas became a crime
punishable in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the ruling was to eliminate 27 of the 30 original
charges of crimes against humanity, and the court directed British
Home Secretary Jack Straw to reconsider his earlier approval of the
extradition request now that the case was substantially weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London in October on Garzon's
request that he stand trial in Madrid on charges of genocide,
conspiracy to murder, kidnapping, hostage taking and torture in
connection with the deaths or disappearances of 3,000 people from
1973 to 1990, when he ruled Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed that her
office had received new information from Garzon Saturday, but she
refused comment on whether it would figure in Straw's review.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Durkin, a spokesman for Amnesty International, which
supports the effort to try Pinochet in Madrid, said, ``It's still
too early to be sure what the legal position on the new cases is.''
</P>
<P>
   The High Court has scheduled a hearing for Monday to hear a plea
from Pinochet's lawyers that the extradition effort should be ended
and that he should be allowed to return to Chile.

WILL OF `YUPPIE GURU' INSPIRES AN UN-ZENLIKE BATTLE FOR $18 MILLION
ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ When Frederick P. Lenz III swallowed 150
tablets of Valium and stepped off a dock into the bay behind his
Long Island home last year, he left behind a collection of
mansions, private jets and luxury cars valued at $18 million, and a
will that practically invited a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lenz, who called himself Rama and was frequently dubbed the
Yuppie Guru, made his fortune through lectures on meditation and
computer science that drew hundreds of fee-paying followers, but he
was best known for his two spiritual novels, ``Surfing the
Himalayas'' and ``Snowboarding to Nirvana'' (St. Martin's Press,
1995 and 1997).
</P>
<P>
   In his will, he was clear on two points: His family should be
disinherited and all of his pets should be destroyed. His plans for
his riches, however, were much more ambiguous. The will says his
entire estate should go to a foundation to promote his ideas,
unless he had failed to take ``significant steps'' to establish the
foundation before his death. In that case, all his money was to go
to the National Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died, in an apparent suicide pact with a female
devotee (who survived) on April 13, Lenz, 48, had not formed a
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the executor of the estate and the National Audubon Society
are fighting over Lenz's money in Westchester County Surrogate's
Court here. The executor, Norman Marcus, claims that the money
should go to the Frederick P. Lenz III Foundation for American
Buddhism, which Marcus established and made himself president of
after Lenz's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society, on the other hand, is taking an
extraordinary legal tack, arguing that Lenz was a fraud and a cult
leader and that the world would be better off if the money went to
the society. It has filed a lawsuit seeking the entire estate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their legal papers, the Audubon Society's lawyers
refer to Lenz as a charlatan whose claim of believing in Buddhism
was a sham. They say that toward the end of his life he was more
interested in scuba diving and writing computer software than in
spreading his gospel. They do not mention that a gift of $18
million would equal more than a third of the Audubon Society's
annual $49 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sincerity and extent of Lenz's belief in Buddhism is
disputed,'' Susan Bloom, a lawyer for the Audubon Society, wrote in
an affidavit. ``He lectured about something called `American
Buddhism,' which, by all accounts, was a belief system consistent
with his lavish lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the society's submission to the court is a
3-inch-thick binder of news clippings that are relentlessly
critical of Lenz.
</P>
<P>
   The articles portray Lenz, who received a doctorate in
literature from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, as
someone who could convince an auditorium full of young people that
he was the incarnation of a Hindu god. The articles say Lenz taught
his followers computer skills and then sent them out into the
business world, using his control over them to exact increasingly
large tuition payments, sometimes charging followers as much as
$3,500 a month to study with him. The articles also include tales
of sexual coercion by women who say the blond, 6-foot-3 Lenz
convinced them that they needed to sleep with him to become
enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon Society officials and their lawyers refused to comment,
but Guy Maxfield, an expert in tax and estate law who teaches at
the New York University School of Law, said the legal strategy was
a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an interesting legal tack to say, `This guy's a
terrible person; give us the $18 million,''' Maxfield said. ``But,
if you assume he really is a screwball or a charlatan and so on,
then a court may say, `Who would make better use of this money, a
foundation set up to promote his screwball ideas or a pristine
group like the Audubon Society?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, the executor, was Lenz's accountant and chief financial
officer. He left the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young in 1993 to work
for Lenz.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus refused to comment on the dispute, but his lawyer, David
M. Warren, said Lenz's life work was to disseminate his ideas. In
death, his money should be used to continue promoting his beliefs,
Warren said. Moreover, he asked, why should Lenz's money go to an
organization that seems to sneer at him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their papers are filled with attacks on him personally, and
that strikes us as being fully inconsistent with their stance of
them being the objects of his generosity,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   The executor, who has asked the court to dismiss the Audubon
Society lawsuit, has until April 7 to respond to the society's
legal motions.
</P>
<P>
   In legal papers, Marcus contends that after Lenz signed his will
in 1994, he did take ``significant steps'' to create the
foundation. He ordered a trademark search on a name he had planned
to use for the foundation, the papers say, and he inquired into the
Asian and Buddhist studies programs at Stony Brook and the
University of Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree,
with the idea that the foundation might contribute money to the
universities. Marcus also contends that Lenz had hardly any
relationship with the Audubon Society during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Like 550,000 others, Lenz belonged to the Audubon Society. He
joined in 1975 and continued his membership off and on until his
death. In 1997, he contributed $1,000 to the society. Other than
the donation, some musical recordings Lenz marketed with names like
``Ecologie'' and ``Cayman Blue,'' and some vague statements that he
made about being kind to the earth, Lenz showed little interest in
conservation or birds.
</P>
<P>
   Lenz owned estates in Greenwich, Conn.; Santa Fe, N.M; Old Field
in Suffolk County, and Bedford (which is why the will was filed in
Surrogate's Court in Westchester County). He also had two Lear jets
and several Porsches, Mercedeses and Range Rovers, and told Newsday
in a 1991 interview, ``I'm just a fun New Age guy.'' From Marcus'
point of view, however, Lenz was a holy man who has been wronged by
the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decedent's life was bound up and imbued with an abiding
dedication to Zen Buddhism and meditation and related Eastern
philosophy,'' Marcus wrote in an affidavit. ``One of the reasons
that the decedent delayed the formation of the charitable
foundation that he wanted to establish was his fear that the
creation of such an organization during his lifetime might attract
unwanted attention.''

DENIED LAST VISIT, HUSBAND OF MYANMAR OPPOSITION LEADER DIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Michael Aris, the British husband of the
Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, died of cancer
Saturday in London after being denied permission by Burmese
authorities to pay a last visit to her.
</P>
<P>
   Aris, 53, a noted scholar of Tibet at Oxford, had cared for the
couple's two teen-age sons in Britain since his wife took on her
political role in 1988 and remained in Myanmar, the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has said that the loss of
contact with her husband and of her chance to be a mother to her
sons was one of the sacrifices she had been forced to make to lead
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sacrifice her husband said she had warned him she might
one day make, from the early years of their marriage _ and one in
which he supported her. He has occasionally released statements
abroad on her behalf, and together with their sons, accepted the
Nobel Peace Prize for her in Oslo in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Aris had received only periodic permission to visit his wife
over the past 10 years, six years of which she was under house
arrest. She remains under strict government control in the capital,
Yangon (formerly Rangoon), as the military continues a campaign of
harassment and imprisonment against her party, the National League
for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Aris, who was in the late stages of prostate
cancer, had petitioned the government of Myanmar to allow him to
visit her.
</P>
<P>
   The government denied his request, saying it would make more
sense for the healthy wife to visit the sick husband. It also said
Myanmar could not provide adequate medical care to a man in his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had made it clear she would not leave
Myanmar for fear the government would not let her return.
</P>
<P>
   She issued a statement Saturday saying, ``On behalf of my sons,
Alexander and Kim, as well as in my own behalf, I want to thank all
those around the world who have supported my husband during his
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, her statement was disseminated by the
American Embassy in Myanmar, which telephoned it to reporters
abroad. The embassy has been a strong supporter of Ms. Aung San Suu
Kyi and the pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi met Aris while a student at Oxford. They
married in 1972. The government of Myanmar has questioned her
patriotism in marrying a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a visit to her dying mother in 1988 that brought Ms. Aung
San Suu Kyi to Myanmar at the time of a pro-democracy uprising that
was crushed by the military at the cost of hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the country's independence hero, Gen. Aung San,
who was assassinated in 1947, she took the leading position in the
new democratic opposition, which overwhelmingly won an election in
1990 that was then annulled by the junta.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction to a collection of his wife's writings called
``Freedom From Fear'' (Penguin Books, 1991), Aris said her decision
to stay in Myanmar ``came as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise to support her decision, which I had given in
advance so many years ago, now had to be fulfilled,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Aris described a visit to his wife in 1989. ``The days I spent
alone with her that last time, completely isolated from the world,
are among my happiest memories of our many years of marriage,'' he
wrote, adding: ``We had all the time in the world to talk about
many things. I did not suspect this was the last time we would be
together for the foreseeable future.''

ALBANY DEMOCRATS MOVE WARILY, WITH EYE ON PATAKI'S VETO KNIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gov. George Pataki of New York used his veto power over the
state budget last year for the first time, boldly slicing more than
$1 billion in spending, it so startled Democratic lawmakers that it
has left them with a kind of political post-traumatic stress.
Worried, even panicked, that the governor will again wipe away
their programs, the Democrats have all but brought this year's
talks to a standstill as they hunt for a way to fend him off.
</P>
<P>
   Some call for quickly reconciling with him by meeting many of
his demands. Others urge hostile tactics, with the Democratic
majority in the Assembly stalling his proposals until he backs
down.
</P>
<P>
   All the choices are nettlesome, which is why the Democrats have
fallen back on the quintessential Albany strategy: delay. And that
means that the state is almost certain to miss the April 1 deadline
for a new budget for the 15th year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Democrats' anxiety is this realization:
Pataki was running for re-election last year, but he still did not
shy from erasing more than 1,000 politically popular items in the
budget approved by the Legislature, from aid for school
construction to AIDS and cultural grants. This year, after coasting
to another term with little apparent damage from the vetoes, he
will no doubt be even less hesitant about invoking this authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's vetoes last year were a great surprise,'' said
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., D-Brooklyn. ``It really put us on
notice that in this year's negotiations, there must be some type of
fail-safe position and method of insuring that those things we put
in the budget, that they are held harmless from the governor's
potential vetoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to bolster his credentials as a fiscal conservative
as he broadens his national profile, Pataki wants the budget to
grow at no more than the rate of inflation, about 2 percent. His
archrivals, the Assembly Democrats, are seeking far more _ a 4
percent increase by their reckoning, and 8 percent in the
disdainful estimation of Pataki, who has repeatedly termed that
level unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a
Democrat, would ultimately have reached some back-room compromise,
joined by the state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a
Republican. But in 1998, glasnost swept through Albany, and instead
of negotiating the budget in private with the governor, Silver and
Bruno turned the job over to legislative committees, which reached
an agreement without a direct role for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was not involved in the horse-trading, and so not
bound by any promises, Pataki had more freedom to wield his veto
knife. It was a defining moment in his tenure, and in recent days
it has seemed as if he is spoiling for a replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will exercise that constitutional power if it comes to
that,'' he said Thursday, referring to new vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to such threats, the Assembly Democrats are mulling
options. The most drastic would be to reject the conference
committees and seek a return of the days when the three leaders
negotiated the budget in private. Pataki and Bruno would oppose
that, and it would represent a public relations stain for the
Assembly Democrats, given that the committees are considered a sign
that the Capitol is adopting late-20th-century government customs.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, the Democrats hope to persuade Pataki to advise
the conference committees about their work, so they can avoid
proposals that might incur vetoes. It is not clear, though, how
much Pataki will oblige.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Silver could give up trying to lure Pataki into the process, and
instead seek to forge an alliance with Bruno, who is a longtime
Pataki ally but could yet turn traitorous. If Bruno would agree to
override Pataki vetoes, the Assembly Democrats could probably
protect their proposals. Last year, Bruno opposed an override,
unwilling to embarrass the governor while he was seeking
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bruno will not rule out an override, and as a result he has
become a pivotal figure in the budget fight _ courted by both
Pataki and Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans are seeking more of an increase than
Pataki, less than the Assembly Democrats. If the governor also
finds that route unacceptable, Bruno could desert him. The senator
might conclude that he needs the extra spending to help his members
win re-election in 2000. After all, it is easier for Pataki to be
tightfisted because he does not face the voters again until 2002.
(Last year, even with the vetoes, Pataki pushed through an
election-year budget with a 7 percent increase.)
</P>
<P>
   Bruno has not shown his cards yet, preferring to try to mediate
between Pataki and Silver, who dislike each other and mostly talk
through Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget battle, Silver has fewer bargaining chits than the
governor. Still, Silver has already refused to allocate money for
charter schools, a key Pataki program, knowing that he can try to
exchange that for the governor's approval on Democratic spending
items.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has criticized the Republicans for the impasse, saying
that Pataki introduced his budget late and Bruno has made it
difficult to agree on the amount available to spend. For the
speaker, though, delay is a time-honored tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders long ago realized that the public blames the
governor more than lawmakers for late budgets, largely because he
is better known. So the Legislature has often tried to gain the
upper hand by refusing to act on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Assembly Democrats are hoping that if the dispute
drags on, they can link the late budget to Pataki's recent national
travels, portraying him as neglecting his duties at home in favor
of Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has one obvious pitfall. In return for winning
Pataki's support for a salary increase for lawmakers, the
Legislature agreed in December to a new law that withholds
lawmakers' pay after April 1 until they approve a budget. Pataki,
though, gets paid.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who increasingly grumble about the law, vow not to
cave in to the governor. They continue to assail the Pataki budget,
saying that it calls for unconscionable reductions in health care,
education and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   What will break the impasse? Silver was asked that question
Thursday, and he did not seem to have a ready answer. But he
appeared in no hurry to hurry things up. Maybe what is needed, he
said, with the budget deadline fast approaching, is ``some exposure
to the public as to what the issues are.''

A SOUTH FLORIDA STRONGMAN PUSHES FOR SECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIALEAH, Fla. _ This city's heart and soul are apparent along
Okeechobee Road, which forms one of its borders with Miami:
auto-repair shops with names like Torres Tires; travel agencies
where one can book a fare or send money to a relative in Cuba;
accountants' and lawyers' offices where speaking in Spanish is
taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is perhaps no clearer symbol of this city of 190,000
than its seven-term mayor, Raul Martinez. And Martinez has big
plans for Hialeah: He wants to make it its own county.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of having Hialeah pay high taxes in exchange for what he
says are Miami-Dade County's deficient services, Martinez is
seeking to build a political moat within Florida's largest urban
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go and speak with other mayors,'' he said in an interview.
``Everybody complains of the lack of services by the county.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time that I've said, `Mr. County Manager, tell me the
services you're providing us,' he says, `Well, we give you this and
we give you that,''' Martinez added. ``Well, no, they don't, and
then when I point that out, I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic administrator who supervises everything from
buying street lamps to filling potholes, Martinez is known within
Hialeah as a strongman who gets things done. And his efficiency
extends to his own position. Last year his formidable power was
further strengthened with a new city charter that also increased
his salary by $30,000, to $152,702 a year, making him the
highest-paid mayor in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 50, has been mayor since 1981, except for three years
when he was suspended from office after a federal grand jury
indicted him on racketeering and extortion charges. He was
convicted in 1991, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Two
retrials ended in hung juries.
</P>
<P>
   In January he persuaded the City Council to approve a $1.2
million settlement with him for legal fees as well as for the
salary and interest he was denied during his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez attributes his legal troubles, which stemmed from
accusations that he had traded zoning favors to developers in
exchange for money and land deals, to perjury by the opposing side,
unethical prosecutors and political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Around Miami, Martinez's bid to make his city a county, which he
first outlined a year ago, is seen as a ploy to gain additional
power.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez counters that his motives are purely practical. With
its own police, water and sewer systems, Hialeah is already able to
meet many of its daily needs, he said. The remaining assets
required by a county, like a hospital, a jail and a courthouse, can
be bought or contracted for, he added, with the $80 million to $100
million that the city currently pays Miami-Dade in taxes every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's complaints about the county administration have been
echoed by other cities and unincorporated areas that rely on the
county for everyday services. With more than 2 million residents, a
population larger than that of 17 states, and an area bigger than
Rhode Island, Miami-Dade County has, over the years, ballooned into
a megalopolis.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the county's staff has grown to about 28,000,
more than the estimated populations of 19 of Florida's 67 counties.
Along with this growth, Martinez and others say, has come increased
inefficiency and corruption. Cities like Miami Beach and Coral City
have complained that the county's resources are spread too thin to
provide the services they need to function. Opa Locka, just north
of Hialeah, has also spoken of secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our present structure needs some adjustment,'' said state Rep.
Willie Logan, a Democrat who represents Opa Locka. ``People are
feeling as if they don't have access to our government, because the
government is too far removed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many observers believe that Martinez's proposal also stems from
his bitter rivalry with Alex Penelas, the 37-year-old mayor of
Miami-Dade County and a fellow Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats, both men break from the mold of most
Cuban-Americans here. The two first met in the late 1980s when
Penelas, a newcomer to politics, received the backing of Martinez
for a seat on Hialeah's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas was elected to the county leadership in 1996, while
Martinez remained in Hialeah, his career path narrowed by the
federal case against him. In the 1997 elections, Penelas backed
Martinez's opponent, Herman Echevarria. And while the county mayor
is sometimes cited as a possible future presidential hopeful, the
city mayor bemoans the fact that his legal troubles have thwarted
his ambition of becoming a congressman or an ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Martinez's strategy is to hurt Penelas,'' said Dario
Moreno, a professor of political science at Florida International
University, ``and so far he has been winning the political battle.
He has gotten all of the attention. It's a very effective tool to
point out the shortcomings of the Penelas administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez denied that his intention was to push the county mayor
into the political shadows, but he spoke openly about his feelings
for Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different styles,'' he said. ``He deals with press
conferences, and I deal with facts and I deal with issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said that his opposition to Hialeah's bid for countyhood
rested on purely legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   As for his rivalry with Martinez, he said, ``I happen to respect
and like Martinez tremendously; this is not an issue of rivalry of
any sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Martinez set his quest for secession in
motion by asking two state legislators to file bills in the Florida
House and Senate. So far, the Senate bill has won support in the
first of several committees it must go through before being
submitted for a full vote. It calls for a special election in 2000
to let Hialeah residents decide on countyhood.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas argues that only Miami-Dade County, through a special
home rule law that allows it to define its borders, can authorize a
change in Hialeah's status.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the legal road to secession remains in dispute, few
believe that Hialeah will become a county any time soon. At most,
analysts say, the debate will serve to open a wedge of dissent that
may expose the perils of an urban sprawl that has quietly outpaced
political consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the bill will get through the state
Legislature,'' said Marsha Matson, an instructor in political
science at the University of Miami and a critic of the county
administration. ``But it might in the future if the county does not
reform itself.''

COURT RULING ALLOWS TRIPS TO THE TITANIC  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Newfoundland, France, New Guinea)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company salvaging the wreckage of the Titanic has exclusive
rights to the ship's artifacts but it cannot keep others from
visiting and photographing the wreckage, a federal appeals court
has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S.
Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., overturned a federal district
judge's ruling last year that the company RMS Titanic, which won
the salvage rights in 1994, could ban anyone else from a 10-mile
radius of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Ocean Expeditions, an adventure tour company that wants to
run tours of the wreckage, appealed the lower court decision,
contending that a company's rights to wreckage under conventional
maritime salvage law does not extend to the water surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Ocean can now go ahead with an expedition this summer, for
which passengers will pay about $35,000 to ride in mini-submarines
that can dive to depths of 12,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Blanton, a lawyer for Deep Ocean, said the company was
pleased with the decision. ``All our client ever wanted to do was
visit the wreck site and take pictures, and the court upheld that
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Ocean's owner, Mike McDowell, was leading a diving
expedition off New Guinea and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court did affirm the lower court's ruling that RMS
Titanic had exclusive rights to artifacts from the liner, and ``we
are pleased with that,'' said Bradford Stillman, a lawyer for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The company realized that its request for photography rights was
``novel,'' Stillman said, but had hoped to bring in extra money to
pay for restoration and exhibition of the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the Titanic, which hit an iceberg in the North
Atlantic on her maiden voyage in April 1912, killing 1,503
passengers and crew members, was found 400 miles off Newfoundland
in 1985 by a team of French and American scientists. RMS Titanic
claimed salvage rights by being the first company to consistently
recover artifacts from the wreckage two years later. It has
profited from displaying thousands of artifacts at exhibitions
around the world.

 By   DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. _ On a snowy afternoon in March 1986, someone
fatally stabbed an inmate named Tyrone Julius at the Clinton
Correctional Facility in Dannemora. Sixteen months later, David
Wong, a Chinese illegal immigrant who was serving time for armed
robbery, was convicted of second-degree murder in Julius' death and
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the case of Wong, prisoner No. 84-A-5320, would not
attract much notice. But this story is different, not only because
interviews with prison employees, inmates and Julius' widow
strongly suggest that Wong is innocent of murder, but also because
Wong has found unconditional support from a group of indefatigable
strangers in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, members of the David Wong Support Committee
have huddled every few weeks to fight for his release. They have
talked to Chinese government officials and college audiences around
the country. They have hired lawyers to handle his appeal. And they
have organized fund-raisers for his defense _ including a banquet
in Chinatown this month that drew 230 supporters and $8,000 in
donations.
</P>
<P>
   They have been so moved by Wong's case that at least eight
members have become lawyers to fight for people like Wong and
against a justice system that they believe is tilted against
immigrants and members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   What has ultimately sustained this long-running, long-distance
relationship, though, is not just philosophy or politics. It is
something simpler: an unexpected flowering of trust and friendship
through handwritten letters, late-night phone calls and occasional
prison visits, proving that the most intimate of connections can
sometimes emerge in the most trying of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the years wear on, the political issues are still there,
but at another level it's really a human relationship, because
we're like a family now,'' said Patti Choy, 45, a career counselor
at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and a member of
the committee. ``He knows our life; he knows all these little
things. And his letters? Just amazing. We sometimes can't get over
how we've all aged together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wong's cause has taken on even more urgency. In weeks,
maybe days, a state Court of Appeals judge, George Bundy Smith, is
expected to decide whether to hear one last appeal for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is no, which seems likely, then the last resort is
a federal habeas corpus petition, said Gabor Rona, Wong's lawyer at
the Center for Constitutional Rights in Manhattan. In such a
petition, Wong would argue that his federal constitutional rights
had been violated and that he should be released. But such
petitions are rarely granted, so there is a gathering sense that
Wong's uphill battle may soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly enough, Wong's supporters are fretting more than the
soft-spoken, diminutive Wong is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at success or failure not in terms of whether my appeal
will succeed,'' Wong, 35, said during an interview at the Auburn
Correctional Facility, where he is now incarcerated. ``I think my
success is how much I and those wonderful people accomplish to make
the system a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I didn't care about anybody, and nobody cared about
me,'' said Wong, who grew up poor in the rural Fujian province of
China and in Hong Kong before being smuggled to New York as a
teen-ager. ``But now, they have made me see the good side of human
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason so many people believe Wong is that he did not reach
out to them initially. Instead, another inmate at Dannemora, Tse
Kin Cheung, wrote to people active in Asian-American affairs to say
that Wong, who barely speaks English, had been framed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Yuri Kochiyama, a longtime civil rights advocate,
visited Wong in prison. He told her that yes, he had participated
in an armed robbery on Long Island in 1983. But no, he said, he did
not kill Julius; he had never even met him.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, Mrs. Kochiyama established the David Wong Support
Committee. Eventually, the committee persuaded William M. Kunstler,
the famed civil rights lawyer, and the Center for Constitutional
Rights to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was just straightforward,'' said Mrs. Kochiyama, 77, who
acts as host for the committee's meetings at her Harlem apartment.
``We knew that he was a guy who had been unjustly treated, and that
he needed support.''
</P>
<P>
   He has received that support from a mostly Asian-American
assortment of more than 40 students, professionals and blue-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Wong, for instance, covered David Wong's murder trial as
a reporter for a Chinese-language newspaper in New York City.
Angered by the verdict, he quit journalism and eventually became a
lawyer specializing in asylum cases. (Norman Wong is not related to
David Wong.)
</P>
<P>
   For Wayne Lum, a postal clerk, the case has been so inspiring
that he occasionally shepherds his wife and three children to the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a defining element in my life,'' Lum said.
``Before, it's like, you go to work, you have dinner, watch a
little TV, go to sleep. But now, I'm committed to these justice
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions crested at the recent Chinatown banquet, which
featured speeches, music, a raffle. But the highlight, no doubt,
was a recording of Wong's voice, reiterating his innocence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 4 p.m. on March 12, 1986, someone used a five- or six-inch
blade to stab Julius, 32, a recent arrival at the state prison in
Dannemora who had been convicted of second-degree murder in
Manhattan. The nape wound was so severe that Julius did not finish
his step, and he collapsed. He died 11 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 70 to 100 inmates in the prison yard who hovered over
Julius, only Wong and Cheung were searched. Investigators found no
weapon and no blood on either man.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wong's trial began in July 1987 in Clinton County Court, and
hinged on the testimony of Richard LaPierre, a prison guard who had
spotted Wong near the scene through his binoculars, from a tower
more than 100 yards away, and Peter DellFava, an inmate with a long
record of forgery, grand larceny and other crimes. A week later, an
all-white jury convicted Wong.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, however, a former prison employee said
the consensus among employees and inmates was that Wong ``did not
do it.'' And a guard who works at Dannemora now and was in the yard
that day said the scene was too hectic, with many similarly dressed
inmates milling about, to discern what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal self, I could not pin that incident on that guy,''
said the guard, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``I was
surprised, because he got along with people and he was never a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Several former inmates were more blunt: They said they had seen
who killed Julius, and the killer was not Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ballinger, who was released from prison in 1996 after
serving time for burglary, said Julius was attacked by two Hispanic
men from New York City in retaliation for an earlier scuffle at
Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was payback time,'' said Ballinger, who now lives in North
Carolina. ``It was so quick and smooth that the average person
wouldn't have noticed it. They were standing there, laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the stabbing, though, few people vouched for Wong
because they were worried about prison grudges, said Cheung, who
now lives in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A C.O. told me that they got the wrong guy,'' said Cheung,
referring to a corrections officer. ``A lot of inmates knew it,
too. But anybody who snitches, they can get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Sharon Julius, Julius' widow, said she, too,
had heard that her husband was killed because of an altercation at
Rikers Island. A friend of her husband even warned her that his
killer had not been caught, and that she should exercise caution in
pursuing a wrongful-death lawsuit against the state, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so after her husband's death, she said, she received
an anonymous letter and two threatening phone calls from men who
told her to stop investigating the incident _ or else. She
complied, fearful for the safety of her three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always assumed that the real killers were still out
there,'' said Mrs. Julius, who had never even heard of Wong _ much
less been informed that anyone had been convicted _ before a
reporter contacted her. ``Whoever really did it, I'd really like to
know. I want to see justice served. Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   To prosecutors in Clinton County the record has always been
clear, however. Since his conviction, Wong has lost every major
appeal, District Attorney Penelope D. Clute said. And even the
county judge, Charles H. Lewis, described Wong as ``coldblooded''
as the trial ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rona says, Wong's defense in a case so dependent on the
credibility of witnesses was compromised by several factors. He
listed the following:
</P>
<P>
   Wong's original lawyers failed to interview potential witnesses
like Ballinger. The jury did not know that prosecutors had
recommended parole for DellFava And there were weaknesses in
LaPierre's testimony, including his acknowledgment that he did not
see the stabbing or the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rona said, Wong did not have a translator who could
speak his native Fuzhou dialect. Jo-An Ting, a secretary who had
never worked as a translator before, spoke Mandarin _ a dialect
that Wong could barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous to do the job; I was not a professional,'' Mrs.
Ting said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Chinese who have recently immigrated to the
United States have shunned Wong, wary, perhaps, of associating with
an illegal immigrant convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wong's closest blood relative here _ a niece who lives in
Binghamton _ has visited him in prison only once.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, committee members have had to overcome language
problems, since Wong's English is uneven and few committee members
can speak Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not prevented supporters and Wong from developing
siblinglike bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Joannie C. Chang, one of several students-turned-lawyers, has
mailed care packages to Wong stocked with Chinese goods like wheat
gluten and grass jelly.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she drove seven or eight hours from Manhattan
to remote Clinton County, in northern New York about 10 miles from
the Canadian border, in an attempt to persuade Mrs. Ting to
acknowledge formally that she had botched the translation.
</P>
<P>
   And while she now lives in San Francisco, Ms. Chang still
corresponds with Wong. Once, after she excitedly mentioned her
participation in an approaching fund-raiser for AIDS patients, Wong
mailed her a small donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so touched by that,'' said Ms. Chang, 30. ``It makes you
admire him even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Ho and Ricky Sin personalized their connection in another
way, visiting Wong's family during a trip to Hong Kong in 1996. His
mother, they said, had been despondent about her only son, but came
alive when she discovered that others cared about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely emotional for everyone; our eyes were really
watery,'' said Ms. Ho, 31, a social worker who now lives in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Should Wong's appeal prevail, he would be deported to Hong Kong
or China. Should it fail, he would be eligible for parole on Jan.
15, 2017.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not circling that date just yet. Instead, he is
looking forward to April 10, when as many as 20 committee members
plan to make the six-hour drive to Auburn to help celebrate his
36th birthday.

JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN IN POLICE BEATING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a year and a half after a Haitian immigrant
named Abner Louima was reportedly brutalized by police officers in
Brooklyn, jury selection is to begin Monday for the trial of four
officers charged with attacking him and of a sergeant accused of
joining them in an attempted cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 600 prospective jurors are to arrive in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn to begin the jury-selection process in the
racially and politically charged case, even as the city's attention
is focused on a similarly explosive case involving a more recent
encounter between a black man and white police officers: the
killing in the Bronx last month of an unarmed West African
immigrant, Amadou Diallo, by four officers who fired 41 bullets at
him. Those four officers were reportedly indicted Thursday on
second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Diallo case, Louima's confrontation with the police
in August 1997 _ in which prosecutors say he was tortured in a
bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush after being
beaten in a police car _ led to mass public protests and charges
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration had set a tone that
fostered police brutality and abuse against members of minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was swift in terming the accusations in the Louima case
``shocking to any decent human being'' and in declaring that if
they were proved, the officers involved should receive
``substantial terms of imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   A final flurry of pretrial papers filed in the Louima case last
week shows that the evidence is expected to include clashing
testimony by medical experts over how Louima received the most
severe of the injuries he suffered on the morning of Aug. 9, 1997,
when he was arrested in a brawl outside a Haitian nightclub on
Flatbush Avenue. Louima's injuries included a perforated rectum and
a damaged bladder that kept him hospitalized for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the injuries were inflicted when one of the four
70th Precinct officers who arrested Louima, Justin Volpe, rammed a
stick into his rectum and then his mouth while he was handcuffed in
a bathroom in the station house. Another of the officers, Charles
Schwarz, held him down, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two officers have denied that their clients
committed these acts, though the lawyers have not said in their
court arguments how Louima, who is 32, married and the father of
two young children, might have suffered his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of the papers filed last week, a prosecutor suggested
that he anticipated that Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, might
argue at the trial that Louima received his injuries in an act of
sodomy before his encounter with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, chief of the criminal division in
the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, said in a letter to defense
lawyers and to the trial judge, Eugene Nickerson, that he intended
to call a medical expert who ``will testify that, in his opinion,
the injuries to Abner Louima's rectum and bladder were caused by a
blunt object being forcefully inserted into his rectum while he was
either in a prone or bent-over position.''
</P>
<P>
   The expert ``will further testify that the injuries were not
caused by a penis,'' Vinegrad said, and that they did occur ``at a
time consistent with the government's theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own papers last week, Kornberg said he would call three
medical experts who were expected to testify that the internal
injuries ``are inconsistent with forcible insertion of a blunt
object in his rectum.'' The papers do not say whether the experts
will state how they think Louima was hurt, or what Kornberg may
offer as a possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined to provide this information to a reporter,
saying ``I will not comment on what I will argue,'' or on any other
aspect of the trial. Vinegrad similarly said he would not discuss
the trial. ``We intend to present our evidence in the courtroom and
not before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he announced the indictment of Volpe and the other
officers 13 months ago, Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn, said that Louima's injuries had resulted from an assault
of ``singular depravity'' by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a civil suit that Louima's lawyers filed for him
against the officers, the city and other parties, the lawyers
termed Louima a victim of ``one of the most shameful, vicious and
cruel acts of police brutality in the history of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Volpe, 26, and Schwarz, 33, Officers Thomas
Bruder, 32, and Thomas Wiese, 35, are to be tried. They are not
accused of torturing Louima with the stick, but of joining Volpe
and Schwarz in beating him in a police car before they arrived at
the station. The sergeant to be tried, Michael Bellomo, 37, is not
charged in either assault but with trying to cover up the alleged
beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is also charged with beating a second Haitian immigrant,
Patrick Antoine, near the nightclub, and the sergeant is accused of
joining Volpe in arresting Antoine on false charges.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants say the charges against them are untrue.
Their lawyers have rejected any implications that the officers
harbor racist attitudes, pointing out that Volpe's girlfriend and
Wiese's fiancee are black.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz could face sentences of up to life in prison
if convicted of the charge of violating Louima's civil rights by
sexually assaulting him with a stick, and Bruder, Wiese and Bellomo
could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of the charges
against them. The officers and sergeant have been suspended with
pay and are free on $100,000 bonds pending the outcome of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the medical testimony, prosecution evidence is
expected to include Louima's testimony and testimony by Officer
Eric Turetzky, who reportedly told investigators he saw Louima with
his pants around his ankles being taken by Volpe away from the
bathroom area to the cell area of the station house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg has indicated that he will challenge Turetzky's
account, and will seek to call Louima's credibility into question
by highlighting such matters as his retraction of a statement that
the officers who attacked him said, ``This is Giuliani time, not
Dinkins time'' (a reference to David Dinkins, who preceded Giuliani
as mayor).
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is expected to take about three weeks, involving
a questionnaire of more than 40 pages and courtroom interviews that
will seek to determine things like the potential jurors' knowledge
and opinions of the Louima case and their views about police
treatment of minority-group members generally.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective jurors in federal court in Brooklyn are not drawn
only from that borough, but also come from Queens, Staten Island
and Long Island. As a result, the pool of prospective jurors at the
courthouse generally has fewer blacks than the pool of potential
jurors in state and local courts in Brooklyn, which are drawn only
from that borough.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Heinemann, the federal court's clerk, declined to make
public figures that he said had been gathered several years ago for
``internal use'' involving the racial makeup of jurors at the his
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers sought to have the trial moved out of New
York City, or at least postponed, on the ground that the intensive
news coverage of the Diallo and Louima cases had so inflamed public
sentiment that impartial jurors would be impossible to find.
Nickerson rejected the request, though he said he would reconsider
if the selection process bore out the lawyers' claim.

 McCALL SEES CONCILIATORY TONE IN MEETING WITH GIULIANI  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the state's
highest-ranking black elected leader, met privately with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani at Gracie Mansion for more than an hour Saturday
and came away with the impression that the mayor had begun to
regret his longstanding lack of dialogues with minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute meeting over bagels, lox and fruit was the first
between McCall and the mayor since Nov. 30, 1994, a drought that
reflected tensions between the Republican mayor and the Democratic
comptroller, and Giuliani's general absence of rapport with black
and Hispanic elected and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who in recent days has softened his caustic tone and
begun a series of meetings with minority leaders in response to
mounting criticism of his administration's aggressive police
policies and to protests in the Amadou Diallo case, did not comment
immediately on his meeting with McCall, one of more than 1,000
people voluntarily arrested in the protests.
</P>
<P>
   But the comptroller, while declining to go into detail about
what they had discussed or whether they had agreed upon anything,
called the meeting cordial, frank and wide-ranging. He said the
mayor had apparently learned much from his recent talks with
minority leaders and seemed to regret not having held such talks
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has found them to be very, very useful and productive,''
McCall said. ``He has indicated that he really did make a mistake
in terms of not having that kind of dialogue earlier. He's learned
a lot from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller suggested that he, too, regretted the long
silence between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' he said, ``I haven't had the opportunity to
meet with the mayor for four and a half years. We had a very frank
discussion about a wide-ranging set of issues, from the present
crisis with the Police Department to education to welfare reform.
They are the kinds of things that I had wished the mayor and I had
been conferring on and having dialogue over the last number of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about whether they had discussed current issues in the
city _ strained relationships between the police and minority
groups and the indictment of four Street Crime Unit officers in the
killing of Diallo _ McCall said he and the mayor did not discuss
the Diallo case specifically, and agreed only to continue their
talks, though no date for further discussions was set.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting itself, rather than what was said, was significant,
he suggested. ``It was important to establish a working
relationship with the chief executive of the city,'' McCall said.
``I've been trying to do that for a long time. The priority for me
was to see that the mayor was interested in having this kind of
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani met with 10 members of the City Council's Black and
Latino Caucus at Gracie Mansion on Friday night, and afterward,
sounding almost contrite, called it the ``beginning of an important
dialogue.'' He added: ``I wish we'd had this meeting earlier. It
might be I made a mistake in not being more open to meetings like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no protest outside Police Headquarters on Saturday _
they have been held only on weekdays since March 9 _ but more than
200 supporters and allies of the Rev. Al Sharpton rallied at his
National Action Network headquarters on 125th Street and vowed to
continue their campaign of civil disobedience for what they call
justice in the Diallo case and reforms in the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced major
changes in the Street Crime Unit _ adding 50 minority members to
the overwhelmingly white unit and putting its plainclothes members
into uniform _ Sharpton said the moves were not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Safir to know that we're not talking about costume
changes,'' Sharpton told a cheering crowd. ``We want to deal with
the function and not the uniform. We don't want to be beaten by
blacks and Latinos. We want the beating to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also expressed skepticism about Giuliani's willingness
to meet with minority leaders, calling it a ploy to divide them and
dilute their fight against police brutality. He insisted that
alliances that had been built in the protest campaign would be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Others attending the meeting included Manhattan Borough
President C. Virginia Fields; Rep. Jose Serrano, a Democrat-Liberal
of the Bronx, and Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields, who met Giuliani on Wednesday for the first time in
15 months, said that the coalition of black and Hispanic leaders
and their allies in civil liberties, labor and religious groups
would remain united in their approach to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going through that door with the same message,'' she
said, ``and the message is: we must use our influence wherever we
sit, because we need change in this city and this country.''

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT PENSION FUND AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Mo., Mass., Md.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, Congress created the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. to make sure that the 42 million workers with
traditional pensions would get paid even if their employer went
bankrupt. The legislation was hailed at the time as second only to
Social Security in its significance to working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   How well that agency operates is now being questioned in a
series of audits by the agency's inspector general, which are to be
made public this week, and by a lawsuit charging that one of the
pension agency's contractors defrauded it.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican senators who are familiar with the audit
findings, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Christopher Bond of
Missouri, said hearings would be held by September to investigate
how well the agency is run and why, for example, nearly half of the
472,000 people covered by failed pension plans that the agency has
taken over have not been told how much they are due each month.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200,000 people waiting for their initial determination of
actual benefits, about 19,000 have been waiting for more than 13
years and some have been waiting for 18 years. When these people
become eligible to receive pension checks, an estimated payment is
sent until the actual amount is determined.
</P>
<P>
   The audits, the lawsuits and the hearings come as congressional
Republicans are gearing up for a battle to pass major changes in
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act that have long been
sought by major corporations and business owners. The Republicans
say picayune regulations and poor operation of the pension agency
are driving up pension-plan costs and hurting workers who change
jobs often.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for pensioners say the Republican proposals would
allow business owners and executives to get bigger tax breaks on
larger pensions for themselves, while reducing incentives to pay
retirement benefits to workers who receive lower pay.
</P>
<P>
   The audits found that ``there were no monitoring controls in
place that would enable'' the pension agency ``to detect potential
unauthorized data modifications'' like creating ghost retirees in
its computers and sending them money.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Grant, the pension agency's deputy director, did not
dispute most of the audit findings, but he said they drew too
heavily on conditions that the Clinton administration inherited in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that the pension agency, which received five awards
from Vice President Al Gore for improving efficiency and customer
service, had reduced the backlog of people waiting to hear how much
they are due to 200,000 from 300,000 and would eliminate it in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said there was no harm from delays in determining
benefits, because when the exact amounts are determined, lump-sum
payments with interest are sent to cover shortfalls, and pensioners
can take months to return overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, the chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, said he
disagreed. ``I think they have forgotten what their mission is,
which is to serve pensioners,'' Grassley said. ``Six to 10 years is
just too long for people to wait to find out how much their pension
will be. We have to make this agency become more customer friendly,
like we did with the IRS.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One employee of the agency, who calls himself Jim Dough, in
order to avoid any retribution, has filed a lawsuit on behalf of
the agency against one of its biggest contractors, Office
Specialists of Peabody, Mass. He was joined by two former Office
Specialists employees and by the Association of Former Pan Am
Employees. Two years ago, the association filed a separate lawsuit
accusing the pension agency of mishandling benefits for its 45,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Dough lawsuit, unsealed on March 18 by a U.S. District Court
judge in Baltimore, says that a senior pension agency official,
Bennie Hagans, steered business to Office Specialists, which
received a number of contracts without competitive bidding, and
ordered payments to it expedited.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also asserts that Hagans improperly intervened when
Myrna Cooks, the Office Specialists liaison to the pension agency,
quit to form her own company and was sued by Office Specialists for
violating her employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans, the lawsuit asserts, ``threatened Office Specialists''
with a loss of business from the pension agency unless it dropped
its suit against Mrs. Cooks and let her assume an Office
Specialists contract valued at $13.5 million. Office Specialists
then settled with Mrs. Cooks, whose business was awarded the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans, in two lengthy interviews, said that he had acted
properly in every dealing and that his routine actions were being
twisted by the plaintiffs, who he said had based their case on
faulty assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Schaudies, general counsel for Randstad North America, a
subsidiary of the Dutch company that owns Office Specialists, said,
``We have no basis for believing there was anything improper'' in
its dealing with the pension agency.

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON or TUZLA, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ As
more reports of heavy fighting and Serb atrocities in Kosovo
emerged Saturday, tensions continued to mount along Yugoslavia's
borders with Bosnia and other countries. NATO carried its offensive
in Yugoslavia closer to Belgrade in the heaviest of three nights of
attacks, as state-run media showed pictures of explosions and fires
in Belgrade suburbs caused by ``NATO criminals'' and claimed
civilians were killed and injured. And in an escalation of the
conflict, Yugoslav helicopters crossed into Bosnia, setting off air
raid sirens and sending people scurrying at Eagle Base, a major
U.S. military compound. (Shepard-Holmes, Cox News Service) ETA by 8

   RUSSIA-ARMY _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ He is 21, alone and
scared. Ivan (not his real name) has been on the run from the army
for three years. During his short few weeks in the army, he was
ill-fed and beaten, his rations and uniform stolen by officers
looking to sell them. The nation's economic crisis has reduced
soldiers to foraging for potatoes in the fields and begging for
change in subway stations. Since the economic squeeze last August,
the number of deserters and draft dodgers has doubled, according to
advocacy groups who work with disaffected soldiers. The only way to
strengthen Russia's army is to reduce its size, many officials
contend. In coming months, severe cutbacks are planned in military
spending and manpower controversial military reforms. It's an
uneasy task ahead: soothing the generals outraged by the plan,
holding off political rivals attempting to capitalize on the
dissatisfaction and convincing the public that their
morale-battered army can be improved by cutting it back. (Holmes,

AMERICAN LEAVES YUGOSLAVIA AFTER HELPING WITH SURGERIES

   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ It's a quiet night here in Zagreb. The
Croatian people are delighted that America is bombing Serbia:
``They're finally getting a taste of what they dealt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing is an e-mail Overland Park anesthesiologist Robert
Reid sent his wife Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To Annette Reid, the message is assurance that her husband had
escaped a war zone and made it to safe territory.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reid is part of an American medical team who escaped into
Croatia after being trapped in Belgrade when NATO began bombing
Serbia. Reid was helping with children's heart operations in a
Serbian hospital.
</P>
<P>
   NATO hopes the American-led air strikes will stop the slaughter
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was expected to return to Kansas City this weekend,
provided that a German airline will fly its routes in Croatian
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   At home with their two young children, Reid's wife has been
glued to CNN broadcasts, worried for her husband's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the people trashing the embassies and you just wonder,
what would they do with a couple of Americans if they found them?''
Annette Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mails, Reid said he wasn't concerned about the bombing
while he was working in a Belgrade hospital as part of the Memphis,
Tenn.-based International Children's Heart Foundation. But he was
alarmed at the ``rapidly escalating'' hatred of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbians blame the United States for the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail continues: Women were screaming at me, ``How can you
kill children?'' They have no idea what their own troops have been
doing to the Kosovo people.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent Thursday to his wife, Reid said all outside
news had been blocked and the Serbian people were only hearing
``gross propaganda.'' He said they were being told no military
sites were being hit by the air strikes, but 10 civilian sites had
been targets. Also, the news said the United States planned to bomb
elementary schools next.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and the rest of the medical team fled Belgrade with the
help of both Serbian and Croatian people.
</P>
<P>
   A Platte County nurse who was part of the same team arrived home
late Thursday night. Marilyn Maddox left Belgrade by bus before the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   The medical team has an ongoing relationship with the Mother and
Child Health Care Institute, the Belgrade hospital. Reid had worked
there before.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation works in Croatia and Serbia, as well as many
other countries. The eight-person team came to Belgrade after being
invited by the Ministry of Health, said Lisa Estes, executive
director of the Children's Foundation in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, the Minister of Internal Affairs in Belgrade
arranged for a car to take the medical team to the Serbian-Croatian
border. A Serbian doctor from the hospital also accompanied the
group in another car, Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian doctors that the foundation works with met the team at
the border, Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were deeply concerned,'' Estes said. ``Our communication
with them was sporadic because it was very hard to get through on
telephone lines.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reid, this was not the first time he has fled a country he
was giving medical help to through the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Palestinian officials drove him from that country
when a conflict broke out with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At home with their children, 6-year-old Ellen and 4-year-old
Eric, Annette Reid said she was only a little surprised her husband
decided to stay in the country after the bombings began.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get as much done as they could because those
people wait and wait for months to get the operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the heart operations, considered routine in America, the
children will die, said Maddox, who fled Belgrade on Tuesday.
Maddox and a New York doctor decided to leave when peace
negotiations broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox and the doctor got the last two seats on a double-decker
bus that took them to an airport in a neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
   The trip normally takes about five hours, but theirs took 10,
including four hours spent stopped at the border. Their passports
were temporarily confiscated and Maddox's luggage was searched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk much on the bus,'' Maddox said. ``We didn't
want to draw any attention to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said the team hoped to perform at least 18 surgeries. But
it was behind because the cases were more complicated than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, she was particularly concerned about one infant.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was on the operating table when air raid sirens blew
and the hospital's electricity went out, possibly as part of a
blackout so it would not be hit by bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was on a bypass machine, meaning its blood had been
drained from the heart so repairs could be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they had a backup generator or some sort of
battery,'' she said. ``I guess that baby might have died.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail sent to his wife Wednesday, Reid said the
infant was doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   Reid wrote: Our 14-day-old Jatene Switch was doing well. I'm
quite happy about that case.

 Woman wins lawsuit against Kansas  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Caryn McCue Woltkamp has won her fight
against those she calls the ``good ol' boys'' at the Kansas
Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The department paid $510,000 this month to Woltkamp, who claimed
in a federal lawsuit that high-ranking officials conspired against
her and eventually fired her after she accused her immediate boss
of sexual harassment. She said he repeatedly asked her for sex,
groped her in the office and pleaded to take nude pictures of her.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Human Resources Department's duty is to protect
state employees from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Woltkamp, 37, prevailed in a 1996 jury trial in U.S. District
Court, and the verdict was later upheld on appeal. Attorneys
representing the department recently decided against asking the
U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.
</P>
<P>
   The jury originally awarded Woltkamp $300,000. Legal fees and
interest pushed the amount to $510,000.
</P>
<P>
   The court judgment ends a six-year struggle that took Woltkamp _
a single mother at the beginning _ from investigating unemployment
claims in Topeka, Kan., to waiting tables in Peculiar, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I did it, but I'm glad it's finally over,'' Woltkamp
said. ``They took a part of me that I don't think I'll ever get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas attorney general's office said Thursday that the
state disagreed with the original verdict and still maintains its
innocence. The judgment was paid because the state had run out of
legal options, said Assistant Attorney General John Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts tend to defer to juries' decisions,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ybarra, the boss Woltkamp accused of sexual harassment,
is still employed at the Human Resources Department. A department
spokeswoman said he was working in a supervisory role and earning
$49,774.
</P>
<P>
   Ybarra answered his telephone at the department Thursday but
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Monsees, Woltkamp's attorney, said, ``This is a man who
cost the taxpayers of Kansas well over a half-million dollars, and
he still has his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsees said his office worked about 1,500 hours on the case and
he presumed the state's attorneys billed a similar number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at $100 an hour, that's another $150,000 in legal fees he
cost the state of Kansas,'' Monsees said.
</P>
<P>
   Woltkamp _ McCue at the time _ took an entry-level job at the
Human Resources Department in 1979 shortly after graduating from
high school. Supervisors praised her work as she climbed the
bureaucratic ladder to the post of special investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Ybarra became her boss in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Woltkamp said in her lawsuit that the sexual harassment began
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, a precursory step to a federal lawsuit. In
January 1993, the EEOC gave Woltkamp permission to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials soon began to lobby her not to file,
Woltkamp later claimed in court. They told her that her job status
would be looked upon more favorably if she let the matter drop.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed. But after the 90-day filing deadline passed, she was
fired. The termination letter told Woltkamp that she was fired for
``deficiencies in work performance.''
</P>
<P>
   She found herself unemployed with a 15-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Her unlawful-termination lawsuit alleged her firing was
retaliation for filing the sexual harassment complaint. Defendants
included the department, Ybarra and three other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant William Medlock, a senior manager in the department,
testified that A.J. Kotich, the department's chief legal counsel,
told him to stop investigating Woltkamp's complaint because it was
being taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Kotich was Ybarra's brother-in-law. He still holds the legal
counsel position.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the litigation, Monsees said the defendants ``tried to
protect one of their own at the expense of a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Two defendants were fired in unrelated sexual harassment cases
before Woltkamp's lawsuit went to trial. Medlock was fired in
November 1995. Hobart Hayes, an Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission officer, was fired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Woltkamp has since married and lives in Raymore, Mo. She
recently quit her job waiting tables at a Peculiar diner.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter is 18 now, a senior at Raymore-Peculiar High
School. Woltkamp's work difficulties and subsequent legal struggle
have lasted half the teen-ager's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep most of it from her, but it's changed both of
us,'' Woltkamp said. ``I'm not as trusting as I used to be. And she
will probably never be as trusting as I was before this all
started.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wants to begin a career but is unsure what field it
would be in.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be politics or government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when that's what I wanted my future to be,''
she said. ``Now, I'm just so glad to be away from all that.''

HALLMARK CARDS THIS WEEKEND BEGINS ITS BIGGEST PRODUCT ROLLOUT
EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. this weekend begins its
biggest product rollout ever by giving away 24 million cards from
its new low-priced Warm Wishes line.
</P>
<P>
   To back the giveaway blitz, Hallmark is spending $50 million to
tell the story of Warm Wishes, a line of 1,040 cards selling for 99
cents, designed for more casual relationships such as neighbors,
co-workers and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hallmark will give away 36 million Warm Wishes cards
in the rollout, which will run through August. The line will be
sold at 20,000 retailers that sell Hallmark products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers told us they wanted to be able to use cards for more
occasions but at a lower cost,'' said Hallmark spokeswoman Linda
Odell.
</P>
<P>
   Odell said she didn't know how much revenue Hallmark hoped to
generate from the new card line.
</P>
<P>
   But Hallmark conducted a seven-month test in Las Vegas beginning
late last year. It found that greeting card sales overall increased
12 percent during the test and that ``Hallmark claimed a
significant portion of this category sales growth,'' according to
information from the company.
</P>
<P>
   E. Gray Glass III, an analyst who follows Hallmark, said the
company was unveiling the new line to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see a niche market,'' Glass said. ``Or it may be that
they're responding to something already in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass said his sense is that Hallmark is performing well
relative to the competition. For instance, Hallmark says its 1998
sales were $3.9 billion, up 5 percent from 1997. American
Greetings, on the other hand, had a sales increase of 0.3 percent
for 1998.

BUSINESSES CASH IN ON WORRY WITH YEAR 2000 NOVELTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Several area businesses have found a whole
new way to fight the year 2000 bug. They're embracing it, and
making money in the clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the strange case of Stan Chrzanowski, local ad guy
turned entrepreneur. Late last year, Chrzanowski said enough was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around me, friends, everyone, had been talking about
Y2K to the degree that it got crazy,'' he said. ``People were
really talking about buying guns and stockpiling food and bottled
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrzanowski's response? A spoof package ``that covers every
aspect of everyone's fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The locally produced Y2K Survival Kit includes a small divining
rod to ferret out water when the supply lines are cut. (Note: It
doesn't work. We tried.)
</P>
<P>
   And a compass to find ``your way to the nearest wilderness.
Start your version of a new human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the kit, a mini-squirt gun to ``ward off those critters
that will want to confiscate your supply of bonbons, Twinkies or
paper clips,'' and a bag of sunflower seeds to either plant a crop
or to throw on the floor to annoy your cubicle mates at work.
</P>
<P>
   With a $14.95 price tag, the oddball product has the makings of
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Chrzanowski, president and creative director of West Creative in
Kansas City, said the company sold more than 2,000 of the kits in
five weeks _ selling out of its first production run. The kit is
assembled by workers at a vocational center in Liberty, Mo. Area
Boy Scout troops are making the twig-sized divining rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing this product is half the battle _ and fun,''
Chrzanowski said. ``We just received an order for 500 from a
company on the West Coast. They're using it as a giveaway to their
clients _ a humorous relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The kit is available at gift stores, Borders and other local
shops, or on the Net at www.y2ksurvivalkit.net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies take a year or two years to get started, but
this had to happen fast,'' Chrzanowski said. ``We had a time
deadline. Come January 1, I don't think we'll sell any. Unless I
come up with a `we survived Y2K kit.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Kansas City, they're up to their ears in chocolate
Easter bunnies now, but after Mother's Day, business slows down at
Annedore's Fine Chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   So owner Nancy Hatch and her employees have hatched a plan to
bolster business and boost the spirits of stressed Y2K programmers.
Annedore's will create a foil-lined box with peanut butter bugs
crawling on chocolate Y's, 2s and K's. They'll be ready after
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is an issue that's a great mystery to many,'' Hatch said.
``And the more we speak out (about Y2K), the more calmness will
come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing _ save for a dozen long-stemmed roses, we have learned
from experience _ soothes anxiety better than chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Up until this point, we've been bugged by a bug we've never
seen. Now, a Lawrence company is promoting a mischievous-looking
spider that is trademarked as the official Y2K Bug.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 inches tall, the royal blue and black creature is a pudgy,
six-legged Beanie Baby-like novelty gift being marketed as a
computer good-luck charm. It's manufactured by Image Makers of
Calabasas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the insipid little creature that has the nation in its
grip,'' said Todd Brabender with Spread the News public relations
of Lawrence, Kan. The creature sells for $7.95 at stores such as
Hallmark, Sears, Osco and Walgreens.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a growing crowd of Y2K novelties, this creature has
something going for it others don't. A percentage of each sale will
go to a Youth 2 Knowledge (Y2K) Computer Fund to help young people
learn about computers.
</P>
<P>
   Checks of $1,000 to $3,000 will be written to a number of
national charities, Brabender said. If your group is deserving,
contact Brabender at (785) 842-8909, or write him at 2620 Cranley
St., Lawrence, KS 66046.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence is surfacing in the Kansas City area that
marketing departments have gotten the memo: Y2K is a nifty way to
bolster market share.
</P>
<P>
   At Barnes and Noble, a table bears the sign: ``The Year of
Living Dangerously...Be prepared for the Year 2000. Find out what
you can do to protect your money, your home, your job and your well
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered about the table are a couple of dozen Y2K books _ from
Y2K for Dummies to shock-Y2K writer Michael Hyatt's Y2K, the Day
the World Shut Down.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite? It's a tossup between Pooh and the Millennium, and
Millenniumopoly, which replaces the traditional Baltic Avenue with
the Plague, and Park Place with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At a SuperTarget store, you can buy a 13-inch Panasonic TV//VCR
combo that, as the box says, is ``Year 2000 ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's the kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics giant Sanyo had posted bright yellow ``This product
is Y2K compliant'' signs on its Web site to alert customers that
its plastic cutting board, with no moving parts, and a bread warmer
are ready for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The claim, which since has been yanked from the Web site,
sparked a round of laughter at the company's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we don't think a product designed `for easy cutting of
fresh bread, bagels, fruits, vegetables, meats, etc., into straight
slices' is going to give up the ghost come New Year's Eve,'' wrote
Declan McCullagh at www.y2kculture.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and Jay Leno chimed
in with funny jabs. In the end, ``the humor of the situation was
not lost on us,'' a company spokesman said. ``It may seem that our
efforts were a bit overzealous.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for cutting-edge technology.

TAXPAYERS OWE SEN. KIT BOND A DEBT OF THANKS FOR BATTLE WITH IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri has been fighting a mostly
thankless but important battle with the Internal Revenue Service
and deserves a good deal more credit than he's getting for his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially so in light of the fact that he seems to have
won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   It began after Bond learned the IRS was implementing a provision
of last year's IRS reform legislation in a manner Bond claimed was
contrary to the law's intent to protect taxpayers. As Senate Small
Business Committee chairman, Bond had been getting inquiries from
constituents concerned about IRS notices informing them that
third-party contacts might be necessary as part of an audit.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbed Bond was that a law meant to help taxpayers was
apparently being used to intimidate them. The provision in question
had been designed to ensure taxpayers full opportunity to
accommodate the IRS before examiners began contacting third
parties. Moreover, if third-party contacts did become necessary,
the law was supposed to give taxpayers a chance to minimize the
potential damage to their reputation these contacts might cause.
</P>
<P>
   As Bond noted in a letter to the IRS commissioner, third-party
contacts are especially hazardous to small-business operators
because they can ``chill relationships'' with suppliers, employees
and customers fearful of becoming involved themselves as part of
the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the law was not being used as intended. Its intent, he
said, was to notify taxpayers of IRS third-party contact plans
``only in those exceptional cases in which the IRS cannot first
obtain all the necessary information directly from the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, and only then,'' Bond wrote, ``the notice is to provide
sufficient information about whom the IRS needs to contact for the
taxpayer to mitigate the damage to personal and business
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the IRS violated the spirit of the law by sending out
blanket notices of its plan for third-party contacts as an
intimidating first resort rather than a last resort to prepare
taxpayers for this disagreeable eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   After Bond's initial complaint, the IRS further irked the
senator by not going as far as Bond thought was needed to fix the
problem. He then followed up with another sharply worded letter to
the IRS commissioner demanding full relief.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the process, Bond's office kept sending out news
releases trying to draw media attention to his crusade, but the
media mostly yawned. Bond persevered, though, and the IRS this week
announced plans to stop warning all those chosen for an audit that
third parties might be contacted as part of their examination.
</P>
<P>
   Bond became a footnote in this effort to protect taxpayers but
deserves much more credit than he's gotten. To be sure, those
audited by the IRS are a minuscule part of the citizenry, so it's
not a policy matter that affects the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's willingness to stand up for taxpayers, however, has
meaning far beyond those being audited. By taking his watchdog
obligation seriously, Bond reminded powerful regulators in all
agencies that at least one person on Capitol Hill is willing to
take on even small fights for big causes on behalf of average
Americans.

 &HT;    Like father, like son in the White House
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He was born in New England to a dad who became
president and a mom with a penchant for speaking her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he picked up an Ivy League degree, passable
fluency in a second language and a stint as an adviser in his dad's
presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
   His father survived eight years as vice president and was
elected president but got the ballot-box boot after one term.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Gov. George W. Bush _ with whom he shares all of the
above _ John Quincy Adams went after his dad's old job. He got it,
and, history tells us, he blew it.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither Adams ranks near the top among U.S. presidents,
they remain in the books as the only father-and-son chief
executives in U.S. history, a record the Bushes would tie if George
W. wins in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It would not take much to outshine John Quincy Adams, who,
according to Grolier Encyclopedia, ``was not one of the greatest
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams historian Paul C. Nagle offers a simpler assessment of how
Congress dealt with President John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bludgeoned him,'' said Nagle, formerly of the University
of Kentucky and University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But John Quincy Adams (the sixth president and the son of John
Adams, who was the second president) became a revered ex-president.
During a post-congressional career that began two years after he
left the presidency 1829 and continued until his death in 1848,
Adams became a leading anti-slavery voice.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaced in the public psyche two years ago when, portrayed
by Anthony Hopkins, Adams was given silver-screen hero treatment in
the movie ``Amistad'' for his defense of Africans who rebelled
aboard a Spanish slave ship.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-slavery fervor sparked him to lead a long, eventually
unsuccessful effort to keep Texas, a slave state, out of the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, no, I haven't read anything about him,'' the
current governor of Texas said when asked whether he knows much
about the man whose feat he may match. Bush said that about the
only thing he knows is that Adams waged a long battle against
making Texas a state.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former President Bush, the son of a Connecticut senator,
the elder John Adams was not born to power and privilege. He was a
Massachusetts farmer caught up in revolutionary fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he always seemed to feel sort of inferior to the
wealthier, the merchant class of Boston,'' said Nagle, whose most
recent Adams book was a 1997 biography of John Quincy Adams.
``They, in turn, sort of looked down on this rotund gentleman who
was prone to lose his temper, as were all the Adamses.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Adams played politics well enough to rise to the top
with a win in the presidential race of 1796 over runner-up Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Abigail Adams, was an outspoken woman, like Barbara
Bush, ``sort of a cult figure,'' Nagle said. In 1776, while her
husband was working on independence for the colonies, Abigail Adams
offered this gender-specific nudge: ``In the new code of laws which
I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would
remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than
your ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the
husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they could. If
particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are
determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound
by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.''
</P>
<P>
   History does not record Adams' response. The nation responded by
not allowing women to vote until 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Like the elder Bush, the elder Adams decided he wanted to be
president. Also like Bush, he failed in his first effort and
settled for two terms as vice president. Under the original
constitution, that was his consolation prize for finishing second
to George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly, Adams was very unimpressed with the job. As the
No. 2 man to Washington, he set an enduring tone for what it would
mean to be the No. 2 man in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most
insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or
his imagination conceived,'' Adams complained to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1796, he became the first incumbent vice president elected to
the presidency. The most recent to accomplish that rare promotion
was the elder Bush, who in 1988 became the first to do it since
Martin Van Buren in 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Like the elder Bush, the elder Adams was dumped after one term,
losing to nemesis Jefferson, who was his vice president despite
being a political foe.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Jefferson were linked in life and death.
</P>
<P>
   On his deathbed, Adams' last words were ``Thomas Jefferson
survives.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. A few hours earlier, Jefferson had died at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the enduring coincidences of American history, the two
men who helped give birth to the nation died on the same day, July
4, 1826, exactly 50 years after they signed the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   But John Adams lived long enough to achieve revenge on Jefferson
and the bluer bloods of American politics. According to Nagle, by
the time Adams lost to Jefferson in 1800, a family plot had already
been hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and John Quincy Adams both felt that somehow the good name
of Adams had to be polished up, that there had to be some kind of
vengeance against the New England crowd that didn't support
Adams,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was political vengeance,'' he said. ``Plus the fact that
both sides of the family had to struggle against alcoholism. They
wanted to see some member of the family succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who said he stopped drinking alcohol at age 40 because it
was getting in the way, had nothing on the Adamses. Two of John
Quincy Adams' brothers, as well as two of his sons, died of
alcoholism, according to Nagle.
</P>
<P>
   And like Bush, who claims he grew up wanting to be baseball
great Willie Mays, John Quincy Adams did not grow up wanting to be
president. The job didn't exist until he was 22.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not born into wealth and position, John Quincy
Adams did benefit from a family that saw public service as a worthy
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a father that was in a position to become president
gave him opportunities that no other young man, or very few young
men, in the new republic had,'' said Celeste Walker, associate
editor for the Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical
Society, who has spent 25 years reviewing the 250,000 pages of
letters, diaries and public papers left by three generations of the
Adams family.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said the evidence is ``overpowering'' that he was raised
to lead the new nation.
</P>
<P>
   At age 24, Adams got these not-so-subtle words of encouragement
from dad. ``If you do not rise to the head, not only of your
profession but of your country, it will be owing to your own
laziness, slovenliness and obstinacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Nagle said, ``is pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   After a successful career as an overseas ambassador, where he
made good use of the fluency he developed in French, the younger
Adams was summoned home by his dad to begin preparing for an
eventual presidential race he did not covet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He disliked politics intensely,'' Nagle said. ``He wanted to
be a scientist. He wanted to be a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   The election of 1824 was the most inconclusive in American
history. Andrew Jackson had the most popular votes, but nobody
earned an Electoral College majority. The election went to the
House of Representatives, which, after Henry Clay threw his support
to Adams, made him president.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address, Adams told Americans he was ``less
possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my
predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, he never made up the confidence deficit. He got
nowhere with grandiose plans for interstate roads and a national
observatory. In 1828, like dad, he became a one-termer, losing to
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Adams began a successful career as a
Massachusetts congressman. Grolier's ``The American Presidency,''
noting Adams pre- and post-presidential successes, labels his
presidential years ``a strange interlude.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams died at his desk in the U.S. House on Feb. 23, 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last of earth. I am content,'' were his last
words.
</P>
<P>
   But he had failed on one score. After dedicating years to
keeping Texas out of the union because it would be another slave
state, his efforts failed on Feb. 19, 1846, when Texas President
Anson Jones turned control over to James Pinckney Henderson, the
first governor of the newest state.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred fifty-three years later, that state has produced the
candidate closest to being able to complete another father-and-son
presidential duo.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of studying the first family that did it,
historian Nagle is convinced the Adamses would approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'd see it as charming,'' he said. ``I know I do,
being the father of sons. Sons tend to want to do something
different than their father. Of our three boys, not one of them
wanted to pursue history. One of them decided to flunk history in
college.''

   Out of provisionals, Waltrip qualifies
</P>
<P>
   By Al Levine
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas _ Thunderstorms threaten today's running of
the Winston Cup Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway. But as far
as Darrell Waltrip is concerned, there isn't a black cloud in the
sky, only silver linings.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, ol' D.W. made the race. Without a provisional.
</P>
<P>
   After he flat-out qualified under extreme pressure and in such
dramatic fashion, Waltrip ran whooping and screaming through the
garage area, fists held high, nearly in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Facing elimination from the 43-car field with his race engine in
after the qualifying motor had blown earlier in the day, Waltrip
turned in a lap of 186.554 mph during requalifying. He'll start
32nd in today's race.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed his No. 66 Ford faster than he wanted. ``Scared myself
to death. Kind of liking jumping off the high dive; ain't never
done it before, hope I make. But I held my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once in his past 20 races has Waltrip started closer to the
front. Last year, he used champions' provisionals to make the field
in 20 of 33 races. He'd already used up his first allotment of
provisionals this season and was facing being shut out of a race
for the first time since November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he looked up and said ``Thank you, Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt our whole year was riding on this weekend,'' Waltrip
said. ``If we miss this show, we miss out on the points. And after
last week, (when) we had a real bad race, another bad finish or no
run at all here and we'd have been history. It's a breath of fresh
air and we needed it badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Darlington, NASCAR black-flagged him for driving
too slow. So Waltrip's qualifying run, though it's more than three
mph slower than pole-sitter Kenny Irwin's lap of 190.154, was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I felt that good since I won the Daytona
500,'' Waltrip said. ``It was a feeling of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested perhaps that the champions' provisionals may have
made him lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very prepared for (today) for a long time and quite
frankly I'm glad it came,'' Waltrip said. ``It's a test.
Everything's a test. As long as I had provisionals to fall back on
I don't think I ever stepped up to the plate. I don't think my team
ever stepped up to the plate. I don't think we ever realized that
we were taking that and abusing it because we could. When you got
to the track and you weren't that good, you said, `it doesn't
matter, we can get a provisional, anyway.' So we'd work on the car
and play along and about Sunday we'd be OK or decent.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying certainly lifted his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the garage probably got more faith in me than I've
got in myself right now,'' Waltrip said. ``I've been dragging
around, kind of having pity parties and feeling sorry for myself.
Last Sunday, I was embarrassed. So we came here on kind of a low
already.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not low anymore.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FATHER BEHIND RIPKEN'S STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When his father was in his early years as a manager in the
Baltimore Orioles farm system, Cal Ripken Jr. was too young to
wonder how baseball should be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``After school was out,'' he has often said, ``my mother would
pack up my sister and my two brothers and me and we'd go wherever
my father was managing that year.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to minor-league towns in South Dakota, Washington
state, Florida, upstate New York and Texas, and then in 1972, not
long before Cal Jr.'s 12th birthday, they drove to North Carolina
where Cal Sr., his cap perched on his already-gray crew cut, was
managing at Asheville. That's when Cal Jr. began to care about
baseball. And to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Before the games, Cal Jr. would take batting practice, shag
flies and take grounders. Not that his father the manager was
tutoring his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were little,'' Cal Sr. once said, ``I showed all
four of my kids how to catch a ground ball and how to catch a fly
ball. Other than that, I just let them play, like kids are supposed
to. I didn't talk hitting with Cal until his junior year in high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Asheville little Cal didn't want to just play baseball.
He wanted to think baseball.
</P>
<P>
   During the games, other kids went to the hot-dog stand or
wandered around the ball park to see what mischief they could get
into, but little Cal Jr. watched what those minor-league pitchers
were throwing as intently as if he were the next hitter. When the
game was over, he sat with his father the manager and asked
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you steal in the third inning?'' he might say. ``Why
did you take that pitcher out in the seventh?''
</P>
<P>
   His father the manager, who had been a career minor-league
catcher in the Orioles' farm system, would explain his reasoning
and his son would remember. For two more seasons, the Ripken kids
spent the summer in Asheville. More questions from little Cal, more
explanations from his father the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I was ready to play, I knew the proper way to do
things,'' Cal Jr. has said. ``Nobody had to tell me what the Oriole
cutoff play was.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only knew what was known in the Baltimore organization as
``the Oriole way,'' a training manual his father helped write, but
he also would develop into The Oriole, the future Hall of Fame
shortstop who would play in a record 2,632 consecutive games before
he finally decided to sit down last Sept. 20 at Camden Yards before
the Orioles' last home game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And when Cal Sr. died Thursday at 63, he deserved to be
remembered not only as the father behind Cal Jr. the ballplayer,
but also the father behind his son's streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bedtime stories,'' the Oriole shortstop has said, ``were
about foul tips splintering up my dad's fingers as a catcher,
taping them together, spitting a little tobacco juice on them and
saying to the umpire, `Let's play.' Hearing those stories, it was
like my dad would have had to break his back to stay out of the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   And one day when Cal. Jr. was 16, after a snowstorm blocked the
road around their Aberdeen, Md. home, his father rigged a plow to
an old tractor. But the battery was dead. When his father tried to
hand-crank the tractor, the engine backfired. The crank flew,
opening a deep gash in Cal Sr.'s forehead. Blood flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go to the hospital,'' young Cal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go on in the house,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Jr. remembered his father wiping off the blood with an oily
rag, going into the house to put two butterfly bandages on the
gash, then returning to start the tractor and plow the snow off the
road. And whenever Cal Jr. told that story, he had the same punch
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dad,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 his dad finally made the big leagues, as an Oriole
coach. After Earl Weaver resigned as manager after the 1982 season,
Cal Sr. hoped to succeed him. Joe Altobelli got the job instead,
but with Cal Jr. established at shortstop, Cal Sr. remained loyal
to the Orioles organization and remained as the third-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Weaver departed after a second term, Cal Sr. finally was
named the Oriole manager for the 1987 season. Until then, only
Connie Mack and Yogi Berra had managed a big-league team with one
son on it. But with young Billy Ripken now at second base alongside
his older brother, Cal Sr. was the first to manage two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that my dad was in the Oriole clubhouse with me,''
Cal Jr. once said, ``has helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   But what helped Cal Ripken Jr. just as much, if not more, were
all those questions and explanations after all those games in
Asheville. And all that snow that prompted his father to hand-crank
the tractor.  &QL;

CENTRAL FIGURES IN LONG-AWAITED COURTROOM BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With POLICE-BRUTALITY-TRIAL) 
(lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A veteran judge is to begin working with prosecutors
and defense lawyers on Monday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on
jury selection for the trial of four police officers from the 70th
Precinct charged with attacking Abner Louima and of a sergeant
accused of trying to cover up part of the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Judge
</P>
<P>
   EUGENE NICKERSON: On the federal bench since 1977, Nickerson,
80, served as Nassau County executive from 1962 to 1970, the first
Democrat elected to that post. Affable and courtly, he is also
known by lawyers for a steely toughness. The judge's major rulings
include two that struck down as unconstitutional the military's ban
on homosexual activity and the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for
homosexuals in the military. An appeals court reversed the rulings.
In 1996, he rejected the argument that the Mafia boss Vincent
Gigante was mentally unfit to stand trial, setting the stage for
his conviction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosecutors
</P>
<P>
   LORETTA LYNCH: Chief assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District of New York, Ms. Lynch, 39, was previously head of the
office's Long Island section. She joined the office in 1990 after
six years in private practice and was the chief prosecutor in
trials involving charges of public corruption in Brookhaven.
</P>
<P>
   ALAN VINEGRAD: Vinegrad, 39, is chief of the criminal division
in the U.S. attorney's office, which he joined in 1990 after
several years in private practice. He was one of the prosecutors in
the highly publicized 1997 trial in which two black men were
convicted of violating the civil rights of a Hasidic Jew fatally
stabbed in violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   KENNETH THOMPSON: Thompson, 32, joined the U.S. attorney's
office four years ago after working as a lawyer with the Treasury
Department, where he helped investigate the initial 1993 raid by
federal agents on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. His
mother is a retired New York City police officer, and he considered
becoming an officer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Defense Lawyers
</P>
<P>
   MARVYN KORNBERG: Kornberg, 64, who represents Officer Justin
Volpe, exploded into prominence in 1985 by exposing police
brutality _ the torture of prisoners, including a client, with an
electric stun gun at a Queens station house. More recently he has
been prominent in defending police officers, and is the lawyer for
Sean Carroll, one of the officers reportedly charged with murder in
the killing of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN WORTH: Worth, 47, represents Officer Charles Schwarz. A
former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, he has defended
officers in trouble for two decades, and since last May his firm _
Worth, Longworth, Bamundo &AMP; London _ has had a contract with the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to represent officers. He is a
lawyer for Edward McMellon, another officer reportedly charged in
the Diallo killing.
</P>
<P>
   STUART LONDON: Representing Officer Thomas Bruder, London, 44,
is a partner of Worth and a former assistant district attorney in
the Bronx, where he supervised a unit that investigated police
misconduct. More recently he has often defended officers, including
Francis Livoti, convicted last year on charges stemming from the
choking death of a man in the Bronx, and (with Worth) McMellon.
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH TACOPINA: Tacopina, 32, represents Officer Thomas Wiese.
He is a former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn who, in
private practice, has represented defendants charged with
white-collar crimes as well as police officers.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PATTEN: Patten, 58, who represents Sgt. Michael Bellomo,
prosecuted police officers charged with perjury when he was an
assistant district attorney in Manhattan. A large part of his
longtime private practice has involved defending police officers
against charges ranging from assaulting suspects to selling
confidential information to mobsters.

SPORTS COLUMN: AT DUKE, THERE ARE TOP PLAYERS AND TEAM LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Elton Brand had just received the latest
in a series of awards that have tumbled over him like a waterfall.
On Monday, Brand, Duke's outstanding sophomore forward, was awarded
the Oscar Robertson Trophy by the U.S. Basketball Writers
Association as the nation's top player. Wednesday, he was named the
winner of the Atlanta Tip-Off Club's Naismith Award. And here he
was Friday being named player of the year by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reporters surrounded Mike Krzyzewski, asking the Duke coach
to describe Brand's greatness. One reporter prefaced his remarks by
saying Brand was Duke's leader. Krzyzewski snapped: ``Trajan
Langdon is our leader. Elton Brand is our best player.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach's statement spoke volumes about a battle between an
emerging player and a master coach attempting to prepare the player
for coming battles, battles for which the player may not be
prepared. Ever so discreetly, the coach has thrown down the
gauntlet. If Brand is great, what does that make Grant Hill?
Krzyzewski knows he and his team exist in an era in which the news
media make kings and queens out of frogs _ not because they really
are kings and queens, but because we need someone to dethrone.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 18 months, Krzyzewski has stayed on top of Brand.
As recently as December, he put the 6-foot-8-inch standout player
on the bench. The coach said he wasn't working hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a growing player,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He's not an end
product. Early on in the season, he kind of looked at it that he
was already there because of all the publicity. He can become an
outstanding player. He's not a great player now. He can become it,
if he knows he's not that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is speculation that Brand will leave Duke to go to
the National Basketball Association, becoming the first player to
leave the Durham, N.C., university as an underclassman.
</P>
<P>
   These are impossible times for anyone who believes young players
should stay in college to learn and absorb. Many of us make the
annual case against young players turning professional. The reality
is that in this climate where everyone seems to be making grabs for
the money, arguing values over cash is difficult. Telling players
on the threshold of riches to wait on the Lord is difficult at
best, hypocritical at worst.
</P>
<P>
   On a more pragmatic level, Krzyzewski knows that Brand holds the
key to preserving a sensational, legacy-setting season. He also
knows that all it takes is for Brand to have an off night and
William Avery to get in foul trouble and Duke is under glass. The
Blue Devils will be an army without a general.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Krzyzewski drew a sharp, immediate distinction
between best player and team leader. The leader single-handedly
bails the team out of jams, then carries the team to higher
heights. That's what Grant Hill did throughout his career at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   In Duke's early-season loss to Cincinnati in November, Brand was
bounced around and held to 12 points and 7 rebounds. The next game
against Michigan State, Brand had only 3 rebounds. THREE. Three
games later, Brand was benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel you've already finished your journey, you don't
continue to travel,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He needs to continue to
travel. That's what we're trying to impress on him.''
</P>
<P>
   And this approach presents issues Brand must answer: Does he
want to go through another college season? Does he want to risk
being benched next season if, in the coaches' determination, he is
lazy and undeserving. Does he want to be labeled? And how much
money does Brand lose in that scenario? Brand would be a better
player if he waits, but who cares?
</P>
<P>
   There are two measurements at work: can you get the money, and
can you play?
</P>
<P>
   Money is the overriding issue. Not how good, not how mature.
This is the way of the world. Last week in Knoxville, Tenn., a
distraught Ron Artest said that he would love to return to St.
John's for another run at the Final Four. But he said he was not
going to allow a game to affect his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is ready for a couple million dollars. On the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Is Brand? ``I know I'm not prepared to go pro and play against
L.J.'' _ the Knicks' Larry Johnson _ ``the Barkleys and the
Malones,'' Brand said recently. ``They're big and strong, and they
know the game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a phenomenal season for Brand. He has reached
double figures in points and rebounds 17 times, is shooting 62
percent from the field and has blocked 83 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Brand is a solid character, easygoing and quick
to smile. He was raised by his mother and a strong extended family
in Peekskill, N.Y. He learned to play the physical game of
basketball on the playgrounds, where fouls are never called and
nobody plays zone defense. He was the biggest player at Peekskill
High, so he often found things too easy. He admits that as a
schoolboy, ``Maybe I was lazy, but when you're 6-7 and &QC; 6-3 guys are
guarding you, it's hard to get up for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day,'' he added, ``I'll be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand is of one of three NBA-caliber players on Duke's team.
Scouts say William Avery might be an NBA franchise player. They all
agree that Corey Maggette, the freshman forward, has NBA stuff.
They say that Brand is unstoppable at this level. In the NBA, they
say he will be a good player, though maybe not an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   For a competitor like Krzyzewski, Brand might represent the
greatest challenge in a season without flaw. If Brand leaves, he
will be about the only thing the Blue Devils will have lost all
season. &QL;

<P>
   VIRGINIA KEY, Fla. _ For years in Dade County, until 1945, the
Atlantic Ocean was emerald green and deep blue, the beach was
black-specked gray, and the people who swam and sunbathed and built
castles in the sand were, by law, white.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Crow laws banned black people from Miami Beach, from Key
Biscayne, from a picture-postcard ocean that gave South Florida a
reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Think, say black residents old enough to remember, what it was
like to live beside such cool beauty and not be able to stick a toe
in it.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who did much of the heavy lifting in this utopia,
it was a tropical paradise with a padlock. As early as the 1920s,
the men who created Miami, dredging it from muck and rotted
mangroves, talked of having a beach just for blacks, to ward off
inevitable protests.
</P>
<P>
   But it was summer of 1945 before county leaders made a deserted
barrier island called Virginia Key the county's only beach for
black people.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that at the time there was no bridge to get to the
island, about two miles off Miami and immediately north of Key
Biscayne, still makes many older black people here shake their
heads. ``Don't quite remember how we got there,'' said Athalie
Range, 83, the first black city commissioner in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But a beach born from racism and created as a vehicle for
segregation went on to become an important recreational and
cultural center for blacks in this county, now called Miami-Dade,
drawing church groups, prize fighters and famous entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   They rode a ferry at first, until a bridge was built, and made
Virginia Key a playground of their own that ended only when the
county started opening other beaches in the desegregation days of
the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as developers eye this small key of largely palm and sand
with intentions of turning it into an upscale resort area, the
older black residents of Miami-Dade are shaking their heads once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have coveted the key over the years, and now the city
of Miami, its legal owner, is considering leasing the property to
entrepreneurs who have suggested building everything from a resort
hotel with a marina, restaurants and entertainment venues to an
upscale campground with cottages, picnic areas and spaces for
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance of environmentalists, historians and black activists
are fighting that plan. They want the key, which the city says is
about 1,000 acres, to remain undeveloped, except for a civil rights
park that would honor black residents who fought against
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   If it belongs to anybody, older black residents said, Virginia
Key belongs to them, because the county once gave it to them to
keep them off the white beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It served its purpose,'' said John D. Johnson, 85, a retired
municipal court judge and one of the many older black residents who
remembers why the island once belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a history behind it,'' said Johnson, who remembers
driving out from Overtown, one of Miami's black neighborhoods, for
barbecues on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasant memories we have,'' he said, of a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the county's position, Dena Bianchino, assistant
city manager for development for Miami, said, ``The point is that
we have this beautiful tropical urban island where we can offer
people a sophisticated hotel experience, a camping experience and a
wildlife destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingling with the signatures of white pioneers on the city's
first charter of more than 100 years ago are those of the black
residents who helped build the city, including Bahamians who became
a part of the city's history. But in this place they helped build,
many blacks consider themselves forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   As the political and economic power gradually shifted from white
residents to Hispanic ones, particularly the Cuban-Americans who
have made Miami home, the shootings of blacks by white and Hispanic
police officers led to riots in the Overtown and Liberty City
sections in 1989 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It is those riots, many black residents say, that overshadow a
much richer, and more substantial, history in which black residents
fought against Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Miami, I can't think of anything very significant where
those persons are remembered,'' said Mrs. Range. But a park,
dedicated to them on the same island that whites once used to exile
blacks, ``is something that we are really due.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is only human nature, she said, that black residents would
push for the monument at a time when developers want to turn it
into a playground for people who can afford waterfront cottages.
</P>
<P>
   City and county leaders gave them the key, black residents said,
to quiet a growing resentment that had already led to protests and
threatened to bring bad publicity to a tourist area that could not
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mid-1940s, long before the battle against segregation
began to capture national headlines. Black residents here, led by
the Colored Ministerial Alliance and other groups, went swimming at
Haulover Beach in the hope of being arrested and getting a chance
to test the Jim Crow laws in court.
</P>
<P>
   City and county leaders gave them their own beach instead.
</P>
<P>
   Black residents had to pay 75 cents _ a steep price in 1945 _
for a ferry ride from a dock on the Miami River. But the key
quickly became a place for celebrations, where members of
fraternities, sororities, church groups and families swam, ate and
played, said Mrs. Range and others who came here.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the county built cottages, cabanas and barbecue pits,
and finally, in 1947, a bridge. Entertainers like Nat King Cole,
who were banned from white hotels on Miami Beach, stayed here, with
black baseball players, boxers and others. The servants who waited
on wealthy, white winter visitors were also banned from the white
beaches, so they stayed on the key, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fun,'' said Walter Anders, 70, who remembers the key's
heyday.
</P>
<P>
   But the beach was also ``a unifying factor,'' Anders said. ``It
was a place where you made friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement ultimately gave black access to other
beaches and made Virginia Key unnecessary. A hurricane in the
mid-1960s destroyed much of what remained of the permanent
buildings, and now the Public Parks Coalition, a Miami group, and
the others want to leave the key to the manatees, wading birds and
other wildlife, said Greg Bush, a spokesman for the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Developers would damage the barrier island that has miraculously
survived South Florida's runaway development, Bush said, while a
park and monument would not intrude on that wildlife nearly so much
as motor homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' he said, that the city will sell both the
history and ecology of the place, for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bianchino, the assistant city manager, said the city would
keep the beach open to the public, adding: ``We're not going to
touch the critical wildlife area of it. I don't think the real
issue is the historical nature of the property. It's development
versus nondevelopment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Range does not think it odd that blacks want to build a
monument to their struggle on the very site of their one-time
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget about these things,'' she said of the black history
on the key, ``and when it comes to a point when someone wants to do
something else, you remember.''

BUTYRSKAYA DETHRONES KWAN AS RUSSIANS COMPLETE SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI _ Michelle Kwan will soon reassume control of her own
destiny as she sorts through what many 18-year-old Americans sort
through when winter turns to spring: university acceptance letters.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kwan took the ice for the free-skate program Saturday
in the Hartwall arena, her options were limited.
</P>
<P>
   Mariya Butyrskaya, a Muscovite, had already clinched the gold
medal and a four-event Russian sweep at these world figure skating
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, the defending champion and last competitor in the final
group, was in the uncommon position of skating for second place.
She would succeed in winning the silver, but by her own lofty
standards, her overall performance in Helsinki cannot be considered
a success. For the second time in her career she was displaced as
the world champion on European ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just really proud of myself,'' Kwan said of her free
skate. ``It's been a rough week or me: a lot of ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan did not fall Saturday, as she had in Friday's short
program: a gaffe that left her fourth in the standings. But in her
free program she did step out of her opening triple lutz and did
downgrade a double axel to a single axel.
</P>
<P>
   Though she completed six triple jumps cleanly, she was not the
most complete skater the last two days in Helsinki, and a severe
cold, which cut into her practice time, did not help her cause or
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold probably hit me harder mentally than physically,''
Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here, we saw that Michelle was not in such good
shape,'' said Yelena Tchaikovskaya, Butyrskaya's coach. ``I never
see Michelle fall in practice, but here in practice there were many
mistakes. She even fell after jumps, and I think this is news for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Good news as it turned out for Butyrskaya, a two-time European
champion who landed seven clean triple jumps. At the age of 26
years 272 days, the Muscovite is the oldest women's world champion
in history, and a mature counterpoint to the teen-agers _ Kwan,
Tara Lipinski, Oksana Baiul _ who have been hoarding much of the
gold of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I skate like a woman on the ice,'' Butyrskaya said.
``I can do all the jumps. I have learned to cope with my nerves,
and today I proved I am the best skater in the world. The age
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya also became the first Russian to win the women's
world title. In 1993, Oksana Baiul became the first Soviet-born
women's champion, but by then the Soviet Union already had split
apart and Baiul was representing Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten near this step by step,'' Butyrskaya said. ``A
couple years ago, Irina Slutskaya became the first Russian to win
the European title. Then I won, and now we are not going to let
that title get away anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia had already swept the four disciplines at the last three
European championships. Now it is the first to run the table at the
world championships since ice dancing joined the marquee in 1952.
Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the pairs event;
Aleksei Yagudin the men's, and Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsyannikov finished first in the dance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That success comes despite Russia's top skaters and coaches
leaving in droves for the surer ice and better conditions that
currently prevail in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Butyrskaya and the women's bronze medalist, Julia Soldatova,
17, remain based in Moscow. Both are being guided by Tchaikovskaya,
one of Russia's most respected coaches. Tchaikovskaya began working
with Butyrskaya after she fell apart in the short program at the
1997 European championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was very interesting why this fantastic woman and
skater cannot perform in competition,'' Tchaikovskaya said. ``Maria
now knows she's a very strong skater and believes she can do this.
The reason she did very well this year is psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   A girl half Butyrskaya's age also did well in Helsinki. Sarah
Hughes, a 13-year-old with braces on her teeth from Great Neck,
N.Y, finished a surprising seventh after skating a clean free
program with six triple jumps that earned her marks ranging from
5.2 to 5.6 for technical merit and from 5.3 to 5.7 for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Hughes would normally be too young to compete here, but
she earned the right by winning a silver medal in the last world
junior championships.
</P>
<P>
   A younger 13-year-old, Naomi Nari Nam, of Irvine, Calif., was
not old enough to skate at the world juniors, and though Nam
finished second to Kwan at the U.S. national championships, she
could not compete here because of the age requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Hughes to take one of the three American spots in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to skate well because I wanted them to know that
13-year-olds do belong here, and that age doesn't matter,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether this was Kwan's world-championship
farewell. She has applied to six universities, including Stanford,
Harvard, UCLA and Cal-Berkeley, and if she elects to start school
full time in the fall, the impact on her skating career could be
profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle has some decisions to make,'' said her coach, Frank
Carroll.  &QL;

VARIED COALITION PLANS NEXT STEP IN PRESSURING NYC POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW) 
 (bl)  
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the reported indictment of the police officers
who killed Amadou Diallo, the wide array of politicians, business
leaders, clergymen and others who had been demanding the
indictments in daily protests have turned their attention to
broader goals.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rev. Al Sharpton contends that the demonstrations and
arrests at Police Headquarters will continue, other protest leaders
have renewed their calls for a requirement that police officers
live within New York City and for the creation of an independent
civilian commission to oversee complaints of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the recommendations that have emerged from
discussions among a diverse group of black and Hispanic elected
officials, clergy members, labor leaders and business executives.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes former Mayor David Dinkins, Sharpton
and Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199, the National Health and
Human Service Employees Union, met Saturday to develop legislative
strategies in the aftermath of the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The four white officers, members of the Street Crime Unit, were
reportedly indicted Thursday by a Bronx grand jury in the killing
of Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who in February was cut
down in a fusillade of 41 shots at his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling for a renewed emphasis within the Police
Department to hire more black, Hispanic and Asian officers and to
enhance its psychological review of new officers.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial demand is certain to be the call for an
independent panel with broad powers to subpoena police officers and
records. The mayor, who has long contended that such investigations
would be best handled within the Police Department, has said
outside monitors could interfere with internal departmental
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several weeks, the reaction to the Diallo shooting
has brought together an uncommon assembly of protesters at Police
Headquarters complaining about what they consider abusive treatment
of minority New Yorkers by officers. While the demonstrations and
arrests were organized by Sharpton, they came to involve public
figures who rarely if ever take part in such events.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, whose National Action Network has been at the core of
planning the daily demonstrations, has not been alone in organizing
the protests. For nearly a year, a group of black business leaders
has also been holding strategy sessions. Participants said they had
been outraged by the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant
whom prosecutors say was brutalized in a Brooklyn precinct station
house in 1997. The trial of four officers and a police sergeant in
the Louima case begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants in the strategy sessions were J. Bruce
Llewellyn, chairman of the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co.;
Loida Nicolas Lewis, chairwoman and chief executive of TLC Beatrice
International Holdings Inc., and two who were arrested last week in
protests blocking the entrance to Police Headquarters: Earl Graves,
the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, and Ed Lewis, the
publisher of Essence magazine. Graves, who sits on the corporate
boards of Daimler Chrysler and the parent company of American
Airlines, said he felt compelled to participate in the sessions and
in the arrests because ``We are simply saying `enough is enough.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the meetings of the business executives occurred in
Lewis' offices at Essence. The publisher said he decided to become
involved after the incident with Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that what happened to Diallo is a continuation
of this outrageous police behavior,'' Lewis said. ``We're still
looking at the trampling of our civil liberties in the name of
crime reduction.'' In addition, Lewis said, he felt it was
important for news organizations and the public to realize that
``there are people who are just as concerned about this as Reverend
Sharpton is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, while there may be broad agreement on many of the
legislative goals, there is great disagreement about strategy. For
example, Sharpton and Dinkins have asked that black and Hispanic
legislators wait to meet with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani until after
Saturday's meeting, which was expected to produce specific
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who has generally avoided requests by black
politicians to meet with him, has had discussions in the last few
days with 10 members of the City Council's Black and Latino Caucus
and Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields. He met Saturday
with state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that it was important not to give the mayor an
opportunity to say that he had reached out to us but that we
declined because of some political gamesmanship,'' said City
Councilman Philip Reed, who represents much of East Harlem. ``We
work in the same building. We pass by him all the time. It seems
ridiculous to treat this like it's the Kosovo talks.''
</P>
<P>
   But several other Council members viewed the situation
differently, saying it was vital to meet with the mayor only after
the leaders had clearly defined a set of goals Saturday.

COMMENTARY: AGE OF REFORM HAS SHORT LIFESPAN IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can hold your breath. Sports is entering an Age of Reform.
Which will be over soon.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer range of current controversies is breathtaking; from a
racket beloved for its corruption, boxing, to a quasi-religious
concept once promoted as a moral equivalent to war, the Olympics,
the very notion of sports as Fair-Shake City is under attack.
Somewhere between the palaces of Las Vegas and the palaces of
Lausanne are the groves of academe, which came alive this month
during the annual celebration of the most liberal of arts,
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need to belabor Olympics and boxing. Having just
admitted synchronized diving, the Games deserve a breather.
However, since I had forgotten that the Olympics enjoyed nonprofit
status (just so I could deduct my annual donations?), maybe we
should at least keep an open eye. Having to subsidize as well as
bribe Olympic officials seems excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing, on the other hand, is supposed to be crooked, which is
why Don King was created, supposedly during a story conference at
HBO. The two killings in his resume were probably the idea of the
network's imaginative president of sports, Seth Abraham, to keep
fighters and managers in line. King's hair is no joke; in the final
phase of his creation, there was so much juice in the room it was a
wonder that no one was electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   The white suburbanites who promoted the new boxing (while their
hipper brothers were helping to get hip-hop mainstream) wanted the
sport to have a faux outlaw edge. They wanted it to appear crooked
and dangerous rather than merely greedy, in which case they would
have had to establish a trade group like the Motion Picture
Association of America and a Jack Valenti to lobby for
protectionism against foreign fighters like Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball, which wraps up tomorrow, is where we should
concentrate our concern. Its television revenues are a mainstay of
the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which puts that
organization in a difficult position on reform. The NCAA was
originally formed because athletic directors and coaches knew they
could not trust each other. Given enough slack, even the Ivies
would have brought in herds of giraffes stuffed them in school
uniforms and pointed them at the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing their membership so well, the NCAA eventually instituted
minimal standards, most recently the so-called Proposition 16,
which required a relatively low level of test scores and high
school course completion for college athletic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   A protest movement, led by such race card dealers as Temple
coach John Chaney and former Georgetown coach John Thompson called
such standards discriminatory; black athletes from traditionally
under-funded and under-serviced schools would suffer because of
their substandard educations. Recently, a federal judge struck down
the NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Such standards may very well be discriminatory. It is one of the
basic concepts that underlie affirmative action. At the same time,
there has always been something cynical about the application of
social engineering to basketball competition, especially since the
college selection process now begins earlier and earlier in a young
athlete's career. The diversion of youngsters, especially black
youngsters, from education begins even before they learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with sneaker companies providing the links among the
Amateur Athletic Union, the high schools, colleges and pros,
youngsters are identified and tracked before they reach middle
school. As one leading youth coach, Gerard Papa of the Flames of
Brooklyn (one of Stephon Marbury's early stages), points out, it's
no coincidence that AAU groupings are now by grade rather than age;
marked players are often a year or two older than their teammates,
sometimes because they've allowed themselves to be left back _
redshirted, in a sense, in junior high _ so they have more time to
physically develop. With their eyes on the prize _ a college deal
and a shot at the pros _ learning to read their own contracts may
be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   For all its talk of reforming a sport that pays its bills, the
NCAA may have been relieved by the judge's decision. It can now
claim to be constrained from a cleanup. Of course. Why would
colleges want to become involved in something as potentially messy
and costly as education?
</P>
<P>
   This is why there is something to be said for the dropping of
pretense. The most competitive colleges could treat their teams as
corporations and factories once treated their teams in the old AAU
_ as morale and publicity-building adjuncts. Players would not have
to go to class and could dicker for long-term benefits and better
cars. It's too early to teach hypocrisy, as the NCAA schools do
now; that's better left for the graduate and professional schools
where the sports lawyers, doctors, executives and journalists come
from.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Olympics, boxing and the NCAA will follow the
lead of such popular sports organizations as Major League Baseball,
the National Football League and the National Hockey League. No
major surgery, just nip-and-tuck reform. Baseball reconfigured its
strike zone without a mention of how that affects all history.
Football reinstated instant replay and said nothing about seasons
of suspect decisions.
</P>
<P>
   And hockey, bless its dented skull, installed harder glass
partitions around its arenas without penalizing the goons who are
paid to run opponents into them. The NHL, however, does have a
policy against concussions. They could give you headaches. Should
be banned.

GORE BEGINS TO PRESS THE FLESH WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Al Gore quacked like a duck in a baby's face. He
empathized with a woman about caring for her ailing elderly mother.
He hammed it up in a home video. He donned a pullover sweater and
slacks, strolled into several living rooms and stopped by a front
porch, where he hugged a woman with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who has spent years assembling the nuts and
bolts of his all-but-announced presidential candidacy, moved this
weekend to the ``retail'' phase of his campaign _ the vital process
of selling himself house by house, voter by voter in this
first-in-the-nation primary state. His aim was to demonstrate that
he is worthy of being president by showing he can mix it up with
real people _ and that he is a real person too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first living room conversation of the year 2000
campaign that I've had the privilege to engage in,'' he told about
70 people Saturday in the parlor of Martin Gross, a prominent
Concord lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to formally ask for your support,'' he said,
after officially visiting the state 15 times over the last six
years and handing out $90 million in federal grants. ``I'd like to
be your president starting in the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his motorcade left the neighborhood, he stopped and
talked with Joan Tibbetts, 58, who has lung cancer and was
complaining about people on welfare. She was sitting on her porch
with her retarded daughter, Kiersten. Gore said he was sorry, that
his sister had died of cancer and, in a Clinton-like gesture, he
embraced them both.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed pressing the flesh is what retail politics is about,
even for an incumbent vice president. Despite the security bubble
that envelops Gore and the media horde that surrounds him, his
aides want him to connect more with voters and yet establish
himself as presidential. ``We want to keep something special about
his aura, but we don't want that to be a barrier,'' said Ron Klain,
Gore's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose campaign created a whirl of up-close-and-personal
moments for him this weekend across the Granite State, said this
could make the difference between whether he wins or loses the
election 20 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   In response to two days of questions, he said his chief mission
was to keep the economy thriving and that he would not let Social
Security ``unravel.'' He said he favored an overhaul of the
campaign finance system and would not take contributions from
political action committees. He condemned President Clinton's
extramarital affair and his lying about it, but asserted, ``He is
my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who attended his events were Democrats, and many
were already committed to him. Nonetheless, they said they were
thrilled that he was stepping out to meet them. ``He has a nice
firm handshake,'' Guthrie Speers, 72, a retired Presbyterian
minister, said admiringly as the vice president personally greeted
every one of the 340 people attending a Democratic dinner in
Conway.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers said that the weekend was a chance for Gore to move
out from being Clinton's shadow and to try to erase some of the
damage he recently inflicted on himself for saying he ``took the
initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But he repeatedly demonstrated his fondness for casting his
accomplishments with a definitive air. The 3,000 town meetings he
conducted during his 16 years in Congress, he said, was ``an
all-time record.'' He said he ``personally negotiated'' with the
Big Three automakers ``to create a new kind of automobile that
would have three times the fuel efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has a commanding lead in polls over former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his only rival for the Democratic
nomination, Gore is fighting early concerns about his electability
in the general election next year against Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly knew his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want your support, I'd like you to vote for me,'' he said
over and over. But it was not all easy for the famously stiff Gore,
who, according to surveys, is lodged in voters' minds as dull and
earnest. A recent Washington Post survey even asked voters if Gore
was ``very boring'' (22 percent said yes) or ``somewhat boring''
(34 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Can he ever shake the reputation for being wooden? ``Oh no,'' he
told an interviewer for the New England Cable Network. ``I'm old
enough to believe I'll never be rid of that. But I think the older
I get, the easier time I have expressing myself in public the way I
do with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After that particular interview, the reporter, Alison King,
asked Gore to wish her father, Jackson, a happy birthday in a home
video. The vice president took the microphone, draped an arm over
Ms. King, interviewed her about her father and called it a wrap
with a jolly sign-off: ``Jackson, there you have it! Live, from
Carroll County, N.H., a preview of your birthday.''

SPORTS COLUMN: UCONN FANS HAPPY TO SAIL UNCHARTED WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The fan from Connecticut wanted to know
how to pass the time, waiting for Saturday's game with Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not go to practice on Friday?'' somebody suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let you go to practice?''
</P>
<P>
   Rookies. What are you going to do? Duke fans, with their
congenital sense of entitlement, know precisely when to strut into
the Final Four practice, last weekend in March, just about every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was the new kid on the block, making its first
appearance in the Final Four late Saturday afternoon against Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the wings were Michigan State and Duke, which has
been here eight times in the past 14 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut fans _ the long-suffering Connecticut fans, I
might add _ were officially just happy to be here. At least, that
was their position as they made their trek down from the Northeast,
like so many belated snowbirds.
</P>
<P>
   The fans could even watch practice, such as it was _ layup lines
and foul-shot drills, the real stuff being conducted elsewhere,
behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Their Connecticut euphoria was partially due to having escaped
Gonzaga last Saturday in the regional final in Phoenix. Nothing
against the appealing Mighty Zags from Washington State, but a
regional loss to Gonzaga would have been the worst thing that ever
happened to the state of Connecticut _ or maybe second to the New
England Patriots' feasting their greedy eyes on some prime real
estate in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that crisis was averted, and Connecticut was officially
in the Final Four. Never again would anybody question the coaching
wisdom of Jim Calhoun, at least until 5:42 p.m. Saturday, that is
to say, tip-off time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited, we are happy to be here,'' Calhoun proclaimed
on Friday. ``Since we left Phoenix, there has been a lot of
exuberance, a lot of joy, a lot of happiness, and a lot of
tape-watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are getting ready for this moment,'' Calhoun added.
``They have the chance to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Calhoun did not say they were ``just'' happy to be
here. It's all right for Connecticut fans to feel that way, and
many of them did. For my dose of Connecticut madness, I talk with a
family of Connecticut boosters, who have been buying season tickets
for several decades, who have suffered those depressing Wednesday
losses in the Big East tournament, and then suffered equally
depressing first-round losses in the vagabond National Invitation
Tournament in some empty gym in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was well past that under Jim Calhoun. Each Big East
championship, each run to the regionals, raised the stakes. Now
Connecticut was at the Final Four. Was there some resident sourpuss
in my friend's family that might feel a Final Four was not enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' my friend pronounced. ``It's nice to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a nice attitude to have. They don't feel that way in
Kentucky, where I have some history. Back there, I am told, the
locals are downright unhappy because Tubby Smith's lads lost to
Michigan State in a regional final. Kentucky people expect to be at
the Final Four every year, and were, for that matter, for the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, on the other hand, had inexplicably missed three straight
Final Fours, which did not take away from their hauteur, you
understand. Coach Mike Krzyzewski was asked on Friday if he had any
friendly collegial advice to give to his three fellow coaches, none
of whom had ever been to the Final Four as participants.
</P>
<P>
   No, Coach K said with not much more than a smirk on his face. He
wasn't joking. He had no advice to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had the advantage of good looks or intelligence,''
Coach K said. ``So if I have an advantage of experience, I won't
talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   By his refusal to discuss it, Coach K was suggesting that there
is indeed some tried-and-true way to approach the Final Four. Or
maybe he was just messing with our minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut basketball people seemed to have a grip on the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when we arrived here, everybody said we've never
been to a Final Four before,'' said Richard Hamilton, the lithe
gunner. ``One thing we try to do, it's just another game. We don't
want to just be in the Final Four, we want to win as many games as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin, the personification of self-confidence, said:
``You may not have this experience again, so you definitely have to
make the most of it. You know, we couldn't come here to play one
game, we came to play two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun applauded this approach. Never again does he have to
deal with questions about why he never got to the Final Four, and
what a blessing that must be. And Calhoun was not yet in a spot
like Tubby Smith, who has to explain to Kentucky fans what he has
done for them lately.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice little interlude. The Ohio State game would come
soon enough. Heightened expectations. Duke knew all about it, in
its genes. Connecticut was about to find out.

YOUNG TRAIL BLAZERS SACRIFICE FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After his team was quickly knocked out in the first round of the
playoffs by the Los Angeles Lakers last season, Rasheed Wallace of
the Portland Trail Blazers met with his coach, Mike Dunleavy, and
asked if Dunleavy wanted him to come off the bench next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes to make us better, I'm willing to do it,''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   One sacrifice by a young player led to another. And another.
Until it became routine for the Trail Blazers. Their roster is
devoid of All-Stars, championship rings and thirty-something
leadership. But they do have incredible depth and chemistry and, at
22-5, the National Basketball Association's best record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Rasheed said he would go to the bench, it gave Mike a lot
of flexibility,'' said Bob Whitsitt, the Trail Blazers' president
and general manager. ``That wasn't a 35-year-old veteran realizing
he wasn't a starter anymore; that was a 24-year-old kid who loves
to play. The feeling was, if he could sacrifice. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when players like Greg Anthony and Jim Jackson _ a
guy who had started his whole life in the league _ were OK with
coming off the bench, it effectively sent a big message to the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's rooted in unselfishness, talent or both, Portland's
emergence this season has been almost startling. The Trail Blazers
have been to the playoffs 16 consecutive seasons, currently the
league's longest streak, and after 27 games last season they were
17-10. But they have not been a legitimate title contender since
Clyde Drexler, Buck Williams and Terry Porter were fixtures in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their success can be attributed to fresher legs during a
frenzied, truncated season. They have one of the league's younger
teams, averaging 27 years in age. Only Anthony, the Lithuanian
center Arvydas Sabonis and Stacey Augmon are 30 or older. Jermaine
O'Neal turned 20 three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But their depth rivals that of the Lakers. It gives the Blazers
the ability to match up against anyone, including the two-time
Western Conference champion, the Utah Jazz. Portland has split two
games with the Jazz this season after winning seven of their eight
prior meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons for the quick start: power forward Brian Grant is
tipping the ball to himself like Dennis Rodman used to, and point
guard Damon Stoudamire no longer runs around without purpose in the
half-court offense. And whether starting or subbing, Walt Williams
represents instant offense.
</P>
<P>
   The package is impressive, especially given the preseason
scouting report. If there had been a vote for the NBA playoff team
most likely to combust, the Blazers might have been that team: nine
players who had started at different times during their careers,
fighting for minutes. And some with unsavory reputations as
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he played _ Dallas, New Jersey, Philadelphia or Golden
State _ Jackson never seemed to fit in. Anthony shot too much for a
point guard. And along with the off-season acquisitions, there were
holdovers like the notorious Isaiah Rider and the unpredictable
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes that rap is a little overused,'' Whitsitt
said. ``I don't think it's bad to have guys walking that emotional
line. It's when you cross the line that you get into trouble.
They're playing at such a high level now that they're learning how
to play in the flow of the game and downshift a little bit at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider, who leads the team in scoring at 15.6 points a game,
still strays from the program sometimes. He was caught on camera
last Sunday night at the Rose Garden, dancing on the sideline and
trying to ignite the crowd during a timeout. The Blazers trailed
Philadelphia by 2 points, but ended up winning.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dunleavy yanked Stoudamire and inserted Anthony to
guard the 76ers' Allen Iverson for the entire fourth quarter of
Portland's 91-75 victory, Stoudamire was not peachy about the
coach's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting out the fourth quarter is difficult, I don't care if
you've won 45 games in a row,'' Stoudamire said last week. ``It
hurt. It definitely hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, they have been selfless. One victory at a
time, the skittish young Blazers are maturing into a team that
could last into June. &QL;

NBA NOTEBOOK: JOHN STARKS, CHRIS MILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starks Gets Out of the Rough
</P>
<P>
   From the Now-It-Can-Be-Told file: John Starks, a golf addict who
was criticized for taking his clubs to Indianapolis during the
second round of the playoffs last season, had already teed it up
the day before the New York Knicks defeated the Miami Heat in Game
5 of their first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played all day and then came out the next day and had a
great game,'' he said. ``I didn't think it was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did. Starks was included in the trade for Latrell
Sprewell at the request of the Golden State Warriors. But that was
not the first time the Knicks had shopped him during the off
season. For all his passion on the floor, the team's management
believed he had lost some of his desire for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy and at least two teammates were
critical of Starks' sudden obsession with golf, and they were upset
that he brought his clubs on the road the day before the Knicks
were eliminated by the Pacers in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are excuses people like to make,'' Starks said last
week. ``Michael Jordan went out and played 36 holes and won a
championship the next night.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Golf is not a strenuous sport. When you go out,
party all night long, drinking and doing those kind of things, then
you come back and try to play, that's hard on you. Much harder than
going out, getting in a golf cart, riding up to the ball, stepping
out, hitting the ball and going back to the cart. If you go out
there and walk the course, that's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost my competitive edge. I still want to win at all
costs. That's what drives me to go out there and play the way I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And drive the ball off the tee, too. Starks has already played
27 holes at the pristine Olympic Country Club in San Francisco,
whose members include Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a coach who likes golf, so it makes it a lot easier,''
Starks said, cackling.
</P>
<P>
   Mills Bemoans Lost Chance
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mills played only one season in New York, contributing as
a role player last year. But like other former Knicks who catch
their old team on television when they can, he mourns the break-up
of a team he thought had title potential in Michael Jordan's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys like John, myself, I think Oak for sure, are
missed now,'' Mills said, referring to John Starks and Charles
Oakley. ``Especially when Mike retired, I thought we could have
done it right then and there. Maybe it still could be the year for
them, but there's just a different-looking team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Mills said: ``When I watch them on DirecTV,
I don't know, they just don't seem the same. That hard play. That
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it, before I was even there, as, `Damn, the
Knicks.' You know when you were playing against them, you go to the
middle and you know they're going to crush you, they're going to
play their behinds off, they're going to dive, they're going to do
whatever it took. I don't really see that now. I see guys looking
more for self, than to play as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is Starks' teammate now at Golden State, added that
Starks' emotion was severely missed by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of what the Knicks were about _ a guy who had
energy and heat and heart,'' Mills said. ``John has tremendous
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the fire just isn't there for the Knicks team I was used
to watching the last four or five years.''

STRAWBERRY PUSHES TO GET IN PLAYING SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ From the moment Darryl Strawberry came onto
the field at Jack Russell Stadium on Saturday, he attracted the
most fan attention among the Yankees. Never mind that Bernie
Williams made this trip, as did Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to spot with bulging muscles on a 6-foot-6-inch frame,
Strawberry went from one screaming group of fans to another,
signing autographs. He smiled easily and often, the picture of
accommodation and grace.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for anyone to tell that maybe, just maybe,
Strawberry shouldn't have even been here. It was, after all, a
beautiful, cloudless day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor specifically told me to stay out of the sun,'' the
outfielder said. ``I hope I'm not doing anything that will turn out
to be bad for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-sun advisory came because Strawberry, 28, had received
chemotherapy only a day before, as part of his sixth-month fight to
overcome colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He was bucking other odds for the first time by playing just a
day after the treatment. The chemotherapy ``kind of wears you
out,'' Strawberry said after batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little sluggish, but you try to fight through it,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the chemotherapy sometimes gives him a
headache. He has undergone two treatments in a once-a-week schedule
that is to last four weeks. Then he will take a two-week break and
his progress will be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry could have used another day off to get his stamina
back, he said, but he is determined to get ready for regular season
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes logging playing time in left field, which he
did for four innings Saturday against Philadelphia. He had one
fielding chance, a fly ball that he fielded cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre, who is recovering from prostate cancer
surgery, told him in a telephone conversation last week that Chili
Davis, a switch-hitter, is the team's first option at designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to play some outfield,'' Torre said of Strawberry
on Friday. ``Not that he has to prove that he can play it all the
time, but he has to be able to stay out for a time just in case he
has to. And the physical part isn't there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre reiterated to Strawberry that the Yankees want him to ease
back into playing shape, not rush back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most important thing that he breaks camp with
us,'' Torre said, ``because I don't want him to break down a week
later. We're looking long term here. Whether that means he's going
to have to stay down here and play Triple-A, we don't know at this
point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's left-field competition includes Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it; I just play,'' Strawberry said.
``Baseball's just fun to me and I go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's game against the Phillies, he hit a sharp ground
ball to first base that drove in a run, then walked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's status is one of the few decisions left to be made
before the Yankees leave Florida for the regular season. Another
decision involves the left-handed pitcher Andy Pettitte, who has
been battling elbow tightness since early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Pettitte makes the opening-day roster may depend on how
well he performs on Sunday. After confining his work to
soft-tossing Saturday, he will pitch in a game at the team's minor
league complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could use a lift from Pettitte because Hideki Irabu
continued his shaky spring Saturday. He came in having given up
seven earned runs in 102/3 innings. And he was hit hard by the
Phillies, giving up nine hits and four runs in his first four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   At least the staff ace Roger Clemens looks as if he's ready for
the season. He threw 106 pitches in allowing no hits against the
Houston Astros late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I tried to increase my velocity, that happened,'' Clemens
said. ``My velocity was better and my change of speeds was better.
I'm also happy with my stamina. When I wanted to reach back and
work a little harder, I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, can understand why
Clemens, at 36, shows no signs of slowing down. When Zimmer went to
leave long after Friday's game, he said, Clemens was still working
on his fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many pitchers can stay up with him conditioning-wise,''
Zimmer said. ``If I had to make a choice right now, I'd take him to
win the Cy Young award again.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ Outfielder Chad Curtis has a policy of signing autographs for
children but not adults, figuring this is where he should put his
energy. When he declined an adult's request Saturday, the man
criticized Curtis. ``He said, `I paid for a ticket just like the
kids,''' Curtis said. ``I said, `Nowhere on the ticket does it say
that you're entitled to an autograph, whether you're a kid or an
adult.' I didn't want the guy to be bitter, so I tried to make him
understand my position.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees have started giving their regulars a periodic day
off. Saturday was first baseman Tino Martinez's.

 &HT;    Drivers like Texas track's makeover
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ No runs, no drips, no errors. The Texas
Motor Speedway makeover received a thumbs-up from the stock car
racing community this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For a track that's only three years old, the place certainly has
a history. Two years ago, heavy rains caused a water seepage
problem on the track and drivers could not control their cars on
the wet surface.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Eddie Gossage answered the complaints last year
by handing out T-shirts that read ``Shut Up And Drive,'' which
really irritated the drivers. The reconstruction seems to have
worked better than the T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the best of a bad situation,'' said Dale Jarrett,
driver of the No. 88 Ford. ``I think those problems are remedied
now and we have a much better race track to race on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn 1 is a lot easer to get into,'' points leader Jeff Burton
said. ``Before, it was very difficult to drive the car down in
there and hit where you needed to hit. It's just a better race
track. They made it more raceable. It's too fast right now because
of the new pavement but as time goes on that'll get wore off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage is pleased with the changes. ``That's why we spent $3.2
million last year, to hopefully hear them say good things about the
speedway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good odds
</P>
<P>
   Multi-car team owner Jack Roush went into the weekend with nine
chances to get his 200th career win: he had two cars in Saturday's
Coca-Cola 300 Busch race here, two entries in the Craftsmans Truck
series race in Phoenix later in the day and five cars in today's
Winston Cup Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   His lineup today: Mark Martin (starting sixth), Jeff Burton
(20th), Johnny Benson (24th), Chad Little (37th, on a provisional)
and Kevin Lepage (40th, on a provisional).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roush isn't anticipating a celebration even though Burton
and Martin have won the first two Cup races held here. ``I'm not
counting on it,'' Roush said. ``We've been extraordinarily lucky at
Texas in not having things happen beyond our control that would
stop us from winning. I don't expect the string to continue, but
we'll try.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Roush's news release, his career victories include
119 road racing wins, 39 Winston Cup, 34 Busch and seven truck
victories. However, the NASCAR record book credits him with only 34
Cup victories.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett supports fund
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarett renewed an arrangment Saturday with the Susan G.
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation which benefits every time he
finishes in the top three or takes a pole.
</P>
<P>
   His sponsor, Ford Credit, will contribute $10,000 for every
Jarrett win, $7,500 for each second place and $5,000 for thirds and
the pole. The Foundation received $175,000 from Jarrett's finishes
last year.

MORA BIDS FOR A SPOT ON METS AS UNDERDOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Melvin Mora wanted a shot at top-level
play somewhere so badly he went half way around the world before
last season and ended up in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Mora _ who is making a strong bid for the final
spot on the Mets' opening day roster _ was asked Saturday morning,
was the move to Asia a mistake?
</P>
<P>
   ``Big,'' the Venezuelan native said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a strange, roundabout way, going to the chaotic
baseball world of Taiwan, instead of the more established leagues
in Japan, has actually helped the little-known 27-year-old utility
man. Indeed, he might finally make his first major-league club this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens come opening day, Mora has already accomplished
something he was not able to do in six seasons in the Houston
Astros organization from 1992-97: get invited to a big-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is no question about it,'' Mets General Manager
Steve Phillips said recently. ``Melvin's opened everyone's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   A .404 batting average in 47 at-bats this spring hasn't hurt.
Neither has the ability to play just about everywhere but pitcher,
catcher and first base. Mora began his career as a center fielder.
But his ability to re-invent himself into an adequate second
baseman is one of the reasons why Mets Assistant General Manager
Jim Duquette thinks that Mora has a shot at being a major leaguer
some day, if not with the Mets on opening day. That, and Mora's
hard work at improving his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had the tools,'' said Duquette. ``It's just that
his bat has held him back. That, and his ability to be an effective
infielder. And he's improved on both.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Duquette who recommended Mora to Phillips last summer,
after Mora had fled Taiwanese baseball after just a month and a
half. And it was Duquette _ along with Mets Coach Cookie Rojas who
had seen Mora play in Venezuela this winter _ who convinced
Phillips to extend a nonroster invitation to Mora this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mora had the chance he always wanted. And he has made
the most of it so far. ``If it was me making the decision,'' Mora
said, ``I'd put my name there as the first one. But it's not my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora is apparently fighting with Mike Kinkade and Craig
Paquette, who also bat right-handed and can play a multitude of
positions, for the final spot on the 25-man roster. ``And it seems
to change every day,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Kinkade appeared to be in front. Recently, though,
Paquette gained ground, while seemingly out of nowhere, Mora has
come along to make it a three-man race. Only three, because this
morning, the 36-year-old Mariano Duncan asked for _ and was granted
_ his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over for me,'' Mora said of the Mets' seven
exhibitions remaining. ``I've got seven more games and I don't want
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Mora is having the time of his life. It has
just been a long time in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that came out of the infamous Astros academy in
Valencia,'' Duquette said of the Venezuelan city that Mora comes
from. ``And he was overshadowed by other prospects like Bobby
Abreu, Richard Hidalgo, Oscar Henriquez, Carlos Guillen, Freddy
Garcia and Manny Barrios. All of them were considered better than
Melvin, who was considered a solid utility player that you would
like to have on your club.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Astros were concerned, however, Mora was the type
of utility player that they wanted to have on one of their minor
league clubs. He hit .298 at Class AA Jackson in 1995 and .286 at
Class AAA Tucson in 1996. But after hitting .257 at Class AAA New
Orleans in 1997, the Astros again did not invite Mora to camp the
following spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when I said I'm done,'' Mora said. ``I didn't want
to go to AAA again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he went to Taiwan for $50,000 up front. It didn't take
much longer for Mora. who was delayed from leaving for a couple of
weeks because of passport problems, to want to come back (and pass
up another guaranteed $50,000).
</P>
<P>
   When Mora finally made it back to the United States last season,
he contacted Edgardo Alfonzo's brother Edgar, who is a coach with
the Mets' Class A affiliate in St. Lucie. Through Alfonzo, Mora got
in contact with Duquette, who offered Mora the only position he had
available: a utility role with St. Lucie. But, true to his word,
Duquette made sure that Mora was promoted to Class AAA Norfolk when
a roster spot opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Mora was considered a long shot when camp began this spring. But
all he wanted was to be at camp.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Duquette said, ``He's done the rest.''

WILL LAKERS BLOW AWAY ALL FOES OR BLOW UP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ He bathed his scalp in peroxide Friday,
hoping a change in tint and color would enhance his play. But nine
rebounds and six flops later, Dennis Rodman could do nothing but
watch his new team implode from the bench in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you need to ask the people around here what is going
on?'' the miffed power forward said after a deflating loss to
Sacramento at home. ``This is just completely ridiculous. I'm not
used to this.''
</P>
<P>
   About now, coach Kurt Rambis must be wondering how many blonds
it takes to muss up the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant keep insisting everything is
fine, that ``Dennis is Dennis'' and that there is simply too much
talent for this explosive combination of talent to combust. But the
Lakers are 3-5 in their last eight games, coming off back-to-back
losses at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   They meet the Knicks on national television Sunday four games in
back of Portland in the Pacific Division, still trying to find
chemistry amid all the commotion of adding the unpredictable Rodman
and veteran shooting guard Glen Rice to a potent mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look from the outside, you see how talented this team
is,'' said Rice recently. ``Now I'm on the inside. And it's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   It is frightening, watching whether this supreme collection of
basketball players can play together and how much Rodman means to
them. The Lakers are 10-2 with him and 8-9 without him. But Rambis,
who sat Rodman for the final 15 minutes, 42 seconds on Friday,
still does not know what player will show up to the arena - if
indeed he shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time rebounding champion left the Lakers after
practice March 13, telling Rambis he needed time to resolve
personal matters. He missed the first four games of a six-game road
trip, and the Lakers lost three of them after going 9-0 with him in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here the rest of the season,'' he said after returning
last Sunday against Orlando. ``I've used up my hall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rambis: ``We didn't stop, we didn't hesitate, we didn't go,
`Oh, me, oh, my, we can't win now.' We just kept playing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nights when O'Neal, Bryant and Rice are so balanced
and awesome during some blistering 20-1 run, it's easy to forget
their problems. If Jerry West has learned anything with this recent
make over, talent indeed camouflages the chinks.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, the Hall of Fame guard and team
president has brought to the Lakers pro basketball's most dominant
big man and its most breathtaking young talent. In the last month,
he's added the league's reigning rebounding king and arguably its
most dangerous long-distance shooter. Point guard is the only
liability, but thus far the veteran Derek Harper and the youthful
Derek Fisher have played well enough to make people forget Nick Van
Exel.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Rice and J.R. Reid for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell
gave Bryant and O'Neal the dimension they needed: a consistent,
spot-up shooter who has to be defended, someone to take those
annoying double-teams away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player studying the game and studying the great big men,
you always saw players like Kareem and Olajuwon with pretty good
players around them,'' O'Neal said. ``They didn't get a lot of
credit but when Houston beat us,'' he added, referring to Orlando's
loss in the 1995 finals, ``Robert Horry was hitting shots, Kenny
Smith was hitting shots and Mario Elie was hitting that crazy,
one-arm jumper he shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem, he had lots of talent. I always wanted to have good
players around me. Well, now I've got a lot of good players around
me. We should have no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice underwent elbow surgery Jan. 22, and hadn't played since
the playoffs last May. He scored 21 points in his debut, the
Lakers' 10th straight victory, keeping Rambis perfect as coach.
Rambis presided over nine straight victories after replacing Del
Harris on Feb. 26, tying the mark for the best record to start a
coaching career. A former cult hero during the team's championship
run in the 1980's, he no longer has that just-woke-up look about
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark Kent eye wear collection is gone, too. (The thick,
black-rimmed glasses knocked askew when Kevin McHale clotheslined
Rambis during the 1984 finals have been retired).
</P>
<P>
   A more resplendent Rambis wears designer suits and custom,
wire-rimmed frames. But he's still bounding from the telephone
booth just in time, like another coach who once had the great
fortune of inheriting a very good team _ and thereafter began
looking more dapper by the day. ``If you want to go ahead and make
that comparison, that's fine,'' Rambis said of Pat Riley. ``But I'm
my own guy. He took over a completely different team, different
circumstances, different era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent brings you a lot of luxuries, but it also brings
you a lot of work, too,'' he added. ``There's a lot of things that
have to go into getting the talent to meshing together, playing
together, blending the egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, Riles never got credit for what he did as a
coach. Everyone just thought he threw the ball out there, and we
fast broke to the other end, and that was it. That was all he had
to worry about. Not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The sideline image is but a facade. Rambis is still the
working-class rebounder whose pinky finger on his right hand is
permanently mangled from his playing days, the frugal soul who
still stuffs his duffel bag with 12 quarts of Gatorade and five
Pepsis from the team cooler before he leaves the arena at night,
the former player who used to ask his teammates for their unused
soap from their hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have mistaken me for someone else,'' he said ``I
didn't take any silverware or towels. That wasn't me. I have no
idea what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he will not change. As for the team he coaches, West
has proven there are no guarantees _ though not every move was made
with the team president's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an owner that likes change,'' West said recently,
referring to Jerry Buss, who orchestrated Rodman's signing.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman does not represent the only chemistry problem. O'Neal and
Bryant are still figuring out the nuances of when to take over a
game and when to involve their teammates. On certain nights, they
still seem in competition for the Most Marketable Player After
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   They even engaged in an altercation during a pick-up game a week
before the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe was shooting the ball every single time downcourt,'' said
Dennis Scott, O'Neal's former teammate and friend, in recounting
the incident. ``Shaq stopped the game and said, `Hold on. Time out.
This is my team.' Kobe said a little something back. Shaq slapped
him. Kobe came back at him and realized who he was coming after and
he stopped. That was it. Just a little squabble.''
</P>
<P>
   The adventures of Rodman. The clash of All-Star egos. And
expectations. Always expectations. You wonder if the Lakers can
find a way not to get pick-and-rolled by Utah again.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath West's smile as he proudly introduced Rice nearly three
weeks ago, you could almost see the wheels spinning. Deep down, he
must ponder whether there is enough chemistry and stability
remaining to get back to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, talent can be the greatest blessing or the biggest
curse,'' he said. ``But when you go through hard times, it's better
to have a lot than just a little.''

A GIANT WHO DIDN'T RUN AND DIDN'T BLOCK, BUT ALWAYS KNEW WHO
COULD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Rooney is leaving professional football after almost 30
years. His retirement announcement was made quietly by the Giants
last week, amid the din of college basketball. But not even March
Madness can obscure what has been one of the truly great football
careers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defining moments in Rooney's professional life was
the Pittsburgh Steelers' draft in 1974. Tim, a nephew of the
Steelers owner Art Rooney, had been hired several years earlier to
upgrade the team's pro personnel department under the direction of
Coach Chuck Noll.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers quickly discovered that Rooney's judgment was
highly valuable, and he soon became involved in almost every aspect
of the personnel department, especially the draft. Then came the
1974 Steelers' draft, considered one of the best of all time. With
their first-round pick, the Steelers took wide receiver Lynn Swann,
and with their second, linebacker Jack Lambert. Pittsburgh had no
third-round selection, but with two fourth-round picks it selected
wide receiver John Stallworth and defensive back Jim Allen. In the
fifth round, Pittsburgh took center Mike Webster.
</P>
<P>
   So in that one draft, the Steelers picked two Hall of Famers in
Lambert and Webster, and two others who should be in the Hall in
Swann and Stallworth. ``Of course you look back on that draft and
you can't believe how it turned out,'' said Rooney, who has three
Super Bowl rings from his days in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Pittsburgh in 1979 for more authority as the
player personnel director of the Lions, he eventually caught the
eye George Young, then the general manager of the Giants. Rooney
came to New York in 1985 as director of pro personnel, the title he
kept for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney became known as one of the hardest-working and best
prepared workers in the Giants' organization. ``Hiring him was one
of the smartest things I ever did,'' Young said recently. ``I
leaned on him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney will not discuss the key decisions he was involved in
with the Giants, or which players he wanted or did not want, but
it's no secret he was right most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   He was in favor of signing the free-agent running back Ottis
Anderson in 1986 when others questioned if he could still play. In
the mid-1990s, he was against Coach Dan Reeves' bringing in former
Denver players like Mike Croel, Mark Jackson and Michael Brooks,
all mostly busts. He was also against signing an aging Chris
Spielman in 1996 _ that, too, proved to be a wise decision.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the Steelers gave up on wide receiver Chris
Calloway, Rooney urged Young to sign him, and Calloway gave the
Giants six good years. Rooney scouted the former Dallas guard Ron
Stone, then a little-known backup, and when the Giants signed him
to a multiyear contract in 1996, the Cowboys, much of the National
Football League and members of the news media snickered. But Stone
has become a productive player.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Rooney's personnel decisions helped the Giants win two
sets of Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi offered Rooney a two-year
contract extension this month, but after listening to Accorsi's
offer, Rooney went home, spoke to his wife, Mary Ann, punched some
retirement numbers into his calculator, and came to the conclusion
that at age 57, now was the right time to leave, even though he was
two years away from collecting a full pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every weekend beginning in July, for most of my life, I've
been around football,'' said Rooney, who will leave officially at
the end of May. ``It's been rewarding and fun, but now I really
want to take control of my life and do what I want to do, which
will include lots of traveling and sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney's successor has not yet been chosen, but will most likely
come from within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein Has Backers
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  While the NFL continues to study the bid for the Washington
Redskins from the real estate developer Howard Milstein, it is
clear he has some support. The league has received more than a
dozen letters from members of the House and Senate, pleading to
allow Milstein and the businessman Daniel M. Snyder to purchase the
team, with some threatening to launch an investigation if the
league vetoes the bid. Members of the Washington news media have
also called for approval.
</P>
<P>
   What his supporters do not know, according to a number of NFL
owners, is that Milstein himself is mostly to blame for not getting
immediate approval.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Milstein has come off as arrogant in his dealings
with a significant number of the owners. He tried to repair his
image at the owners' meetings in Arizona two weeks ago, but based
on interviews with several owners this week, those efforts may have
come too late.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, problems still exist with the bid, mainly because
there is not enough cash in the offer. Much of Milstein's wealth,
these owners maintain, is in his real estate holdings, which are
financed by banks. Some traditional owners, whose wealth comes
mostly from the teams themselves, frown upon such leveraged
purchases of teams.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of Milstein's bid being approved are still about 50
percent, several owners said. The league will hold a special
meeting next month in Atlanta to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: If Milstein does get the team, Charley
Casserly, one of the NFL's more respected personnel men, will be
out as the Redskins' general manager. According to one owner,
Milstein's representatives have talked openly about firing
Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Casserly would almost certainly land with
another team, or join the league office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue on Broadway?
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  There are rumors that the Giants have been exploring the
possibility of playing in Manhattan, although the Giants deny any
such interest and pointing to their lease with the Meadowlands that
runs well into the next century. ... More people are becoming
sports agents than ever before. More than 300 prospective agents
took a qualifying exam administered by the NFL players association
recently, with some 290 passing. There is concern among some agents
that increased competition will lead to more cheating. ... The
former Giants linebacker Corey Miller, whose neck injury ended his
career with New York, has been medically cleared to play again by
at least one other NFL team.

CUBA'S BEST PLAYERS ARE FLASHY WITHOUT BEING FLAMBOYANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see BBO-ORIOLES-CUBA) 
 (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Omar Linares is the best-known member of the Cuban
national team that will play the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday, and
deservedly so. But Yobal Duenas may be the one player the Orioles
want to watch and remember.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles and officials of other clubs who have come to Cuba
for a firsthand look at the talent here may want to get a good look
at Duenas, because they may not see him when the Cubans go to
Baltimore for the second game of the home-and-home series, if there
is a game in Baltimore. Speculation has arisen that the Cubans will
pull out of the second game because they don't want to risk
defections.
</P>
<P>
   Another speculated scenario, though, has them taking an older
team to Baltimore for the May 3 game on the theory that the older
players will be less attractive to major league teams and less
likely to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Duenas is a good-fielding second baseman who is in his mid-20s,
24 or 26, depending on the source of the information. ``He is one
of our best prospects,'' said Ismael Martinez, a coach for the
Industriales team of Havana. ``He has all the tools to be a great
baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Duenas won the Cuban League batting championship by hitting .418
in the recently concluded season, and equally as impressively he
had a .499 on-base percentage and a .626 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers would get any scout's attention. Linares has
attracted attention with a talent that has made him the best Cuban
player in the past two decades, if not the best in history.
</P>
<P>
   Linares is 31, which is considered old here for a player though
not old by American major league standards, but he has had his
chances to change addresses when he has played in the United States
with the national team and has chosen not to. While virtually all
of the Cubans who have defected have been pitchers, Linares, a
third baseman, would have been a sought-after international free
agent if he had desired to become one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linares is the best example of a baseball player we have here
in Cuba,'' said Antonio Scull, whose two-run eighth-inning home run
Friday night gave Industriales a 3-2 victory over Santiago de Cuba
in the first game of the championship series of the Cuban League
playoffs. ``He is a modest player who gives everything on the
field. He is a player who could be playing in the big leagues, but
he decided to stay here in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubans, Scull added in Spanish, in which all of the players
spoke, admire Linares because he opted to stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   Linares, on the other hand, is slipping as a hitter. Limited by
injuries to 87 at-bats this season _ Duenas, by comparison, had 337
_ Linares hit .287, sending his career average under .370. He has
won five batting titles with averages ranging from .409 to .446 but
none since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he is still widely respected among his peers.
``He's absolutely the best player we have here in Cuba,'' said Ivan
Correa, the catcher for Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   Linares also appears to be past his injuries. ``Omar seemed to
be in good shape the last few times we saw him,'' Martinez said of
the right-handed hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   German Mesa and Orestes Kindelan will not be joining Linares and
Duenas in the Cuban infield for the game at Estadio
Latinoamericano. Mesa, the slick-fielding shortstop, and Kindelan,
Santiago's slugging first baseman, are in the final playoff series
and will not be on the team, even though no playoff game is
scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to play, but this is a decision that has been
made,'' said Kindelan, whose 438 career home runs make him Cuba's
Hank Aaron. ``It's going to be a great opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would go to Baltimore, the 34-year-old Kindelan
said, ``There I am surely going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Linares, Kindelan has played in the United States. He very
much made his presence felt in 1996 in Atlanta, breaking the
Olympics home run record by swatting nine in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can play in the big leagues,'' the right-handed
hitter said. ``The pitchers throw a little harder, but they have to
throw it over the plate. I think I could hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed no regrets at not trying to stay in the United
States. ``I feel fine because I'm in the company of my family and
my people,'' he said, standing outside the visitors' dugout 40
minutes before the start of the first game of the final series.
Money is very important, but it's not the only thing. For us,
family and friends are just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Loidel Chappeli, a 27-year-old left-handed hitter, is expected
to be the Cubans' first baseman in Kindelan's absence. His
statistics this season were not as good as Kindelan's.
</P>
<P>
   With Mesa missing at shortstop, Danel Castro, 22, is the leading
choice to play there. No one, however, can replace Mesa, at least
not defensively. Allowed to return to the league this season after
having been one of several players suspended _ El Duque, the
Yankees' Orlando Hernandez, was another _ Mesa demonstrated his
talent in the series opener Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Mesa flew through the air to snare a
leadoff line drive between short and third. Then in the sixth, he
teamed with second baseman Juan Padilla on as neatly an executed
play as any major league combo could pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla went far to his right to field a leadoff grounder and,
knowing he could not throw out the runner, flipped the ball to
Mesa, who had come toward second. Pivoting as if he were completing
a double play, Mesa fired the ball to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles won't see Mesa either here or in Baltimore. As
part of his return to active status, Mesa cannot play out of the
country. The players had been suspended because they were suspected
of harboring ideas of defection.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Cuban starting lineup are expected to be catcher
Juan Manrique and outfielders Oscar Machado, Jose Estrada and Luis
Ulacia. The Cubans have not disclosed their starting lineup nor
their starting pitcher. However, players and coaches said the best
pitchers were Pedro Lazo, Jose Contreras and Jose Ibar, all
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   They said Lazo and Contreras throw fastballs at speeds faster
than 90 miles an hour while Lazo also has a good slider and
Contreras a good curveball. Ibar's strength is more off-speed
pitches.

ORIOLES TRY TO RALLY FROM A DOWN SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see BBO-CUBA)  
 (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Chris Hoiles succinctly summed up the Baltimore
Orioles' 1998 season. ``It pretty much goes to show you can't buy a
World Series,'' Hoiles, the team's erstwhile catcher, said. Not
even for $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles play a historic game on Sunday, meeting the Cuban
national team on its home ground. They made history last year, too,
amassing the largest baseball payroll ever. But they got nothing
for it except a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps talking about the money,'' Harold Baines,
their veteran designated hitter, said. ``Talk about wins and
losses, not how much a player makes. Whether you have the highest
payroll or the lowest payroll, you still got to go out there and
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles performed so badly that they finished 35 games
behind the Yankees. Injuries to three of their five starting
pitchers _ Mike Mussina, Jimmy Key and Scott Kamieniecki _ in a
10-day span in May set the tone for their lost season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was one of the most frustrating years for me
personally and for everyone on the team,'' shortstop Mike Bordick
said. ``Even though we had some key injuries, I still think we had
the talent to do a lot better than we did. There was a lot of
frustration. We just couldn't get it rolling. You'd think with the
talent we had we could've regrouped a little bit better. We didn't
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their distance from the Yankees, measured in
metaphorical miles, the Orioles momentarily threatened to get into
the race for the wild-card spot in August. But a team meeting the
day after a poor effort in Chicago produced an ugly confrontation
between the Manager Ray Miller and the second baseman, Roberto
Alomar, and a couple of losses grew into a 10-game losing streak
that put an exclamation point on the team's awful season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller rejected the idea that his near fight with Alomar
affected the other players. ``You have a meeting, you're teed off
and you air everybody out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager said the pitching injuries were the primary problem,
but he suggested the unusually high number of potential free
agents, 14, might also have contributed to the team's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was that much of a problem in the clubhouse,
but I think it is mentally for people,'' Miller said. ``Fourteen
free agents at the same time. If one's talking to the general
manager, the other 13 are wondering, `Why isn't he talking to
me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty in the front office was another element he cited.
Pat Gillick, the general manager, was on his way to retirement,
Miller said, and his assistant, Kevin Malone, wasn't sure if he
would be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a lot of the time that the rough things were going
on,'' Miller said, ``they were out scouting. I don't think there
was anything intentional. There just wasn't a whole lot of planning
going on for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The free agency theory receives mixed reactions. B.J. Surhoff,
one of the free agents, said his status did not affect him and he
doubted that the others were affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to talk about a lot of different things other
than how we actually performed,'' Surhoff, the veteran left
fielder, said. ``I just don't think we played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Rafael Palmeiro, who is now with the Texas
Rangers, said free agency ``was probably a distraction for some of
the players,'' adding: ``Some guys use it as a motivating factor.
Other guys don't play well under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flanagan, the team's pitching coach last year and one of
its broadcasters this season, said he thought the bulk of potential
free agents could have been a factor. ``It's human nature when you
don't have a contract and you're in your free-agent year, the
tendency is to play for some numbers because it is your chance,''
he said. ``Maybe the focus, although unintentional, has become a
little bit more on the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they let some of the free agents go and lost others they
wanted, the Orioles had to scramble to fill spots. They added
Albert Belle for his bat; Will Clark to replace Palmeiro at first
base; Delino DeShields to replace Alomar, who went to Cleveland,
and Charles Johnson to catch and improve the performance of the
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles may not have the No. 1 payroll this season, but they
will be up there with the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The
question is whether the players feel any residual stigma lingering
from their high-priced failure last year.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson, the starter for the game in Havana, said they
don't. ``The players don't care about the payrolls,'' he said.
``It's something for other people to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Brady Anderson said he did not think so either.
``I understand that the team with the highest payroll in baseball,
you'd expect to win more games than you lose,'' he said. ``But the
effort we had was there. The results just weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoiles said last year was last year; it's gone and forgotten.
But is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who were on the team last year and went through that
whole process realize that we have something to prove this year,''
Bordick said. ``You can have that little chip on your shoulder,
whether it would be proving people wrong or proving to yourself
that you can do something right. Hopefully, we can use that to push
in the right direction and have some success.'' &QL;

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: JIM ABBOTT, RICK HELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overcoming Another Obstacle
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he led the United States to an 8-3 victory over the
Cuban national team in Havana in 1987, Jim Abbott has been the most
popular foreign player among Cuban fans.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has to cheer for Abbott, an incredibly courageous man
who has been a major-league pitcher despite a birth defect that
left him with only one hand. And the cheering will grow louder this
year because he has overcome another obstacle _ a sudden loss of
his pitching ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like there's any finality to it; it's an ongoing
process,'' the 31-year-old left-hander said of his impressive
comeback. ``I'm enjoying playing again. I'm just going out there
having fun, trying not to make it as complicated as I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Milwaukee Brewers' starting rotation, Abbott is
back after an anguished period in which he staggered to a 2-18
record with the Angels in 1996, was released and did not play in
1997, and then made a belated start to the 1998 season in the minor
leagues in his comeback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad year in '96,'' he said. ``I just didn't pitch
well. I became tentative, didn't throw quality pitches. I came back
to spring training the following year trying to make the team and
put all that behind me and I couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time for me. I didn't know what I wanted. I
didn't know if I could do well in the big leagues any more. It took
me a while to figure out what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball terms, Abbott said, if he was not dead, ``I was in
serious resuscitation.'' Last year, he related, he realized he
missed playing. ``I was healthy and young enough and wanted to give
it a shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox gave Abbott a chance, and he responded
positively. After stops at four minor league outposts from May 31
to Sept. 3, he started for the White Sox five times and won five
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a different pitcher than I was a couple years ago,''
Abbott said. ``I'm not as afraid to take a chance. I may throw an
off-speed pitch where I would never have done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the National League, Abbott has found something else
that is different. He has to hit, not an easy feat for a one-handed
batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always kind of adapted,'' he said. ``I just try to make
contact. This spring I've tried to learn to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   His education, it seems, never ends.
</P>
<P>
   A Confidence Booster
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling never heard of Billy Loes, the Brooklyn Dodgers
pitcher of the early 1950s who said he did not want to win 20 games
because then he would be expected to do it every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really worry about what other people expect,'' said
Helling, a 20-game winner for the Texas Rangers last year. ``I
don't think you can expect anyone to win 20 games. Last year we had
four 20-game winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling pointed out that neither Greg Maddux nor Randy Johnson
were among them. ``Those are guys who are aces and guys you would
expect to do things like that year in and year out, but they didn't
do it,'' he said. ``It's not easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I played on a good team,'' he said. ``I kept most of
the games close and ended up winning most of them. This year I
might pitch better and win less games. I was just fortunate last
year that we won most of the games I pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling said the most important benefit he gained from his good
performance was an infusion of self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Maddux told me this winter you don't win 20 games by
accident,'' the 28-year-old right-hander said. ``You can't be lucky
and win 20 games. That gives me the confidence to know I belong
here and it's possible for me to do it again. If it ever happens
again, who knows? But if I'm struggling or get off to a bad start,
I know in the back of my mind that last year wasn't just a one-year
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Beware of Scorpions
</P>
<P>
   Comforting sign in the Anaheim Angels' clubhouse in Tempe,
Ariz., on the wall next to the door the players' exit for their
workouts: ``Check and look in all shoes, bags and gloves for
scorpions!''

PURDUE TRANSFERS ADD TO DUKE'S INCENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Michele VanGorp and Nicole Erickson came to
Purdue in 1995 hoping to lead the school to its first national
championship in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue is one game from that goal. VanGorp and Erickson, now
star players at Duke, stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing subplot of Sunday night's Purdue-Duke
championship game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
women's tournament is VanGorp and Erickson, who transferred from
Purdue to Duke in 1997, matched against their former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The duo transferred after Purdue abruptly fired coach Lin Dunn.
VanGorp, who had 20 points in Duke's 81-69 semifinal victory Friday
night against Georgia, has remained angry about the dismissal,
though she said she has no ill feelings toward her old teammates.
Some of those who stayed at Purdue have acknowledged that they also
considered transferring and have watched VanGorp and Erickson with
a keen and fond eye.
</P>
<P>
   So it's safe to say that this will be a story line copiously
examined as the teams prepare for Sunday night's game. Even if the
principals involved might wish otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, just minutes after Purdue defeated Louisiana
Tech, 77-63, to advance to the championship game, senior Stephanie
White-McCarty, who played with VanGorp and Erickson, was asked her
emotions facing her former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just playing against those two,'' White-McCarty
said. ``We have to play against all their players. So I'm
approaching it like any other game.''
</P>
<P>
   The motivation might be more pronounced for VanGorp, who has
been the most outspoken about Purdue's decision to change coaches.
She has said Purdue officials never gave her an adequate answer for
Dunn's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason for it,'' VanGorp said on the eve of
Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The VanGorp-Erickson saga comes against the backdrop of a bigger
story involving the Duke women's team _ their presence in the
championship game at all.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, a bit player in the sport until recent seasons, has made a
captivating charge through the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weekend of a tournament traditionally dominated by
a few powerhouse programs, underdog Duke has stolen the spotlight
with a tough-talking coach, a savvy, scrappy, senior-dominated team
and a certain aplomb in a season branded as madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not surprised by this,'' said Duke Coach Gail
Goestenkors after Friday's victory, which allowed her team to keep
serve in its figurative Final Four match with the Duke men's team.
``These aren't upsets to us. We expect to win the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke will no doubt be considered the underdog again Sunday, but
it has flourished in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, reminded that her team was considered the least
talented of the four teams in the women's Final Four, Goestenkors
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be athletic to be a great player,'' she
said. ``We have smart, poised players who know how to play
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke used the same formula to dismantle Georgia that was so
effective in its stunning upset of three-time defending national
champion Tennessee in Monday's East Regional final. There was
dependable inside play by the 6-foot-6-inch VanGorp and there was
the lively play of a trio of nimble guards, Georgia Schweitzer,
Peppi Browne, and Erickson, who led all scorers with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   And Duke won with an infectious enthusiasm and a weaving,
pass-happy, team-oriented offense that involved every player on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spread you out and kill you slowly,'' said Georgia Coach
Andy Landers. ``You find yourself yo-yoing defensively from a
talented inside post player and a talented bunch of perimeter
shooters. You choose your poison.''
</P>
<P>
   While Duke presented its offensive attack exactly as planned,
the Blue Devils also effectively slowed Georgia's star twin guards,
Kelly and Coco Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller came into Sunday night's game averaging 27.5 points
per game in the tournament but sank just 5 of 13 shots against Duke
to score 13 points. Her sister led Georgia with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to focus on the twins,'' Duke's Erickson said.
``We saw on film that they liked to go to their left and then
shoot, so we tried to force them to their right. And we bumped them
around a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Millers, who are 5-10, were supposed to be
the physical presence that thwarted and wore down Erickson, who is
5-6.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen that way. Erickson came out shooting, making
her first shot as she led Duke to a 40-34 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp started slowly, hampered by a smothering Georgia
double-team. But she closed the first half by scoring eight of
Duke's last 12 points. At the start of the second half, she hit a
three-point corner jumper and another pull-up jumper, leading Duke
to a 13-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's pressure defense, led by the Millers, rattled Duke
briefly, cutting the Blue Devil lead to seven points at the
midpoint of the second half. But Duke, which has three starters who
shoot better than 80 percent from the foul line, made 8 of 11 free
throws in the final eight minutes to help protect the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson also hit two 3-point shots in the final minutes to ruin
any Georgia comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, which has not lost since Nov. 22, took an early
advantage against Louisiana Tech, led by 18 first-half points by
guard Ukari Figgs.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs, who teams with White-McCarty in what is considered the
best backcourt in women's college basketball, made three of her
first four three-point shots as Purdue took a 40-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech mounted a comeback that cut Purdue's lead to
58-55 midway through the second half, but led by Figgs, Purdue
scored 14 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything to prove to anybody,'' Figgs said
afterward. ``We're No.1 and we're here to win a championship.''

OUTDOORS: MILD WINTER AUGURS WELL FOR TROUT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you have made no preparations for the April 1 opening of
the trout fishing season in New York state, there is still time to
get some of your gear in order, an endeavor that should heighten
your anticipation of the pleasures that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And if the weather doesn't turn around between now and Thursday,
stream conditions in much of the state will be close to ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a fairly mild winter,'' said Wayne Elliott,
fisheries manager for the state's Department of Environmental
Conservation's Region 3, which includes Westchester, Putnam,
Dutchess, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties, adding
that many of the streams were open most of the time. ``As far as I
can remember, every snowstorm that we got this winter shifted over
to rain before it was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocking of trout, mostly browns, is under way in Hudson Valley
streams, Elliott said. In discussing the Amawalk, which he
described as ``a delightful wild trout stream,'' he noted that in
Region 3 and the state generally, stream trout fishing is limited
to lures or flies. The intent of the regulations, he said, is to
minimize mortality among fish that are released. Amawalk
regulations allow one to keep three trout of 12 inches or more in
length.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial infusion of 2-year-old brown trout _ fish from 12
to 15 inches _ are being released in many Region 3 streams this
year, Elliott said, about 10,500 of them. About 1,000 of those
fish, all tagged, are going into Esopus Creek. These spaghetti-type
tags are inserted under the dorsal fin. It is important, he said,
that anglers who catch any of these tagged fish return the tags to
the state's DEC. Anglers who wish to release such fish could simply
leave the tag implanted, note its number and report the date and
place of catch to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pierce, a DEC fisheries biologist whose duties include
watching over the Amawalk and the East and West branches of the
Croton River, is pleased with the success of a special no-kill
section of the West Branch, which was instituted a few years ago.
About a mile of the stream, between Croton Falls reservoir and the
stream's confluence with the East Branch of the Croton, is
involved. Anglers who fish this section with lure or fly have a
better than usual chance of encountering good numbers of wild brown
trout, some of them over 15 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   The East Branch continues to remain open to fishing with flies
or lures year-round _ from the East Branch reservoir to the
diverting reservoir _ and there is a daily limit of one trout, 14
or more inches in length.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catskills, the Beaverkill and the Willowemoc are in great
shape, said Ed Van Put, a wildlife technician with the DEC and a
master fly fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Save for lingering snow and cold in early March, Van Put said:
``It was an easy mild winter. The streams beds haven't been scoured
by any significant floods or ice jams, and the trout should be
prospering.''
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect at this time of year, Long Island's three
major trout streams, the Connetquot, Nissequogue and Carman's
River, are eminently fishable. On the Carman's, more than two miles
of which are in Suffolk County's Southaven Park, it's fly fishing
only on the stream itself, with one stretch set aside for catch and
release, but lures and bait may be used on the pond and lake at the
downstream end. The daily limit, where allowed, is three trout,
nine inches or more in length. The daily fee is $2, and one may
fish from sunrise to sunset, seven days a week. The telephone
number is (516) 854-1414.
</P>
<P>
   On the Connetquot, in a state park of the same name in Oakdale,
a catch-and-release fly-fishing season is under way. The regular
season, also limited to fly fishing, begins Thursday. Starting that
day, there will be three daily sessions _ 7 to 11 a.m., noon to 4
p.m. and 4 p.m. to sunset _ and two trout of any size may be kept.
There are 30 beats, or fishing sites, and the fee is $15 a session.
There is no Monday angling. Reservations can be made by calling
(516) 581-1005. There is a bonus for angler-birders who visit this
stream: its ospreys have returned from warmer climes and are
nesting, said the park manager, Gil Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nissequogue, which is in Caleb Smith State Park in
Smithtown, there are eight river beats and five pond beats. One may
keep two fish daily, nine inches or more in length. It's fly
fishing only and there are two four-hour sessions daily save for
holidays and weekends, when there is a third session that starts at
4 p.m. ends at sundown. The fee is $15 a session. The number for
information and reservations is (516) 265-1054. Fishing is closed
on Mondays unless it is a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   A state fishing license is also needed to fish these three
streams.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, if you are a fly fisherman, you should make
sure that you have a good supply of nymphs, wet flies and streamers
to take with you opening day. It might also be wise to bring along
a dozen or so small dries, perhaps No. 20 or 22 Adams, because if
the day is sunny and warm, there will be a hatch of tiny aquatic
insects on some pools.
</P>
<P>
   You should also test or inspect your waders for leaks. One
oft-suggested approach to this is to don your waders and slip into
a water-filled tub. This technique is dubious. Visual scrutiny _
including going into a dark room and running a flashlight around
the interior of the waders _ is best. Circle the flaws with a
marking pen so you can tell where to put the patches.
</P>
<P>
   If this is all too much, you can simply haul your waders out of
the cellar at the last minute, put them on, wade in and wait for
the worst. If there is a big leak, you are done for the day unless
you choose to retreat to your vehicle and apply a patch then and
there. In some instances, particularly if the day is cold and
nasty, this might be a welcome diversion.

NATO TARGETS SERB GROUND UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND AND LOUISE D. PALMER AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serb troops, defying NATO's four-day aerial siege,
stepped up their deadly attacks Saturday on ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo, increasing pressure on the Clinton
administration and US allies to consider launching a ground war to
halt the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   With all signs indicating that the NATO offensive has yet to
slow the slaughter in Kosovo, allied forces targeted Serb tanks and
troops in the separatist province and focused a new wave of missile
attacks on Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official warned that ``dark things are happening'' in
Kosovo, including reports of Serb forces murdering members of the
ethnic Albanian leadership, rounding up and killing military-age
men, and bombing and burning villages.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia said Saturday night that it had downed a NATO plane,
and a Dutch official said he had similar reports. If true, it would
be the first allied plane to be shot down since the offensive
began.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came amid growing pleas from ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo for NATO troops to fight Serb security forces on the
ground, and US officials confronted the public's enduring
reluctance since the Vietnam War to commit US soldiers to foreign
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the strikes, but we demand that NATO ground troops
come into Kosovo as quickly as possible,'' said a spokesman for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for autonomy for ethnic
Albanians who represent about 90 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last week he had no plans to send combat
troops to Kosovo, and officials at the White House and Pentagon
Saturday reiterated his position.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton called for NATO ``to stay
the course'' in order ``to defuse a powder keg at the heart of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the potential for US involvement in
a ground war. But in a letter to congressional leaders that was
released Friday night, he said he had dispatched 100 Marines to
defend the US Embassy in neighboring Macedonia, and he raised the
possibility of sending an unspecified number of additional troops
to conduct operations such as combat search and rescue,
intelligence support, surveillance and reconnaissance in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound military planning may also call for sending a limited
number of additional US military personnel to Macedonia in support
of ongoing operations,'' Clinton said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed confidence Saturday in the outcome of the
NATO operation, he reported no progress in curbing the alleged Serb
war crimes. In fact, Clinton said, ``Serb troops have continued
attacks on unarmed men, women, and children.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Defense Secretary George Robertson provided a
bleaker assessment. ``There are clear signs now that an all-out
Serbian offensive against the Kosovo Albanian people has started
and violence is widespread,'' Robertson said. ``The Serbs are
bombarding villages to the point of obliteration.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the brutality, thousands of Kosavars continued to flee to
neighboring countries. More than 250,000 people already have been
displaced, and the State Department Saturday projected that more
than 500,000 could be driven from their homes in the conflict.
Human rights groups reported that a Kosovo political nerve center
was burned down, as was a food warehouse operated by the Mother
Teresa organization.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, in forgoing ground troops,
ordered allied military forces to expand their attack by targeting
the Serb operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy could place NATO pilots at greater risk of attack
by Serb antiaircraft units because the jets and helicopters will be
required to fly closer to the ground to hit tanks, artillery, and
mobile command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to begin the assault, dubbed Phase Two of
Operation Allied Force, was seen as an indication that NATO leaders
are confident that the first stage of the attack crippled much of
Yugoslavia's air defense system and command and control facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In Aviano, Italy, US combat pilots, speaking to reporters for
the first time since the operation began, expressed surprise at the
minimal opposition they have encountered. ``We have not seen
anywhere near the amount of aircraft weaponry employed that we
thought we would see,'' said one Navy pilot, who was not permitted
to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed off Saturday on the second phase of the operation
after meeting at the White House with his foreign policy advisers
and speaking with British, French, and German leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Solana gave the order to the supreme allied commander, US Army
General Wesley Clark. ``I have taken this decision with the support
of all allied governments, which are determined to bring a halt to
violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian catastrophe,''
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said warplanes and cruise missiles will continue
to strike military targets throughout Yugoslavia as part of the
effort to force Milosevic to accept a peace agreement that grants
autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In massive raids Friday night and early Saturday, NATO aircraft
flew 249 sorties, and Tomahawk cruise missiles were seen soaring
across the Belgrade skyline before they detonated. Serbian state
radio reported that NATO missiles and bombs destroyed a military
barracks, a munitions dump, and a telecommunications site. New
attacks began late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the strikes began, Serbian television
also reported that nonmilitary targets were hit, including a
factory and a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts of Belgrade.
NATO officials denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic called the NATO military action the worst threat to
world peace since 1945. He issued the statement after Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin sent him a message of support and the
Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, decried the NATO siege as
``a dark chapter in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders have said their military will not enter the
conflict. But tensions remained high, as the Communist-dominated
parliament Saturday advised Yeltsin to formally cut ties with NATO.
Also, angry Russians protested in Moscow for a third day to express
solidarity with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds also demonstrated outside embassies in Berlin, Rome,
Athens, Vienna, and London. Some protesters clashed with police.
Others hurled objects at the embassies of NATO nations. And some
burned US flags and shouted anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement over the NATO mission also festered among US
political leaders. Delivering the Republican weekly radio address,
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri said the Clinton administration
had yet to articulate a clear plan for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty obligates us to demand a clearly focused mission for
our soldiers,'' Ashcroft said. ``They deserve the complete
commitment of every American they serve and the certain leadership
of the commander-in-chief they obey.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his radio speech, said maintaining peace in Europe
is a vital US interest. ``Through two World Wars and a long Cold
War, we saw that it was a short step from a small brushfire to an
inferno, especially in the tinderbox of the Balkans.''

SERBS' `ETHNIC CLEANSING' CALLED MORE AGGRESSIVE IN KOSOVO THAN IN
BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: this has been added to Page 1 of The New York Times)  
 (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The brutality against ethnic Albanian civilians by
Serb forces represents a ``broad-based ethnic cleansing campaign
across Kosovo'' that is far swifter and more sweeping than similar
efforts by Serbian forces during the war in Bosnia, a senior
Clinton administration official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had been caught off-guard by the scale of the
operations being carried out in Kosovo by Serbian security police,
the Yugoslav army and paramilitaries, the official said. Although
prepared for a large-scale military effort by the Serbs against the
ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
administration was not anticipating sweeping operations against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal and evil nature is shocking,'' he said. ``Even for
hardened people, it's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration now knew of summary executions of men, and
the forced eviction of thousands of women, children and elderly men
by bus into northern Albania late Saturday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the military sweeping across, fighting the Kosovo
Liberation Army and then burning shops and villages,'' the official
said. ``There is a great human tragedy unfolding. I don't want to
tell you all of Kosovo is aflame, but bad stuff is going on, and a
lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, was awash Saturday night in
leaflets apparently distributed by the Serbian authorities
encouraging ethnic Albanians to leave Kosovo via Macedonia, the
official said. Yugoslav army tanks have been patrolling the streets
of Pristina for the last several days in an attempt to intimidate
the urban population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was still short of hard evidence because
foreign monitors left Kosovo last weekend, Western journalists were
forced out and telephone lines have been cut. The official insisted
that cloud cover over Kosovo in the last few days had stymied
efforts to get clear satellite and other aerial images of the
humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But enough anecdotal evidence had been gathered from all over
Kosovo _ a hilly, mostly rural area about the size of Connecticut _
to convince administration officials of the scale of Milosevic's
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the official cited landmark incidents in
the Bosnian war _ the massacre at Srebrenica and the use of
concentration camps for Muslim men of fighting age _ and said that
what was happening now in Kosovo was broader and faster-paced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By quickening the pace tonight of the air campaign against
Milosevic, the administration was ``doing everything we can'' to
try and curb the effects of what he described as Milosevic's
``brutal rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials ordered the air campaign to begin when
Milosevic refused to sign a peace deal and then stepped up his
campaign of violence against Kosovo's Albanians. The administration
had ``no choice,'' even though it turned out that it encouraged
Milosevic to further accelerate the brutality, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader would have tried to accomplish the same
ethnic cleansing even without the NATO attacks, the official said.
``It would have happened slower with no penalties for him,'' the
official said, who added that the conflict between NATO and
Milosevic was now developing into ``an awful test of wills.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers and officials of the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe, who have been trying to
collect evidence of the past few days atrocities, described a mass
execution near Velika Krusa, just north of Prizren in southern
Kosovo; the burning of large sections of Pec, a major town west of
Pristina; and the use of civilians as ``human shields'' in an
attempt to deter NATO attacks on Serbian military installations.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous accounts of men missing, of whole villages
burned and homes torched. About 20,000 refugees who had huddled on
the Kosovo side of the border were now being bused into northern
Albania, administration officials said. Military-aged men were
noticeably missing in the retinue, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of about 35 men, women and children were found around
Velika Krusa on Saturday, according to a military official with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This official
said he had been told by a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army
in Kosovo, who spoke by satellite phone, that the bodies were found
shot and mutilated near a rail line. Thirteen other bodies of two
families were found nearby and the bodies of two elderly men burned
in their homes were also found, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla commander had also described seeing many other
bodies, maybe as many as several hundred, in the area but his men
had been unable to approach them because of fighting between Serbs
and the guerillas in the area, this official recounted.
</P>
<P>
   This official, a key liaison between the OSCE and the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas, said he was confident that the information he
received Saturday from the local guerrilla commander was credible.
This was in part because he had been able to double check it with
other sources in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   According to several accounts, a large swath of Pec, a pretty
town with well established residential areas, was on fire Saturday
night. An ethnic Albanian living in Washington, who asked not to be
identified, said he spoke tonight to a relative in Pec who
described seeing burning houses from his window and hearing steady
shelling from the direction of Serb military positions. The
relative said that he saw about 200 civilian men being marched down
the main road of the city to an unknown destination. The men were
flanked by Serbian policemen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Saturday by the human rights office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said repeated
reports were being received of ethnic Albanians being detained as
``human shields.'' The organization said that the reports could not
be verified but appeared credible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of the agency's statement said: ``The reports that Albanian
civilians are being detained as ``human shields'' _ i.e., placed
strategically at military or other installations in an effort to
deter NATO bombing _ remain persistent but so far are proving
impossible to verify. In the past 24 hours further reporting of the
large-scale round-up of up to 20,000 people at Cirez (still
unconfirmed) describes this as a `human shield' operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials working for the organization, which is
based in Vienna, said they had rarely encountered such frustrations
in trying to determine developments on the ground. Telephone
contact with Kosovo was almost impossible, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One worker, who asked not to be identified, said that most often
telephones in Kosovo that used to be answered by well-known
contacts of the organization were ringing but not being answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unclear whether communications have been deliberately
disrupted, whether the individuals concerned are in hiding, or
whether something more sinister has happened to them: the general
experience when trying to contact people is that telephones appear
to be be ringing but go unanswered,'' Saturday's report said.
</P>
<P>
   A man reached by phone in Pristina on Saturday, Adem Demaci, a
prominent political activist who has campaigned for decades for
Kosovo's independence, described sitting in his apartment in the
dark Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we had about 60 shellings of restaurants and shops
in Pristina,'' Demaci said in describing a Serbian sweep through
the capital. ``The restaurants are all closed, the proprietors have
all gone away and the shops robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Demaci said that six bodies, shot and then burned, had been
found in a street of the Pristina suburb of Kosovo Polje on Friday
night. ``There have been many killings in Pristina and people are
in great fear,'' he said. The streets were virtually deserted,
DeMaci said. Only three or four bakeries were operating.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE human rights report said Saturday that many
Albanian-owned businesses had been set on fire by police,
paramilitaries or Serb civilians, creating the specter of a food
shortage. It voiced concern that civilians are also beginning to
run out of food because they cannot venture out.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign against Yugoslavia is doing what years of
abstract debate could not. It is beginning to define the role for
the NATO alliance to play in post-Cold War Europe. Four days of
bombing is not enough to resolve this issue fully. But the early
indications are that the members of the expanded alliance are
capable of a unified response to threats to Continental security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO's recent expansion to 19 members, the alliance
summoned the political unity required for decisive action to meet a
dangerous military crisis less than 100 miles from the borders of
NATO Europe. It acted with U.S. military leadership but with broad
combat participation from European members.
</P>
<P>
   In line with this unity, most NATO members have contributed in
some way. Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and six other
countries in Europe have sent pilots to raid Yugoslav targets.
Others have provided air bases.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been uneven spots in the European
support. Italy, despite its military cooperation, and Greece have
voiced some reservations. But the larger pattern has been that of
NATO giving unanimous political approval to the operation. It was a
demonstration of the kind of policy coordination that some of the
same countries have not been able to summon over non-European
issues like Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planes, ships and missiles have been the largest single
component in the attacks. But NATO's European members have shown an
encouraging new assertiveness that makes it reasonable to imagine
Europe at last taking on broader responsibility for security
issues. Despite the historical sympathies several governments have
felt for Serbia, most have been able to recognize that they have an
interest in Balkan security and in halting the Serbian atrocities
that have driven Kosovo Albanians to seek refuge in other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking change has taken place in Germany, which for
decades after World War II understandably and correctly shunned any
military activism beyond German frontiers. But Germans have now
spent more than half a century proving to themselves and their
neighbors that they have become responsible and conscientious
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Today's German leadership, including German military commanders
and the new socialist-led government of Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder grew up after the war, and Germany is now ready to take
its proper place as one of NATO's leading members. European NATO
members cannot assume as much responsibility as they should for
Continental security without a strong and confident German
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   One note of caution must be sounded even as the U.S.-led air
strikes go forward. In regard to NATO's future, this operation must
be regarded as a deliberate, real-time testing of principles and
methods, rather than as a tactical model for all future crises. The
very fluidity of the situation in Yugoslavia supports the point.
NATO will face more difficulties this week. Slobodan Milosevic not
only continues to resist the international peace plan, but he seems
intent on intensifying his violence against the people of Kosovo
with paramilitary troops that cannot easily be stopped by air
power.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance can preserve the unity and resolve it showed
last week, it should be able to pick apart and pressure Milosevic's
forces over time, and ultimately prevail.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IS IT TIME FOR RON PERELMAN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a company gets attention it would just as soon pass
up. Last week Revlon Inc., the cosmetics company controlled by
Ronald Perelman, got a double dose. Rumors of an impending takeover
put the company at the top of the business section just as the
generosity of its president, George Fellows, put it on the front
page.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows provided transportation so that Howard Safir, the New
York City police commissioner, could attend the Academy Awards.
Company spokesmen firmly denied any impropriety in the police
furor, but Perelman, who has controlled Revlon since 1985, was
silent on the takeover rumors that sent the company's stock
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   If he does sell Revlon, Perelman would make a good profit, but
the gain would be nowhere near as great as it would have been had
Revlon been sold a year ago, before its stock fell sharply amid
excess inventories and talk that the company needed new products.
</P>
<P>
   Both pieces of publicity had unpleasant sides for Perelman, who
declined to be interviewed. The Safir trip reminded people of the
tycoon's willingness to do favors for the powerful, as in the offer
of a job to Monica Lewinsky before she became famous. And the
Revlon rumors focused attention on the problems of Revlon and other
companies in Perelman's corporate stable.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems have been growing for a couple of years. They
have not led to Perelman's eviction from the billionaires' club,
but they have damaged the wealth of those who invested in his
companies, and they have raised the issue of whether his reputation
for brilliance may have been overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon seemed to be on a run a few years ago, with its Colorstay
makeup being touted as age-defying and growing Asian sales. But
then competitors brought out their own new products, Asian markets
trembled and Revlon announced layoffs. Suddenly, investors started
focusing on the $1.7 billion in long-term debt on the company's
books and the stock price fell as low as $12, half the price at the
company's 1986 initial public offering. Now it is back above $22,
thanks to the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Revlon's performance is typical. Each of the four
companies that Perelman has taken public in the 1990s has been a
loser for investors who bought at the offering and held on. An
investment of $4,000, spread evenly among the four, would now be
worth about $2,600. That is not good during a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation seems unfair to Howard Gittis, Perelman's top
aide. ``If you buy when he does, and come out when he does, you do
fine,'' he says. That is true, and is shown by the performance of
such companies as New World Communications, the broadcaster that
was sold to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in 1997. Investors who
bought the stock at the same time as Perelman did very well. It is
those who bought stock when Perelman's companies went public who
have done poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In the case of Coleman Co., the camping-equipment maker,
Perelman got hoodwinked. He agreed to sell the company for more
than $30 a share to Sunbeam, then run by Albert ``Chainsaw Al''
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the payment was to be in Sunbeam stock,
which cratered amid questions about the company's accounting that
led to Dunlap's ouster. Coleman shares are now worth less than they
sold for in the 1991 offering. ``It's hard to protect yourself
against false financial statements,'' said Gittis.
</P>
<P>
   At Consolidated Cigars, the biggest cigar company in the nation
and the maker of such brands as El Producto and Muriel, Perelman
rode the cigar boom up and then back down. In 1996, investors were
sold stock at $23 a share, more than 14 times what Perelman had
paid. A few months ago the entire company was sold to a French
tobacco company, for $17.85 a share. Perelman made a big profit,
while public investors lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Marvel Entertainment, the comic-book company that
diversified into sports trading cards under Perelman's tutelage.
Both businesses soared as adults became active collectors, but
overleveraged Marvel went broke after the fads ended. An investor
who bought stock when Marvel went public in 1991, and held on, now
has some odd pieces of paper that give him or her the right to buy
securities in the successor company to Marvel. A $1,000 investment
is worth about $2.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no takeover of Revlon without Perelman's approval.
If he sells now, he will get plenty of money. But if he holds on,
he has a chance to revive both the company's fortunes and his own
reputation as a businessman and investor.

EDITORIAL: GENDER BIAS ON THE CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of University Professors last month
reported that the gap in salaries between male and female faculty
members of the same rank actually worsened from 1975 to 1998, even
though the proportion of women teaching at universities and
colleges grew over that period. Women are moving into academia in
greater numbers, but they seem to be less valued and more likely to
be relegated to lesser-paying jobs in lower-ranking institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the salary differences can be explained by seniority,
academic disciplines and lifestyle choices among women encumbered
with family responsibilities. But even allowing for those factors,
subtle patterns of gender bias continue to play a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   Hard evidence of this phenomenon is found in a new report on
women on the science faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which boasts one of the most prestigious faculties in
the world. Women on other campuses and in other professions have
called attention to gender bias and the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But the MIT study is unusual because it examines tenured women
who have excelled in the male-dominated sciences, and whose
collective experiences with bias cannot be explained away by
special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   When the study began in 1994 in response to discrimination
concerns, there were only 15 tenured women compared with 194 men on
the science faculty, a ratio that has shown little improvement in
recent years. Detailed data collected by a special committee found
gender disparities in distribution of research grants, laboratory
space, awards, appointments to faculty committees and teaching
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that old-fashioned assumptions and
gender stereotyping worked to marginalize the women, undervalue
their achievements and exclude them from positions of power, even
when there seemed to be no ill intentions. No woman has ever served
as head or associate head of a science department at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   More powerful than the statistical data are the perceptions of
the women interviewed. These gifted scientists believed early on
that the problem of gender discrimination had been solved in
previous decades. They believed rewards would be based solely on
merit, without reference to gender.
</P>
<P>
   Only gradually did they realize that the playing field was not
level, and that slight disadvantages accumulated over time had
created great differences between their careers and those of their
male colleagues. The report grimly notes that this pattern seems to
repeat itself over generations.
</P>
<P>
   MIT is certainly not alone in this problem. But it has
confronted this reality boldly and is taking steps to correct the
inequities and improve hiring practices. Beyond that, the study has
significant social value because it documents with unusual clarity
how pervasive and destructive discrimination can be even when there
is no blatant harassment or intimidation.

VLADIMIR PETROV, 83, SOVIET PRISON CAMP SURVIVOR AND PROFESSOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Germany, Italy, Conn., Md., Va., Mass., Calif.,
Minn.)   By CARMEL McCOUBREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vladimir Petrov, who survived six years in a Soviet prison camp
and later became a professor of international affairs at George
Washington University, died on March 17 in his home in Kensington,
Md., a suburb of Washington. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his death was brain cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrov recounted his experiences in the camp and in World War II
in two memoirs, ``Soviet Gold'' (1949) and ``My Retreat From
Russia'' (1950), that were praised as brisk adventure stories as
well as important early sources of information about the Soviet
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1915 in what is now Krasnodar, Russia, he was a
19-year-old engineering student in Leningrad when he was arrested
and accused of espionage, which he dismissed in his books as having
been concocted by a woman in the secret police whose advances he
had spurned.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to a labor camp in northeastern Siberia, in the
Kolyma River gold basin, traveling for 47 days in a sealed train
car with 60 other men. There were 500,000 inmates, and one year, he
said, as many as 70,000 died. Conditions were so bad, he wrote,
that ``few political prisoners ever live out their terms.''
</P>
<P>
   He was released in 1941, just before the Nazi invasion, and
bribed and finagled his way back to Krasnodar. Petrov's antipathy
for the Soviet system led him, as the war went on, to join a
German-sponsored movement to recruit a Russian force for a
last-ditch stand against the now-advancing Communists. As the Nazis
retreated, so did he.
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to Austria, where he was imprisoned briefly in a
Nazi camp. He escaped after a week, writing that after his
experiences in Soviet incarceration, ``it was as easy as breaking
out of kindergarten.'' Then he fled to American-occupied Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he moved to the United States, and spent much of the
next two decades teaching Slavic languages at Yale. In 1965 he
received a doctorate in political science from Yale and joined the
Institute for Sino-Soviet Affairs at George Washington University.
He became professor emeritus in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Petrov's marriage to Mirtala Kardinalowska ended in divorce. He
is survived by his wife, Jean; a son from his first marriage,
George, of Minneapolis; five daughters from his second marriage _
Susanna Petrov of Boston, Lili Robins of Stafford, Va., Anne Petrov
of Paris, Jane Petrov-Aronsohn of Washington and Carol Petrov of
Kensington; three sons also from his second marriage _ Vladimir of
Los Angeles, Alexander of Rockville, Md., and Andrew, of
Kensington, and six grandchildren.

FLEEING REFUGEES RECOUNT HORROR THEY LEFT BEHIND

<P>
   ROJZAYE, Yugoslavia _ Beaten and terrified, ethnic Albanians
fleeing across the border to Montenegro on Saturday described a
systematic campaign of terror by Serbian forces in Kosovo,
including executions, looting, random machine-gun fire in the
streets, and all-night grenade attacks on Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Muslims reaching here said they had packed into
cars and fled for their lives from the city of Pec, the ancient
seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the most coveted city in
Kosovo for Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Their accounts indicated that the Serbs' ``ethnic-cleansing''
campaign has taken on a chilling ferocity as the fourth straight
night of NATO bombing continued to pound the Serbian forces of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A bruised and shaken couple, Fatima and Redjeb Djanbaya, arrived
in Rojzaye just two hours after being forced from their home and
driving through the smoldering ruins of their hometown of Pec.
Redjeb, a businessman, sat in the red Opal they used to escape,
beaten, frightened and unable to speak. His wife said four Serbian
paramilitary in green fatigues had opened fire on their home in the
center of Pec at noon and shattered the front windows before
bursting in.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was told they were going to die. The paramilitaries
stripped off Fatima's rings, bracelet, and necklace, forced Redjeb
to drink whiskey _ a sin for Muslims, clubbed him with a rifle
butt, and then, inexplicably, allowed them to flee _ Fatima with no
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 miles to the southeast, an ethnic Albanian who gave his
name only as Remzi crossed the border from Kosovo at Blace,
Macedonia, after making the most harrowing journey of his life. He
pulled the maroon Volkswagen Passat carrying his wife and three
children to the roadside and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catastrophe,'' he said, over and over. Over his shoulder, less
than a mile away, several homes in an Albanian village were ablaze,
the orange flames leaping in the fading light of dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Remzi, who refused to give his last name, saying he feared for
relatives he left behind, was one of hundreds who crossed the
border into Macedonia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the refugees spilling out of Kosovo, Remzi is a
man of substance. He said he paid Serb paramilitary police
``thousands of deutsche marks'' at four separate checkpoints to
make it the 60 or so miles from his home to the border.
</P>
<P>
   He had watched from a distance, he said, as his lawyer, Bajram
Kelmendi, and Kelmendi's two sons were summarily executed by Serb
police three days ago. On Saturday, human rights groups reported
that the body of Kelmendi, a prominent civil rights lawyer, had
been dumped outside Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. ``They threw
their bodies on the side of the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Remzi's story and those like it were cited Saturday by officials
from NATO countries as reason why the attacks against Serb forces
operating in Kosovo needed to be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages, separating men and boys
from their families and shooting them in cold blood,'' George
Robertson, the British defense secretary, said at a news conference
in London. In Washington, officials said there was increasing
evidence that the Serbs were summarily executing ethnic Albanians,
apparently in retaliation for the NATO airstrikes and because there
was no international presence in Kosovo to deter or document the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Corroborating reports of atrocities remained difficult because
international observers and news organizations have been expelled
from Kosovo or left for their own safety. But after previous
massacres by Serb forces, few international observers doubt their
willingness to perpetrate such acts.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando del Mundo, a spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said his organization has not been able
to confirm reports of mass executions. He also said his
organization had heard, but had not been able to confirm, widely
reported allegations that up to 20,000 refugees were being forced
to march through central Kosovo by Serb troops. Del Mundo was
skeptical of the report, saying the alleged area was not heavily
populated.
</P>
<P>
   The details recounted by the refugees from Pec and elsewhere,
however, had a consistency that lent them a terrifying ring of
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima Djanbaya remembered that one of the men who burst through
her door barked, ``We've come to kill you. We have orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs held a pistol to Redjeb's head and forced him to sit
at the kitchen table, she said. They ordered Fatima to lie face
down on the floor, then opened a bottle of whiskey they were
carrying and ordered Redjeb to drink, a calculated insult to his
Islamic faith. Then they smashed the side of his jaw with the butt
of a rifle and beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The Djanbayas begged for their lives and offered the Serbs
anything they wanted to spare them, she said. The paramilitaries
then stripped her of her jewelry, including her wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo belongs to Serbs, you should all leave. Or you will
die,'' the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima ran out in her stocking feet, and Redjeb, nearly
unconscious, stumbled out behind her. They made it to their car and
drove as fast as they could, passing the smoking ruins of ethnic
Albanian neighborhoods of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the city was burning,'' she said. ``We saw as we
drove, and we cried. I still cannot believe I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never see our home again. We left everything,'' she
said, describing the ordeal in a relative's home in Rojzaye.
</P>
<P>
   This Montenegrin town is set in the rugged canyons of the
Morache River valley, where some 4,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
have arrived since last summer. Legions more have massed across the
border in recent weeks but have been turned back by Yugoslav border
patrols and Montenegrin police. Only those with money to bribe
border guards have been able to cross. Most end up fleeing instead
to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But those who managed to make it here in recent weeks gave
chilling accounts of events in Pec as the buildup to the NATO
attack ignited attacks against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   One large family, named Delajaj, found itself pulled apart by
the war. On Saturday, 16 family members, including 11 children,
packed into two compact cars, a Volkswagen Golf and a Honda Accord,
and fled, leaving others behind.
</P>
<P>
   Merita Delajaj, 22, said they decided to escape after a long
night during which Serbian paramilitaries surrounded the extended
family's cluster of homes. In Saturday's pre-dawn darkness, machine
gun fire shattered the windows of a house that faced the road,
where five male relatives, including her husband, were staying to
protect it from looters. She said she and 10 female relatives,
along with 15 children, huddled in the corner of another house as
the machine-gun fire rattled outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very afraid. We just tried to cover the children, and
pray we wouldn't be killed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When NATO started the bombing, the Serbs attacked us very
hard. They came house to house and are pushing the Albanians out.
They are killing those who stay behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When they fled Saturday morning, with only two cars and limited
amounts of money to bribe the border guards, heart-wrenching
decisions had to be made. Parents had to choose which children to
send across the border, and which to keep behind. Merita left with
her two children, but her husband stayed behind. ``We just came
with the clothes we had. We took nothing. We ran to save the
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point she was overwhelmed and sobbed uncontrollably. She
left the room as her two children, a 3-year old boy and a
6-year-old girl, looked on. When she came back, she said, ``It is
my husband. I don't know if he is alive or dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone connections to Kosovo have been badly disrupted, so
families spend hours dialing over and over the numbers of their
homes. Some described the ominous experience of hearing Serbian
voices answer.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear just how many have fled, but some refugees said at
least half of the 100,000 ethnic Albanians living in and around Pec
had fled.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodletting has pitted neighbor against neighbor. ``These
were our friends, our neighbors,'' said Adel Radonchic, as she and
her husband described the Serbian paramilitary troops, some of whom
they have known all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't blame them for this. We blame Milosevic. He is the
only one who can be blamed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before nightfall, 73-year-old Darnoli Abdula walked through
the border checkpoint. He said he had walked for two hours from his
village, Gajre, after Serb troops forced him to leave at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army burned my house,'' he said. ``The whole time I walk
here, I see nobody. I just see fire. All the houses on fire.''

HILDEGARD ELIZABETH PEPLAU, 89, DEVELOPED PSYCHIATRIC NURSING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Vt. )   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a
major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and
mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman
Oaks, Calif. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Peplau wrote a seminal text, ``Interpersonal Relations in
Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic
Nursing,'' which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It
was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an
interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing
education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in
elevating nursing to a profession.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues regarded Peplau as the ``mother of psychiatric
nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio
State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American
Academy of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the general acceptance of Peplau's interpersonal
process, Sills added, ``It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life
and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since
Florence Nightingale.''
</P>
<P>
   Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because
it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author.
Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Peplau was born in Reading, Pa. As a child she witnessed the
deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding
of the impact of illness and death on families.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931
and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse
Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's
degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in
education in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   She studied psychology for a certificate from the William
Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to
adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.
</P>
<P>
   Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at
Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at
Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a
professor emeritus in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications.
She was also executive director and president of the American
Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last
year, and was a board member of the International Council of
Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane
Reimann Prize, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of
Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of
Reading.

U.N. PANEL URGES NEW INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The 20-member panel reviewing Iraq's
disarmament record has concluded that because of Iraq's
unwillingness to reveal information, the United Nations needs to
continue to monitor, inspect and investigate Iraq's weapons
programs, diplomats said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-page report is written in diplomatically opaque language
that reflects the numerous compromises among the divergent
political interests of its members. But at least three people who
have seen it said Washington and its allies consider it essentially
an endorsement of the Special Commission, whose inspections of
weapons programs have so infuriated Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of well-known, difficult circumstances,'' the report
concludes, the commission and the international nuclear monitoring
agency ``have been effective in uncovering and destroying many
elements of Iraq's proscribed weapons programs in accordance with
the mandate provided by the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel met Saturday to approve the document, a copy of which
was shown to The New York Times. The draft has been intensely
debated in secret sessions for more than a week by its panelists _
who come from the United States, Britain and other nations that
have strongly backed the special commission, and from Russia and
China, which have argued that the commission has outlived its
usefulness and that sanctions against Iraq must be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Celso Amorim, the Brazilian representative to the United
Nations, who is chairman of this panel and two others that focus on
Iraq, is expected to give the document to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and the Security Council on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends some changes in the nature and structure
of the inspectors' group and the commission that oversees the
group's activities. It recommends, for example, that the commission
meet four times a year instead of twice and that it more closely
monitor the inspectors' activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the document contends that a future inspection system, what
the document calls ``reinforced ongoing monitoring and
verification,'' must be both ``comprehensive and intrusive,'' which
Iraq has strongly resisted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Effective inspection, the report concludes, depends on ``full
and free access'' to suspect sites, and it stresses that
international inspectors must be given unimpeded access to all such
sites, including those at military facilities. ``Indeed,'' the
report states, ``the reinforced ongoing monitoring and verification
would be, if anything, more intensive than the one so far
practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that, the panel recommends that more inspectors be
hired to monitor Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people familiar with the panel's
deliberations, the Russian and Chinese representatives pressed hard
at first for the report to conclude that Iraq had answered the most
important questions about its past weapons program, and that
therefore there were no ``disarmament issues'' that required
continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the report concludes the opposite. In virtually every major
weapons category, there are still outstanding ``disarmament
issues'' that merit further investigation, the document states,
particularly in Iraq's reporting on its biological weapons program,
where ``critical gaps'' remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq possesses the capability and knowledge base thorough
which biological warfare agents could be produced quickly and in
volume,'' the report warns.

 &HT;    New faces in women's final
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ For a Final Four that has been missing a lot
of familiar names, tonight's national championship game featuring
Duke and Purdue offers plenty of interesting subplots.
</P>
<P>
   There are the two Duke seniors, guard Nicole Erickson and center
Michele VanGorp, going up against their old school, which they left
after a former coach was dismissed in the wake of recruiting
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's current Purdue coach Carolyn Peck, who is coaching
her last collegiate game before moving on to a job in the WNBA this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   And most importantly, the winner will become a national champion
for the first time, a feat that deserves notice in a sport that in
the '90s has been dominated by Tennessee and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone new is going to win the national championship,'' Duke
coach Gail Goestenkors said. ``The sport is ready for a new
national champion. How could it get any more exciting than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Purdue (33-1), which has won 31 consecutive games,
has been installed as a slight favorite to become the first Big 10
women's team to win a national crown, and that's just fine with
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is all on Purdue,'' VanGorp said. ``They're the
ones who have been ranked No. 1, who have to uphold their standing.
We're the underdogs and we're trying to come in and topple the big
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Boilermakers, who have upset Tennessee this season, have
succeeded because they don't overlook any foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record doesn't matter at this point,'' Peck said. ``We've
got to go out and play the game for 40 minutes, maybe 40-plus
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (28-6), which beat Georgia 81-69 in the national semifinals
on Friday, is finishing the season where it started. After an
embarrassing 104-74 loss to UConn in San Jose in November, the Blue
Devils overcame a rash of preseason injuries to reel off 16
consecutive wins, capture the regular-season ACC title and upset
Tennessee in the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a national championship on our minds,'' Erickson said.
``I think having the seniors we have on our team and the
competition we've faced all year has really prepared us for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be the last for Purdue's dynamic senior guard duo
of Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs, who stuck around when
then-coach Lin Dunn was fired in 1996. Despite several transfers,
the Boilermakers are enjoying the greatest season ever by a women's
Big 10 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad they decided to stay here,'' Purdue forward Katie
Douglas said of White-McCarty and Figgs, ``because I know we
wouldn't be here without them.''

CONDEMNATION MUTED IN DUMA RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One Russian lawmaker wanted to boycott US goods to
protest NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia. Another suggested moving
the United Nations from New York to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
who declared the NATO airstrikes the ``beginning of World War III''
_ and came prepared for battle in his military uniform.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the West got off surprisingly easy Saturday at an
emergency session of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of
parliament, called to discuss the situation in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In an angrily worded four-page resolution passed in a 366-4
vote, the Duma condemned NATO and declared ``solidarity with
brotherly Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more jingoistic blocs in the Duma, the Communists and
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, failed to muster the votes to
include such proposals as sending arms and troops to Yugoslavia, or
providing tax breaks for factories that send aid to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution merely asked the government to ``show respect''
to Russian citizens who wish to help ``brotherly Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively staid nature of the document was a bit of a
surprise. This was, after all, the State Duma, where anti-Western
sentiments have dominated ever since Communists and nationalists
won a majority in the 450-seat body in 1995. The Duma has never
been shy about issuing thundering denunciations of Western policies
before, especially since the house's resolutions are merely
recommendations to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document represents a defeat'' for the Communists and the
nationalists, concluded Pavel Lapkov, a commentator for NTV
television.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the winner was the government of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who still hopes to secure a $4.8 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund and then use the IMF loan as a
bargaining chip to help persuade other lenders to restructure
Russia's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who Saturday began three days of talks with IMF
Executive Director Michel Camdessus, has made sure to temper
Russia's harsh denunciation of the US-led attacks just enough to
avoid isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, though some Duma members advocated putting Russia's
army in a higher state of combat readiness, Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told the house session that Russia would make no military
response to the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who expect Russia to act on impulse and retaliate with
similar steps (to NATO's) are mistaken,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma also voted to put off ratification of the 1993 Start II
treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons. Some lawmakers wanted to
pull out of the treaty altogther, which earned the Duma a stern
admonition from Russia's defense minister, Igor Sergeyev. ``Do you
want to start a nuclear war or something?'' Sergeyev snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma later voted to return to Start II after the NATO
airstrikes are over.
</P>
<P>
   To hear some members of the Duma speak, the airstrikes might as
well have been aimed at Russia. This was especially true of leading
Communists, who blame Russia's inability to deter NATO from bombing
on the pro-Western foreign policy pursued by President Boris N.
Yeltsin for much of his eight years in office. ``I am convinced
that the tragic situation in Yugoslavia and in Russia . . . stems
from the president,'' said senior Communist lawmaker Viktor
Ilyukhin.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the Duma was echoed on the street. For the third
day, demonstrators protested in front of the US Embassy, shouting
anti-American chants and carrying posters bearing often obscene
slogans, many with references to President Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters were prevented by hundreds of riot police
from adding to the large splotches of ink that gave the embassy's
facade the appearance of a huge Jackson Pollock painting.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one in Russia supports NATO's action. Three Russian
politicians known for their prominent roles in the country's market
reform efforts, Yegor Gaidar, Boris Fyodorov, and Boris Nemtsov,
have joined in the Russian condemnation of the attacks. The three
plan to travel to Belgrade on Sunday to meet with Serb leaders,
then head to the United States and other NATO countries, to try to
work out a peaceful solution to the conflict, Russian news agencies
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Duma addressed NATO's argument that the bombings
are aimed at weakening the military ability of Yugoslavia's
President Slobodan Milosevic to crack down on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Only one legislator, Konstantin Borovoi, tried to say anything
about that, but the Duma voted not to let him have the floor. ``I'm
also against NATO because they're not bombing Milosevic hard
enough,'' Borovoi quipped later.

LUCIENNE BLOCH, 90, MURALIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Mexico, France, The Netherlands, Ohio, Calif.,
Mich, Colo., Wash. )   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant
contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious
photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in
Gualala, Calif. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy
lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great
Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed
depiction of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed
vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was
going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the
fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by
his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller
Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to
paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ``Man at the Crossroads,'' in the
great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center
capstone now known as the GE Building and at the time an especially
potent symbol of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on
portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to
substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to
take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there
be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their
property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the
Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not
reckoned on Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an
unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.
</P>
<P>
   A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst
Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United
States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925,
when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory
of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted
by mistresses, took her children to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the
Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass
sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and
was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art.
Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a
banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show
at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little
English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch,
who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to
the great man.
</P>
<P>
   During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up
behind Miss Bloch and said, ``I hate you,'' a comment of such
disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was
Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's
philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it
happened, from Miss Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear,
she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that
laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's
controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the
Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the
artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian
immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in
her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as
the basis for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Walking arm in arm into a White Castle to buy hamburgers and
kissing openly on the street in front of passers-by, Miss Bloch
wrote, forever infused the very streets of their courtship with
special meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he
handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the
country, including her most acclaimed work, ``The Evolution of
Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union
organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other
publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif.,
where Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the
couple retired to Gualala in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging
sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of
photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled
for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the
artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her
photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst
Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo;
a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith
of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only
herself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired
photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her
blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Dimitroff and
Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the
scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation,
the mural was shrouded from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it
was scraped into oblivion _ almost.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is
only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was _ on a
Rockefeller wall.

FREEWAY INTERCHANGE MISSING TWO IMPORTANT LEGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of L.A. drivers pay every day for a
mistake the state transportation agency made 32 years ago _ the
failure to connect the 5 and 134 freeways in all four directions.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that motorists traveling between two of
California's busiest freeways must detour onto streets in
neighboring Burbank, causing bottlenecks and bedlam for motorists
and neighbors alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of Los Angeles freeway construction, engineers
predicted Burbank and nearby Glendale would never grow large enough
or generate enough traffic to justify the cost of building ramps
from the 5 south to the 134 west and from the 134 east to the 5
north.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since the interchange opened in 1967, pass-through traffic grew
109 percent to an average of 441,000 cars and trucks a day _ making
it the 16th busiest freeway connection in the state. And Burbank
and Glendale are hubs of the entertainment industry, home to major
studios and drawing in thousands of new commuters a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major freeway interchange that's missing two important
legs. It seems obvious that it would be done,'' said Burbank City
Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom.
</P>
<P>
   This detour junction was built for $8.2 million in 1967. Adding
connectors would cost an estimated $80 million _ a fraction of the
$400 million to correct the bottleneck at the 101-405 freeway
interchange a few miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the state Department of Transportation stopped
building incomplete junctions, the top transport agency official in
Los Angeles says there are no plans to add ramps to the 5-134
interchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have it on our priorities list,'' said Bob Sassaman,
acting director for the agency's District 7.
</P>
<P>
   The transport agency wants to focus on such projects as building
car-pool lanes, the 710 Freeway extension to Pasadena, north of
L.A., and adding sound walls, Sassaman said. ``The missing moves
are not as important to us. There are a lot more projects people
want us to do first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorists may think the incomplete interchange is
ridiculous, but in the 1950s and 1960s the design likely made
sense, Sassaman said. Planners assumed drivers on the 5 south could
take the 170 Freeway south to the 134 Freeway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They likely anticipated that this was a minor move and
wouldn't be needed. When it was done I'm sure it made sense,''
Sassaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to budge the state agency, the city of Burbank, Los
Angeles and Glendale have joined in a $50,000 study they hope will
prove the need for ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy. It's incomprehensible to me how they could build
that intercharge the way they did,'' said Frank Barneburg, chairman
of the Burbank Transportation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The study has won support from key politicians and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   David Fleming, a prominent civic leader in L.A's San Fernando
Valley and vice chairman for the California Transportation
Commission, said he never uses the freeway when he travels into
Burbank because he does not want to have to get off and then back
on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously people expect a freeway interchange to go in all
directions. Now you're stuck with half a system,'' he said.
Although the project may be daunting and expensive, Fleming said
Burbank should push forward.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Burbank, said he will push
the agency to reconsider building ramps, if even just for equity
between Los Angeles and other areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Los Angeles has gotten the short end of the stick. You
look at the Bay Area and you can see where the money has gone,''
Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have soundwalls on their freeways to protect cows from
hearing too much noise. Then you have people in Toluca Lake (in the
San Fernando Valley) who have been waiting for years for
soundwalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum also is mounting in the Burbank and Glendale business
communities for construction of the ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a benefit to all the businesses located in
this part of Burbank,'' said Dan Millman, general manager of the
Media City Center, located off the Olive Avenue exit of the 5.
``The current route is cumbersome at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Millman said the detour is confusing to his shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large number of people who call us every day asking
for directions. They get lost and they want to know exactly what
streets to take to get here. I think there's many people who use
routes through the city rather than getting on the freeway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would absolutely take traffic off of Alameda Street and
Riverside Drive,'' Ovrom said. ``We have a big investment in the
Media City Mall, and I think it would increase people's willingness
to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Green, a spokesman for Disney, said the company contributed
to the cost of doing the study as part of its involvement in a
transporation coalition with the other studios and the cities of
Burbank, Glendale and Los Angeles.

   Green said company officials have not yet decided whether they
support contruction of the new ramps, but agreed to help the cities
in their effort to see if adding the missing ramps back was a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the other studios see ourselves as a member of the
local community. It's appropriate for us to have a study that may
have an impact on improving traffic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the transport agency's engineer who led the design of the
134-5 interchange some 40 years ago believes the connectors must be
built because of population growth in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed. All of these freeways are carrying much
more traffic than what they were designed for,'' said Jess
Reynolds, who supervised a design team on several interchange
projects in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. ``This would be the time to

it can be done.''

   The interchange borders Burbank and Los Angeles, which has
thrown in its support for the connectors as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a freeway to freeway interchange it should
provide for all moves,'' said Robert Takasaki, a senior
transportation engineer for the Los Angeles Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's study so far indicates the new connections at a cost
of $80 million are possible but difficult to build.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Yamarone, principal traffic engineer for Burbank, said
engineers and consultants expect preliminarily to recommend against
building the ramps because of the great cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of traffic that would be using it just didn't
justify the impact and the cost,'' Yamarone said.
</P>
<P>
   If the next phase of the study shows that city streets are being
flooded by freeway traffic, Yamarone said he thinks city staff
would change its recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely would revive the ramp idea,'' Yamarone said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Burbank City Council has been pushing for the
connectors for more than a decade and has lined up political
support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that recommendation will be well-received. One
of the purposes of the study was to get Caltrans (the state
transport agency) to agree not to hold us to current standards,''
Burbank Councilman Ted McConkey said. ``I don't think we're going
to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamarone said part of the problem is that the agency has strict
standards for how new ramps could be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to have much broader ramps than the ones we were
trying to make work,'' Yamarone said. ``We knew we'd never be able
to get an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the city believes that to build the connectors, only a
group of horse stables would have to be taken. But pieces of
Griffith Park and the Los Angeles River also could be affected,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the interchange's construction in the 1960s, the effect
on Griffith Park was among the reasons the transport agency chose
not to build the connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said a connector from the 134 east to the 5 north would
have meant taking an even bigger chunk of Griffith Park away than
was stripped away just to build the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt it could be handled by the city streets,'' Reynolds
said, who retired from the agency in 1972. ``We didn't anticipate
that movement would have that much traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Reynolds said he and the designers were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to build the connectors is a result of several
critical errors in judgment: First, engineers relied largely on
projections about future land use and development growth.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions, from the Los Angeles County Regional Planning
Department, did not contemplate the tremendous growth in the San
Fernando Valley in the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Burbank and Glendale rose from 234,559 in 1967
to 301,608 today, according county figures.
</P>
<P>
   And those statistics don't count the thousands of people drawn
to the two cities each day for work in the movie and television
studios. Jobs in Burbank alone grew from 75,000 in 1970 to 105,000.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters more urgent, in studies done for studio expansion
projects traffic engineers have found the 5 and 134 freeways have
reached overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Stan Freitag, a set builder who travels the surface
street link between the 5 south and the 134 west.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through this way every day for the last nine years.
I don't understand the logic. All of a sudden you're dealing with
people crossing the street and stopping at stoplights,'' Freitag
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to save money played a part in the interchange's
deficient design.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the transport agency was building for the future,
there was pressure to save money, so the designers were encouraged
to eliminate any links that they didn't think would be heavily
used, Reynolds said.

NEW RULE ON LEAD DRAWS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning June 1, the federal government will require
contractors and others involved with renovation of painted surfaces
in pre-1978 residential buildings to notify both occupants and
owners of the hazards of lead-based paint.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, which critics say will impose burdensome and
impractical requirements on owners and co-op boards, has been
mandated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in its
``Pre-Renovation Lead Information Rule,'' which was issued on June
1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The rule attracted a modest amount of attention when first
proposed in 1994, with about 30 official ``comments'' submitted by
trade organizations and advocacy groups nationwide. But lawyers for
co-ops and condominiums and representatives of multifamily property
owners now say that compliance will be difficult in many situations
and virtually impossible in others.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Eckerson, a lawyer for the EPA, said that the agency was
aware of the difficulties in complying with the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vagaries of different areas of the country can make what
seems to be a pretty straightforward rule end up looking pretty
complicated,'' he said. ``And we are going to have to come out with
some specific guidance for specific situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eckerson said, the agency intends to issue written
clarifications on the new rule with the next six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more vocal critics of the regulation is Dan
Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement
Program, a Manhattan-based trade association of apartment building
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an insane requirement,'' he said. ``It is
inconceivable that this rule can be complied with in the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulation, Margulies explained, whenever a
contractor expects to disturb more than two square feet of painted
surface in a house or apartment _ for example, by sanding, scraping
or otherwise preparing a painted surface for repair _ the
contractor must provide information about lead-based paint hazards
to the owner and occupants of the premises. If the work is in a
common area of a multiple dwelling, he said, the contractor must
provide lead-hazard notices to the property owner and, it seems, to
occupants of all apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think about how many times this notice requirement would
be triggered in a 100-unit building,'' Margulies said. ``Every
paint-patching episode, every ceiling-leak repair would require a
new notice.''
</P>
<P>
   And the notice requirements themselves, he said, are daunting.
For example, Margulies said, for a covered repair in a common area
the contractor must inform the property owner and building
residents about the nature and extent of the proposed renovations,
including start and end dates for the work to be performed. And the
contractor must also make the EPA's official lead-hazard pamphlet,
``Protect Your Family From Lead In Your Home,'' available at a
central location in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The notification of the owner must be performed by hand
delivering a copy of the notice and obtaining an acknowledgment of
the receipt, or by mailing the notice to the owner a week prior to
the start of the work. Notification of the residents, Margulies
said, can be made by slipping the notice under the door of each
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   If the notice is made by mail or by slipping it under the door,
the contractor must prepare a certification indicating how and when
the notice has been provided. The contractor must then keep the
signed acknowledgments and certifications on file for three years
following completion of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a well-maintained building you're doing constant
maintenance,'' Margulies said. ``You'll have contractors sending
notices to tenants on a weekly basis. And then, if the scope of a
particular project changes, or the start date gets pushed back a
few days, the contractor has to start all over and send out a whole
new set of notices.''
</P>
<P>
   At very least, he said, the additional expense involved in
complying with the rule will be passed along by the contractors to
building owners. And while it may at first appear that only
contractors are required to comply with the new rule, he said, it
is likely that many property owners and co-op and condominium
boards will also have to comply with the rule as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most multiple dwellings, building employees end up doing
this kind of routine maintenance,'' he said. ``And that will make
the owner responsible for complying with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Errol Brett, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that it is
essential for boards to make sure that the law is being followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a litigious society,'' Brett said. ``And since
board members can be held accountable for the acts of others, they
have to be absolutely sure that there is strict compliance with the
new rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the penalties for violation of the rule are significant _
up to one year in prison and up to $25,000 a day in fines _ the
only way a board can truly be certain that the rule is being
followed is to assume the responsibility for following it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be safe than sorry,'' Brett said, adding that
at the very least boards should include specific language in
renovation contracts requiring the contractor to provide proof to
the board that the required notices have been provided.
</P>
<P>
   But as a practical matter, he said, boards may have an even more
compelling reason for providing the notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent a condominium in Queens with 1,100 apartments,''
Brett said. ``That means that if I have to make it possible for
every contractor the condominium hires to comply with the law, I
have to give each contractor the name and address of every unit
owner in the building. And there are a lot of companies out there
who would pay those contractors a lot of money to get those names
for their mailing lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, while co-op apartments are legally owned by
the co-op corporation individual units are frequently sublet by
shareholders. Under the new regulation, he explained, it is unclear
who should be notified and how the notification should be made.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brett said, he was not sure whether a board has the
right to provide lists of names and addresses of unit owners
without first obtaining their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that another
problem with the new rule was its ambiguity. For example, he said,
while the rule contains an exemption for minor repairs _ those that
disturb less than two square feet of painted surface _ it is
unclear what must be done when a one-square-foot repair
unexpectedly expands to three-square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, he said, is that in one place the rule requires
notification of the occupants of ``each affected unit'' when a
common area renovation is being performed, yet in another it refers
broadly to ``each unit of the multifamily housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The former wording, he said, would seem to make it necessary to
notify only those on, say, a floor where a particular renovation is
being made. The latter phraseology, on the other hand, implies that
all occupants must be notified no matter where work is being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would appear to be an absurd interpretation,'' he said.
``But the phraseology is so ambiguous, and the potential fines and
penalties are so high, it probably pays to notify everyone for
almost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Another puzzling element of the regulation, Cholst said, is that
while every occupant might have to be notified for a relatively
minor repair conducted in a common area, only the occupant and
owner of a particular apartment must be notified when repairs _ and
even significant renovations _ are being performed inside the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Cholst said, he intends to suggest to buildings
that he represents that whenever board approval is necessary for a
renovation in a shareholder's apartment, such approval be made
contingent upon the shareholder's acknowledging receipt of the
required notice from the contractor and perhaps even notifying
other unit owners of the work being performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to impose a huge burden on boards and managing
agents and shareholders,'' he said. ``But it's always better to err
on the side of caution.''

LOS ANGELES: Reynolds said. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade-off is that some Los Angeles commutes are longer than
necessary, exacting a cost in wasted time on the road. In Los
Angeles during 1996, a trip that should take 20 minutes actually
took slightly more than 30 during rush hour, and the average
Angeleno spent 76 hours in traffic delays, costing $1,205 each
year, according to a University of Texas study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only designed for 20 years into the future,'' said Mel
Hodges, chief officer of project studies for the agency. ``That
freeway was designed in the 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges explained that the 5 and the 134 come together at an
angle, so the thinking at the time was that people coming south on
the 5 would not need to go west on the 134 because they could have
taken the 170 south as a more direct route to the 134.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no need to come back in the opposite direction,''
Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency also neglected to connect the 170 south to
the 101 west, requiring drivers to exit the 170 and take city
streets to the 101 entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the agency's resistance to the 134-5 interchange is that
engineers say other, more heavily traveled interchanges are in need
of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The peak rush-hour traffic at the intersection of the 101 and
405 freeways is 24,000 cars, while the 5-134 junction handles
14,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   However, agency's numbers don't include drivers making the
connection by using Burbank surface streets.
</P>
<P>
   By the agency's estimation, those streets are not heavily
traveled either.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,500 cars a day exit at the 134's Victory Boulevard exit,
but only 2,500 make the link to the 5 north at the Western Avenue
onramp. Agency officials say that if a connector to from the 134
east to the 5 north was needed, those counts would be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even see that move making even a dent in circulation
of city streets. If there was a big need for it there would be a
lot of people leaving Victory and Western,'' said Nick Jones, an
associate transportation engineer for the transport agency.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank leaders insist the missing link causes major traffic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Bob Kramer said city officials see fixing the missing
link problem as part of an overall strategy to imporve traffic flow
on the freeways and city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a way to eliminate cut-through traffic in our
city. There's no question people use Hollywood Way and Buena Vista
Street to get from the 5 to the 134 quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Burbank has put in speed bumps, chokers and
narrow surface streets to encourage commuters to get on the
highways rather than clogging up residential streets.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the transport agency designed freeways for a
principal use: Long, regional trips and commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Ovrom said that people today are using the freeways for shorter
trips, many of them within the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system was designed to be spokes leading from the
suburbs into Los Angeles. Today that has all changed. Most of the
movement now is suburb to suburb traffic,'' Orvom said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not changed its philosophy. Sassaman said that
suburb to suburb traffic can be handled by surface streets and that
freeways were never meant to provide for motorists making short
trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freeway is set up for regional trips, not for local
trips,'' Sassaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Armstong, director of development for the city of
Glendale, said her city wants the new ramps, in part because of
Glendale's retail war with Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want people getting off the freeway in
Burbank,'' Armstrong said. ``We want them to come straight to
Glendale.''

NEW LUXURY TOWERS ARE SPROUTING IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After a decade-long drought in new construction,
downtown Chicago is suddenly awash in new luxury apartment towers.
About half a dozen towers are currently rising on the Near North
and South Sides, several in neighborhoods not previously known as
high-end residential enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, luxury housing in Chicago tended to be concentrated
in the Gold Coast, a neighborhood a mile north of the Loop and
consisting of Lake Shore Drive and three streets to the west. But
none of the new buildings are in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, several are either on or just off Michigan Avenue,
while the rest are in neighborhoods that for most of this century
have been industrial and commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
   How is luxury defined in Chicago? The most common definition is
a purchase price of more than $300 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, however, brokers and developers say that a luxury
apartment starts at about $1 million. All of the new buildings
contain at least some apartments at that price level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a real difference between what you got for
$300,000 and what you got for $700,000,'' said James Kinney,
president of Rubloff Residential Properties, a leading downtown
brokerage. ``Now, to get that same `wow factor' you're talking at
least a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   This is relatively new ground in Chicago. Five years ago,
according to data from the local multiple listing service, there
were 33 sales of $1 million or more downtown. In the last 14
months, however, there have been 122 sales, with an additional 56
$1 million-plus units currently under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Why the run-up in prices at a time when inflation remains at
historic lows? ``There's just a lot more money in Chicago today
then there was at the beginning of the decade,'' said Diane Swonk,
deputy chief economist at Bank One Corporation here. ``The economy
has been booming and it doesn't take many years of 20 percent
returns on assets to create a lot of disposable income.''
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers in the demand side of the equation are up, the
numbers on the supply side are down. ``This is the tightest market
for luxury sales I can remember,'' said Joan Armstrong, a broker
with Koenig &AMP; Strey who has specialized in Gold Coast real estate
for more than 20 years. ``There is very little to show people. If
they're nice apartments, they're gone in a week, often for more
than the asking price.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the new buildings under construction, the most notable are
Park Tower, the Bristol and Riverview, with Park Tower in
particular perceived as a premier luxury address.
</P>
<P>
   Park Tower, on the west side of Water Tower Square at Michigan
and Chicago Avenues, is a joint venture of Hyatt Corp. and LR
Development. The architect is Lucien Lagrange, principal of Lucien
Lagrange and Associates, a firm noted locally for innovative
residential work.
</P>
<P>
   The building, a streamlined 67-story Art Deco affair clad in
cream-colored stone, will open in the summer of 2000. The first 20
floors will be occupied by the 203-room Park Hyatt Hotel. The rest
will consist of 115 condominium units, including eight full-floor
penthouses. Condominium prices range from $617,000 to $3.5 million,
with an average of more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Abrams, president of LR Development, all of
the penthouses have been sold and all but five of the remaining
units are spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We researched the market and found that people wanted the
service and amenities that go with a hotel, but not the traffic and
congestion,'' he said. The solution, he added, was to have two
entrances _ one for the hotel on Chicago Avenue and another for the
condominium around the corner on Water Tower Square. Tenants also
will be able to order room service from the hotel and will have
access to the hotel's lavish health club.
</P>
<P>
   The building is extravagantly scaled, with apartments up to
10,000 square feet and with ceiling heights up to 15 feet. All of
the units face east and have clear views of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the same feel you get in some of the classic Lake
Shore Drive apartment buildings from the '20s and '30s,'' said
Lagrange, the architect. ``The wasted space is really what makes
those old apartments special _ the galleries and vestibules and
hallways and niches. These aren't spaces that you eat or sleep in,
but there's something comfortable about them and also very
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagrange is personally designing several of the apartments in
the building and says the dominant style is ``more Beaux-Arts than
Bauhaus. People want columns and moldings. It's very classical,
very traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away, at the corner of Rush Street and Delaware
Place, is the Bristol, a 41-story International Style tower being
developed by Golub &AMP; Company. The architectural firm is Solomon
Cordwell Buenz Associates, based in Chicago. The building's 189
units range in price from $275,000 to $1.4 million. According to
Golub president Michael Newman, about 35 percent of the units have
been sold so far. The building will be completed by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bristol and Park Tower are within easy walking distance
of the Gold Coast. The third building, Riverview, has a more
adventurous location. That bulding is part of an emerging
neighborhood along the north bank of the Chicago River where it
meets Lake Michigan. For most of Chicago's history, this land _
within shouting distance of the Loop _ has been occupied by
warehouses and factories.
</P>
<P>
   It is now being developed into a mixed-use neighborhood that
includes residential, hotel and entertainment facilities as well as
a pedestrian promenade along the river. Riverview, which is being
developed by MCL Companies, will ultimately consist of three towers
with a total of about 400 units and about 30 town houses. The
architect is Gregory De Stefano of De Stefano and Partners, based
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase, which will open late in 2000, consists of a
98-apartment tower and nine town houses. The tower units start at
about $285,000 and go up to $2 million while the town houses, which
face the river, start at $1.1 million and go up to $2.1 million.
According to Daniel McLean, president of MCL, 35 tower units and
four town houses have been sold. ``The site is spectacular _ you're
surrounded by water on three sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What do you get for a $1 million today? ``Over 3,000 square feet
of space, fancy kitchens with granite countertops, hardwood floors
throughout, marble bathrooms, nine-foot ceilings and great views of
the lake and downtown,'' said McLean.
</P>
<P>
   The new luxury buyers, say developers, are a different crowd
than in the past in that suburbanites make up a much bigger part of
the mix. ``In the '80s, maybe 10 to 15 percent of the downtown
buyers were suburbanites,'' said McLean. ``Today, it's 40 or 50
percent. Many are empty nesters in their early 50s with high
incomes. They want to be downtown where there's lots to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a surprising number of suburbanites _ probably
35 percent _ who are either moving to the city or are buying a
second residence downtown,'' said Newman.
</P>
<P>
   One such buyer is Harvey Kinzelberg, who, with his wife, Mary
Ann, recently purchased a 4,000-square-foot penthouse at Park
Tower. Kinzelberg, 54, is the founder of Sequel Capital Corp., an
industrial leasing firm based in suburban Deerfield.
</P>
<P>
   Kinzelberg, who currently lives in Glencoe, a tony North Shore
suburb, says he is ready for a change. ``The children are grown and
we want to experience the city _ the restaurants, the museums, the
wonderful architecture. The city's vibrant and exciting. It's time
for us to have some fun.''

KINGS LOOK TO THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The time hasn't yet arrived, but it is drawing
near.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, barring a miraculous, season-saving
turnaround, the Kings officially will start thinking about next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Their version of the white flag of surrender will be a move to
recall some of their top prospects from the minors, giving several
players a taste of the NHL and giving Kings management what it
hopes will be an eye-pleasing glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our playoff hopes are dim,'' general manager Dave Taylor
acknowledged. ``We could win eight or nine games (of the 11
remaining) and still not get in, the way Calgary is playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it probably won't be long until the recalls begin.
The Kings, who begin a five-game trip today in Colorado, are
permitted four, and may begin to use them this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the East Coast,'' Taylor said, referring to
Tuesday night's game in Boston against the Bruins. ``We'll see
where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he has four players in mind to recall.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Jason Podollan, acquired this week in the deal that sent
Yanic Perreault to Toronto, probably will be promoted from the Long
Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL. The Kings also probably will recall
winger Pavel Rosa. And from Springfield of the AHL, the Kings
probably will recall winger Josh Green, who began the season in the
NHL, along with center Eric Belanger. A back injury, however, might
prevent Belanger from playing.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Kings continue to cling to playoff hopes as
they prepare for their five-game swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematically, we're still there,'' coach Larry Robinson
said. ``But time is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tumultuous week for the Kings, the $4.25-million
divorce settlement with Steve Duchesne the most notable event.
After the Kings shipped the disappointing defenseman to
Philadelphia on Tuesday, Taylor indicated that the experience
probably would make the team more fiscally conservative in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor indicated that Kings management has reached the
conclusion that building a consistent winning team, rather than
stocking the roster with stars, is the surest way to make the
franchise successful at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still question whether a star would do it,'' Taylor said.
`` A winning team would do it. A star and a winning team would
definitely do it.... Even going to Anaheim, they have two of the
best players in the game (Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne), and they
still have empty seats there. That's what's alarming about this
game. It's hard for a family to afford to go to a game. We have to
bring the sanity back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taylor doesn't dispute that the Kings desperately need a
high-scoring forward. Adding one and staying within a budget is the
complicated part. Ideally, improvements in the team would come from
the pool of players drafted the last few years. But the Kings'
prospects are still in their developmental stages, and Taylor did
not rule out signing a free agent this summer. He did say, however,
that the Kings will be very careful before they do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to find ways to improve the team,'' Taylor said.
``We'll have to be creative and we'll have to take chances with
free agents, college free agents.... You're guaranteed to be
spending money now. Is it guaranteed to help the team? That's the
question. We can only control our (own spending). We have our plan.
Developing players is going to be really important to us. But we
have to find ways to improve ourselves in the short-term.''

POLITICS AND GEOGRAPHY LIMIT NATO AIR ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the New York Times.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By moving to widen the attack against Yugoslavia's
military targets, NATO is still trying to cut off the head of
Belgrade's war machine rather than dismember it piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, announced Saturday that
allied fighter-bombers were shifting to a second phase to intensify
attacks on the Yugoslav tanks, troops and artillery that are
gouging a brutal offensive through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Clinton administration officials challenged that
claim Saturday, accusing NATO diplomats of raising expectations
that allied fighter-bombers might not be able to deliver _ right
away or ever.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's heavy weaponry has been on NATO's target list from
the start, Pentagon officials said. But the top priority of the
campaign's first phase was knocking out Serbian air defenses to
prevent the downing of any NATO planes, a precaution that may have
failed Saturday night if reports from Serbia are proven true that a
radar-evading F-117 stealth fighter was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Under the broader campaign announced Saturday, NATO air forces
will attack a larger proportion of strategic military targets _
like command posts, headquarters, ammunition depots and airfields _
in a concentrated swath of Yugoslavia south of Belgrade, below the
44th parallel. The closer targeting had not begun by Saturday
evening, in part because the weather over Yugoslavia was
unsuitable, and in part, NATO officials said, because Yugoslav air
defense systems made it unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But if NATO officials were to attack heavy weaponry in earnest,
commanders would be ordering aloft A-10 Warthogs, armed with
Maverick anti-tank missiles, and perhaps armor-busting attack
helicopters. They are not, administration officials say, fearing
that Army helicopters smack too much of ground forces, which have
been ruled out for now, and that the slow-moving, low-flying A-10s
would be too vulnerable to shoulder-fired ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very duplicitous of them,'' a senior Pentagon
official said of the NATO pronouncements. ``The phasing is more for
the political side, not the military. They should be characterizing
this as a significant gut check for the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say they had little choice. The horrifying
reports of atrocities from Kosovo built up immense political
pressure to do something about the reported massacres. But
political leaders here and in Europe were not willing to risk using
the best anti-tank and anti-troop aircraft, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, American and other allied officials say, ground
attack planes like F-16s and F-15Es will do the best they can at
least to scatter Serbian forces, if not actually destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the attack becomes more pervasive and intense, the Serbs
will have to disperse their forces,'' a Western military attache
said. ``Greater dispersal means less activity by their military.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, allied air power is severely limited by the region's
notoriously bad weather, hilly terrain, menacing ground-to-air
missiles and a lack of spotters on the ground to help pinpoint and
bomb Yugoslavia's heavy weapons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When you think of attacking fielded forces, what comes to mind
is troops in the open,'' said an Air Force general with experience
in the Balkans. ``That's not what we're going to be doing. First,
we'll have to locate them, and then precisely target them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go after their barracks and their headquarters,'' the
general continued. ``You go after where they work and live, and if
they're not there, at least you know where they won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Air is going to be good to isolate these guys and separate
them from their leadership their ability to communicate with
them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather is one important hindrance to the NATO pilots. Cloud
cover prevents them from identifying their targets and using
laser-guided bombs to hit them. This places a greater reliance on
unmanned cruise missiles, which are effective mainly against fixed
targets.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, many manned aircraft were forced to turn back because
of bad weather en route to or over their targets. NATO briefers
refused to say how many planes had aborted their missions.
</P>
<P>
   To hit ground targets with precision, allied warplanes would
typically have to drop to about 10,000 feet, from the 20,000 feet
or more at which they fly now. The pilots would have to visually
identify targets, which in hilly terrain can be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the situation in Iraq and in Bosnia, the NATO pilots
would not have spotters on the ground or in the air to pinpoint the
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs are not maneuvering, then it's not a difficult
target to attack,'' an Air Force general said. ``Without someone on
the ground, especially if the Serbs are in close proximity to
friendly forces or civilians, the complexity goes up immensely.''

JOHNSON TRIES TO FIND RIGHT BATTING ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ The Dodgers' eight position players are set, but
their positions in the batting order are still being finagled.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said he ``likes the feel'' of
switch-hitting center fielder Devon White hitting fourth, giving a
lefty presence to the middle of the lineup. It would also split up
Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of fooling around, trying to find a fit,'' Johnson
said Saturday. ``With (Todd Hundley) being inconsistent in the
lineup, I'm trying to figure out how to best protect certain people
in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the Dodgers were excited to acquire Hundley
was his left-handed bat in what had become a right-handed lineup.
But his unavailability most of the spring left the Dodgers with
only right-handers in the middle of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting an end to that,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   So a week ago Johnson inserted White as the cleanup hitter,
giving the Dodgers a lefty bat among the righties. In the last
three seasons, White has hit .280 when he bats fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the uncertainty around Hundley, I've had kind of a look
at Mondi,'' Johnson said. ``Mondi is a guy who hits a lot of
doubles. It's good to get somebody ahead of him who can run. Then
if they put Sheff on base, you've got a switch-hitter behind him
and you know that works.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who spent part of his time hitting fifth when he was with
the Florida Marlins, had no preference where he batted in the
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hit 30 homers,'' said White, who hit 22
homers last season with Arizona. ``If I get a ball I can drive,
I'll drive it. My job is to get on base, score runs and drive some
runs in. Batting (fourth), you're in a situation where you get
better pitches, so you swing at better pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson continues to flirt with the notion of batting shortstop
Mark Grudzielanek second. But Grudzielanek has proved to be a
better offensive player batting seventh than second. In his past
three years, he has hit .255 with a .304 on-base percentage from
the No. 2 spot. He has hit .301 with a .322 on-base percentage from
the seventh spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grudzielanek wants to hit down there (No. 2), but he doesn't
get on base enough,'' Johnson said. ``I told him `You've got to
show me you can walk more.' I look at on-base percentage. Heck, I
wake up in the middle of the night to look at on-base percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   As it looks now, Eric Young will bat leadoff, perhaps followed
by Grudzielanek, Sheffield, White, Mondesi, Eric Karros, Hundley
and Adrian Beltre. Johnson could have the same option if
left-handed hitting catcher Rick Wilkins is in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   No hits, no satisfaction: Right-hander Chan Ho Park pitched six
innings and didn't allow a hit against the St. Louis Cardinals, but
he certainly wasn't proclaiming himself fit for the regular season
yet. Park walked five, throwing 95 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-hitter, but so what?'' Park said. ``It's spring training.
Too many walks. Five, six walks, you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Park was particularly upset after walking two Cardinals in the
first inning. One of those walks was to Mark McGwire, prompting a
lusty ``Boo'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cutting it off too much. The ball was running on him,''
Johnson said. ``He was all hacked off. He was fighting himself a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Though Johnson hasn't officially named a
starting rotation, he said it would remain consistent with the
Grapefruit League rotation. That would mean Kevin Brown in the
April 5 opener followed by Park, Ismael Valdes, Carlos Perez and
Darren Dreifort. Since the Dodgers play 17 straight days to start
the season, nobody is scheduled to be bumped a day in the rotation.
. . . In an attempt to get at-bats for catcher Angel Pena and
middle infielder Juan Castro, Johnson sent both of them to the
Dodgers' Triple-A game against the Cardinals. ``I want them to get
about eight (at-bats) in the next few days. I have to make sure
they're getting some playing time, and I'm limited here,'' Johnson
said. He added that neither was demoted.

INJURIES DEPLETE GALAXY DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The concern on Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano's face
started to show Friday, when he learned central defender Robin
Fraser will be out at least three weeks after injuring his left
shoulder in the waning moments of L.A.'s 2-1 shootout victory over
Colorado in last week's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right back Ezra Hendrickson is out at least one more
game with a strained groin and highly touted defender Steve Jolley
returned to practice late this week after having arthroscopic
surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries come at a bad time for the Galaxy because Dallas
forward Jason Kreis, who scored three goals in Dallas' 4-0 victory
over Kansas City last week, brings his long-range striking ability
to the Rose Bowl today when the Burn plays the Galaxy at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy-Burn game follows a Women's World Cup tune-up between
the United States and Mexico, which begins at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (the injuries) one of those things you don't foresee,''
said Zambrano. ``It's one thing to get one untimely injury, but to
have three guys of this caliber go down defensively hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Robin's case, it's bad, we're looking at three weeks at
least. Then, if he has to have surgery, it will be longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries may force the Galaxy to go with three defenders,
leaving Paul Caligiuri alone in the middle, with two left-footed
backs _ Joey Franchino and Greg Vanney _ playing wide. Defensive
midfielder Danny Pena would drop in front of Caligiuri, forming a
four-man backline at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from a four-man system to a three-man is tough because
you have to play with two left-footed players on the outside,''
said Caligiuri. ``Still, whether it's Joey or Greg playing the
right side, they both man-mark well. It's just one of those
adjustments you have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreis, who earned MLS player of the week honors, was given a lot
of room to roam against Kansas City. Caligiuri says closing down
Kreis and post-up striker Mickey Trotman will be the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to shut down Kreis because he likes to
control the ball and shoot from distance,'' Caligiuri said. ``And
Trotman's a player who likes to spin you around so we have to deny
him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kansas City) in the defensive third allowed them (Dallas) to
do what they wanted, but that's not our nature. We'll go with our
high pressure and when they're in our defensive third, we won't
give them any space.''

REPORTS THAT U.S. PLANE WAS BROUGHT DOWN IN FIRST ALLIED LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update; substantial new information throughout.)  
(lh) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders announced a new phase of the air
assault on Serbian targets Saturday, for the first time ordering
direct attacks on troops and equipment of the Yugoslav army and
special police forces in and near Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But as allied planners were preparing the stepped-up air
campaign, an U.S. F-117 stealth fighter apparently went down in
Yugoslavia Saturday night, the first allied loss in the four-day
Balkan conflict and a stunning demonstration of the vulnerability
of one of the most advanced weapons in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television broadcast images of the burning wreckage of
an aircraft that bore the distinctive markings of the F-117
Nighthawk, a radar-evading fighter-bomber that has performed
flawlessly in previous missions over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities claimed that their air defenses shot down
the U.S. aircraft, but the cause of the plane's apparent crash
could not immediately be determined.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesmen grimly referred all inquiries about the
incident to the Pentagon, where officials would not confirm the
loss of the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The videotaped pictures of the ruined jet were shown repeatedly
on U.S. television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on the fate of the plane's pilot and a crew
member.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the the loss of the U.S. airplane shocked White House
officials, who had spent most of the day consulting with European
leaders about expanding the military mission in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled by numerous reports of atrocities in Kosovo, including
mass executions, deportations and forced marches, NATO and U.S.
officials accelerated a decision to attack Serbian forces in the
field, officials here and in Europe said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when the United States announced the attacks,
President Clinton said the West had a ``moral imperative'' to try
to halt the slaughter of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Clinton warned
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, that if he did not
cease the repression in Kosovo, NATO would ``seriously damage''
Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, NATO and the United States moved to make good on that
threat, setting plans for attacks by allied warplanes, including
ground-attack helicopters, that would take aim at supply depots,
communications facilities and troop concentrations located south of
the 44th parallel in Yugoslavia. The area includes all of Kosovo
and a substantial portion of Serbia south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to strike at heavy weapons, which are of course
what are used to bombard villages and kill people,'' said Jamie
Shea, a NATO spokesman in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington said that NATO is not yet sending
low-flying combat ground-attack planes or helicopters to hit
Serbian troops in Kosovo. While there are signs that NATO attacks
have weakened some Serbian air defense systems, low-flying aircraft
would still remain vulnerable to Serb ground fire, and the current
weather in the Balkans has been too poor to permit such operations,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium,
announced the escalation of the air war and the shift in strategy
this afternoon after a series of conversations among President
Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Jacques
Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy. Later, Chirac also contacted the
Russian government in an attempt to restart talks with the Serbs
toward a diplomatic settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total unity that the campaign was moving as planned
and that it was important to move to a new phase of the air
campaign, including focusing on forces in the field,'' said David
Leavy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton believes that Slobodan Milosevic's continued
repression and continued intransigence remain an obstacle to
resolving this crisis and thus it was necessary to move forward in
broadening the scope of the air assault,'' Leavy said. Milosevic is
the president of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the dominant part.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that the reports
of Serbian brutalities were numerous and credible and had triggered
the intensified air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing brutality made it an easy call to broaden and
deepen the attack,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the decision to go ahead with the
second phase of the air war was moved up by several days because
the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Kosovo is far worse than any
previous campaign against ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages,'' the British Defense
Minister, George Robertson, said in London. ``There are reports
that the Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration.
There are clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against
the Albanian population has started.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson accused Milosevic of being a ``serial ethnic
cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea cited reports that large groups of Kosovo Albanians _
conspicuously lacking adult men _ have been spotted under the guard
of Serbian forces. ``Dark things are happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarming reports and the pleas from some in Kosovo
for more forceful intervention, administration officials insisted
that they were not planning to use U.S. or NATO ground troops to
halt any killings and punish Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops,'' Vice President Al Gore said in
response to a question while campaigning in New Hampshire. ``I
believe that we can achieve our objectives with the use of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, for the first time, people heard large explosions
before air-raid sirens sounded, suggesting that Yugoslavia's air
defense system has been damaged around the capital, as NATO has
said it was.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade television broadcast images showing the city almost
deserted by shoppers Saturday after heavy overnight missile raids
aimed at military targets on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Stinging chemical fumes wafted over parts of the city Saturday
after allied warplanes bombed a rocket fuel depot in the Ibarska
Magistrala area in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign has been conducted until now using cruise
missiles and precision-guided bombs dropped from high-altitude
aircraft. Any serious effort to destroy tanks, artillery pieces,
trucks and mobile ground forces would require lower-flying aircraft
like the tank-killing A-10 Warthog and ground-attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials indicated that they were not yet prepared to
employ such weapons in the new phase of the air combat because of
their increased vulnerability to ground fire and surface-to-air
missiles. Instead, aircraft already involved in the campaign _
F-16's and F-15E's _ will be used to attack the new set of targets
in southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, a White House spokesman said that NATO had
begun to attack ground units of the Yugoslav army. But Pentagon
officials said later that the flights had not yet occurred because
of concerns over weather and Serbian air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that
Milosevic was conducting a ``brutal military offensive'' against
civilians and that allied forces must ``stay the course'' to
prevent the war in Kosovo from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children,'' Clinton said. ``We must, and we will, continue until
Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, accepts peace or we have
seriously damaged his capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no visible signs Milosevic was backing off.
Serbian television broadcast programs with patriotic themes along
with coverage of NATO attacks and news of protests against them in
Greece and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian province of Kosovo, the center of the conflict
that led to the attacks that began on Wednesday, Serbian troops
continued their rampage against the ethnic Albanians, burning homes
and villages and rounding up ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happening because of NATO,'' Robertson, the
British minister, said. ``This violence was going on before we
began.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies planned to continue bombing airfields, industrial
sites and anti-aircraft defenses throughout Yugoslavia Saturday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is not very good,'' Air Commodore David Wilby of
Britain said in a Brussels briefing early Saturday. In operations
that ended before dawn Saturday, he said, ``some of the airplanes
turned back because of the weather, but manned aircraft did get
through to their targets last night.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 249 allied planes took to the air between Friday and
early Saturday, he said. Bombs dropped from aircraft and the
warheads of unpiloted cruise missiles struck military targets
around Belgrade and the southeastern Serbian city of Nis, and in
six areas in and around Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have given only sketchy accounts of damage from
the air raids because they say it will take time to analyze
photographs taken after the attacks. And without people on the
ground, they say, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and other officials warned Milosevic Saturday not to
try to retaliate by attacking international peacekeepers in
neighboring Bosnia or Macedonia. About 12,000 allied soldiers in
Macedonia are preparing for missions to enforce a peace agreement
in Kosovo if, as the allies hope, the bombing forces Milosevic to
accept one.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, he added, will do their best to see that Serbian
authorities who may be responsible for atrocities against civilians
are prosecuted for them by the international criminal tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation that
signed the peace agreement that Milosevic refused to accept in
Paris earlier this month, said that Serbian military and police
sweeps through Kosovo could only be stopped by sending in NATO
ground forces, an Austrian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said later, ``Currently, there are no plans for us to take
on ground operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding details to earlier accounts of a dogfight Friday
afternoon in which two NATO F-15s shot down two advanced MIG-29
Yugoslav planes over Bosnia, Wilby said the MIGs had apparently
intended to try to lure the NATO planes across the border into
Serbia to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aircraft turned toward them in rule-book fashion and shot
them down,'' he said. The wreckage of one lies in a minefield in a
sector of Bosnia patrolled by Russian troops serving with the
alliance-led peacekeeping force, he said, and the other went down
in an unknown location.

 &HT;    Duval escapes with lead as Sawgrass mauls field
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Welcome to the TPC, which should stand
for Terribly Punishing Conditions or something moderately
unprintable.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's just The Players Championship, which Saturday
went from tough to torture chamber, and there is no hope (or rain)
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the best field in golf is paid handsomely for putting
up with greens that putt like the floor at the Pauley Pavilion _
$900,000 is the first-prize loot _ but even those who have seen
shenanigans like this before at the TPC at Sawgrass were reaching
for the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody went unscathed. Second-round leader Joe Ozaki disappeared
with an 81. England's Nick Faldo tied his worst-ever score in the
United States with an 83. Bob Friend, who aced the eighth hole
Friday and stood at 1-under par, is 14-over in this morning's
newspaper fine print after an 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing Augusta and the U.S. Open on the same day,
and I'll have none of that,'' said Scotland's Colin Montgomerie,
who stood at 1-under 215 after a 73 and felt fortunate to be there.
``It's probably the most demanding conditions we play ... but there
were a lot worse than me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for local knowledge, even Jacksonville-native David
Duval might have blown off the leaderboard. As it was, Duval held
onto his cap and his game decently enough to secure the 54-hole
lead at 4-under 212 _ the highest three-round score by a leader
since the tournament moved to Sawgrass in 1982. With a bogey at the
18th hole, Duval shot a 74 for a one-stroke lead over Phil
Mickelson (71 on Saturday) and Skip Kendall (70).
</P>
<P>
   With conditions the way they are and likely to worsen as the
greens get firmer and the wind continues to blow balls off line,
anyone within at least six shots of the lead is in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Three-shots back at 1-under 215 are Montgomerie, Nick Price (74)
and Scott Hoch (73). Four shots behind at even-par 216 are a group
that includes Tiger Woods (75), Mark O'Meara (71) and Payne Stewart
(74).
</P>
<P>
   The lowest scores on the board were 70s by Steve Stricker, Scott
Gump and Kendall. Six players broke par. Seventy-three shot over
par _ 14 of them 80 or better. Of the 27 players who started the
third round under par, six remain in red numbers. By late
afternoon, hitting a sprinkler became a decent option. At least, it
wasn't as hard as the greens
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something today I've never seen before,'' Mickelson
said. ``On the first green I had a putt hit a spike mark and come
backwards. The spike marks were so firm, they could careen a ball
off line. That's when I knew it was going to be long day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Phil and I walked out on the first green, you could
almost see your reflection in it,'' Montgomerie said. ``It was
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims were everywhere you looked. Atlanta's Billy Andrade
made 10 bogeys during an 81. Sea Island's Davis Love III quadrupled
the 17th and went from 3-under to 1-over, but is still not out of
it, starting today at 2-over. Columbus' Larry Mize is even a stroke
better after a commendable 73.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-burned and weary, Duval could not have been happier than to
awaken today in his Jacksonville Beach house as the tournament
leader, regardless that his once five-shot lead had blown away in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where to start,'' he said. ``I'm beat. It was
tough out there today and I think it was reflective on the scores.
We just got kicked around. ... If we had to do this every week, I
don't think a whole lot of people would play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who was muttering obscenities to himself that were
evident to lip-readers, swiped at a mound so hard that he recoiled
5 yards. He almost flew the ball in the hole at the 15th and then
struggled to make bogey after scooting balls back and forth over
the putting surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Club selection was impossible,'' Woods said. ``The greens (cut
to 1/10 of an inch Thursday) are almost impossible to play. Some of
the pins are in spots where you just can't hold them, they're so
burned out. But five shots is not too hard to make up.''

 &HT;    SERBS CLAIM TO SHOOT DOWN NATO PLAN, AS NATO EXPANDS BOMBING
CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    With FIGHTER-BOX-0328; KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0328.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbian military authorities claimed Saturday night
to have shot down a NATO F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter jet and
broadcast television images of twisted burning aircraft wreckage --
a stark reminder of the tragedy and human cost of modern warfare
for which President Clinton has tried to prepare the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials did not immediately deny what
appeared to be the first loss of a NATO aircraft since the bombing
of Yugoslavia began four days ago. There were news reports late
Saturday quoting unidentified sources at the Pentagon confirming
the loss of the aircraft. But those sources had no explanation of
why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television images of the fiery plane wreckage clearly
showed a U.S. Air Force insignia and an ``Air Combat Command''
insignia that is typically displayed on Nighthawks. In addition,
there were unconfirmed reports from Italy that one NATO plane had
not returned to Aviano Air Base near the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian authorities claimed that the pilot of the downed
F-117 was captured by farmers and turned over to the military.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent downing of the $45 million F-117, which is designed
for missions into highly defended areas, came hours after Clinton,
in his weekly radio address, urged NATO to ``stay the course'' and
allied forces decided to expand their attacks to include Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with Serbian forces reportedly intensifying atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, a sign
that the NATO bombing has been ineffective in its objective of
slowing the Serb assault, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
vowed to pay ``any cost'' to keep NATO peacekeeping troops out of
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, weapons and television images suggested little
chance for a quick resolution to the conflict that, after four days
of intense bombing by NATO warplanes, is threatening to spread
beyond an area that Clinton described as ``a powder keg at the
heart of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president said the bombing of Yugoslavia was
necessary ``to prevent a wider war'' involving other European
countries, two Yugoslav helicopters flew over neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina before turning back when confronted by NATO jet
fighters Saturday. On Friday, also over Bosnia, NATO F-15 warplanes
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters that crossed over the
border about 25 miles from Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops
taking part in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targeting of Serbian ground troops in Kosovo, the
increasing flood of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia, the
Yugoslavian violation of air space in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
spreading protests in European cities underscored the dilemma NATO
leaders face: whether to send ground troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials moved swiftly Saturday to
dampen speculation that ground forces would be needed, especially
to stop the alleged ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serbian troops and
thugs against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accomplish our objective through air power,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,''' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing reports of atrocities in Kosovo prompted NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana Saturday to widen the range of
bombing targets to include Serbian tanks, artillery and troops in
Kosovo. In Brussels, Solana said he was ``determined to bring a
halt to violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian
catastrophe'' with what was dubbed ``Phase Two'' of the bombing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes
after meeting with his foreign policy team and speaking with
leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France.
``All the leaders agreed that . . . it was time to broaden or
deepen the attack,'' said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   This new phase of the NATO assault will be more dangerous,
however. To attack tanks and soldiers on the ground will require
NATO planes to swoop within range of Serb weaponry, which includes
1,400 anti-aircraft artillery, 100 surface-to-air missiles and an
undetermined number of shoulder-launched missiles similar to
American Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army, which numbers about 30,000 soldiers, have
waged a 13-month siege of terror that has forced more than 350,000
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson said an ``all-out Serb
offensive against the Albanian population'' of Kosovo has begun,
with scores of people murdered and villages destroyed. But he
insisted, ``This is not happening because of NATO. The violence was
going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea emphasized that NATO battle plans do
not call for the use of ground troops. But he also acknowledged
that air power alone will not entirely prevent Serbian brutality
against ethnic Albanians. ``It's not possible to do that from the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 NATO ground troops, including 400 Americans, are in
Macedonia training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace
settlement, but not as an invading, offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for the first time since the NATO assault began, air
raid sirens screeched in Belgrade as allied bombs rocked the
suburbs of the Yugoslavian capital. Still, Milosevic remained
defiant, issuing a statement once again rejecting any Kosovo peace
plan that includes the stationing of NATO troops in Serbia's
southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow at any cost the enemies to occupy their country,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said the Serbian attacks
on unarmed ethnic Albanians in recent days was ``all the more
reason for us to stay the course'' until Milosevic ``accepts peace
or we have seriously damaged this capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., questioned Clinton's leadership in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops must receive a clear military mission,'' Ashcroft
said. ``Our leaders must construct a a strategy and timetable to
achieve that mission. Third, our soldiers deserve an exit strategy
that can bring them home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Clinton's broadcast, a U.S. Navy ship fired two
Tomahawk cruise missiles at what a defense official called
``targets of opportunity'' near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the skies cleared after a heavy day of rain over Aviano
Air Base, more than 50 warplanes screamed off the runway for the
fourth straight day of bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With few neutral observers on the ground in Yugoslavia, it is
difficult to determine the extent to which the NATO bombing has
weakened Milosevic. The air raid sirens in Belgrade went off after
the explosions in the suburbs, suggesting that NATO had weakened
Yugoslavia's formidable air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said reconnaissance efforts were under way to verify
allegations of fresh Serb aggression against the Kosovars. He said
U.S. officials would turn over any evidence of war crimes to the
U.N. Tribunal in The Hague for possible prosecution.

REPORTS THAT U.S. PLANE WAS BROUGHT DOWN IN FIRST ALLIED LOSS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders announced a new phase of the air
assault on Serbian targets Saturday, for the first time ordering
direct attacks on troops and equipment of the Yugoslav army and
special police forces in and near Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But as allied planners were preparing the stepped-up air
campaign, an U.S. F-117 stealth fighter apparently went down in
Yugoslavia Saturday night, the first allied loss in the four-day
Balkan conflict and a stunning demonstration of the vulnerability
of one of the most advanced weapons in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television broadcast images of the burning wreckage of
an aircraft that bore the distinctive markings of the F-117
Nighthawk, a radar-evading fighter-bomber that has performed
flawlessly in previous missions over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities claimed that their air defenses shot down
the U.S. aircraft, but the cause of the plane's apparent crash
could not immediately be determined.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesmen grimly referred all inquiries about the
incident to the Pentagon, where officials would not confirm the
loss of the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The videotaped pictures of the ruined jet were shown repeatedly
on U.S. television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on the fate of the plane's pilot and a crew
member.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the loss of the U.S. airplane shocked White House
officials, who had spent most of the day consulting with European
leaders about expanding the military mission in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled by numerous reports of atrocities in Kosovo, including
mass executions, deportations and forced marches, NATO and U.S.
officials accelerated a decision to attack Serbian forces in the
field, officials here and in Europe said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when the United States announced the attacks,
President Clinton said the West had a ``moral imperative'' to try
to halt the slaughter of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Clinton warned
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, that if he did not
cease the repression in Kosovo, NATO would ``seriously damage''
Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, NATO and the United States moved to make good on that
threat, setting plans for attacks by allied warplanes, including
ground-attack helicopters, that would take aim at supply depots,
communications facilities and troop concentrations located south of
the 44th parallel in Yugoslavia. The area includes all of Kosovo
and a substantial portion of Serbia south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to strike at heavy weapons, which are of course
what are used to bombard villages and kill people,'' said Jamie
Shea, a NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington said that NATO is not yet sending
low-flying combat ground-attack planes or helicopters to hit
Serbian troops in Kosovo. While there are signs that NATO attacks
have weakened some Serbian air defense systems, low-flying aircraft
would still remain vulnerable to Serb ground fire, and the current
weather in the Balkans has been too poor to permit such operations,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials in Brussels, announced the
escalation of the air war and the shift in strategy Saturday
afternoon after a series of conversations among President Clinton,
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Jacques Chirac of
France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema of Italy. Later, Chirac also contacted the Russian
government in an attempt to restart talks with the Serbs toward a
diplomatic settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total unity that the campaign was moving as planned
and that it was important to move to a new phase of the air
campaign, including focusing on forces in the field,'' said David
Leavy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton believes that Slobodan Milosevic's continued
repression and continued intransigence remain an obstacle to
resolving this crisis and thus it was necessary to move forward in
broadening the scope of the air assault,'' Leavy said. Milosevic is
the president of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the dominant part.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that the reports
of Serbian brutalities were numerous and credible and had triggered
the intensified air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing brutality made it an easy call to broaden and
deepen the attack,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the decision to go ahead with the
second phase of the air war was moved up by several days because
the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Kosovo is far worse than any
previous campaign against ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages,'' the British Defense
Minister, George Robertson, said in London. ``There are reports
that the Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration.
There are clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against
the Albanian population has started.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson accused Milosevic of being a ``serial ethnic
cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea cited reports that large groups of Kosovo Albanians _
conspicuously lacking adult men _ have been spotted under the guard
of Serbian forces. ``Dark things are happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarming reports and the pleas from some in Kosovo
for more forceful intervention, administration officials insisted
that they were not planning to use U.S. or NATO ground troops to
halt any killings and punish Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops,'' Vice President Al Gore said in
response to a question while campaigning in New Hampshire. ``I
believe that we can achieve our objectives with the use of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, for the first time, people heard large explosions
before air-raid sirens sounded, suggesting that Yugoslavia's air
defense system has been damaged around the capital, as NATO has
said it was.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade television broadcast images showing the city almost
deserted by shoppers Saturday after heavy overnight missile raids
aimed at military targets on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Stinging chemical fumes wafted over parts of the city Saturday
after allied warplanes bombed a rocket fuel depot in the Ibarska
Magistrala area in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign has been conducted until now using cruise
missiles and precision-guided bombs dropped from high-altitude
aircraft. Any serious effort to destroy tanks, artillery pieces,
trucks and mobile ground forces would require lower-flying aircraft
like the tank-killing A-10 Warthog and ground-attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials indicated that they were not yet prepared to
employ such weapons in the new phase of the air combat because of
their increased vulnerability to ground fire and surface-to-air
missiles. Instead, aircraft already involved in the campaign _
F-16's and F-15E's _ will be used to attack the new set of targets
in southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, a White House spokesman said that NATO had
begun to attack ground units of the Yugoslav army. But Pentagon
officials said later that the flights had not yet occurred because
of concerns over weather and Serbian air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that
Milosevic was conducting a ``brutal military offensive'' against
civilians and that allied forces must ``stay the course'' to
prevent the war in Kosovo from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children,'' Clinton said. ``We must, and we will, continue until
Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, accepts peace or we have
seriously damaged his capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no visible signs Milosevic was backing off.
Serbian television broadcast programs with patriotic themes along
with coverage of NATO attacks and news of protests against them in
Greece and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian province of Kosovo, the center of the conflict
that led to the attacks that began on Wednesday, Serbian troops
continued their rampage against the ethnic Albanians, burning homes
and villages and rounding up ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happening because of NATO,'' Robertson, the
British minister, said. ``This violence was going on before we
began.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies planned to continue bombing airfields, industrial
sites and anti-aircraft defenses throughout Yugoslavia Saturday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is not very good,'' Air Commodore David Wilby of
Britain said in a Brussels briefing early Saturday. In operations
that ended before dawn Saturday, he said, ``some of the airplanes
turned back because of the weather, but manned aircraft did get
through to their targets last night.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 249 allied planes took to the air between Friday and
early Saturday, he said. Bombs dropped from aircraft and the
warheads of unpiloted cruise missiles struck military targets
around Belgrade and the southeastern Serbian city of Nis, and in
six areas in and around Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have given only sketchy accounts of damage from
the air raids because they say it will take time to analyze
photographs taken after the attacks. And without people on the
ground, they say, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and other officials warned Milosevic Saturday not to
try to retaliate by attacking international peacekeepers in
neighboring Bosnia or Macedonia. About 12,000 allied soldiers in
Macedonia are preparing for missions to enforce a peace agreement
in Kosovo if, as the allies hope, the bombing forces Milosevic to
accept one.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, he added, will do their best to see that Serbian
authorities who may be responsible for atrocities against civilians
are prosecuted for them by the international criminal tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation that
signed the peace agreement that Milosevic refused to accept in
Paris earlier this month, said that Serbian military and police
sweeps through Kosovo could only be stopped by sending in NATO
ground forces, an Austrian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said later, ``Currently, there are no plans for us to take
on ground operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding details to earlier accounts of a dogfight Friday
afternoon in which two NATO F-15s shot down two advanced MIG-29
Yugoslav planes over Bosnia, Wilby said the MIGs had apparently
intended to try to lure the NATO planes across the border into
Serbia to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aircraft turned toward them in rule-book fashion and shot
them down,'' he said. The wreckage of one lies in a minefield in a
sector of Bosnia patrolled by Russian troops serving with the
alliance-led peacekeeping force, he said, and the other went down
in an unknown location.

PADRES EYE ANGELS' NEVIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Phil Nevin had three hits Saturday in the
Angels' 4-2 loss to the Seattle Mariners at Tempe Diablo Stadium,
raising his average to .378 (14 for 37). Those numbers might be
just good enough to send him packing.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck (broken bone in right hand and currently visiting
his ailing mother) will return to the team Wednesday and might be
ready by opening day. Todd Greene continues to show his shoulder is
healthy enough to catch. Charlie O'Brien is the most experienced
catcher on the staff. All that makes Nevin expendable.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been interested in shortstop/utility player Andy
Sheets of the Padres, who have lost catcher Carlos Hernandez for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin has heard the same thing, so Saturday morning he met with
manager Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let him know I've heard all this stuff, Nevin
said. ``I said `What's the deal? It's bothering me.' He said the
only thing you can do is what you do on the field. I've been traded
twice in my career. It's not something that would crush me.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin says he likes being in Anaheim and would prefer to stay.
However, the Padres would have plenty of playing time for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my career I need to play, said Nevin, 28.
``If it means going to San Diego and I'm going to be playing ... If
I'm going to get a lot more at-bats there than here, I'm sure it
would be good for me. If not, obviously I'd like to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin started at catcher on Friday in the Angels' game against
the Padres. And it was no coincidence. The Padres wanted -- and got
-- a good look at the former College Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've shown this spring I'm more than adequate
defensively and I can bring something to the table offensively if
I'm in there all the time, he said. ``I think people realize that.
I just wish people around here realized that.
</P>
<P>
   It is the policy of Angels management not to discuss potential
trades.
</P>
<P>
   It's only spring training, Mo Vaughn says. Just wait.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who has hit 40 or more homers in a season twice in his
career (the Angels record is 39), has had 50 at-bats this spring.
His home run total, however, is equal to that of Andy Stankiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Mo knows, but isn't concerned. His priority Saturday was getting
dressed and out of the clubhouse in time to watch UConn in the NCAA
Tournament. Vaughn is a Connecticut native and has a friend on the
UConn coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always hit at least one, Vaughn said of his spring
training history. ``But I don't worry about it either. It's been an
adjustment, but the adjustment has been out here (Arizona), not
with this team. I'll hit one before I leave.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than a month since spring training began, and
everyone -- from players, to coaches to front office personnel --
is ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week in camp is the toughest for the players, Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``You'll see the next few days guys
will have their bags packed, their cars loaded and ready to go.
I've got a list as long as my arm of guys wanting to go to Lake
Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   Half the team will break camp on March 30 and play in Lake
Elsinore on March 31. The other half of the team will remain in
Arizona to play one last Cactus League game on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Angels regulars will go to Lake Elsinore, including
Vaughn, Jim Edmonds, Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Todd Greene and
Troy Percival. Mark Petkovsek will start on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Tim Belcher made 98 pitches in six innings
Saturday, allowing three runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I wanted to do, said Belcher, who will be the
Angels' opening day starter on April 6 vs. Cleveland. ``I wanted to
get up to 90 or 100 pitches so my next time out (April 1 at minor
league camp) I can cut back to about 50 or 60 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Greene caught five innings Saturday but no Mariners baserunner
tried to run on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belcher mixes up his looks real well, and he's quick to the
plate, Greene said. ``But I don't feel bad about (no Mariners
trying to steal).
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it's possible Greene will be the Angels' opening
day catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Darin Erstad was scratched from Saturday's game
because of a bruised right heel. ... The Angels travel to Tucson
today to play the Colorado Rockies. Ken Hill will start for Anaheim
against Colorado's Brian Bohanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of multiplying atrocities filtering out of Kosovo, bad
enough news on purely humanitarian grounds, convey a still bleaker
message for allied policy makers trying to stem the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed accounts reaching Central European capitals _ taken
as fact or something close to it by allied officials, despite a
lack of confirming details _ indicate strongly that three days of
bombing raids have so far utterly failed to achieve even the modest
goals set by NATO and spelled out on Wednesday by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As one European diplomat said, ``we have to confront the
possibility that the air campaign, by forcing the independent
observers and Western journalists out of Kosovo, has given the
Serbs a sense that they can do whatever they like without anyone
being able to prove that they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, unless the tide turns soon, an exit strategy for
Clinton and other leaders may be harder than ever to develop. That
has long been a major fear of some of his congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea of bombing was first considered, some officials in
Washington suggested that it could be used to force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the NATO peacekeeping force
in Kosovo that he adamantly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion of the peacekeeper element in the proposed peace
settlement negotiated at Rambouillet, France, caused him to reject
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton came to believe that it would be tactically wiser to
set goals for the airstrikes that might be more readily achieved.
So he said last week that the purpose of the bombing was to bolster
NATO's credibility, to deter Milosevic ``from continuing and
escalating his attacks'' in Kosovo and, if needed, to severely
damage his war-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has succeeded in sending the message that it takes the
atrocities against ethnic Albanians seriously. But Milosevic has
not been deterred by the bombs and cruise missiles that the allies
have flung at him, and if his conventional war-making capacity has
been hurt, the ability of his paramilitary forces to spread havoc
in Kosovo remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, an American,
acknowledged on Friday that allied airstrikes could not in the
short term protect the ethnic Albanians from attacks by the Serbian
paramilitaries, and other officials said they wondered whether that
could ever be done without the introduction of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies are opposed to sending in troops unless they are
invited by the Milosevic government; one NATO staff study
reportedly indicated that it would require a huge deployment,
perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 troops, to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, the British defense minister, conceded
Saturday in London that what he called ``an all-out Serb offensive
against the Albanian population'' had begun, and said he had
reports that ``the Serbs are bombing villages to the point of
obliteration.'' But he insisted: ``This is not happening because of
NATO. This violence was going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood of apprehension in this region was heightened by the
intrusion of Serbian warplanes into Bosnian airspace _ MIG fighters
on Friday, helicopters Saturday. From the beginning, the countries
that border on Yugoslavia have worried about the Kosovo trouble's
spilling across their borders, and of course the Clinton
administration is particularly concerned about anything that
threatens to disrupt the hard-won peace settlement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, which borders Kosovo on the south, is especially
vulnerable to the unrest. It could be flooded with refugees, and
its fragile multi-ethnic balance could be upset. At present, about
a quarter of its population of 2.2 million is made up of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get nervous in Hungary,'' an official in Budapest said,
``because one of our main cities, Seged, is just a few kilometers
from the northern border of Yugoslavia. But if shivers run down our
spines, think of the tremors they feel in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, the Western alliance responded to the reported
torching of villages and alleged massacres by switching tactics,
saying that low-flying planes would now go after Yugoslav tanks,
artillery and even ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear is whether NATO had succeeded in its evident
intention to weaken the Serbs' radar and anti-aircraft defenses.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the airstrikes, senior military officers said it
could take a week or more to finish the first phase. But Saturday's
announcement came just four days into the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If the slaughter in Kosovo continues, the ``ethnic cleansing''
could be largely complete in a short period. NATO might even lose
public support for its campaign, whose goals are difficult to
achieve, because of the dispersal of the paramilitary forces and
their supplies, and because the terrain and small-scale targets
require pilots to fly at dangerously low altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Greece and Italy have suggested that it might be time
for diplomacy, rather than bombs. Javier Solana, the NATO Secretary
General, has worked hard to preserve a semblance of unanimity in
the alliance, but he himself has said the airstrikes should last
for a matter of days rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there seems to be little strategic room for an early bombing
pause. That would only convince Milosevic that he had won, allied
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the apparent softening of resolve in some European
capitals suggests that the prospect of more or less open-ended
strikes by NATO warplanes is slim. If the bombing campaign does not
stop Milosevic, some administration officials have been saying, the
answer is more bombing. From the European perspective, at least,
that may swiftly begin to ring a little hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's accelerated campaign in Kosovo calls into question
another possible endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have suggested that, failing an
agreement by the Serbian leader to return to the bargaining table,
the best thing to do would be to announce that his military
capacity had been degraded and call off the raids. But that would
not sound very convincing if the Serbs were still on their bloody
rampage in Kosovo, which is what the whole policy was meant to
stop.

DONNIE ALLISON JOINS ALABAMA'S GANG OF COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Special to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Paul ``Bear'' Bryant and Gene Stallings,
make room for ``coach'' Donnie Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, the 59-year-old veteran of NASCAR's famed ``Alabama
Gang'' and a 10-time winner as a driver, is coaching Ricky Craven
on the SBIII Motorsports team that fields the No. 58 Hollywood
Video Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   A ``coach?'' In stock-car racing?
</P>
<P>
   It's all about communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A percentage of what we talk about might just be talk,''
Craven said, ``but every now and then he comes up with something
real important.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Allison: ``Driving a car hasn't changed since I drove.
Ricky and I talk about different things that I used to feel at
different racetracks, and he still feels that. And I overcame
problems at different racetracks, and it seems to help him. It's
not a coach as much as it is somebody to talk to that's been there,
that's done the same thing he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison can even help on tracks where he never raced, including
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look at a car and pretty much determine where our
problem spots are. I guess watching a lot of cars and driving them
myself, it's an ability I have. I can't answer why I got it. I
don't know. But I do have it, and it's really not only helped
Ricky, but other guys I've helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other guys include Joe Nemechek, Bobby Hamilton, Davey
Allison and Hut Stricklin. Allison said he ``jumped at the chance''
to help Craven's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to race. I want to race,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Money has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no. I like to win,'' he said. ``The money is nice and
you can make a lot of money, but anyone who drives for the money,
they don't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can an Alabaman like Allison and a New Englander like
Craven understand each other?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little dialogue problem there,'' Craven said with a
smile, ``but we'll overcome it.''

BUDDY BAKER SPEAKS FOR THE REGULAR FOLKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _Racing, it has been said, is all about common
people doing uncommon things.
</P>
<P>
   So, who better to bring NASCAR to the nation than Buddy Baker, a
self-described common man who has done some very uncommon things _
like driving winning race cars at 200 mph?
</P>
<P>
   As a racing analyst for CBS Sports, Baker, a member of the
International Motorsports Hall of Fame, will again provide analysis
for the telecast of today's Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sport that identifies with the regular folk,''
observed Baker's broadcast partner, Ken Squier. ``And Buddy's never
lost his common touch. He understands what people want to know, and
he's able to communicate that to them in a way that's easily
understood. He has a bit of that Will Rogers touch.''
</P>
<P>
   That Baker can so ably put viewers inside a car, or inside a
driver's head, is a tribute to his racing experience and his love
of motorsports. It isn't, he admits, because of innate broadcasting
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a passion for the sport, and you first have to have a
love for what you do,'' Baker said this week while trolling the
pits, preparing for today's race. ``That's really helped me along
in this job. It's certainly not my voice, or any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Baker's voice fits. A folksy Southern drawl, it reflects
NASCAR's roots. What's more, his down-home manner softens what is a
coldly technical and, at times, brutal sport. Baker's knowledge and
enthusiasm have earned him professional praise, while his frequent
``Buddyisms'' _ country-charming turns of phrases _ have set him
apart as a broadcast booth original.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a legendary driver, Buck Baker, Buddy stood out as a
racer long before he stood out as a broadcaster. With 17 wins on
superspeedways, (11th all-time) including a career-capping victory
at the Daytona 500 in 1980, he was selected one of NASCAR's 50
greatest drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his love of speed, Baker was the first driver in the
world to break the 200 mph barrier on a closed course. He achieved
that feat in 1970 in a Dodge Daytona. He also won 40 Winston Cup
poles, ranking him 10th all-time.
</P>
<P>
   As a driver, Baker was renowned for his preparation. He tries to
be equally ready as an announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out unprepared anymore,'' Baker said. ``The
people watching are far more sophisticated about what's going on
today. A mistake in front of 30 million people _ that's a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's plan: ``You have to learn the players first off, and
remember that you did this for 32 years. You say, `OK, what's he
thinking, what's he feeling in this situation?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. I've been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he never thought about a broadcasting career when he
was driving, Baker now says, ``I'm just as passionate about doing
well up in the booth as I was in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still comfortable in the driver's seat, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, I test a little bit in different race
cars, just so I know that I know what I'm doing,'' Baker says,
``and to keep up with the current race cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker calls NASCAR a ``family,'' and he has occasionally taken
on the role of mentor to younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come up and say, `I'm having trouble in Turn 1. The
car's slipping and gettin' in the corner,' '' Baker said. ``And
I'll know what it takes to make a suggestion that might help them.
Then, when they come up and say that that really helped, you know
how good that makes you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Squier said Baker has done a lot to make others feel good, both
on and off the track. Last year, at a small race in Vermont, Baker
took time to visit with each of the 100-plus driving crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went and talked to every single one,'' Squier said. ``He so
impressed every driver there. They'd never known anybody who'd won
major races.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's sensitivity was evident again last week, Squier noted,
when he was told that a 35-year-old man with spina bifida whom
Baker had befriended had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried,'' Squier said. ``Buddy was a tiger as a driver, but
he's a pussycat as a person.''

Martin primed to keep Texas Motor Speedway streak alive
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FORT WORTH _ If you are looking for a clear favorite to place a
wager on for the Primestar 500, Mark Martin is your man.
</P>
<P>
   Since Texas Motor Speedway opened, Martin has owned the place.
Not literally, of course, but the driver of the Valvoline Taurus
seems to know what the other drivers haven't figured out about the
1.5-mile D-shaped oval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people will attend today's Winston Cup race at
the ultramodern facility where Martin has found Victory Lane three
times in the three seasons TMS has been open.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's victory in the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 300 on Saturday
kept his string going in Texas, which started when he won the
inaugural Busch Grand National race at TMS in 1997. He returned to
Texas last year and won the Winston Cup event. The 40-year-old
Arkansas native is the only driver to qualify in the top 10 in all
three Cup races held at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a great chance to win here again,'' said
Martin, who will start on the outside of row 3 today. ``I've been
lucky enough to win three times here, and I would love to make it
four (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jack Roush fears the odds may catch up with his team, even
though it had a 1-2 finish last year with Martin and Chad Little
and another 1-2 finish Saturday with Martin and Jeff Burton, who
won the first Cup race at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extraordinarily lucky in Texas,'' Roush said. ``We
haven't had things happen beyond our control that would have
stopped us from winning, but I don't expect that string to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon hopes his string of bad luck doesn't continue at
TMS, one of only three Winston Cup tracks where Gordon has failed
to win. He hasn't come close at Texas, finishing 30th in 1997 and
31st in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tough place for us,'' said Gordon, who will
start behind Martin on the outside of row 4. ``We've had bad things
happen here, but with the changes in the track, I don't see why we
can't have a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the drivers feel differently about the track than they
did the first two years here. Finally, TMS has a racing surface to
match the finest facility in motor sports. That seems to be the
conclusion of the Winston Cup drivers heading into today's race.
</P>
<P>
   TMS officials spent $3.2 million on the racing surface since
last year's event to try to ensure a peaceful weekend without
driver complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the proof is in the effort,'' TMS general manager
Eddie Gossage said. ``We addressed what they asked us to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage and everyone involved at TMS can live without all the
negative things people remember about the first two NASCAR events
at the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, things began with a monsoon-like two-day storm that
made mud pits out of almost half of the parking area, causing a
massive traffic jam for the 185,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the unexpected driver complaints about the new
racing surface. The dual-banking setup left the drivers saying TMS
was a one-groove track that was too tight entering turn 1 and too
dangerous coming out of turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   Their fears became a reality on the first lap on the inaugural
Winston Cup race at TMS when 13 cars were involved in a crash on
the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   TMS officials spent $500,000 to make changes to the track, along
with paving most the grass areas of the parking lot that had been
made unusable from the downpours.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1998 race weekend came around, everyone hoped the
problems were in the past, but the track controversy had just
begun. The drivers continued to complain about the tight entrance
and exit to the frontstretch, but they also said a dip had
developed between turns 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts were being sold at TMS that read ``Shut Up and Drive.''
That caused friction between Gossage and the drivers, and even more
friction between Gossage and NASCAR president Bill France Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A bad situation became worse when a drainage problem on the
track caused water to seep to the surface in turn 1. France had
seen enough and warned TMS officials that NASCAR would not be back
unless corrections were made.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Gossage didn't hesitate on the decision to rebuild the
racing surface. The 24-hour-a-day project was completed in six
weeks, and the results have passed the test of the drivers this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is the best it has ever been,'' said Kenny Irwin,
who is on the pole for today's race at 190.154 mph in the Texaco
Ford. ``It's still a one-groove track, (but) it's more comfortable
getting around here that it used to be.''

   F-117A: THE FIRST STEALTH FIGHTER
</P>
<P>
   Overall Mission: The F-117A Nighthawk is the first aircraft
designed with stealth capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Current Mission: The current NATO air campaign against Serb
military targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Features: The F-117A's unique design as a single-seat fighter
makes it exceptional in combat. Its navigation and attack systems
is set up in a state-of-the-art digital avionics suite that reduces
pilot workload. Detailed planning for missions into heavily
defended areas can be programmed into an automated mission planning
system.
</P>
<P>
   History: The first F-117A was delivered in 1982, and the last in
1990. Only 31 months after the U.S. Air Force decided to develop
the aircraft, the first flight came in 1981. The lone F-117A unit,
the 4450th Tactical Group (now the 49th Fighter Wing, Hollman Air
Force Base, N.M.) began operating in October 1983. The Aeronautical
Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio,
combined the stealth technology during the development and
production process.

CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    With FIGHTER-BOX-0328; KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0328.

 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbian military authorities claimed Saturday night
to have shot down a NATO F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter jet and
broadcast television images of twisted burning aircraft wreckage --
a stark reminder of the tragedy and human cost of modern warfare
for which President Clinton has tried to prepare the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials did not immediately deny what
appeared to be the first loss of a NATO aircraft since the bombing
of Yugoslavia began four days ago. There were news reports late
Saturday quoting unidentified sources at the Pentagon confirming
the loss of the aircraft. But those sources had no explanation of
why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television images of the fiery plane wreckage clearly
showed a U.S. Air Force insignia and an ``Air Combat Command''
insignia that is typically displayed on Nighthawks. In addition,
there were unconfirmed reports from Italy that one NATO plane had
not returned to Aviano Air Base near the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavian TV reports did not include information about the
fate of the F-117A pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent downing of the $45 million F-117, which is designed
for missions into highly defended areas, came hours after Clinton,
in his weekly radio address, urged NATO to ``stay the course'' and
allied forces decided to expand their attacks to include Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with Serbian forces reportedly intensifying atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, a sign
that the NATO bombing has been ineffective in its objective of
slowing the Serb assault, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
vowed to pay ``any cost'' to keep NATO peacekeeping troops out of
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, weapons and television images suggested little
chance for a quick resolution to the conflict that, after four days
of intense bombing by NATO warplanes, is threatening to spread
beyond an area that Clinton described as ``a powder keg at the
heart of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president said the bombing of Yugoslavia was
necessary ``to prevent a wider war'' involving other European
countries, two Yugoslav helicopters flew over neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina before turning back when confronted by NATO jet
fighters Saturday. On Friday, also over Bosnia, NATO F-15 warplanes
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters that crossed over the
border about 25 miles from Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops
taking part in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targeting of Serbian ground troops in Kosovo, the
increasing flood of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia, the
Yugoslavian violation of air space in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
spreading protests in European cities underscored the dilemma NATO
leaders face: whether to send ground troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials moved swiftly Saturday to
dampen speculation that ground forces would be needed, especially
to stop the alleged ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serbian troops and
thugs against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accomplish our objective through air power,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,''' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing reports of atrocities in Kosovo prompted NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana Saturday to widen the range of
bombing targets to include Serbian tanks, artillery and troops in
Kosovo. In Brussels, Solana said he was ``determined to bring a
halt to violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian
catastrophe'' with what was dubbed ``Phase Two'' of the bombing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes
after meeting with his foreign policy team and speaking with
leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France.
``All the leaders agreed that . . . it was time to broaden or
deepen the attack,'' said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   This new phase of the NATO assault will be more dangerous,
however. To attack tanks and soldiers on the ground will require
NATO planes to swoop within range of Serb weaponry, which includes
1,400 anti-aircraft artillery, 100 surface-to-air missiles and an
undetermined number of shoulder-launched missiles similar to
American Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army, which numbers about 30,000 soldiers, have
waged a 13-month siege of terror that has forced more than 350,000
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson said an ``all-out Serb
offensive against the Albanian population'' of Kosovo has begun,
with scores of people murdered and villages destroyed. But he
insisted, ``This is not happening because of NATO. The violence was
going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea emphasized that NATO battle plans do
not call for the use of ground troops. But he also acknowledged
that air power alone will not entirely prevent Serbian brutality
against ethnic Albanians. ``It's not possible to do that from the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 NATO ground troops, including 400 Americans, are in
Macedonia training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace
settlement, but not as an invading, offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for the first time since the NATO assault began, air
raid sirens screeched in Belgrade as allied bombs rocked the
suburbs of the Yugoslavian capital. Still, Milosevic remained
defiant, issuing a statement once again rejecting any Kosovo peace
plan that includes the stationing of NATO troops in Serbia's
southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow at any cost the enemies to occupy their country,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said the Serbian attacks
on unarmed ethnic Albanians in recent days was ``all the more
reason for us to stay the course'' until Milosevic ``accepts peace
or we have seriously damaged this capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., questioned Clinton's leadership in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops must receive a clear military mission,'' Ashcroft
said. ``Our leaders must construct a a strategy and timetable to
achieve that mission. Third, our soldiers deserve an exit strategy
that can bring them home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Clinton's broadcast, a U.S. Navy ship fired two
Tomahawk cruise missiles at what a defense official called
``targets of opportunity'' near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the skies cleared after a heavy day of rain over Aviano
Air Base, more than 50 warplanes screamed off the runway for the
fourth straight day of bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With few neutral observers on the ground in Yugoslavia, it is
difficult to determine the extent to which the NATO bombing has
weakened Milosevic. The air raid sirens in Belgrade went off after
the explosions in the suburbs, suggesting that NATO had weakened
Yugoslavia's formidable air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said reconnaissance efforts were under way to verify
allegations of fresh Serb aggression against the Kosovars. He said
U.S. officials would turn over any evidence of war crimes to the
U.N. Tribunal in The Hague for possible prosecution.

   WASHINGTON _ Serbian military authorities claimed Saturday night
to have shot down a NATO F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter jet and
broadcast television images of twisted burning aircraft wreckage --
a stark reminder of the tragedy and human cost of modern warfare
for which President Clinton has tried to prepare the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials did not immediately deny what
appeared to be the first loss of a NATO aircraft since the bombing
of Yugoslavia began four days ago. There were news reports late
Saturday quoting unidentified sources at the Pentagon confirming
the loss of the aircraft. But those sources had no explanation of
why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television images of the fiery plane wreckage clearly
showed a U.S. Air Force insignia and an ``Air Combat Command''
insignia that is typically displayed on Nighthawks. In addition,
there were unconfirmed reports from Italy that one NATO plane had
not returned to Aviano Air Base near the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavian TV reports did not include information about the
fate of the F-117A pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent downing of the $45 million F-117, which is designed
for missions into highly defended areas, came hours after Clinton,
in his weekly radio address, urged NATO to ``stay the course'' and
allied forces decided to expand their attacks to include Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with Serbian forces reportedly intensifying atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, a sign
that the NATO bombing has been ineffective in its objective of
slowing the Serb assault, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
vowed to pay ``any cost'' to keep NATO peacekeeping troops out of
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, weapons and television images suggested little
chance for a quick resolution to the conflict that, after four days
of intense bombing by NATO warplanes, is threatening to spread
beyond an area that Clinton described as ``a powder keg at the
heart of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president said the bombing of Yugoslavia was
necessary ``to prevent a wider war'' involving other European
countries, two Yugoslav helicopters flew over neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina before turning back when confronted by NATO jet
fighters Saturday. On Friday, also over Bosnia, NATO F-15 warplanes
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters that crossed over the
border about 25 miles from Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops
taking part in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targeting of Serbian ground troops in Kosovo, the
increasing flood of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia, the
Yugoslavian violation of air space in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
spreading protests in European cities underscored the dilemma NATO
leaders face: whether to send ground troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials moved swiftly Saturday to
dampen speculation that ground forces would be needed, especially
to stop the alleged ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serbian troops and
thugs against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accomplish our objective through air power,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,''' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing reports of atrocities in Kosovo prompted NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana Saturday to widen the range of
bombing targets to include Serbian tanks, artillery and troops in
Kosovo. In Brussels, Solana said he was ``determined to bring a
halt to violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian
catastrophe'' with what was dubbed ``Phase Two'' of the bombing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes
after meeting with his foreign policy team and speaking with
leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France.
``All the leaders agreed that . . . it was time to broaden or
deepen the attack,'' said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   This new phase of the NATO assault will be more dangerous,
however. To attack tanks and soldiers on the ground will require
NATO planes to swoop within range of Serb weaponry, which includes
1,400 anti-aircraft artillery, 100 surface-to-air missiles and an
undetermined number of shoulder-launched missiles similar to
American Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army, which numbers about 30,000 soldiers, have
waged a 13-month siege of terror that has forced more than 350,000
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson said an ``all-out Serb
offensive against the Albanian population'' of Kosovo has begun,
with scores of people murdered and villages destroyed. But he
insisted, ``This is not happening because of NATO. The violence was
going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea emphasized that NATO battle plans do
not call for the use of ground troops. But he also acknowledged
that air power alone will not entirely prevent Serbian brutality
against ethnic Albanians. ``It's not possible to do that from the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 NATO ground troops, including 400 Americans, are in
Macedonia training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace
settlement, but not as an invading, offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for the first time since the NATO assault began, air
raid sirens screeched in Belgrade as allied bombs rocked the
suburbs of the Yugoslavian capital. Still, Milosevic remained
defiant, issuing a statement once again rejecting any Kosovo peace
plan that includes the stationing of NATO troops in Serbia's
southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow at any cost the enemies to occupy their country,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said the Serbian attacks
on unarmed ethnic Albanians in recent days was ``all the more
reason for us to stay the course'' until Milosevic ``accepts peace
or we have seriously damaged this capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., questioned Clinton's leadership in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops must receive a clear military mission,'' Ashcroft
said. ``Our leaders must construct a a strategy and timetable to
achieve that mission. Third, our soldiers deserve an exit strategy
that can bring them home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Clinton's broadcast, a U.S. Navy ship fired two
Tomahawk cruise missiles at what a defense official called
``targets of opportunity'' near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the skies cleared after a heavy day of rain over Aviano
Air Base, more than 50 warplanes screamed off the runway for the
fourth straight day of bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With few neutral observers on the ground in Yugoslavia, it is
difficult to determine the extent to which the NATO bombing has
weakened Milosevic. The air raid sirens in Belgrade went off after
the explosions in the suburbs, suggesting that NATO had weakened
Yugoslavia's formidable air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said reconnaissance efforts were under way to verify
allegations of fresh Serb aggression against the Kosovars. He said
U.S. officials would turn over any evidence of war crimes to the
U.N. Tribunal in The Hague for possible prosecution.

RANGERS LEFT BLEEDING, DAZED AND FADING FAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Every now and then, a single image seems to sum
up an entire game, maybe even a whole season. One of those images
could be seen here Saturday, late in Philadelphia's 3-1 victory
that helped reduce the Rangers' dwindling playoff hopes to rapidly
dying dreams. In the picture was Petr Nedved, the Rangers'
first-line center, on his hands and knees, dazed, with blood
pouring from three cuts around his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Near him stood Eric Lindros, big No. 88 of the black-clad
Flyers, his stick still in his hands, with 3 minutes 30 seconds
remaining in the game. Lindros just watched Nedved bleed until the
referee, Kerry Fraser, sent him to the penalty box with a
double-minor for high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rangers put five of their 22 shots on John
Vanbiesbrouck during the ensuing manpower advantage, they could not
beat him, or overcome the two goals by Valery Zelepukin and the
single tally by Karl Dykhuis. Kevin Stevens had given the Rangers a
1-0 lead on a fluky, blooper shot just 1:09 into the game. The
result left the Rangers six points out of a playoff berth with nine
games left.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Rangers General Manager Neil Smith said the team
would request a league review of the incident, which could lead to
a suspension of Lindros. Nedved said that hard hitting _ he took
plenty of it Saturday _ was part of the game, but that sticks
around the eyes were ``a different story.'' Lindros said: ``He
hooked my arm. I came back when my arm was hooked and,
unfortunately, my stick caught him in the head.'' Nedved needed
stitches for his cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he called Colin Campbell, the former Rangers coach
who is the National Hockey League's vice president in charge of
discipline. Smith said Dave Checketts, the president of Madison
Square Garden, will call Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner. The
Flyers, winners of three consecutive games after going 12 games
without a victory, are to play in Detroit on Sunday afternoon in a
network television match between two top contenders for the Stanley
Cup. A suspension of Lindros would be a courageous move by
Campbell, who has declined to suspend Lindros for other more
damaging incidents this season. However, Lindros was fined $1,000
for a stick-swinging incident in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect anything; I respect whatever they do,'' Smith
said, referring to league discipline and discussing Lindros'
history of rough play. ``Sooner or later, somebody's eyeball is
going to be laying on the ice, and he's going to be skating around
saying, `Geez, I didn't know I did it.' We've seen him do it about
20 times since he's been in the league.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nedved absorbed many hits during the game, some of them clean
and legal, as the Flyers tried to intimidate the smaller Rangers.
Earlier, Nedved was checked hard by Dan McGillis, Chris Therien and
Lindros. After Sandy McCarthy jostled the Rangers' Wayne Gretzky,
McCarthy and Craig Berube picked simultaneous fights with Chris
Tamer and Darren Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were physically stronger than we were, no question about
it,'' said Rangers Coach John Muckler, whose team no longer has the
traded Ulf Samuelsson and the injured Jeff Beukeboom, both rugged
defensemen. Muckler praised Nedved and his team. ``We didn't back
down,'' Muckler said. ``I thought Petr was awesome.'' Nedved led
the Rangers with four shots.
</P>
<P>
   The result left the Rangers with a 1-3-2 record in their last
six games and kept them six points behind Boston in the race for
the final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. With only nine
games remaining, the 10th-place Rangers also trail ninth-place
Florida by one point. They missed the playoffs last season and have
not missed the tournament in two consecutive seasons in more than
two decades. The Bruins were to play later Saturday night, in
Toronto. Either Carolina, which leads in the Southeast, or Florida
will win that division, and all divisional winners get automatic
playoff berths, meaning the Rangers would most likely have to catch
Boston to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Back behind the bench for the Flyers was Coach Roger Neilson,
returning from a two-game suspension because he threw a stick on
the ice to protest a referee's decision more than a week ago while
his team played its 12th straight game without a victory (0-8-4).
Despite their recent successes, the Flyers are still an anxious
team that has fallen from the Eastern Conference lead.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, one of the new arrivals, said Saturday, ``The whole
team played big and tough.'' Lindros added, ``On our losing streak,
we never lost all our confidence.''

STRONGMAN APPEARS TO PULL STRINGS IN PARAGUAYAN CONFLICT;
EX-GENERAL DENIES ROLE IN VICE PRESIDENT'S DEATH
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ Cashiered army Gen. Lino Oviedo has been
called everything from the savior of Paraguay to the president's
evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   With his fiery speaking style, Oviedo has played a powerful role
in the country's politics for a decade _ even though he has never
held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Oviedo was back in the headlines following an
outbreak of violence that threatens to topple the 7-month-old
government of President Raul Cubas, who faces an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Vice President Luis Argana _ one of Oviedo's
staunchest political foes _ was killed in the Paraguayan capital of
Asuncion by gunmen dressed in military fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Argana's backers accused the cashiered general of the crime and
clashed with pro-Oviedo demonstrators outside the Congress
building. On Friday night, police and army troops moved in with
armored cars, tear gas and rubber bullets. Rumors of a military
coup circulated. In the melee, four people were killed, and scores
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Paraguay's Tiananmen Square,'' said political
scientist Michael Carter, who noted that this landlocked South
American nation of 5 million people is normally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden bloodletting jump-started a campaign to oust Oviedo's
close friend and political protege, President Cubas. The lower
house of Congress impeached Cubas on Wednesday, and his trial in
the Senate began Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the country blames the president and Gen. Oviedo''
for Argana's death, said Walter Bower, president of the lower house
of Congress. ``Oviedo is the Al Capone of Paraguayan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo's political rise began in 1989, when he took part in a
military coup that ended the 34-year dictatorship of Alfredo
Stroessner. Toting a grenade, Oviedo marched into Stroessner's
quarters and demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   He became army chief under President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who
became Paraguay's first freely elected civilian leader in 1993.
Three years later, Oviedo led an aborted putsch against Wasmosy's
beleaguered government and was briefly jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his release from prison, Oviedo began his own run for
the presidency. He rose to the top of the polls by speaking
Guarani, the Indian language popular in the countryside, by
focusing on impoverished peasant communities and by espousing a
populist platform.
</P>
<P>
   He was disqualified from the race and sent back to the stockade,
however, after the Supreme Court ruled that he was obligated to
serve a 10-year prison sentence for his role in the coup attempt.
Oviedo was replaced on the Colorado Party ticket by his
running-mate, Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 1998 election and taking office, Cubas
immediately released Oviedo from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Vice President Argana, also of the Colorado Party, many
politicians claimed that Cubas had violated the constitution by
freeing Oviedo. They immediately began a drive to impeach the new
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This democracy is not working, because Cubas doesn't have the
least bit of leadership,'' said Juan Dario Monge, a Colorado Party
deputy. ``He is controlled by Lino Oviedo. He is simply a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the effort to oust the president, Argana was
gunned down. Police have uncovered no evidence linking Oviedo to
the crime. Still, many politicians accuse him of playing a role in
the slaying, partly because Oviedo has made violent threats in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   During a rally last December, Oviedo said he would ``bury
alive'' the Supreme Court justices who had upheld his conviction in
the coup attempt. Later, a group of his followers fired shots at
the windows of the court building.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Oviedo's popularity remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lino Oviedo is the only one who can save the country from its
misery,'' one demonstrator said last week. The protester wore a red
T-shirt with the defiant words: ``I'm for Oviedo and what of it?''
</P>
<P>
   One European diplomat said that, after decades of dictatorship
and unbroken rule by the all-powerful Colorado Party, Paraguay
lacks dynamic civilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paraguayans are used to having someone strong at the helm. And
the only strongman in the country is Lino Oviedo,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one Paraguayan newspaper speculated that Argana's
assassination may have been carried out by drug dealers in exchange
for receiving protection from the armed forces for their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo is said to have amassed a fortune as he moved his way up
through the military. Bower and other politicians claim that he has
been involved in drug trafficking, contraband smuggling and other
illegal activities, but they admit that they have no proof.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Western diplomat, another rumor making the rounds
is that a paramilitary group organized by Oviedo killed Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, who turned himself in to military authorities last week
at President Cubas' request, says he is innocent of the slaying and
points out that the assassination simply added to the momentum to
impeach President Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   Before Argana was slain, it appeared that the Senate lacked the
two-thirds majority vote necessary to oust the president. But
legislators claim that since the assassination, they have picked up
enough votes to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who are hurt by this are me and President
Cubas,'' Oviedo told the Buenos Aires newspaper Clarin. ``This is a
plot designed to destabilize the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cubas is impeached, he would be replaced by Senate president
Luis Gonzalez Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hundreds of army troops and marines cordoned off
the Congress building to prevent more violence. The smell of tear
gas and burned-out cars lingered in the air. Several legislators
reportedly wore bullet-proof vests as they entered the building to
begin deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the backers of Cubas and Oviedo said they would take up
arms to defend the presidency. Argana's supporters, meanwhile,
accused pro-Oviedo forces of placing snipers on one of the
structures adjacent to the Congress building.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared for his trial defense on Saturday, Cubas took
time out to calm people's nerves in a nationwide address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paraguay has always been a country of peaceful people,'' Cubas
said. ``Never again should we allow our ideas to be stained with
blood or to generate acts of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Those loyal to Oviedo and Cubas claim that the impeachment
amounts to a power grab engineered by former members of
Stroessner's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Argana, who was in line to become president had
Cubas been ousted, headed the Supreme Court during the final years
of the Stroessner dictatorship. At the time, the Stroessner
government held hundreds of political prisoners, according to
Soledad Villagra of the Center for Justice and International Law, a
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Posters have gone up all over Asuncion proclaiming: ``No to the
past. No to the dictatorship. No to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cubas is convicted, the Western diplomat predicted that
Oviedo would probably survive the controversy, perhaps by going
into self-imposed exile for a few years, then returning to campaign
for the presidency once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that he's going to go back to jail,'' the
diplomat said. ``What saves Lino Oviedo is that the entire
political class is discredited. There are no white knights.''

RODMAN LATE TO PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A no-go in the fourth quarter Friday night, a
no-show for 75 minutes at Saturday's practice, Dennis Rodman is
testing once more the patience and understanding of Lakers
teammates and management.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: He's still a Laker, for now. And still the starting
power forward, for today anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever's bugging him _ an unknown because he left without
speaking to reporters _ is resolved, according to coach Kurt
Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   After showing up at 12:15 p.m. for an 11 a.m. practice at
Southwest College, Rodman engaged in animated discussion with
general manager Mitch Kupchak while his teammates worked out. Then,
following a short film session that Rodman did not attend, he met
with coach Kurt Rambis for nearly 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a coach-player meeting. I think a lot of things
were resolved in there . . . to my satisfaction,'' Rambis said.
``Do I expect him to be late anymore? I won't know that until the
next time something comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   The tardy arrival _ which was unexcused and will earn him
another fine _ came less than a week after Rodman returned from an
eight-day absence during which he attended to personal business,
gambled in Las Vegas and drew fines of $100 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or no, Saturday's events followed Rodman's refusal
to re-enter Friday night's game against the Sacramento Kings, which
might have cost the Lakers a win.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis summoned him with about three minutes left, but Rodman
sent word, through assistant coaches, that his muscles were tight
from sitting too long. Minutes later, the Kings' Chris Webber
tipped in an offensive rebound for the winning basket, while the
seven-time rebounding champion sat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, who initially called the benching a coaching decision,
seemed frustrated over the incident but declined to say whether it
was related to Rodman's skipping practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's troublesome, or (if) I appreciate the
honesty that he is too stiff, because with some (older) players . .
. you sit on the bench a while, you do get really stiff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers long ago set up a stationary bike at Rodman's
request to let him stay warm and loose during games, and he has not
used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's the player's responsibility to be ready to
play,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman got his first start of his Lakers career on Friday and
will probably start again today against New York, but Rambis,
admitting he is ``disappointed,'' wouldn't commit to keeping Rodman
in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will talk about that further, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer can the Lakers tolerate the insubordination and
disappearances? If there's a cutoff point, Kupchak isn't saying.
But the team isn't prepared to waive Rodman just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an option for any player with any behavior that doesn't
seem to be working at that point in time. That's always an
option,'' Kupchak said, ``but that's really not something that
we're prepared to talk about right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he's late. It's not the first time he's been late,''
he said. ``It's not something that we totally did not expect, and
certainly at this point in time our position is that we will
tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it a problem for the team? ``Of course it is,'' Derek
Harper said. ``What are you going to do? It's not my place to worry
about all of that. . . I don't have time to be focused on Dennis
and what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rodman arrived, along with his talent agent Steve Chasman
and two bodyguards, he requested the meeting with Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our discussion, I understood why his frustration led
him to be late,'' Rambis said, ``and we worked through his
frustration to what I feel is our satisfaction. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it was a very positive discussion,'' he said. ``I
believe there's going to be a lot of positive things that will come
out of that discussion.''

U.S. PLANE REPORTEDLY SHOT DOWN OVER YUGOSLAVIA; SERB ATTACKS ON
ETHNIC ALBANIANS INTENSIFY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. stealth fighter plane reportedly was shot
down Saturday near Belgrade as the NATO alliance broadened its
targets to include Serb troops, tanks and artillery in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air assault on Yugoslavian positions had entered its
fourth day when Yugoslavian television reported that a U.S. F-117A
Nighthawk stealth fighter had been brought down by Serb
air-to-ground missiles about 30 miles west of the Yugoslavian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials here refused to confirm or deny the report
late Saturday, although television footage aired in Belgrade and
over CNN showed the wreckage of a burning plane. Serbs said it had
been identified as part of the 8th Fighter Squadron out of Holloman
Air Force Base in New Mexico. The identifying marks ``AF 806'' and
``Air Combat Command'' could be seen on the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The television report said that a search was under way for the
pilot, and that two other NATO aircraft also had been shot down and
German crewmen captured.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO officials said they were looking into the
report, but cautioned that the Belgrade government ``is a master at
propaganda,'' as one spokesman put it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Associated Press quoted a U.S. military official as
saying the plane shown on Yugoslav television appeared to be an
American radar-evading stealth fighter, one of the most
sophisticated aircraft in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The official said NATO headquarters had indicated to the
Pentagon that a plane had not returned from its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth planes based at Holloman have been flying from Aviano
Air Force Base in Italy as part of the NATO offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Italian defense officials also told local television reporters
late Saturday night that one fighter had not returned from its
mission over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reports of ethnic Albanian villages being razed and
civilians being executed by the Yugoslav army and security police
continued to filter out of Kosovo, heightening the concern of
Western leaders that thousands of people may have been slaughtered
since the allied offensive began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels said the expanded and
more pointed NATO attacks on military positions inside Kosovo are
aimed at trying to stop what one alliance aide described as the
``systemic and organized campaign'' by the Serbian-dominated
Belgrade government to wipe out the predominantly Albanian
population of the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton used his weekly radio
address to call attention to the ``brutal military offensive'' he
said is being carried out by the forces of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. He urged Americans to continue to support the
NATO operation designed to force Milosevic to accept a peace
agreement on Kosovo that Albanian separatists have already signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children. That is all the more reason for us to stay the course,''
Clinton said. ``We must, and we will continue until Milosevic
accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity to make
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked these people of Kosovo to accept peace, and they did.
We cannot let them down now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The intensified allied air campaign began shortly after NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana gave the order to U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark, the alliance's supreme commander, to ``initiate a broader
range of air operations'' directed specifically at troops and
weapons inside Kosovo. The order came after Clinton conferred with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other allied government
leaders by telephone. All agreed, said one U.S. official here, that
it was ``time to start putting it to (Milosevic's) forces on the
ground in Kosovo that are carrying out the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said the broader attack would include
strikes at tanks and other heavy weapons, army and police command
posts, supply depots and other facilities that provide back up to
the Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   But they emphasized that there were no plans to commit any NATO
ground forces to Kosovo. That position was stressed as well by
administration officials here and by British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Cook also shot down the idea of sending in ground troops to help
stop what he said was an on-going ``spring offensive'' by Serb
forces that Milosevic had been planning for months .
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the intention of committing ground troops,''
Cook said in an interview with CNN, adding that it would take
several months to assemble a force in the area large enough ``to
fight its way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook used the interview to warn Milosevic that he would be held
accountable as ``a war criminal'' for the killing in Kosovo when
the NATO operation dubbed Allied Force is brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO moved into what it called a more intensified phase of
the bombing campaign, air raid sirens sounded across Yugoslavia to
indicate the approach of allied aircraft and of Tomahawk cruise
missiles fired from a U.S. warship in the Adriatic. The Milosevic
government called for calm, telling people that the strikes were
being directed at military targets only.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials said that the bombing and missile
strikes Saturday night would be concentrated more and more on Serb
forces in Kosovo, they stressed that Yugoslavia's extensive air
defense system would still be hit as well.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders have given few details about the extent of
damage inflicted on the Yugoslavian military, but they said
Milosevic's air defenses had been severely hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, U.S. pilots returning from bomb runs to the
Aviano air base in Italy reported little resistance from the Serb
air defense systems. They speculated that most of them had either
been taken out or were being held back for use later when NATO
planes begin coming in ``lower and slower,'' as one pilot put it,
to make more precise hits on targets.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front Saturday, Milosevic rejected a plea from
leaders of neighboring states who met with him in Belgrade to press
the case for a peaceful settlement. But the Yugoslav dictator said
his country would never accept a peace plan that allows NATO
peacekeeping forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow, at any cost, the enemies to occupy their country,'' he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats reported that Milosevic had been pleased
to see reports of anti-American and anti-NATO demonstrations across
Europe in recent days, including demonstrations and assaults on
Saturday outside various embassies in London, Rome, Berlin, Athens
and Vienna. Some demonstrators clashed with police, burned U.S.
flags and shouted anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats also suggested that a statement of support sent to
him from Russian President Boris Yeltsin had only reinforced his
resolve not to give in to NATO demands.

DEVILS' RALLIES AREN'T ENOUGH IN A TIE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Two days after an important home victory
against Pittsburgh, the New Jersey Devils struggled to salvage a
4-4 tie Saturday with the Chicago Blackhawks, the worst team in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Even to gain the tie against a lowly team that was playing
without two of its best players, the Devils had to come from behind
twice in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison and Jason Arnott scored the goals after Petr
Sykora scored in the first period and Ken Sutton in the second for
the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was another disappointing performance at home for a
team that leads the Atlantic Division with 88 points and an overall
record of 39-22-10, but is only 15-13-8 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Devils were playing without Scott Stevens and Lyle
Odelein and did not have Martin Brodeur in goal, the result was all
the more disappointing considering that the Blackhawks were missing
Doug Gilmour and Boris Mironov and last week traded away their
longtime captain, Chris Chelios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh is a better club than Chicago,'' said Morrison, who
scored his 13th goal of the season. ``We should win these games.
The only good thing is that we came back in the third and got a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek was unhappy over the Devils' having failed
all five times in a total of 10 minutes with the man advantage
despite the fact that Chicago is the worst team in the National
Hockey League at killing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't work hard enough in practice,'' Ftorek said. ``If
you don't work hard enough in practice, it comes into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' power play showed some promise in the 5-3 victory
over Pittsburgh two days ago with two goals on three attempts. But
it fizzled Saturday afternoon, especially on the Devils' first
attempt, when they did not have a shot against Mark Fitzpatrick,
who faced 35 shots, including five in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils also looked insecure on defense without Stevens and
Odelein. Stevens missed his fifth game with a strained groin, while
Odelein missed his third game with a bruised right knee. Stevens
may play Sunday in Florida against the Panthers, who are fighting
for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play a sound game positionally like we usually do
and like we should in order to be successful,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chris Terreri made his first start in goal in 14 games and did
not look particularly sharp. He faced 26 shots, one in the
overtime, and allowed goals to Jamie Allison, Ed Olczyk, Dave
Manson and Eric Daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty good legs after being out for so long,'' said
Terreri, who could have prevented the goal by Daze, which went
between Terreri's legs for Chicago's fourth goal, 8 minutes 52
seconds into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it when Arnott scored on a backhander 21 seconds
later to complete the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago is a team not in the playoffs, and their players play
hard for a spot on the team next year,'' Terreri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back with two goals in the third, and every point you
earn is important,'' said Bobby Holik, who returned after serving a
two-game suspension for slashing and breaking the left index finger
of Igor Korolev of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri made his first start since Feb. 19 and took fewer than
four minutes to have an impact in this game. He denied Olczyk from
close range on Chicago's first attempt and in the same sequence
started the play that led to the Devils' first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri controlled the puck after the save and gave it to Brad
Bombardir, who sprang Sykora with a pass down the left wing. Sykora
skated in alone on Fitzpatrick and beat the goalie with a
backhander for his 25th of the season, 3:49 into the game, on the
Devils' first shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took control shortly afterward, and Allison tied it with
his second goal of the season, 8:52 into the game, when he
deflected Aleksei Zhamnov's shot from the left point past Terreri.
Sutton regained the lead for the Devils with his first goal, five
minutes into the middle period, when he beat Fitzpatrick from the
left side after a pass from Sergei Brylin. But Chicago took the
lead going into the third period. After Olczyk tied the score with
his eighth goal of the season, a power-play goal with 7:44 left in
the second, Manson gave the Blackhawks the lead with his fourth of
the season with 3:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have had plenty of success against teams in the
Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference, and nine of their
remaining games are within the conference. They have only two games
left against the Western Conference, against Anaheim and Nashville.

WALTRIP FINDS SPEED TO EARN CUP BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I can't count the times I've hunted down
Darrell Waltrip at a racetrack during the past three seasons to get
his opinion on the latest NASCAR phenom, some time-honored NASCAR
tradition, some hot NASCAR trend.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time Winston Cup champion and the Jeff Gordon of his
day, Waltrip has settled comfortably into the role of elder
statesman after 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday morning, the statesman was about out of breath.
Waltrip walked into the garage area at Texas Motor Speedway needing
to run the lap of his life. Fresh out of face-saving provisionals
under NASCAR's complicated qualifying system, Waltrip needed to
make the Primestar 500 on merit. On pure speed.
</P>
<P>
   Hate to admit it, but I didn't think he had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Move up the required 10 spots, to 36th, during second-round
qualifying? After failing to make any of the first five races of
1999 on speed? You'd have a better shot at finding an open lane on
I-35W headed to the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely when Waltrip went out and pulled a fast one
on me, and all the nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his crew changed a blown engine and after only two
practice laps, Waltrip qualified the No. 66 Big Kmart Ford 32nd at
186.554 mph. Instead of facing a roomful of media ready to write
his obituary, Waltrip looked inside himself and 'fessed-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was big,'' said Waltrip, NASCAR's winningest active
driver with 84 victories. ``Today was one of those times when you
have to reach deep down inside and say, `Can I do this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you got a car you know should be in the top 25 and
you're 41st or 46th or whatever, who do you look to? Do you look to
the racing gods? No, you look to the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is with a new team fielded by Travis Carter and Carl
Haas, and there is some leeway there for those intangibles known as
inexperience and chemistry. But Waltrip, 52, is well-aware that he
is the one element in this mix of men and machinery that has a
proven record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do any of you folks know who has the most poles of anybody in
the garage area right now?'' Waltrip said. ``Has anybody looked
lately?''
</P>
<P>
   It's Ol' D.W. with 59, most in NASCAR's modern era, which dates
from 1972. The flip side of that, however, is the fact that Waltrip
has not won a pole since November 1995 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
That was 101 Cup races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the garage have probably got more faith in me than I
got in myself right now,'' Waltrip said. ``I've been dragging
around, kinda having pity parties and feeling sorry for myself. To
walk through the garage and see the guys in there... I don't
believe I felt that good since I won the Daytona 500 \Rin 1989\S.
It was that kind of feeling. A feeling of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's investment plan
</P>
<P>
   You probably have a retirement program at your place of
employment. NASCAR Winston Cup regular Ernie Irvan has one where he
works, too, and it began paying its first dividend this weekend at
TMS.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Irvan is a 50/50 partner with Mark Simo in a
start-up Cup team. Two-time Busch Grand National champion Randy
LaJoie qualified the No. 14 Federated Auto Parts Ford 14th for
today's race, the first of an abbreviated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an investment,'' said Irvan, driver of the No. 36 M&AMP;Ms
Pontiac. ``If we can make this program work, and keep sponsorship,
it's an investment for the future. My deal is to look out for Ernie
Irvan 10 years down the road. I probably won't be a Winston Cup
driver 10 years down the road. If I'm not, what am I going to be
doing? Well, if you already have the process in place for owning a
Winston Cup team, then maybe you can make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan and Simo, who owns the No Fear line of sportswear, know
NASCAR is hot stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you crunch the numbers, it makes sense,'' Irvan said.
``We've been very fortunate to qualify for this race. We may not
make any more of the other seven we're supposed to run. But right
now, everything looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds on rebound
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner's 32nd-place finish at Darlington Raceway on Sunday
was the first pothole encountered by the 1997 Cup rookie of the
year and crew chief Larry McReynolds this season.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, driver of the No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet and fifth in the
Cup standings this year, crashed at TMS last year and finished
33rd. But that was before team owner Richard Childress switched
crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago, I was just about ready to quit racing,'' said
McReynolds, who was working with seven-time Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   They had won the season-opening Daytona 500, but Earnhardt spent
most of the weekend in Fort Worth complaining about an ill-handling
No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Daytona 500 on, it was a complete disaster,''
McReynolds said. ``It looked like we didn't even know what made a
car roll forward. I've never been a quitter, but we were struggling
so bad with the 3 team that I was looking in the mirror and saying,
`Self, maybe racing has just run off and left you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I even had some preliminary conversations with World Sports,
which handles TNN, TBS and CBS, about is there a future for Larry
here? Can we make it happen. I mean, I was that close to just
hanging it up.''
He did the math
</P>
<P>
   Roush teammates Jeff Burton and Mark Martin, winners of the
first two Cup events at TMS, started from the fifth and seventh
positions, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That is in line with statistics compiled by That's Racin'
colleague David Poole, motorsports writer for ``The Charlotte
Observer''. Poolefound that 62.08 percent of the winners at all
tracks currently on the Cup circuit started in the top five. That
bodes well today, then, for Kenny Irwin, Bobby Labonte, Steve Park,
Terry Labonte and Ward Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Irwin should be especially pumped, because 169 of
915 races (18.47 percent) run at current tracks have been won from
the No. 1 slot.
</P>
<P>
   Poole currently is compiling a NASCAR fan's guide for the proper
pronunciation of names of French Formula One drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Cope survives bubble
</P>
<P>
   The last driver to crack the Primestar 500 lineup by speed
yesterday was Derrike Cope, whose struggles with TMS date to last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cope crashed during first-round qualifying last April, when
water began seeping through Turn 1. He rebroke two ribs injured at
Atlanta Motor Speedway and did not attempt to requalify.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, he moved from 39th to 36th and into the field with a
flyer at 185.995 mph. Like Waltrip, Cope and team owner Chuck Rider
had no provisionals to cash in _ and a big-name sponsor to cater to
on race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting grayer and grayer by the moment,'' Cope,
driver of the No. 30 Jimmy Dean Pontiac, said as he waited on the
bubble. ``It's one of those racetracks where the margin of error is
very, very little.''
</P>
<P>
   Last words
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend proved a lot to me, it proved a lot to my team _
that we can do this, and we have to do this.'' _ Waltrip, after
qualifying for the Primestar 500 on speed

RAIN, WRECKS MARK MARTIN'S THIRD TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The racing surface is repaved, reconfigured,
revamped and gets rave reviews, but the latest NASCAR race at Texas
Motor Speedway produced something that looked a lot like a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   More wrecks. More weather problems. And another Mark Martin
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300 yesterday, his
third victory in the five stock car races at the track. He did it
because of the weather and the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Martin conceded he had no chance to win until Matt Kenseth
wrecked on lap 143.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no scenario could we compete with him,'' said Martin,
who won the BGN race in 1997 and the Winston Cup race last year.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to compete with anybody down the stretch because
he had the No. 60 Winn-Dixie Ford in front when rain stopped the
race after 163 of the scheduled 200 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was our lucky day,'' Martin said. ``We were in good
position to capitalize on the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, Martin's Roush Racing teammate, was second in the
No. 9 Track Gear Ford. He won the Winston Cup race in Darlington,
S.C., last week when rain shortened that event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd have won today's race, we'd have been arrested for
grand larceny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Green finished a hard-luck third. If rain had stopped the
two laps earlier, he might have had the victory. He was out front
when a caution flag came out on lap 152 because of a four-car
wreck, but he didn't have a third gear. He had no chance on the
restart, and Martin and Burton got around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third is a bonus for us,'' Green said. ``If the rain had come
a couple of laps earlier, it would have been a big bonus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this race wasn't a complete rerun of the first two,
problem- plagued years. This time, the wrecks and the weather
weren't the track's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The racing surface was wet because of the rain, not water
seeping through the track.
</P>
<P>
   And the wreck that decided the race was caused by a combination
of Kenseth's inexperience and zealousness.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth had far and away the dominant car. He moved the No. 17
DeWalt Tools Chevrolet from fifth to first by the eighth lap. He
pulled away from the field, leading by as much as four seconds. He
led 88 of the first 100 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt had everybody covered today,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as though the only thing that could stop Kenseth
would be the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the race was delayed more than 21/2 hours, and at
about the 110-lap mark, crews were anxiously watching the weather
radar to see if more rain was coming. Teams did not want to come in
under green-flag conditions and be caught in the pits if rain
started falling again.
</P>
<P>
   The race indeed turned on green-flag pit stops, but not because
of the rain. It happened because of a wreck between Casey Atwood
and Jeff Krough in lap 142.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had pulled into the pits, but knowing a caution was
coming, he exited without stopping to stay on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, who already had pitted and was a lap down, raced around
to try and get his lap back. Instead, he got caught up in the wreck
coming around Turn 4. He was sideways across the start-finish line
and went into the grass.
</P>
<P>
   The once-dominant car now had front end and side sheet metal
damage, and wasn't a factor.
</P>

   ``Matt was doing his best to get us back on the lead lap, and he
just overdid it,'' crew chief and owner Robby Reiser said. ``It was
just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the rain, Kenseth's wreck put a damper on Martin's
victory. The 40-year-old Martin has become the 27-year-old
Kenseth's mentor, and is expected to be part owner of a Winston Cup
team for Kenseth next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more disappointed to see him have trouble than I was
elated to win the race,'' Martin said.

   Adam Petty and Casey Atwood, both promising young Busch Grand
National series drivers, weren't yesterday. The inexperienced
18-year-olds were involved in wrecks and unable to finish the
rain-shortened Coca-Cola 300 at the Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, who started third in the No. 45 Spree Chevrolet, crashed
on Lap 86 when his car hit the wall in Turn 2. He had fallen out of
the top 20 before leaving the race. He finished 39th.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Petty was quick to blame his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just being young and dumb,'' said Petty, the grandson of
NACSAR legend Richard Petty and son of Winston Cup regular Kyle
Petty. ``I was trying to do something my car wouldn't do. I am
really down on myself right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's all my fault. I just got stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood's troubles stemmed from car trouble that led to driving
trouble. The driver of the No. 27 Castrol GTX Chevrolet had a
front-end vibration that wasn't fixed with a four-tire change. That
led to something breaking inthe right front-end of his car, forcing
it to get loose out of Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of control triggered a crash with Jeff Krogh's No. 56
Clearwater Forest Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars went around me, and something broke in the right
front and went and just took off into the wall,'' Atwood said. ``I
took out a bunch of cars. I hate it for everybody, but there's
nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting in the No. 18 position, Atwood finished 35th. He
was running in the top 10 before the crash on Lap 143 of the
163-lap race. _ Rick Herrin
GORDON CRASHES OUT AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in three races, Jeff Gordon got tangled up in
a wreck at Texas Motor Speedway. Yesterday it was during the
Coca-Cola 300 in the No. 24 Pepsi Chevrolet, co-owned by his wife,
Brooke, and Winston Cup crew chief Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had been running third, but the crew mismanaged its
mileage and he pitted around Lap 140. Moments later, the day's
fifth caution came out at Lap 152 after a four-car wreck involving
Bobby Hillin Jr., Barry Bodine, Phil Parsons and Jimmy Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves out of sequence and should've have been
running back there \R12th\S,'' Pepsi crew chief Patrick Donahue
explained. ``When you get out of sequence like that, those things
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 158, Gordon got tagged by the fallout from a Turn 2
tangle between the No. 3 AC Delco Chevy driven by Dale Earnhardt
Jr. and Jeff Purvis' No. 4 Lance Snacks Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   The race ended at Lap 163.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been that nice for us,'' Evernham admitted. ``But
we're lucky that car isn't in a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished the race in 13th place. _ Stacy Feducia
</P>
<P>
   TELECAST CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   The rain that delayed the start of yesterday's race by more than
2 1/2 hours also forced CBS to cut away from the Coca-Cola 300
before it was finished. The network shifted the telecast to The
Nashville Network, its cable network, at 3:14 p.m. That's when CBS
began its coverage of the NCAA Final Four basketball game between
Ohio State and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The race telecast had been scheduled from noon to 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to disappoint somebody,'' said CBS
spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade. ``But we're trying to satisfy the
biggest audience we can. It's really a numbers game.'' _ David A.

WINSTON CUP APPEAL
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Winston Cup drivers racing in the Busch Grand
National series was showcased in yesterday's Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   And they delievered with three Cup drivers finishing in the top
five, highlighted by Mark Martin's victory. Jeff Burton was second,
and Primestar 500 pole-sitter Kenny Irwin claimed fifth. More
impressive, half of the top 20 finishers were Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 43 drivers in yesterday's race will compete
today in the Primestar 500. _ Rick Herrin
</P>
<P>
   TYLER JET MAKES FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hammer, the crew chief for Rich Bickle's 10-10-345 Lucky
Dog Pontiac, had a tough decision to make yesterday. Should he make
a run in second-day Winston Cup qualifying?
</P>
<P>
   His car was 26th fastest Friday after pole qualifying for the
Primestar 500. The top 25 had locked in their spots in the field,
and 26th almost certainly was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the 26th fastest car after qualifying for the
Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300 stood on its time and had to use
a provisional to make the field when speeds improved the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer's decision was made easier after the morning practice
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only four or five cars had gone faster than our speed,''
Hammer said. ``Eleven had to do it to knock us out of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The car owned by Tim Beverley of Tyler stood on its speed. Four
second-day qualifiers went faster, but Bickle was safely in at No.
30, a relief for the team that failed to qualify at Darlington
(S.C.) Raceway last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start 30th,'' Hammer said. ``A really good day would be
if we can finish in the top 20. I'd be satisfied with that. That
would be another step forward for us.'' _ Simon Gonzalez
</P>
<P>
   STUNT DRIVER MISSES FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Barrett should have joined Hammer in standing on his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, driver of the No. 90 Suburban Lodge Ford, was 36th
after first-day qualifying and on the bubble. The first 36 cars
make it in on speed, with the final seven spots being filled with
provisionals, based on car owner points.
</P>
<P>
   Car owner W.C. ``Junie'' Donlavey and Barrett elected to attempt
to re-qualify yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we could run stronger,'' Donlavey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the wrong decision. Their lap of 185.573 mph was 41st
fastest, and the team doesn't have a provisional.
</P>
<P>
   If they had stood on the first-day lap of 186.136, they would
have made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this sport, but it's pretty cruel sometimes,'' Barrett
said. ``I came here to race. Now I'll have two qualifying laps
running through my mind for a couple of weeks. What if we had done
this? What if we had done that?''
</P>
<P>
   A disappointed Donlavey tried to look at the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have to fight that crowd tomorrow,'' he said. _ Simon
Gonzalez
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH CORNERS
</P>
<P>
   During Busch practice Thursday, Turn 2 at Texas Motor Speedway
was the turn that some drivers had some trouble negotiating.Turn 2
claimed some victims, but Turn 4 claimed some as well.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not because of the track.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six caution periods in the Coca-Cola 300 yesterday, five
were caused when cars hit either the wall in Turn 2 or Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The final caution of the day came out on Lap 158, when Dale
Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Purvis and Jeff Gordon were involved in a
chain-reaction wreck in Turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was checking up in front of me, and I could not get
slowed down,'' Earnhardt said. ``It would have done me no good to
get on the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Other victims who hit the wall in turns 2 and 4 were Lyndon
Amick (Turn 4), Adam Petty (Turn 2) and Casey Atwood (Turn 4).
Amick hit the wall after he made contact with pole-sitter Dave
Blaney.
</P>
<P>
   Petty damaged the front end of his car after hitting the wall,
and Atwood said something happened in the front end of his car
before he hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little out of the groove coming off Turn 2,'' Petty
said. ``You get out of the groove out there and you go straight
into the wall.'' _ Len Hayward
</P>
<P>
   G. BODINE FAST, SAFE
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine had one of the fastest cars Friday. He turned
the fastest lap _ 190.101 mph _ of any Winston Cup driver in
Friday's afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   But rain yesterday shed his speed in the qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, driver of the No. 60 Power Team Chevrolet, qualified
26th (the highest a second-round qualifier can start) for today's
PrimeStar 500 after morning rains forced him to play it safe. His
qualifying lap time was 28.504 after posting a field-best 28.347
lap time in the third practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted a good lap,'' said Bodine, who is 29th in the
Cup point standings. ``If it would have been dry, I would have gone
for a record, but it was wet and I went into a conservative mode.
There's no sense in being stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine said his practice speeds, all over 190 mph, came
relatively easy and said his team and the rest of the drivers are
aware of his car's ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car is faster than that, and everybody knows it,'' Bodine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, whose last victory came in 1996 at Watkins Glen,
finished 32nd in last year's Cup race at the Texas Motor Speedway.
_ Rick Herrin
</P>
<P>
   EARLY INCIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Dave Blaney said he did not have enough to keep up
with the leaders in yesterday's Coca-Cola 300. In the early portion
of the race, however, his No. 93 Amoco Pontiac was running well
enough to give him a good, solid finish.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 72nd lap, Blaney's luck changed for the worse. Blaney
and Lyndon Amick touched entering Turn 4, with Blaney suffering
some front-end damage that made his car tough to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, however, brought the race to a halt with 37 laps
remaining, and it helped the former Sprint Car champion end with a
strong eighth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did hurt \Rthe car\S quite a bit because it would not
handle near as good after that and actually it did not run as
good,'' Blaney said. ``The body was pulling so much air, but we
were pretty good early on because we rode in fourth there for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This finish was much better for Blaney this time in the
Coca-Cola 300; last season he finished 34th.
_ Len Hayward
TOUGH BUSCH LUCK
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lepage said he was wondering if Texas Motor Speedway will
ever let him finish a Busch Grand National race. For the past two
years Lepage has finished 40th or worse. In yesterday's race he
finished 43rd and had the distinction of being the first car in the
garage after leaving with less than 20 laps completed.
</P>
<P>
   In both races, the transmission has kept Lepage from finishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be that Texas just does not like me,'' said Lepage,
who also drives the No. 16 Primestar Ford in the Winston Cup
series. ``All of the sudden I got up to speed and it started to
vibrate and I thought we might have a wheel loose or something. We
came in and changed all four tires, and the vibration was still
there. At least we did not wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage has participated in all six Busch Grand National races
this year and yesterday's finish broke a string of two consecutive
top-10 finishes. The Vermont native came into the event second in
Busch points but fell to eighth. _ Len Hayward
</P>
<P>
   IMPROVEMENT FOR SCHRADER
</P>
<P>
   Look at the stats this season for Ken Schrader in the No. 15
Oakwood Homes Busch car and they don't look good. In three races
this season, Schrader has finished 38th, 18th and 38th.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, however, Schrader had some good luck and came away
with a seventh-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struggled here before, we have crashed and we have
taken 18th,'' the Winston Cup regular said. ``So right now, we will
take seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader added that there could be a chance for a second groove
to develop in today's Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second groove was trying to work, but that is one of those
things where the other driver has to work with you,'' he said. _
Len Hayward
TEXAS CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   The luck of Texas natives Terry Labonte and Bobby Hillin Jr.
varied in the Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   Despite coasting in with an empty gas tank on his first pit
stop, Corpus Christi native Labonte went on to finish 14th in the
No. 44 Slim Jim Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Midland native Hillin, however, got caught in the backstraight
accident that brought out the caution flag on Lap 152. Hillin
slowed to avoid a spinning Barry Bodine and was tagged from behind
by Brett Bodine. Hillin finished 34th in the No. 8 Clean Shower
Chevy.
_ Johnny D. Boggs
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The No. 84 Three Stooges Beer Chevrolet, driven by Ken Bouchard,
became the first car to withdraw from the Primestar 500 field.
Bouchard suffered a concussion when his car tagged the Turn 2 wall
in his qualifying attempt Friday and was transported to Parkland
Memorial Hospital. Bouchard remained at Parkland yesterday in
stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grissom, who finished 10th in the 1997 and '98 Winston Cup
races at TMS, replaced Tony Raines as driver of the No. 74 Bace
Motorsports Chevy in the Coca-Cola 300. Raines suffered a
concussion after crashing in Turn 2 during practice Friday and was
released from Harris Methodist Hospital yesterday. Grissom, who
failed to qualify for the BGN field as a replacement driver for the
injured Bobby Labonte, finished 40th in Raines' Monte Carlo after
encountering engine problems.

Duval tops survival test at TPC
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ In honor of the Final Four on
Florida's opposite coast, the Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass
decided to do its best Duke imitation and run up the scores.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you looked Saturday at The Players Championship,
there were big numbers. Even the new generation's king, David
Duval, wasn't above the ballooning scores, although his didn't rise
as much as most.
</P>
<P>
   Duval weathered five bogeys, but avoided any disastrous holes,
to shoot 2-over-par 74 and claim a one-shot lead going into the
final 18 holes today.
</P>
<P>
   This is all you need to know about how tough it was to play the
Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass on Saturday: Six players
broke par-72 and 14 shot in the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Long hitters saw their drives run off the hard fairways and into
hairy rough. Any shot missed around the rock-hard greens trickled
into ankle-deep rough. The result was a scoring average of 76.24
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval stands _ or teeters, as the case may be _ at 4-under 212
for the tournament, one stroke ahead of Phil Mickelson and Skip
Kendall. The 4-under total is the highest score to lead at The
Players after 54 holes since 1982. Nick Price, Scott Hoch and Colin
Montgomerie were two strokes further back at 215.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough out there and that was reflected in the scores,''
said Duval, who is threatening to win the tournament that is in his
back yard, just a few miles from his home in Jacksonville Beach.
``We just got kicked around. It played as difficult certainly as
this course ever has and maybe as tough as any course I've ever
played.''
</P>
<P>
   By any standards, it was a brutal day of golf. Generally,
Augusta National is considered as difficult a test of golf as pros
see. But the TPC on Saturday was in the same class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as hard and as fast as I've seen at Augusta,'' said
Mickelson, one of the six who beat par with a 71. ``It was
extremely difficult. I've never been faced with chips around the
greens where the sole purpose is to just get it on the green, not
getting it close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great mental challenge every hole. And there's a
certain amount of relief after each hole. But it's only
temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players didn't get relief until the sun went down and they
could get away from the TPC at Sawgrass. Even then, they had to
face the reality that, most likely, they'll get the same nasty
treatment today in the final round since conditions aren't expected
to change.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, everybody expected Saturday to be a
survival test. Even when he birdied two of the first four holes,
Duval knew better than to be lulled into a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   He was sailing along after those early birdies at 8-under par
with a five-shot lead on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But on the par-4 5th hole, Duval couldn't get up and down from
the fringe and it was the first of four bogeys in six holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to do this every week, not a lot of people would
play golf,'' Duval said. ``I knew we were in for a jolly good time.
You can access the greens. But you can't access the holes. And if
you miss the greens, it's pretty much an automatic bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worse. Joe Ozaki, who started the day leading Duval by a
stroke, was one of the 14 players who couldn't break 80.
</P>
<P>
   There were a ton of lowlights as scores rocketed upward.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was more exasperated than Davis Love III, who started the
day at 4-under par. He triple-bogeyed the first hole when he needed
four wedge shots to get his ball to stay on the table-top green.
Near the end of his round, he had a quadruple-bogey at No. 17 after
hitting two balls in the water. The bookend 7s nuked his otherwise
solid round. He was 1-under on his other 16 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Life was tough for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy Waldorf was 3-under par for the tournament as he reached
the 18th tee. Eight strokes later, he was licking his wounds with a
75 for the day and sitting at 1-over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Strange started the day tied for fourth place, shot 78
and called the course ``laughable'' because of the way it was
playing.
</P>
<P>
   The course was dry, hard and, if you weren't on the fairway or
green, you were in rough up to your socks. And there was a lively
breeze that blew at varying speeds throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days like this, you have to figure out the wind and then
deal with it,'' said Steve Stricker, whose 70 got him to even-par
for the tournament and was tied for low round of the day. ``I was
hoping for a good round and I have a feeling I'll move up. In these
conditions, everybody is going to face situations where you're
staring at the possibility of a big score. That's when you have to
cut your losses and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot even-par and was very happy with it,'' said Mark
Calcavecchia, who had a chip-in for birdie on No. 11 to anchor his
round. ``On the final seven holes, there were only two birdie
holes, 14 and 16. On the rest of them, you can forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the dust settled, Duval was on the perch of another
victory. He already has had two this year, shot a final-round 59 at
the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and been a threat virtually every
time he's touched a club.
</P>
<P>
   Winning in his hometown would be a nice addition to his
collection of achievements already this year.

UCONN IS TOO MUCH FOR OHIO STATE

 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Jim Calhoun pumped his fists twice and
then, one by one, embraced the players who had carried him to the
brink of a national championship. There was Khalid El-Amin, the
rotund point guard, and Richard Hamilton, the silky shooter. Ricky
Moore, the defensive whiz, was next.
</P>
<P>
   When he was through, Calhoun emitted just the slighest sigh and
burst into a smile. These great Connecticut players, who had made
the Huskies one of the favorites for the title since the start of
the season, played the kind of taut game that wins championships.
And finally, come Monday, the Huskies will help decide one.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the stellar offense of Hamilton and El-Amin, who combined
for 42 of Connecticut's 64 points, and lock-down defense from
Moore, Connecticut reached its destiny Saturday night with a 64-58
victory over Ohio State. The Huskies (33-2), in their first Final
Four, will play in Monday's national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the success they have enjoyed in the past decade, for
them to get a chance to play for the national championship is
fitting,'' Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   This team has been called Calhoun's most talented, and all
season the expectation was that Calhoun should make the Florida
flight plans early. But the Huskies have failed to put together a
dominant performance, struggling against Gonzaga even to reach the
Final Four. Saturday night, the many facets of Connecticut's game
fit together well, the defense feeding Connecticut's fast-break
offense to pound Ohio State (27-9) in transition and the offense
building such a big lead that Ohio State could not find its way
back. Connecticut had a nine-point lead with seven minutes left in
the first half but led by just 36-35 at the half. Then, the Huskies
opened a 10-point lead in the second half with Hamilton and El-Amin
leading the way and this time, the margin was enough for the
defense to take over. Ohio State hit just 8-of-33 field goal
attempts in the second half (24 percent) and struggled as if on a
slippery slope that kept getting steeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spurted and played terrifically well full court and then
when we _ particularly in the first half _ got a lead, we relaxed
on offense and then on defense,'' Calhoun said. ``We gave up easy
hoops and out-of-bounds plays and we allowed them right back in.
Coming out in the second half, there was no way we could allow them
to come back from 10 down that easy. They could come back, but not
that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came easily for Ohio State. The Buckeyes' backcourt is
the most important part of the team, scoring more than half of
their tournament points. Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd are the only
two Buckeyes who averaged in double figures. But Connecticut
identified the threat and then destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who was hounded by Moore all night, scored just 11 points
on 3-of-13 shooting and Redd, who relies on Penn to get him the
ball, scored 15 points on 7-of-18 shooting. Calhoun has maintained
that Moore is the best perimeter defender in the nation _ he said
Saturday night that Moore cut the head off the dragon that is Penn
_ and on one play midway through the second half Moore gave ample
evidence to back Calhoun's confidence.

<P>
   First, he stayed so close to Penn that Penn forced a terrible
shot that missed. Then, as the ball bounced long off the rim, Moore
retrieved it before it went out of bounds and launched a long
outlet pass to El-Amin. El-Amin put up a perfect alley-oop pass,
which Rashamel Jones laid in. That play gave Connecticut its
10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't let me breathe the whole time,'' Penn said.
</P>

<P>
   Still, Ohio State did not go away quietly and Calhoun's fear
that Ohio State would come back was realized.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a remarkable season for the Buckeyes, coming from
the bottom of the Big Ten last season to a stirring run through the
tournament. The Buckeyes played with all the tenacity _ if not the
skill level _ they showed throughout this season. They were down by
just 57-54 with 4 minutes 12 seconds remaining after Redd followed
a Connecticut shot clock violation with a layup. But then the poor
free throw shooting that has plagued Ohio State all season _ and
which at one point inspired O'Brien to call in a sports
psychologist _ resurfaced. In the final 2:53 of the game _ with
Connecticut's lead at four _ Ohio State was just 4-of-9 from the
line.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Huskies all the breathing room they needed. With
1:35 remaining, the Huskies worked the shot clock with Ohio State
trying to deny Hamilton the 3-pointer. Finally Penn, at 5-10, ended
up on the 6-6 Hamilton. Hamilton saw the mismatch and shot a
leaning 8-footer over Penn with just one tick left on the shot
clock. That gave Connecticut a 61-55 lead and, effectively, the
game. When, a minute later, Ohio State missed two straight shots,
Hamilton clenched his fists and finally smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our pride stepped up a little bit,'' El-Amin said.
``We felt threatened that their backcourt was going to try to outdo
us.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to worry. Connecticut had played the game it needed to
play. Perhaps it was still not its best game _ it was not as
flawless as the Huskies' crushing of St. John's in the Big East
final _ but it was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun patted El-Amin on the back as he left the dias in the
news conference after the game and that was all the celebration
there would be for Saturday night. There was a long sleepless night
of work ahead for Calhoun, work he said he was thrilled to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better basketball game in us,'' he said. ``I
hope we have it Monday night.''

 &HT;    Remembering TMI two decades after the accident
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In a matter of eight seconds in the predawn hours
of Wednesday, March 29, 1979, the nuclear power plant at Three Mile
Island in Pennsylvania went from normal operation to the brink of a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later there is still intense debate over the health
and environmental impact of the United States' worst nuclear
accident. The accident, in which the plant's radioactive fuel rods
were exposed and more than one third melted, effectively halted the
growth of nuclear power in this country.
</P>
<P>
   While 104 existing plants continue to operate, there have been
no new plants built since 1979. And many plants under construction
at the time, including the Zimmer plant partially owned by Dayton
Power &AMP; Light, were converted to coal.
</P>
<P>
   However, things could be changing.
</P>
<P>
   With coal-fired plants under fire for not meeting strict federal
clean air standards, the nuclear power industry is showing signs of
being reborn. Some industry and government representatives believe
the nation cannot meet air standards to curb global warming without
nuclear power in the mix. In fact, TMI 1 _ not the unit involved in
the accident _ was recently sold to a Pennsylvania power company.
TMI 1 has operated without incident since shortly after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power plants emit none of the so-called ``greenhouse
gases'' that spew from coal plants, but nuclear plants still
haven't successfully solved the problem of nuclear power, most
importantly disposing of the used, spent nuclear waste. The shadow
of Three Mile Island, and the even longer shadow of the accident at
Russia's Chernobyl plant, still hover over the industry. While
industry and government regulatory agencies like the Department of
Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission downplay the damage
done at Three Mile Island, outside Harrisburg, Pa., there are some
researchers who think the health effects of the accident were much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years is time enough for some hard-to-detect cancers to
start showing up. Researcher Steve Wing, an epidemiologist at the
University of North Carolina, thinks he sees statistical
indications that cancer deaths have increased in the areas downwind
from Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand the issues, first it is necessary to revisit
what happened on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and the investigations
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. on Day 1 of the accident, a pump supplying water to
TMI-2's steam generator stopped operating. Water serves two
purposes in a nuclear plant like the one designed by Babcock &AMP;
Wilcox at Three Mile Island: It supplies steam to the plant's
electric generator and cools off some of the intense heat produced
by the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's safety system shut down the steam generator. As the
reactor's coolant water temperature increased, a valve on top of a
containment tank opened as it was supposed to, releasing some of
the pressure. The valve was supposed to close 13 seconds later, but
in the first of a series of instrument failures and poor
communication between plant operators, it remained open for nearly
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Operators in the control room believed the valve was shut and
did not pump needed coolant water into the reactor. A ``loss of
coolant accident'' was in progress. Eventually, nearly one-third of
the plant's coolant water escaped through the valve.
</P>
<P>
   At about 6 a.m. some of the casings around the reactor's fuel
rods ruptured, partially uncovering the rods and sending
radioactive gas into the coolant water. Eventually, one-third of
the rods would melt down. The reaction also produced a bubble of
hydrogen in the containment building, which produced great concern
of an explosion for several days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   As radiation detection alarms went off all over the plant, the
incident was declared a general emergency at 7:20 a.m. Radiation
was released to the containment building and to the environment.
Estimates of how much radiation escaped into the air outside the
plant vary. Industry and government sources found that radiation
levels outside remained low throughout the accident. Critics
believe the releases could have been much higher downwind of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   WKBO, a radio station in Harrisburg, reported the story of TMI-2
at 8:25 a.m. Miscommunication added to the crisis. While officials
were aware of low-level releases to the environment, public
relations people from Metropolitan Edison, the plant owner, were
telling reporters there had been no release. The report added to an
atmosphere of mistrust. Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh, who
in the next three days would weigh whether to evacuate 600,000
people, was also not quickly informed of the release.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 2 of the accident, some children under 2 and pregnant
women were told to leave the area downwind of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Day 2, radiation levels measuring 3,000
millirems per hour were recorded above the plant. (An average
X-ray, by comparison, measures 10 millirems.) Also, Met Ed released
water from showers, toilets and laundry facilities into the
Susquehanna River, some of it contaminated. Company officials did
not inform the reporters _ who by now numbered in the thousands _
of the release, adding to the level of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials
received the results of an analysis that showed damage to the
reactor core was more substantial than anticipated. There was a
possibility of greater radiation releases.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thornburgh eventually decided that no evacuation was
needed, but continued to advise pregnant women and preschool
children to stay more than five miles from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, March 31, Day 4 of the accident, concern about a
possible explosion of the hydrogen bubble reached its peak, but
officials later determined that not enough oxygen was being
generated to cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous operator mistakes and miscommunications, coolant
water was restored to the reactor core, bringing it under control.
Today, TMI-2 remains in cold, monitored storage while its sister
reactor continues to produce electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history has
been the subject of hundreds of studies, but some question their
validity.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials concede that the accident was a result of
poor operator training and inadequate instruments _ faults they say
have since been addressed at the nation's nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit by 2,000 people living downwind of Three
Mile Island was dismissed in 1996 in U.S. District Court, and is
currently being appealed. Judge Sylvia Rambo ruled that there was a
``paucity'' of evidence that the accident caused ill health
effects.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Carolina researcher Wing, at the request of
the litigants, re-examined data from a 1990 Columbia University
study that found no increased cancer rates after Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the January 1997 journal, Environmental Health
Perspectives , Wing found lung cancer incidence elevated 300-400
percent and leukemia rates up by 600-700 percent among those in the
direct path of the radiation plume released at Three Mile Island.
</P>
<P>
   The report touched off a lively debate on methodology and
statistics between the authors of the two major studies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wing and the Columbia researchers, however, say further
health studies need to be done. The data used for both was
collected between 1981-85, too soon for some cancers to make an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said the Columbia report errs in assuming too low an
exposure rate from the accident and not including enough cancers.
Industry officials say that more than a dozen health studies since
1979, including a Pennsylvania Health Department registry of 35,000
people living near the plant, show no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more attention needs to be paid to it,'' Wing said.
``I don't feel the book should be closed at all. There is something
to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 book, Deadly Deceit by Dr. Jay M. Gould and Benjamin
Goldman, also claims that cancer and mortality rates in the areas
closest to Three Mile Island are higher than reported and suggest a
link to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of Wing's study, he said, is that it looked
at rates both upwind and downwind of the accident, and the rates
downwind are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes our re-analysis so interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said that in addition to collecting more health data, the
whole process of the nuclear regulatory agencies should be opened
up to encourage more community participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the first to say that our study doesn't prove by
itself that there were high-level radiation exposures, but it is
part of a body of evidence that is consistent with high
exposures,'' Wing said. ``The cancer findings, along with studies
of animals, plants and chromosomal damage in Three Mile Island area
residents, all point to much higher radiation levels that
previously reported.

EARNHARDT JR. SALVAGES FINISH IN TOP 10 DESPITE EARLY EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By David A. Markiewicz 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Even a couple of post-race peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches couldn't console Dale Earnhardt Jr. yesterday as
he stood outside his hauler in the gloom of a rainy spring
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the minor physical damage he suffered in a lap 158
crash that troubled him. It was the thought of wrecking his car and
failing to defend his Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300 title at
Texas Motor Speedway that was disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The crash ``wasn't that bad,'' Earnhardt said, ``but it was hard
enough to tear up a race car. We can heal bones, but it's a shame
to tear up them race cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt might have found some solace in the outcome, though.
The downpour that ended his day early gave him a 10th-place finish.
As Earnhardt knew, it was the best ending he could have expected,
considering the events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   As he climbed out of his No. 3 ACDelco Chevrolet into the rain
for the last time yesterday, Earnhardt had observed: ``If it rains,
it's a top 10; if not, it's junk.''
</P>
<P>
   His car might have been junk _ banging into Jeff Purvis' Lance
Snacks Chevrolet still left his car running, but not in good
condition _ but the result wasn't. The washout garnered him
valuable points toward a possible second consecutive NASCAR Busch
Series driving championship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``It's not the boost we'd like,'' Earnhardt said. ``We
won the race here last year, but the field was much tougher this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's day started with misfortune when his car suffered a
cut tire, and he fell behind a lap. He fought his way back to the
lead lap, but then came the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get back up to the front where we hadn't
been all day and went down into the corner and a couple of guys
checked up,'' Earnhardt explained.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt won seven of his 31 races last year while driving his
father's car. His TMS victory was the first of his career in 16
starts.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Earnhardt Jr. ranks sixth in the point standings
and is fifth in money earned. But it hasn't exactly been the cruise
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt attributed that to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the addition of a few Winston Cup veterans and a couple
more competitive Busch teams than we had last year, it's definitely
stronger each week,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``We're going to have to
get our stuff together if we're going to win this championship.''

 &HT;    Ohio State's magical quest falls short
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Scoonie Penn wore two new shirts Saturday
_ No. 35 and Ricky Moore.
</P>
<P>
   He wore No. 35 because he couldn't find his usual Ohio State
game jersey, No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   He wore Ricky Moore because Moore is Connecticut's 6-foot-2
senior defensive grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie, wearing all this new apparel, hit his first two shots,
then went 1-for-11 the rest of the way and Ohio State's first visit
to the NCAA Final Four in 31 years ended on the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   The final was UConn 64, OSU 58, in a national semifinal where
the concept of offense was as lost as if it dropped into one of
Florida's infamous sinkholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Ricky cut the head of the dragon off,'' said UConn
Coach James Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Moore on Scoonie, but that was the main
bottleneck because Scoonie starts every Ohio State play and ends a
lot of them, too. This night, Scoonie played with Moore attached to
him like a Siamese Twin.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said at first he didn't know whether he was going to put
Moore on Scoonie or on Michael Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after watching tape,'' he said, ``I knew as Scoonie goes,
so goes Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Moore wrap himself around Scoonie like a fur coat and
leave him only occasionally in the next 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got one or two open looks the whole game,'' Scoonie
said. ``Usually on defense, you'll find guys who take their eye off
you a couple of times. He didn't. Like when Michael would be there
at the top of the key ready to make his move, usually my guy will
go over and help out. Ricky never went over.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky didn't lose that number.
</P>
<P>
   In the UConn dressing room, Moore laughed when he heard that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I?'' he said. ``Redd can do that all day and I'm
not going over there. I figure someone else can help on Redd. I had
my hands filled with Scoonie.''
</P>
<P>
   Redd was also stopped. He got four baskets on fast breaks, but
out of OSU's regular offense, he was 3-for-14.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its head lying on the ground, the Ohio State
dragon staggered around and made life tough for UConn. Every time
the Huskies seemed as if they had the game in their pocket, the
Buckeyes rushed back. Just before the half a nine-point UConn lead
disintegrated to one.
</P>
<P>
   In the UConn lockerroom, Moore was furious. He began screaming,
``How can we let a 10-point lead get away?''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow guard Khalid El-Amin tried to calm him. ``Stop
panicking,'' El-Amin told Moore. ``You're starting to sound too
much like coach.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn built a 10-point lead at 51-41, but the dragon fought back
and cut it to 59-55 with two minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the killer play. UConn's Jake Voskuhl fumbled the ball
near the free throw line, then tried to tap it to El-Amin at the
sideline. But El-Amin had left the area. With no one there, Voskuhl
raced over and grabbed his own pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was traveling,'' said OSU Coach Jim O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the officials allowed UConn to call a 20-second
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies scored on that possession, the Buckeyes missed four
shots and four free throws in the last 1:42 and the turnaround
season, the improbable season, the magnificent season ended with a
thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from 8-22 one season to the Final Four the next,''
Scoonie said. ``It was a great accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not that big of a deal to me right now,'' said
O'Brien. ``The big picture is so much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, the dragon didn't die, it just went into
hibernation until next October.

KRAJICEK WINS FINAL AS THE BACKUP ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Before Richard Krajicek and Sebastien
Grosjean, the pair of marquee also-rans who toiled Saturday in the
final of what had become an anticlimactic men's event at the Lipton
Championships, marched out to battle on the sun-blasted stadium
court Saturday afternoon, they nearly had to ask permission to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis does not often treat its male conquistadors like
second-class citizens. But here at the Lipton, Williams-mania has
descended with a bang on the eve of the sport's first
sister-against-sister finale since the Watson siblings tangled at
Wimbledon in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism, and one Florida-based African-American family, rule
the roost this year.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Krajicek and Grosjean were able to wangle a
2-hour-39-minute lease on the stadium, and Krajicek, the hottest
performer on the men's tour but an uncomfortable performer Saturday
because of a queasy stomach, used it for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 7-5
victory. That solved the identity of the men's 1999 Lipton
champion; the identity of the women's champion remains a Williams
family secret until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams, whose two teen-age daughters, Venus and
Serena, will face each other Sunday for the Lipton's women's title,
already calls the pristine green stadium at this $7 million event
``Venus' house.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, his 18-year-old daughter Venus is the defending
champion and has beaten her 17-year-old sister in both their
professional meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Saturday that Sunday's showdown between the
sixth-seeded Venus and the 16th-seeded Serena, now undefeated in 16
straight matches following her brash semifinal dismissal of
top-ranked Martina Hingis, has the makings of a present and future
classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you probably heard me say in the past, my girls would be
No. 1,'' Williams said. ``We're planning so long, worked so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena is probably playing like the best player on the tour
right now, but I don't know if anyone could beat Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday the Williams girls lent the stadium spotlight to
the men.
</P>
<P>
   The history-making done by the seventh-seeded Krajicek, the
first Dutchman to reach the Lipton final, and the 74th-ranked
Grosjean, not just the first Frenchman but also the lowest-ranked
men's finalist in the tournament's 15-year tenure, rated on a
smaller scale than that reserved for the much-ballyhooed women's
finale. But certainly it was of pivotal importance to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The final represented the continuing comeback of Krajicek, who
underwent knee surgery last year and is still pursuing the
excellence he displayed when he served and volleyed his way to the
1996 Wimbledon title. It was also a breakthrough for Grosjean. This
was the first professional final for the 20-year-old Grosjean, who
had to be wondering if he would ever replicate the peak he hit in
his junior career when he reigned as the world No. 1 in singles and
doubles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both Krajicek and Grosjean collected high-stakes scalps during
their Lipton campaigns. Krajicek detonated his serve and demolished
Pete Sampras, who nonetheless reclaims the No. 1 spot. Grosjean
brushed away three match points and stunned top-seeded Carlos Moya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their opening set, the sniper skills of Grosjean, whose
razor-sharp passing shots from the backcourt had served as his
passport to this round, made inroads on the vaunted Krajicek serve.
After trading breaks in the third and fourth games, Grosjean rifled
a backhand crosscourt pass to gain a break point and went ahead by
4-3 when Krajicek netted his backhand approach. A forehand that
Grosjean knifed down the line brought him the opening set, but in
the second, the 27-year-old Krajicek soothed his nerves by
re-invigorating his serve and converted the set with a
match-leveling service winner.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek took a two-sets-to-one lead when a backhand return from
Grosjean clipped the net and skipped wide at set point of the third
set. They traded breaks midway through the fourth set, locking it
up at 4-4, but Krajicek got the pivotal break in the 11th game and
needed to serve for the match just once. With his 24th ace at match
point, he had his title. The victory elevated Krajicek to a
career-best ranking of No. 4 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel good, but I didn't panic, and I picked my points
to use my energy,'' Krajicek, who blamed his problems on nerves and
a stomach ailment, said. ``I was definitely not hoping for a fifth
set.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchman's successful, and somewhat predictable, performance
against the gutsy but outgunned Grosjean landed him his 17th career
title and extended his circuit-leading hot stretch to 13 of his
last 14 matches.

   His quarterfinal loss to Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten at Indian
Wells, Calif., is sandwiched between the title here Saturday and
one on Feb. 28 in London, where he soldiered through despite
attending the funeral of his friend, Menno Oosting, on the morning
of the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   While Krajicek dedicated his London victory to Oosting, a
doubles specialist and Davis Cup veteran who died Feb. 22 in a car
accident in Belgium, this title came under happier circumstances
and could be dedicated to his daughter, Emma, who celebrated her
first birthday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters insisted they would both celebrate on
Sunday.

<P>
   ``I really, really hope it's super tennis,'' Venus Williams
said.

THEY WON'T TAKE ANY MORE BULL
</HEADLINE>

By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether it's opposing teams, NBC or fans, the
Chicago Bulls no longer get much respect around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bulls played the Atlanta Hawks before 62,000 at
the Georgia Dome. This year, they played the same club before just
more than 8,000 at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But even the downtrodden Bulls place boundaries on how much
strong-arming they'll take, and that limit was reached this week in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The low point occurred when undrafted rookie Brad Miller scored
25 points in a 19-point Hornets victory, and went nuts after a dunk
by doing his ``Herman Munster'' dance down the court.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls forward Mark Bryant took offense, and hit Miller with a
flagrant elbow to the nose that bloodied him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller is a young guy and I think he will learn just to go out
and play ball,'' said Bryant, who apparently had a lesson plan
already drawn up. ``All the showboating isn't necessary. He played
extremely well, but being a vet, you can't let somebody make you
look silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the best play of the night was when Mark fouled
that guy pretty hard,'' Keith Booth said. ``Any time a team is
going to rub it in, you want to set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls weren't the only team giving protocol lessons this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Jerome Williams learned this when he stole the ball
from Milwaukee's Michael Curry, who was trying to dribble out the
game's final seconds of the Bucks' 115-86 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Curry shoved Williams in the back, and said his message for the
Detroit forward was, ``Don't try to pad your stats at my expense.''
</P>
<P>
   As if they understood, no teammate came to Williams' aid, when
he recollected himself off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought there was something that needed to be done, I
would've taken care of it myself,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Pay cut? Vancouver rookie Mike Bibby exhibited his youthful
innocence with a group of reporters in the America West Arena
locker room before the Grizzlies-Suns game last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After talking about the rigors of travel, and the continuous
games that take a toll on his legs, Bibby said: ``It's all right.
I'm getting paid more money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``!ital!More money?'' said teammate Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who was
sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that?'' seven-year pro Tony Massenburg said. ``He
got six-figures in college. He is getting seven now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby laughed it off, and shot back to Abdur-Rahim, ``Let's talk
about `Reef' at Cal.'' He then said, ``I'm talking about the per
diem.''
</P>
<P>
   Blow it up: After the Warriors played their last regular-season
game ever at the Sports Arena on Wednesday, Bimbo Coles was told he
wouldn't have to play there anymore (although the teams do have an
exhibition slated there next preseason).
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. They can blow it up if they want,'' Coles said. ``It's
a depressing building. You come in here and there's no energy in
the building, kind of blah. The biggest thing is I'm glad I wasn't
traded here, or I would have had to play here like another 15
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the ever-sensitive Clippers brass doesn't mind getting
ripped by a guy named Bimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Expert analysis: Charles Barkley doesn't have much respect for
the Eastern Conference: ``Take Miami and Indiana and Orlando out of
the East and you might as well blow the rest of them up,'' Sir
Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're terrible. We don't even pay attention to the East.
It's a dogfight out here (in the West) every night. Am I surprised?
Yeah, I'm surprised Miami and Indiana aren't 20 games ahead of
everyone else. That's the only thing I'm surprised about. And
Orlando started fast, but they're folding now. So you really have
only two teams over there, and that's it. Two. The West is brutal.
We don't even want to talk about the Eastern Conference, they're so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Return of KJ? Veteran point guard Kevin Johnson, who hasn't
played since leaving the Phoenix Suns last season, has informed the
Milwaukee Bucks he is interested in coming out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been the drugs: Heat coach Pat Riley dismissed
former Bulls coach Phil Jackson's belief that the champion will be
``tainted'' and the shortened season will not produce a ``real''
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the effects of that window pane that he
took in the '70s,'' Riley said. ``Those synapses don't fire like
they used to. What the hell does he know? He's stumping for Bill
Bradley, he should have no opinion on the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, smiling, added: ``I say that all in jest. He would love
it to be tainted because he was the only one who tasted victory the
last six years (actually 6 of 8). He doesn't want to give anybody
credit.'' &QL;

&HT;     US STEALTH FIGHTER DOWNED; PILOT IS RESCUED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Updates with loss of jet)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND LOUISE D. PALMER AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A US F-117A stealth fighter, the most advanced in
the American arsenal, was reported down Saturday night over
Yugoslavia in the first allied loss in four days of punishing
attacks intended to disable Yugoslavia's war-making machine.
Pentagon sources reported that a rescue mission pulled the pilot
out safely from Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
   The downing of what was long considered a virtually invulnerable
warplane occurred as NATO shifted its air war to concentrate
primarily on Serb tanks and troops in the separatist province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops, meanwhile, defied NATO's aerial siege and stepped
up their deadly attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
increasing pressure on the Clinton administration and US allies to
consider launching a ground war to halt the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning images of a burning plane, first shown on Serbian
TV early Sunday in Yugoslavia, showed tail markings that identified
it as part of a squadron based at Holloman Air Force Base in New
Mexico. Pentagon officials confirmed the loss of the plane but gave
no indication what brought it down. There was no further
information on the rescue of the pilot, CNN quoted Pentagon
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth fighters, which served with distinction in the Gulf War,
had crashed before because of pilot error or mechanical problems,
but never in combat. Serbian TV said this plane crashed west of the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, near the Bosnia border.
</P>
<P>
   There had been pressure to expand the targets and geographical
reach of the air war to a riskier phase to try to stop the Serb
killings of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A NATO official warned that
``dark things are happening'' in Kosovo, including reports of Serb
forces murdering members of the ethnic Albanian leadership,
rounding up and killing military-age men, and bombing and burning
villages.
</P>
<P>
   The developments occurred amid growing pleas from ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo for NATO troops to fight Serb security forces
on the ground, and US officials confronted the public's enduring
reluctance since the Vietnam War to commit US soldiers to foreign
wars. ``We welcome the strikes, but we demand that NATO ground
troops come into Kosovo as quickly as possible,'' said a spokesman
for the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for autonomy for
ethnic Albanians who represent about 90 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last week he had no plans to send combat
troops to Kosovo, and officials at the White House and Pentagon
Saturday reiterated his position.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton called for NATO ``to stay
the course'' in order ``to defuse a powder keg at the heart of
Europe.'' Clinton made no reference to the potential for US
involvement in a ground war. But in a letter to congressional
leaders that was released Friday night, he said he had dispatched
100 Marines to defend the US Embassy in neighboring Macedonia, and
he raised the possibility of sending an unspecified number of
additional troops to conduct operations such as combat search and
rescue, intelligence support, surveillance, and reconnaissance in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound military planning may also call for sending a limited
number of additional US military personnel to Macedonia in support
of ongoing operations,'' Clinton said in the letter. Although he
expressed confidence Saturday in the outcome of the NATO operation,
he reported no progress in curbing the alleged Serb war crimes. In
fact, Clinton said, ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed
men, women, and children.''
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson provided a bleaker
assessment. ``There are clear signs now that an all-out Serbian
offensive against the Kosovo Albanian people has started and
violence is widespread,'' Robertson said. ``The Serbs are
bombarding villages to the point of obliteration.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the brutality, thousands of Kosavars continued to flee to
neighboring countries. More than 250,000 people already have been
displaced, and the State Department Saturday projected that more
than 500,000 could be driven from their homes in the conflict.
Human rights groups reported that a Kosovo political nerve center
was burned down, as was a food warehouse operated by the Mother
Teresa organization.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, in forgoing ground troops,
ordered allied military forces to expand their attack by targeting
the Serb operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy could place NATO pilots at greater risk because the
jets and helicopters will be required to fly closer to the ground
to hit tanks, artillery, and mobile command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to begin the assault, dubbed Phase Two of
Operation Allied Force, was seen as an indication that NATO leaders
are confident the first stage of the attack crippled much of
Yugoslavia's air defense system and command and control facilities.
In Aviano, Italy, US combat pilots, speaking to reporters for the
first time since the operation began, expressed surprise at the
minimal opposition they have encountered. ``We have not seen
anywhere near the amount of aircraft weaponry employed that we
thought we would see,'' said one Navy pilot, who was not permitted
to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed off Saturday on the second phase of the operation
after meeting at the White House with his foreign policy advisers
and speaking with British, French, and German leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Solana gave the order to the supreme allied commander, US Army
General Wesley Clark. ``I have taken this decision with the support
of all allied governments, which are determined to bring a halt to
violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian catastrophe,''
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said warplanes and cruise missiles will continue
to strike military targets throughout Yugoslavia as part of the
effort to force Milosevic to accept a peace agreement that grants
autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In massive raids Friday night and early Saturday, NATO aircraft
flew 249 sorties, and Tomahawk cruise missiles were seen soaring
across the Belgrade skyline before they detonated. Serbian state
radio reported that NATO missiles and bombs destroyed a military
barracks, a munitions dump, and a telecommunications site. New
attacks began late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the strikes began, Serbian television
also reported that nonmilitary targets were hit, including a
factory and a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts of Belgrade.
NATO officials denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds also demonstrated outside embassies in Berlin, Rome,
Athens, Vienna, and London. Some protesters clashed with police.
Others hurled objects at the embassies of NATO nations. And some
burned US flags and shouted anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement over the NATO mission also festered among US
political leaders. Delivering the Republican weekly radio address,
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri said the Clinton administration
had yet to articulate a clear plan for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty obligates us to demand a clearly focused mission for
our soldiers,'' Ashcroft said. ``They deserve the complete
commitment of every American and the certain leadership of the
commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his radio speech, said maintaining peace in Europe
is a vital US interest. ``Through two World Wars and a long Cold
War, we saw that it was a short step from a small brushfire to an
inferno, especially in the tinderbox of the Balkans.''

THE ASCENDING SENATORS CRUSH THE DESCENDING ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Ted Donato's stay on Long Island was brief _
just five months _ but that was enough time for him to form strong
opinions on the New York Islanders' sad situation.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem? There has been too much player turnover,
Donato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a lot of moves over the last three years, so
there's not a lot of stability,'' said Donato, who last Saturday
was dealt to the Ottawa Senators for a fourth-round draft pick,
another player affected by the Islanders' salary dumping. ``People
look at the team and say, `Where's it going?' That's the problem
they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato returned to Nassau Coliseum Saturday night and scored
Ottawa's second goal as the Eastern Conference-leading Senators
embarrassed the Islanders, 7-3, in front of 11,491 fans. The
Islanders are 0-11-3 in their last 14 games against the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy, Joe Sacco and Zdeno Chara scored for the
Islanders. Wade Flaherty made 29 saves for New York. Marian Hossa
(twice), Donato, Radek Bonk, Aleskei Yashin (twice) and Andreas
Dackell scored for Ottawa. Ron Tugnutt made 20 saves for the
Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Senators,'' said Donato, a left wing who
underachieved in 55 games as an Islander (seven goals, 11 assists)
after coming from Boston in a trade last November. ``Ottawa has a
lot of young, talented players. Guys like Radek Bonk and Wade
Redden _ guys they've stayed with. And now they are starting to
reap the benefits. Now, they have the opportunity to be good, not
for one or two years, but for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders and the Senators were in similar positions three
years ago. They built young, talented teams through heady draft
choices. Both teams were full of potential, it seemed. But since
then, the teams have gone in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators were patient with their young players. They
nurtured them, let them grow together and learned to win together.
Now they are legitimate contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were not patient. Mike Milbury, the Islanders'
general manager, went for quick fixes, and that has got the team
into the predicament it finds itself in today. The Islanders are
the second-worst team in the National Hockey League, a hodgepodge
of veterans, journeymen and leftovers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At one time, the Islanders had Bryan Berard, one of the most
exciting puck-rushing defensemen in the game, but he was traded to
Toronto for goalie Felix Potvin this season. They had Bryan McCabe
and Todd Bertuzzi, but they were traded to Vancouver for Trevor
Linden.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that Berard, McCabe and Bertuzzi are not as
talented as the Senators' young players _ Yashin, Dackell, Shawn
McEachern, Magnus Arvedson and Jason York _ but they were talented
enough to build a team around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't here long enough to understand the whole dynamic of
what was going on here with ownership and management,'' Donato
said. ``I didn't have an understanding of the direction things were
going in. Having said that, there are probably guys here that have
been around for a while and don't understand what direction the
team is going in either.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also external forces, like ownership problems and
difficulties getting a new arena, that are dragging down the
Islanders, Donato acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a new building,'' he said. ``I think the people on
Long Island deserve it. A new building would show, `Hey we're
serious and we're going to be successful.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the new life last week's trade has given him, Donato
said: ``It's the best situation to go somewhere everybody's upbeat
and positive. This is a real fun time of year. Unfortunately, when
you're not going to the playoffs, like the Islanders, it's not fun.
So this is a great opportunity for me. It's a breath of fresh
air.''

DODGERS' JOHNSON DOES IT HIS WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Davey Johnson wanted to fish, play golf and
live a normal life, which he did after walking out on $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, however, he realized something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson needed baseball. He spent part of last year scouting
Ireland and Scotland for a Japanese team, but it wasn't enough. He
is a baseball lifer. He needed Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have taken any job,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But not just anyone would take (begin ital)him(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has always won, but that doesn't mean he'll always find
a job. He finished first with the Mets twice and won a World
Series, then spent two years without a manager's job.
</P>
<P>
   He won in Baltimore, making the playoffs both years, only to
leave the same day he was named the American League's Manager of
the Year. He didn't manage the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Dodgers did not want him. Not at first.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone enticed Felipe Alou into
considering the position only to have the Montreal Expos skipper
remain in Canada. Then, and only then, did the Dodgers pursue
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take much convincing on the Dodgers' part.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't care that he was the second choice. What matters
to Johnson is he was the right choice. Just ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of managers who would not have been as
prepared to handle this job as me, having managed in a major
market,'' said Johnson, alluding to his stint with the Mets. ``It's
a job, I think, for an experienced manager.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the quintessential Davey Johnson. His confidence borders
on cockiness, but there is much truth to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take a job, it's my job to solve the problems,''
Johnson said. ``It's my job to make sure there are no major
problems for the organization, for the general manager. That's what
I have to do. Basically, the challenge for me is to do the little
things that make the difference between winning and losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is all about the little things. He's about moving
runners over, about hitting to the opposite field. He's about
manipulating a bullpen, and sometimes his players. He is not about
the superstars because they will take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is detail-oriented but not obsessive. He isn't in his
office examining flow charts of every player, nor is he looking at
matchups to find out what his third baseman hits during Monday
afternoon games on artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's a baseball man with a mathematician's degree, a
combination that allows him to play the numbers game better than
most managers. He's a thinker, but he doesn't get caught up in
documenting everything.
</P>
<P>
   He might not sleep at the ballpark, he might not study film all
night, but he's always thinking baseball. Always.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very complex,'' Malone said. ``With what he's
been through, the experiences he's had, the opportunities, the
success, I would say there's a lot of complexity to him. I would
say that's a strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of people not being able to read him, or understand him
or misunderstand him, has probably been advantageous for him. They
may miscalculate his strengths and therefore he beats you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson way
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnson beats you. He wins his way. He loses his way. And
when the time comes he'll bow out, making you think it was his way.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson solicits the input of his coaching staff and his general
manager. He consults his players about potential decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to making a decision, Johnson has the final
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball, and decisions in baseball, are not made by a
committee,'' Johnson said. ``It's like anything else. You listen to
everybody, you delegate authority and you're able to look at more
areas, the whole picture. You get input from everybody you can to
make the best possible decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to make a decision on a pitcher, you don't
want to ask your pitching coach because you're liable to get in a
tie. Now, you have a tie, a deadlock, so you do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's also called a player's manager, though it doesn't mean
the players are running the clubhouse. It means Johnson gives you
his trust, until he sees fit to take it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're responsible enough to take care of your business,
he'll let you do it,'' first baseman Eric Karros said. ``Guys are
given their freedom to be responsible for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he's always been that way, even when he was
managing in the minor leagues _ where, of course, he won. Three
years of minor-league managing produced a pair of first-place
finishes, and he carried his approach to the Mets. In his first
year, 1984, he took a downtrodden Mets franchise and gave them
credibility by finishing second. Johnson won 90 games for the first
of six times. And during those Mets years an impressionable
teen-ager was hanging around the clubhouse. It was Gary Sheffield,
the nephew of pitcher Doc Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to learn about the game from watching the Mets
play the game when he was winning there,'' said Sheffield, now
Johnson's left fielder in Los Angeles. ``He's a fierce competitor.
He communicates well. He talks to you after every at-bat. He's
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 full seasons Johnson has managed in the big leagues,
he's never finished below second place. Among active managers,
Johnson's .575 winning percentage (985-727) is the best.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won the 1986 World Series title with the Mets and has
won five division titles.
</P>
<P>
   He wins, but not many people can figure out why or how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone can put a finger on it, as to why he
wins so much,'' Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina said. ``I
really didn't deal with him much. A pitcher's relationship with the
manager is much different than a pitcher and pitching coach. About
the only time I dealt with him was (on the pitcher's mound during
games). But I know he wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone didn't fully understand Johnson's managerial skills until
the two were united in Baltimore. Malone quickly learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to rest veterans when they need a day off, he
knows how to utilize his bench,'' Malone said. ``He knows how to
utilize his bullpen and he knows when to take the starters out. He
knows how to get matchups he wants. I don't think you can be as
successful as he has been without being well-rounded and strong in
a lot of areas.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flip side
</P>
<P>
   But with Johnson's winning comes his reputation for rubbing
owners the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets, Johnson's relationship with the front office
deteriorated rapidly. It happened right after Gary Carter and Keith
Hernandez ended their Mets careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Johnson parted less than two months into the 1990
season. The Mets haven't been to the playoffs since.
</P>
<P>
   It took Johnson, the winningest manager in Mets history
(595-417), nearly three years to land another managerial job. He
ended up in Cincinnati with owner Marge Schott in a relationship
doomed from the moment Schott's St. Bernard ran onto the Riverfront
Stadium carpet.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, who took over for Tony Perez in late May, won
division titles in his two full seasons with the Reds. At the close
of the second division championship, which culminated with an
Atlanta Braves sweep in the National League Championship Series,
Johnson left the Reds quietly so Ray Knight could take over.
</P>
<P>
   Schott didn't like the fact Johnson was living with his
girlfriend, who is now his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion he's the best manager in baseball at running a
pitching staff,'' said Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden, who
hired Johnson with the Reds. ``(Schott) wanted to fire him. I
respect ownership. You have to have loyalty. But he is a phenomenal
baseball manager.''
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Johnson wound up with another team, the Baltimore
Orioles, who were looking for a playoff appearance. That lasted two
seasons before public feuding with owner Peter Angelos forced
Johnson to think again about golf courses instead of baseball
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Orioles, Johnson won 186 games. And if not for an
overzealous kid in Yankee Stadium's right-field seats in the
American League Championship Series, the 1996 Orioles might have
reached the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no managing offers came his way. Not until Alou said no
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's detractors point out that along with Johnson's
victories come his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Johnson ruffles management is because he is
honest and strong-willed. Most owners are not willing to be told
how things should be done.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson moves on. He leaves because he knows only one way to
do it, his way. Besides, it works. It has worked for nearly two
decades at every level.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 56 and is with his fourth organization in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge, and I like challenges. I think
challenges are the spice of life,'' Johnson said. ``I think this is
a challenge here. I hope this is my last job. I admire and respect
a lot of people in this organization, being here. Where do you go
from here? I would say this is going to be it for me.''

 &HT;    Duke holds off Michigan State
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ If ever Duke, the seemingly-invincible
team , looked vunerable and ripe for the taking, it was at the 8:33
mark of Saturday night's Final Four semifinal with Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand, the All-American center who had been dominating the
game, was on the bench with four fouls. Michigan State's Charlie
Bell had just sank a pair of free throws to bring the Spartans to
within three points, 51-48.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was missing its free throws and looking a little uncertain.
A crowd of 41,340 buzzed with the possibility of one of the NCAA
tournament's most monumental upsets.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, guard Trajan Langdon showed why they call
him the ``Alaskan Assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure of a season of great expectations on the line,
the senior from Anchorage sank a a 3-point shot to put the Blue
Devils up by six. The shot appeared to have a calming effect on
Duke, which went on to win 68-62 and advance to Monday night's
championship game with UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (37-1) has now won 32 straight games dating back to
November 28. The Blue Devils will be going for their first national
championship since 1992 and their third this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the national player of the year, finished the game with
18 points and 15 rebounds. Augusta's William Avery had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils held Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State's
All-American guard, to only five of 16 shots from the field and 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   Up 12, 32-20, at halftime, Duke threatened to run away from
Michigan State in the opening minutes of the second half when
Avery's basket put the Blue Devils up by 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the Midwest Regional champions would not go away, fighting
back to close the gap to four, 43-39, on Thomas Kelley's layup with
13:29 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Duke got five straight points from Brand to go up by seven,
48-41, with 12:34 left. But then Brand had to go to the bench after
commiting his third foul with 12:04 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Brand came back after a TV timeout at the 11:12 mark, but then
picked up his fourth foul on a charging call with 10:12 left. Duke
led 50-44.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Langdon's big shot, Michigan State climbed back to
within four, 54-50, with 7:09 left. Avery then provided the
heroics, scoring five straight points to put the Blue Devils up by
nine, 59-50, with 6:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   Brand finally came back with 4:44 remaining and Duke holding a
seven-point lead. The Blue Devils had weathered the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Duke jumped out to a 12-point lead, at halftime behind the sheer
power of Brand, who outmuscled the Michigan State front line for
eight points and 13 rebounds in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While Brand was controlling things inside, Duke's perimeter
defense was holding the Spartans to nine-for-31 shooting (29
percent). Cleaves hit only one of his four first-half shots.

VAN HORN SITS OUT ANOTHER NETS LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With their best frontcourt player
cheering from the sideline ina slick three-button suit, the New
Jersey Nets turned in what may have been their most inspiring
performance of the season Saturday night at Continental Arena.
Keith Van Horn, his sprained right ankle too tender to play,
watched as a Nets lineup that included his new and unheralded
teammates, Jamie Feick and Mark Hendrickson, pushed the Cleveland
Cavaliers to the brink before losing, 109-99.
</P>
<P>
   With their great preseason expectations having drowned beneath
the rush of a 5-23 record, the Nets cannot be satisfied with a
moral victory, but they should receive a little consolation in this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets rallied from deficits of 13 points in the second
quarter and 10 points in the third to take an 84-82 lead on a
3-pointer by Stephon Marbury two and a half minutes into the final
period. It was nip and tuck for the next four minutes, but
consecutive 3-pointers by the Cavaliers and three monumental
turnovers by the Nets ended the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   After Jayson Williams answered a 3-pointer by Derek Anderson
with a layup to pull the Nets within 92-91, Johnny Newman sank
another 3-pointer to give Cleveland some space with 5 minutes 26
seconds left. Chris Carr, who had 19 points and nine rebounds in
his second start at small forward, turned the ball over on the
Nets' ensuing possession, and after Corie Blount scored to make it
97-91, Williams had the ball yanked away from him by Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Fouled on the other end, Kemp hit a free throw to put the
Cavaliers ahead by 98-91, and then Kerry Kittles turned the ball
over. Brevin Knight, Cleveland's point guard from nearby East
Orange, N.J., sealed the Nets' fate by hitting an 18-foot jumper to
make it 100-91 with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, hitting four 3-pointers for the second straight game,
led the Nets with 26 points and six assists. Williams followed with
16 points and 11 rebounds, and Feick, a 6-foot-8-inch forward who
started in Van Horn's spot, had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Nets
shot a season-high 47.4 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp led the Cavaliers, who made 30 of 45 free throws, with 26
points, including 12 from the free-throw line, and Knight had 17
points to help lift Cleveland (14-12) to its third victory in three
games with the Nets this season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Van Horn wanted desperately to play. He warmed up on his heavily
taped ankle but, realizing his attempt was futile, he stopped
moments before the game. The loss of his roughly 20 points a game
would seem to have doomed the Nets, but his teammates responded
well to playing without their lead man.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is averaging only 7.4 points, was impressive in
the first half, making 5-of-6 shots to score 11 points. A limited
player offensively, Williams reached deep into a bag of moves that
few knew he had and scored on jump shots, driving layups and one
running hook.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Williams did not want to accept that his
favorite teammate would not play. But when it was decided that Van
Horn would not go, he knew his game would have to change. ``I've
got to score the ball Saturday night, I guess,'' Williams said
before the game. ``I have to be a post presence. We're going to try
to post up Stephon and work through him, and I'll have to be more
offensive-minded as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the playbook of the Indiana Pacers, who
posted their burly point guard Mark Jackson in defeating the Nets
on Friday, the Nets sent Marbury down to the block. The 6-2 point
guard was supposed to post Cleveland's Knight, who is 5-9, but
playing with his back to the basket is not one of Marbury's
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first quarter, Coach Don Casey scrapped that game
plan and let Marbury return to the perimeter, where he drilled two
3-pointers to help the Nets stay in the game. Strangely, offense
was not a problem before intermission, as the Nets shot 52.5
percent and were remarkably in sync with the newcomers Feick and
Mark Hendrickson getting a good deal of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Defense, however, was another issue. Cleveland, always among the
league's lowest scoring teams, ran up 59 first-half points. Kemp
used his girth to draw fouls and hit free throws to score 10.
Wesley Person sank jumpers in adding another 10 points, and Knight
overwhelmed Marbury numerous times on his way to 11 first-half
points.

RODMAN IS LEAST OF LAKERS' WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dennis Rodman wouldn't explain himself to
reporters, so we can only imagine why that reboundin' fool showed
up too late to practice with the Lakers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he just hates to be around guys who can't get their act
together.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's shenanigans might be the team's most spectacular
problem, but he's far from the only headache for the team that
suddenly has lost back-to-back games at the Forum and five out of
eight overall.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gone haywire since a 10-game winning streak got
everybody's hopes up, so haywire that general manager Mitch Kupchak
said during the practice at L.A. Southwest College, ``To some
degree, (Rodman's unpredictability) is a `constant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was half-joking, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Rodman's fault the Lakers lost an eight-point lead
against the .500 team from Phoenix Wednesday night. It wasn't
Rodman's fault the Lakers lost a 19-point lead against the .429
team from Sacramento Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   His latest lateness _ a day after he mysteriously sat out the
fourth quarter against Sacramento _ forced Rodman and his (begin
ital)tres(end ital) -Hollywood agent to hold half-hour chats with
Kupchak and coach Kurt Rambis. Which is bad because it took time
away from straightening out everything else:
</P>
<P>
   The `F' in `D': The Lakers' defense failed completely in the
third quarter Friday, when Sacramento scored 40 points _ 22 on
shots in the paint _ making Corliss Williamson look like George
McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   How else could the Lakers lose a game in which they scored 109
points, shot 54 percent, had their highest assist total (29) in a
month and led by six in rebounds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense isn't skill. Defense is hard work and a mindset,''
guard Derek Harper said. ``We need to make defense a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The March 10 trade that brought Glen Rice and J.R. Reid to Los
Angeles, and sent Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte, cost
the Lakers their best defensive player. Only Harper, Rodman and
Robert Horry are noted for defense. Might the team be ill-equipped
to defend however hard it tries?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. You can play defense if Kevin is out there, if Mark is out
there, if Howard is out there, if Tim is out there,'' Harper said,
naming the reporters in front of him. ``Anybody can play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He's never seen us play, but we get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Complacency: Maybe having the league's best center, best outside
shooter, best rebounder and hottest 20-year-old guarantees nothing.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Now(end ital) they hit the low point of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we get a big lead, we have a tendency to free-lance,''
Horry said after the Lakers lost the 19-point lead to Sacramento.
``It's not just us doing it, a lot of teams do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be a championship team, we have to play defense
24/7.''
</P>
<P>
   That's 24 hours, seven days a week, not 24 minutes off, seven
minutes on.
</P>
<P>
   Cold Rice: Rice might be rusty, but he's also having to work too
hard to get his shots. He was 5 for 12 against Phoenix, and was 3
for 7 before four jumpers in the last 3{ minutes against Sacramento
revived the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, like Jones before him, doesn't always seem to be part of
the offense. Will that improve with time? Or is this proof that
with Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal dominating the shots column,
three's a crowd?
</P>
<P>
   Name tags: They have a new head coach, a new assistant, new
starters at four positions and a 50 percent roster turnover since
losing the Western Conference championship series last May. And
they've had only one break as long as two days between games to get
used to each other in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if these guys are a little
shell-shocked,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 4-5 since the Rice trade. Meanwhile, Charlotte is
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those stats can be misleading, or how do you explain
Cleveland being 5-1 since signing ex-Laker Corie Blount?
</P>
<P>
   Rambis must be shell-shocked, since he's been on the job a month
and is still surprised how much an NBA head coach has to do (all
those interviews!).
</P>
<P>
   His first elective lineup change, starting Rodman over Travis
Knight at forward, blew up on Rambis Friday when the Lakers were
outscored 16-10 to open the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the byplay with Rodman, who apparently refused to
re-enter the game, claiming his 38-year-old legs stiffened during a
long second-half sit.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis indicated the problem was dealt with ``to my
satisfaction'' when the coach and player met behind a closed door
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him, because there are other problems to solve. &QL;

U.S. PLANE DOWNED IN YUGOSLAVIA BUT PILOT IS RESCUED
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. stealth fighter plane went down Saturday
near Belgrade as the NATO alliance broadened its targets to include
Serb troops, tanks and artillery in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. military search and rescue team found and rescued the
pilot of the U.S. F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter, the Pentagon
said. Officials would not confirm what caused the plane to crash.
But Yugoslavian television reported that the stealth fighter had
been brought down by Serb air-to-ground missiles about 30 miles
west of the Yugoslavian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The television footage aired in Belgrade and over CNN showing
the wreckage of the burning plane and identified it as part of the
8th Fighter Squadron out of Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.
The identifying marks ``AF 806'' and ``Air Combat Command'' could
be seen on the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The television report said two other NATO aircraft also had been
shot down and German crewmen captured. German authorities disputed
that account.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO officials cautioned that the Belgrade
government ``is a master at propaganda,'' as one spokesman put it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. radar-evading stealth fighter is one of the most
sophisticated aircraft in the U.S. arsenal. It was bombing targets
in Yugoslavia on the fourth day of the allied air assault.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth planes based at Holloman have been flying from Aviano
Air Base in Italy as part of the NATO offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reports of ethnic Albanian villages being razed and
civilians being executed by the Yugoslav army and security police
continued to filter out of Kosovo, heightening the concern of
Western leaders that thousands of people may have been slaughtered
since the allied offensive began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels said the expanded and
more pointed NATO attacks on military positions inside Kosovo are
aimed at trying to stop what one alliance aide described as the
``systemic and organized campaign'' by the Serbian-dominated
Belgrade government to wipe out the predominantly Albanian
population of the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton used his weekly radio
address to call attention to the ``brutal military offensive'' he
said is being carried out by the forces of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. He urged Americans to continue to support the
NATO operation designed to force Milosevic to accept a peace
agreement on Kosovo that Albanian separatists have already signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children. That is all the more reason for us to stay the course,''
Clinton said. ``We must, and we will continue until Milosevic
accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity to make
war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked these people of Kosovo to accept peace, and they did.
We cannot let them down now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The intensified allied air campaign began shortly after NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana gave the order to U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark, the alliance's supreme commander, to ``initiate a broader
range of air operations'' directed specifically at troops and
weapons inside Kosovo. The order came after Clinton conferred with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other allied government
leaders by telephone. All agreed, said one U.S. official here, that
it was ``time to start putting it to (Milosevic's) forces on the
ground in Kosovo that are carrying out the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said the broader attack would include
strikes at tanks and other heavy weapons, army and police command
posts, supply depots and other facilities that provide back up to
the Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   But they emphasized that there were no plans to commit any NATO
ground forces to Kosovo. That position was stressed as well by
administration officials here and by British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Cook also shot down the idea of sending in ground troops to help
stop what he said was an ongoing ``spring offensive'' by Serb
forces that Milosevic had been planning for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the intention of committing ground troops,''
Cook said in an interview with CNN, adding that it would take
several months to assemble a force in the area large enough ``to
fight its way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook used the interview to warn Milosevic that he would be held
accountable as ``a war criminal'' for the killing in Kosovo when
the NATO operation dubbed Allied Force is brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO moved into what it called a more intensified phase of
the bombing campaign, air raid sirens sounded across Yugoslavia to
indicate the approach of allied aircraft and of Tomahawk cruise
missiles fired from a U.S. warship in the Adriatic. The Milosevic
government called for calm, telling people that the strikes were
being directed at military targets only.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials said that the bombing and missile
strikes Saturday night would be concentrated more and more on Serb
forces in Kosovo, they stressed that Yugoslavia's extensive air
defense system would still be hit as well.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders have given few details about the extent of
damage inflicted on the Yugoslavian military, but they said
Milosevic's air defenses had been severely hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, U.S. pilots returning from bomb runs to the
Aviano air base in Italy reported little resistance from the Serb
air defense systems. They speculated that most of them had either
been taken out or were being held back for use later when NATO
planes begin coming in ``lower and slower,'' as one pilot put it,
to make more precise hits on targets.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front Saturday, Milosevic rejected a plea from
leaders of neighboring states who met with him in Belgrade to press
the case for a peaceful settlement. But the Yugoslav dictator said
his country would never accept a peace plan that allows NATO
peacekeeping forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow, at any cost, the enemies to occupy their country,'' he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats reported that Milosevic had been pleased
to see reports of anti-American and anti-NATO demonstrations across
Europe in recent days, including demonstrations and assaults on
Saturday outside various embassies in London, Rome, Berlin, Athens
and Vienna. Some demonstrators clashed with police, burned U.S.
flags and shouted anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats also suggested that a statement of support sent to
him from Russian President Boris Yeltsin had only reinforced his
resolve not to give in to NATO demands.

YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SUPERSTAR IS A REGULAR JEFF
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ He is the Michael Jordan of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   At times, however, Jeff Gordon might as well be named Jeff
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has the big bucks, the cool shades and the handsome-
movie-star smile. But with the fan-friendly atmosphere of NASCAR,
Gordon, 27, is at times as relatively accessible as your next-door
neighbor. Any Joe Jordan off the street _ with proper credentials,
of course _ could walk into the garage area at Texas Motor Speedway
and shake hands with his favorite driver.
</P>
<P>
   Some Regular Joes have done just that this weekend. And the
hospitable Gordon, who has won three of the past four Winston Cup
points titles and has become the sport's pop icon, tries to
accommodate their wishes, shaking as many hands and signing as many
autographs as time allows.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who wears his wedding ring while driving, represents
``The Good Guy'' for many of his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Jeff because he seems to be a real good family man and
he is down to earth,'' said Mike Swanson, 40, of Dallas, who had
one of the special passes that allow fans to get near Gordon's
garage area. ``He doesn't blow off people who want autographs. He
tries to make time for people.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been tough for Gordon to make time this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He'll start eighth in today's Primestar 500 Winston Cup race. He
finished 13th in yesterday's rain-shortened Coca-Cola 300 Busch
Grand National race. He ran in the Busch series to get more time on
a track where he wrecked while running in the Winston Cup races in
1998 (finishing 31st) and 1997 (30th).
</P>
<P>
   All of the practices and qualifying have made for a taxing week.
On Friday, after a 55-minute practice for the Busch race in his No.
24 Pepsi Chevrolet, Gordon ran to his No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Finishes Chevy to begin preparations for today's Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a long weekend and it's hard work, but I enjoy it
_ I'm having fun with it,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   So is Eddie Gossage, the vice president and general manager of
TMS. Yesterday's race was one of only five Busch events that Gordon
plans to compete in this year. With today's Primestar 500, that
means racing fans will have two chances to see Gordon. And that,
Gossage said, translates into more respect for the track and more
revenue for TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ticket sales, we are already 16,000 ahead \Rafter
the Busch race\S of where we were this time last year,'' Gossage
said. ``We sell our stars, and that's why the ticket sales are
ahead, and part of that is because of Jeff Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   The TMS people have not had to do much to sell Gordon. The
people around him have done quite a job. He wrote his autobiography
in 1997. Earlier this month, he was on the cover of ``Fortune'' and
``ESPN The Magazine''.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks he is to be featured in ``Esquire'' and on
the CBS program ``60 Minutes II''. He makes 40 two-hour appearances
for his sponsors, which include DuPont Automotive Finishes, Pepsi,
Quaker State, Chevrolet, and Close-Up toothpaste. Of the 125 media
requests that he gets a week, he has time for just five. His
likeness is on billboards touting a youth magazine, soft drinks and
milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is great with people, and he doesn't complain about being
a star or the position he is in,'' said Charles Hudson, a
public-relations official for the DuPont side of Gordon's marketing
team. ``He knows that what he does helps the sport of racing, and
it helps his sponsors. But he is genuine. The way you see him in
the media or with his sponsors is the same way that you see him
when he's just sitting around off-camera drinking a soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is widely acknowledged as one of the biggest reasons for
the increased popularity of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has changed a lot of things, brought a huge awareness to
the sport,'' said Dale Jarrett, who has finished third, second and
third in the points races the past three years. ``We've always had
the crowd base from 25-65, but Jeff has brought the younger crowd,
10 years old and up. It is important for the sport that we get fans
at a young age because that'll give us fan support for a long time.
And then, you have kids much younger who want to be race drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-time NASCAR points champion Darrell Waltrip recalled that
he won nearly $875,000 in 1982 when he won his second Cup title.
Gordon earned more than $9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, I asked him for change for a hundred,'' Waltrip
said of Gordon. ``He said, `That ``is'' change.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are different now, and he's a big reason.''

USC'S ABDUL-MALIK MAKES MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik believes his
days at the position are over as he attempts to play outside
linebacker in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an all-season thing. It's a mutual decision with the
coaches,'' Abdul-Malik said. ``I think it's my best chance to be
successful to take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Abdul-Malik was a second-team All-Pac-10 performer
last season but was worried his weight (240 pounds) was too light
to play the position in the NFL. Ironically, Abdul-Malik wants to
lose 10 pounds to play linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   That means his position change sounds permanent, at least in
Abdul-Malik's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm adjusting to it well. It's going to be a short process for
me,'' he said. ``I was originally a linebacker in high school and
converted to a defensive end when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Abdul-Malik moving to linebacker, Lonnie Ford has now
switched from linebacker to defensive end. Ford was a tight end his
first two seasons at USC, but also played defensive end in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Making the grade: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward marveled at some
of the gossip he heard surrounding his absence from the football
program during winter practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard everything from I had drug problems to I was stupid
and I was throwing away my education,'' Soward said. ``(People)
really didn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas the punt returner: Freshman Jason Thomas has begun
working on punt returns in practice. It might sound strange for a
quarterback, but his speed makes him a natural returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be a real candidate to do that,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Helping out: Former Washington offensive line coach Steve Morton
is coaching USC's tight ends in spring practice, but he has not
accepted the job full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, who interviewed for but did not get the head-coaching
position at the University of North Dakota this week, will wait to
see if he can get an offensive line position at another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm volunteering right now,'' Morton said. ``I was looking for
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton is still being paid by Washington through June, which is
the earliest USC could begin paying him if he accepts the job.

BLOWING THE WHISTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers don't exactly require assistance in
the art of losing, but plenty of NBA employees keep volunteering to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit Z was Friday's loss to the SuperSoncis in Seattle, where
the home team attempted 36 free throws, while the Clippers squeezed
off 14.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the count was 11-10, Sonics, but the zebras gave a
clutch performance down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   One non-call that was of grim fourth-quarter consequence to the
Clippers involved point guard Darrick Martin, whose arm was whacked
by Seattle All-Star Gary Payton. The ball went out of bounds, but
was awarded to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took the high road when the subject was brought up before
Saturday's game vs. Utah at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make some plays so we don't leave it (outcome) in
somebody's else's hands,'' Martin said of the less-than-friendly
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   subhead Sore points
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who hyperextended his left knee in Wednesday's loss to
Golden State, played 31 minutes Friday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still about 80 percent,'' he said, referring to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   His backup du jour is Troy Hudson, who - including the Jazz game
-is three games into a post-CBA, 10-day contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson played 17 minutes in Seattle, and scored five points
before fouling out in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his first after leaving Southern Illinois following
his junior season, he played eight games for the Jazz while John
Stockton was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot playing against Stockton while I was there,''
said Hudson, whose education was accelerated by Payton on Friday.
``He's very aggressive and really smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran point guard Pooh Richardson is scheduled to bring his
tender ankle off the injured list for Monday's game in Denver. Yet
another injured point guard, Sherman Douglas (thigh), is required
to spend two more games on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Forwards backward
</P>
<P>
   Forward Rodney Rogers missed Saturday's game with a contusion of
the right knee he acquired against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Maurice Taylor rolled his right ankle in the same game,
but returned and finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor remained a bit gimpy Saturday, but was in the lineup
against Utah.

BLAZING A NEW TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A roll call of the 12 Portland Trail Blazers may sound a pinch
less than dirty, but it wouldn't be a shock to learn they are being
coached by Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some Blazers are swell citizens, but let's just say one or
two others are quite aware that Miranda is not the last name of a
woman who worked with a pile of fruit strapped to her head.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team with a record ... the best in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A cinch explanation for this is an abundance of talent; the
Blazers have more depth than beatnik poetry. Thanks to the shrewd
maneuvers of Prez/GM Bob Whitsitt, the roster includes nine former
NBA lottery picks, although none of the original selections
belonged to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   This haul has left Coach Mike Dunleavy with a squad that is
two-deep at each position:
</P>
<P>
   The shooting (and we do not use the term loosely) guards are
Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson. Glower forward is maintained by Brian
Grant and Rasheed Wallace, with bouncy Jermaine O'Neal - in his
third season after skipping from high school to the NBA - in the
wings. Arvydas Sabonis occupies the center position, backed by
shot-blocker Kelvin Cato. Small forward is where you'll find scorer
Walt Williams and defensive mercenary Stacey Augmon. The point
guards are jitterbug Damon Stoudamire and veteran Greg Anthony, who
applies more defensive pressure than a mother-in-law who's overdue
for grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing these guys to share the wealth could put Dunleavy in
line for Coach of the Year. The strategy for beating
post-lockout-schedule fatigue (and opponents) with superior numbers
is much easier to sell, of course, as the victories pile up.
Without such success, this team might turn into the Donner Party.
</P>
<P>
   But don't pencil in Portland as the Western Conference's top
seed just yet. The Blazers, whose bills are settled by Paul Allen,
have zoomed through the season's opening half on a schedule that
was a bit Microsoft. Half two includes four games with the Lakers,
three with San Antonio and three with Vin Baker-less Seattle. There
is a solo trip to Houston and a game in Utah, where the Jazz could
be in position to annex the conference's catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   One place you won't find the Blazes is the lottery, but Whitsitt
may have the Clippers and Grizzlies on speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead No Shanghai surprise
</P>
<P>
   The next NBA Draft - which looks brutally deficient at the
center position - may receive an upgrade from China.
</P>
<P>
   (Editor's note: insert drum roll here). And now ... the starting
lineup for your Shanghai Sharks (a professional club team) includes
a 7-foot-5, 18 year old named Yao Ming, who may decide to chase his
dream of playing in the NBA this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being worked on right now,'' said one NBA scout who
recently traveled to China for a look at Ming. ``He could be in the
NBA next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in the hyperbole that zings around basketball
campfires, Ming could be the biggest thing to leave China since the
U.K.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not exactly anonymous in the United States, having
impressed the sharpies at last summer's Nike Camp in Indianapolis.
He also played center for a San Diego-based team that participated
in several U.S. tournaments last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good,'' said the scout of the 270-pound Ming. ``He
needs some upper-body strength and some work playing with his back
to the basket, but he could be outstanding. At the worst, he's Rik
Smits.''
</P>
<P>
   (Editor's note: Smits is the Dutch-born Indiana Pacer who has
averaged 15 points per game through 10 NBA seasons; if you're
looking for a center, you could do a lot worse.)
</P>
<P>
   subhead Con-Vince-d
</P>
<P>
   With a slight bow to a few unlawful dribbling escapades by
Sacramento King Jason Williams, the most electrifying rookie to hit
the NBA is Toronto's Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his eye-popping athletic ability, many NBA watchdogs
questioned the 6-foot-7 Carter's shooting skill. Let's see ... the
kid made 41 percent of his 3-point attempts as a junior at
Carolina. Considering his talent and fierce approach to competing,
that would have been good enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Carter's success is the Raptors' decision to keep
him at forward. Yeah, Carter has the requisite speed and quickness
to play guard, but the switch would have made matching up more of a
problem for him than for the other team.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers couldn't resist the temptation of moving Jerry
Stackhouse to guard, even though the 6-6 ex-Tar Heel had - like
Carter -- been used exclusively at forward in college.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell if this Carter can lead the Raptors to the
promised land with the same drama presented by Joe Carter and the
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   If, as his nickname suggests, Allen Iverson is The Answer, the
question must be: ``Who thrilled the league office by firing
super-agent David Falk?'' ... Losing Antonio McDyess and John ``Hot
Rod'' Williams and replacing them with Tom Gugilotta and Luc
Longley has not worked wonders for the Phoenix fast break. Jason
Kidd must feel like Jeff Gordon behind the wheel of a station
wagon. ...The Utah Jazz payroll is the league's fourth lowest;
obviously, their favorite play is not the pick-and-bankroll. ...
Eleven starting NBA centers (38 percent) were born outside the U.S.
The number does not include the Pistons' center, who was born in
Fresno as Brian Williams, then re-born on a cliff in Tibet as Bison
Dele.

THIS TIME, SHAQ'S JABS HIT EWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal's rotating rivalry _ he's gone
through David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Greg Ostertag and Olden
Polynice _ lands today on Patrick Ewing. O'Neal's pro wrestling
bravado was aimed at the Knicks' center in a Sports Illustrated
article published last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's somebody I really don't like, especially since the
lockout,'' O'Neal said of Ewing, the players union president. ``Let
me tell you this: Patrick and his Georgetown boys messed up the
lockout. Georgetown is supposed to be a five-star university? Yeah,
right. That's why he and Zo (Alonzo Mourning) were trying to play
lawyer, trying to intimidate billionaires like (Portland owner)
Paul Allen. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's response? ``I'll see him on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers prepared for the Knicks, O'Neal said he's not
concerned about firing up Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just do what I do to all the other big men, play hard and
whoop their (butts). If he comes with extra, then I come with
extra,'' he said. ``Let me tell you something, no human can break
me down. If he wants to fight, we can fight. If he wants to go to
war, we can just go to war. I back down to no man. He puts his
drawers on the same way I put my damn Calvin Klein drawers on.''
</P>
<P>
   Big bench: Overshadowed in Friday's loss to Sacramento was one
of the best performances of the season from the Lakers' reserves.
In fact, it was almost entirely bench players who built the
double-digit first-half lead that was later squandered in the third
quarter by the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox, J.R. Reid, Derek Fisher and Robert Horry entered the
game late in the first quarter, joining starter Kobe Bryant, and
the group scored 20 points in four minutes to take a 30-20 lead by
the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Fisher each sunk a pair of 3-pointers in the run for 12
quick points, while Bryant added seven. Defensively, Fox, Horry and
Bryant all blocked shot attempts, and Fisher added a steal.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, the bench finished with 27 points (13 from Fox),
20 of the Lakers' 42 rebounds and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Missing: Dennis Rodman wasn't the only Laker missing from
Saturday's practice. Backup center Sean Rooks, who hasn't played
the last two games, was excused from practice to attend to personal
matters, according to the team.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO lost an F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter over
the skies of Yugoslavia Saturday evening, but the unidentified
pilot was rescued safely and returned to an allied military base.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced the rescue and
reiterated that the loss of the plane, the most advanced in the
U.S. arsenal, had not dampened NATO resolve in the clash with
Yugoslavian President Molosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said it has not been determined whether the F-117A was hit
by Yugoslavian anti-aircraft fire or crashed as a result of a
malfunction or pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic announcement came as Serbian television broadcast
images of twisted burning aircraft wreckage -- a stark reminder of
the tragedy and human cost of modern warfare for which President
Clinton has tried to prepare the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television images of the fiery plane wreckage clearly
showed a U.S. Air Force insignia and an ``Air Combat Command''
insignia that is typically displayed on F-117A Nighthawks.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the $45 million F-117, which is designed for
missions into highly defended areas, came hours after Clinton, in
his weekly radio address, urged NATO to ``stay the course'' and
allied forces decided to expand their attacks to include Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with Serbian forces reportedly intensifying atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, a sign
that the NATO bombing has been ineffective in its objective of
slowing the Serb assault, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
vowed to pay ``any cost'' to keep NATO peacekeeping troops out of
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, weapons and television images suggested little
chance for a quick resolution to the conflict that, after four days
of intense bombing by NATO warplanes, is threatening to spread
beyond an area that Clinton described as ``a powder keg at the
heart of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president said the bombing of Yugoslavia was
necessary ``to prevent a wider war'' involving other European
countries, two Yugoslav helicopters flew over neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina before turning back when confronted by NATO jet
fighters Saturday. On Friday, also over Bosnia, NATO F-15 warplanes
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters that crossed over the
border about 25 miles from Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops
taking part in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targeting of Serbian ground troops in Kosovo, the
increasing flood of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia, the
Yugoslavian violation of air space in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
spreading protests in European cities underscored the dilemma NATO
leaders face: whether to send ground troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials moved swiftly Saturday to
dampen speculation that ground forces would be needed, especially
to stop the alleged ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serbian troops and
thugs against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accomplish our objective through air power,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no intention of sending ground troops to
fight in Kosovo, and the Department of Defense is not doing any
planning that would enable such a deployment,''' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing reports of atrocities in Kosovo prompted NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana Saturday to widen the range of
bombing targets to include Serbian tanks, artillery and troops in
Kosovo. In Brussels, Solana said he was ``determined to bring a
halt to violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian
catastrophe'' with what was dubbed ``Phase Two'' of the bombing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes
after meeting with his foreign policy team and speaking with
leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France.
``All the leaders agreed that . . . it was time to broaden or
deepen the attack,'' said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   This new phase of the NATO assault will be more dangerous,
however. To attack tanks and soldiers on the ground will require
NATO planes to swoop within range of Serb weaponry, which includes
1,400 anti-aircraft artillery, 100 surface-to-air missiles and an
undetermined number of shoulder-launched missiles similar to
American Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army, which numbers about 30,000 soldiers, have
waged a 13-month siege of terror that has forced more than 350,000
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson said an ``all-out Serb
offensive against the Albanian population'' of Kosovo has begun,
with scores of people murdered and villages destroyed. But he
insisted, ``This is not happening because of NATO. The violence was
going on before we began.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea emphasized that NATO battle plans do
not call for the use of ground troops. But he also acknowledged
that air power alone will not entirely prevent Serbian brutality
against ethnic Albanians. ``It's not possible to do that from the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 NATO ground troops, including 400 Americans, are in
Macedonia training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace
settlement, but not as an invading, offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for the first time since the NATO assault began, air
raid sirens screeched in Belgrade as allied bombs rocked the
suburbs of the Yugoslavian capital. Still, Milosevic remained
defiant, issuing a statement once again rejecting any Kosovo peace
plan that includes the stationing of NATO troops in Serbia's
southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not
to allow at any cost the enemies to occupy their country,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said the Serbian attacks
on unarmed ethnic Albanians in recent days was ``all the more
reason for us to stay the course'' until Milosevic ``accepts peace
or we have seriously damaged this capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., questioned Clinton's leadership in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops must receive a clear military mission,'' Ashcroft
said. ``Our leaders must construct a a strategy and timetable to
achieve that mission. Third, our soldiers deserve an exit strategy
that can bring them home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Clinton's broadcast, a U.S. Navy ship fired two
Tomahawk cruise missiles at what a defense official called
``targets of opportunity'' near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the skies cleared after a heavy day of rain over Aviano
Air Base, more than 50 warplanes screamed off the runway for the
fourth straight day of bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With few neutral observers on the ground in Yugoslavia, it is
difficult to determine the extent to which the NATO bombing has
weakened Milosevic. The air raid sirens in Belgrade went off after
the explosions in the suburbs, suggesting that NATO had weakened
Yugoslavia's formidable air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said reconnaissance efforts were under way to verify
allegations of fresh Serb aggression against the Kosovars. He said
U.S. officials would turn over any evidence of war crimes to the
U.N. Tribunal in The Hague for possible prosecution.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO lost an F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter over
the skies of Yugoslavia Saturday evening, but the unidentified
pilot was rescued safely and returned to an allied military base.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced the rescue and
reiterated that the loss of the plane, the most advanced in the
U.S. arsenal, had not dampened NATO resolve in the clash with
Yugoslavian President Molosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said it has not been determined whether the F-117A was hit
by Yugoslavian anti-aircraft fire or crashed as a result of a
malfunction or pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic announcement came as Serbian television broadcast
images of twisted burning aircraft wreckage -- a stark reminder of
the tragedy and human cost of modern warfare for which President
Clinton has tried to prepare the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television images of the fiery plane wreckage clearly
showed a U.S. Air Force insignia and an ``Air Combat Command''
insignia that is typically displayed on F-117A Nighthawks.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the $45 million F-117, which is designed for
missions into highly defended areas, came hours after Clinton, in
his weekly radio address, urged NATO to ``stay the course'' and
allied forces decided to expand their attacks to include Serbian
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with Serbian forces reportedly intensifying atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, a sign
that the NATO bombing has been ineffective in its objective of
slowing the Serb assault, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
vowed to pay ``any cost'' to keep NATO peacekeeping troops out of
his country.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, weapons and television images suggested little
chance for a quick resolution to the conflict that, after four days
of intense bombing by NATO warplanes, is threatening to spread
beyond an area that Clinton described as ``a powder keg at the
heart of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president said the bombing of Yugoslavia was
necessary ``to prevent a wider war'' involving other European
countries, two Yugoslav helicopters flew over neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina before turning back when confronted by NATO jet
fighters Saturday. On Friday, also over Bosnia, NATO F-15 warplanes
shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jet fighters that crossed over the
border about 25 miles from Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops
taking part in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targeting of Serbian ground troops in Kosovo, the
increasing flood of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia, the
Yugoslavian violation of air space in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
spreading protests in European cities underscored the dilemma NATO
leaders face: whether to send ground troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials moved swiftly Saturday to

PILOT IS RESCUED; BRUTALITY REPORTS GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update)  (lh) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An U.S. F-117 stealth fighter went down in
Yugoslavia Saturday night, the first allied loss in the four-day
Balkan conflict, even as NATO officials announced a broad new phase
of the air assault on Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the F-117 was rescued by an U.S. military
search-and-rescue team six hours after his plane went down,
according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Belgrade claimed that Serbian air defenses had
shot down the radar-evading stealth aircraft, one of the most
advanced weapons in the U.S. arsenal. There was hostile missile
activity in the area where the plane was operating, one Pentagon
official said Saturday night, but there was no independent
confirmation that the plane was brought down by Serbian fire.
</P>
<P>
   The official Tanjug news agency in Yugoslavia said the F-117 was
brought down late Saturday near Budjenovci, 35 miles northwest of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although pictures of the fiery wreckage were shown on Serbian
and U.S. television for hours Saturday night, administration
officials did not confirm the downing of the aircraft until the
pilot was safely out of Serbian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Saturday night expressed relief that the
pilot, who was not identified, was safely snatched from Serbian
territory only hours after his plane went down. He said that the
United States and NATO were broadening the goals of the
four-day-old military operation in Yugoslavia to include attacks on
equipment and troops of the Serbian army and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said from the outset,'' Clinton said in a statement
released by the White House late Saturday night, ``this military
operation entails real risks. However, the continued brutality and
repression of the Serb forces further underscores the necessity for
NATO forces to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the the loss of the U.S. aircraft stunned White House
officials, who had spent most of the day consulting with European
leaders about expanding the military mission in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled by numerous reports of atrocities in Kosovo, including
mass executions, deportations and forced marches, NATO and U.S.
officials accelerated a decision to attack Serbian forces in the
field, officials here and in Europe said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the F-117 was a propaganda coup for the Serbians,
who have absorbed four days of heavy pounding from U.S. and NATO
bombs and missiles and the loss of at least five MiG fighters in
air-to-air combat. It was the first time one of the $43-million
F-117's has gone down in hostile action, after performing
flawlessly in hundreds of missions over Iraq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television broadcast images of the burning wreckage of
an aircraft that bore the distinctive markings of the F-117
Nighthawk, with tail numbers indicating it was from the 8th Fighter
Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the loss of the plane in Serbia, the United States faces
a loss of the secret technology that allows the F-117 to evade
detection. That technology includes the composite materials used
for the outer surface of the plane that absorb radar instead of
reflecting it back to defensive missile sites.
</P>
<P>
   Any secrets lost to the Serbs could find their way to the
Russians, who have been supporting Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the allied airstrikes announced Saturday marked
a new phase in the four-day-old campaign against the Yugoslav
military. Until now, airstrikes had chiefly targeted air defenses
and military infrastructure, not Yugoslav troops and armor that
could be used to kill ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, when the United States and NATO initiated the
attacks, President Clinton said the West had a ``moral imperative''
to try to halt the slaughter of civilians in Kosovo. Clinton warned
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, that if he did not
cease the repression in Kosovo, NATO would ``seriously damage''
Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, NATO and the United States moved to make good on that
threat, setting plans for attacks by allied warplanes that would
take aim at supply depots, communications facilities and troop
concentrations located south of the 44th parallel in Yugoslavia.
The area includes all of Kosovo and a substantial portion of Serbia
south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to strike at heavy weapons, which are of course
what are used to bombard villages and kill people,'' said Jamie
Shea, a NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington said that NATO is not yet sending
low-flying combat ground-attack planes or helicopters to hit
Serbian troops in Kosovo. While there are signs that NATO attacks
have weakened some Serbian air defense systems, low-flying aircraft
would still remain vulnerable to Serb ground fire, and the current
weather in the Balkans has been too poor to permit such operations,
officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And while the cause of the downing of the F-117 is not yet
known, allied war planners likely will treat Serbian air defenses
with more respect in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and NATO officials in Brussels announced the
escalation of the air war and the shift in strategy Saturday
afternoon after a series of conversations among President Clinton,
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Jacques Chirac of
France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema of Italy. Later, Chirac also contacted the Russian
government in an attempt to restart talks with the Serbs toward a
diplomatic settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total unity that the campaign was moving as planned
and that it was important to move to a new phase of the air
campaign, including focusing on forces in the field,'' said David
Leavy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton believes that Slobodan Milosevic's continued
repression and continued intransigence remain an obstacle to
resolving this crisis and thus it was necessary to move forward in
broadening the scope of the air assault,'' Leavy said. Milosevic is
the president of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the dominant part.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that the reports
of Serbian violence were numerous and credible and had triggered
the intensified air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing brutality made it an easy call to broaden and
deepen the attack,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the decision to go ahead with the
second phase of the air war was moved up by several days because
the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Kosovo is far worse than any
previous campaign against ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been torching villages,'' the British defense
minister, George Robertson, said in London. ``There are reports
that the Serbs are bombing villages to the point of obliteration.
There are clear signs now that an all-out Serb offensive against
the Albanian population has started.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson accused Milosevic of being a ``serial ethnic
cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea cited reports that large groups of Kosovo Albanians _
conspicuously lacking adult men _ have been spotted under the guard
of Serbian forces. ``Dark things are happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alarming reports and the pleas from some in Kosovo
for more forceful intervention, administration officials insisted
that they were not planning to use U.S. or NATO ground troops to
halt any killings and punish Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops,'' Vice President Al Gore said in
response to a question while campaigning in New Hampshire. ``I
believe that we can achieve our objectives with the use of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, for the first time, people heard large explosions
before air-raid sirens sounded, suggesting that Yugoslavia's air
defense system has been damaged around the capital, as NATO has
said it was.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Belgrade television broadcast images showing
the city almost deserted by shoppers Saturday after heavy overnight
missile raids aimed at military targets on the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Stinging chemical fumes wafted over parts of the city Saturday
after allied warplanes bombed a rocket fuel depot in the Ibarska
Magistrala area in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign has been conducted until now using cruise
missiles and precision-guided bombs dropped from high-altitude
aircraft. Any serious effort to destroy tanks, artillery pieces,
trucks and mobile ground forces would require lower-flying aircraft
like the tank-killing A-10 Warthog and ground-attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials indicated that they were not yet prepared to
employ such weapons in the new phase of the air combat because of
their increased vulnerability to ground fire and surface-to-air
missiles. Instead, aircraft already involved in the campaign _
F-16's and F-15E's _ will be used to attack the new set of targets
in southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, a White House spokesman said that NATO had
begun to attack ground units of the Yugoslav army. But Pentagon
officials said later that the flights had not yet occurred because
of concerns over weather and Serbian air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that
Milosevic was conducting a ``brutal military offensive'' against
civilians and that allied forces must ``stay the course'' to
prevent the war in Kosovo from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children,'' Clinton said. ``We must, and we will, continue until
Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, accepts peace or we have
seriously damaged his capacity to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no visible signs Milosevic was backing off.
Serbian television broadcast programs with patriotic themes along
with coverage of NATO attacks and news of protests against them in
Greece and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian province of Kosovo, the center of the conflict
that led to the attacks that began on Wednesday, Serbian troops
continued their rampage against the ethnic Albanians, burning homes
and villages and rounding up ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happening because of NATO,'' Robertson, the
British minister, said. ``This violence was going on before we
began.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies planned to continue bombing airfields, industrial
sites and anti-aircraft defenses throughout Yugoslavia Saturday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is not very good,'' Air Commodore David Wilby of
Britain said in a Brussels briefing early Saturday. In operations
that ended before dawn Saturday, he said, ``some of the airplanes
turned back because of the weather, but manned aircraft did get
through to their targets last night.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 249 allied planes took to the air between Friday and
early Saturday, he said. Bombs dropped from aircraft and the
warheads of unpiloted cruise missiles struck military targets
around Belgrade and the southeastern Serbian city of Nis, and in
six areas in and around Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have given only sketchy accounts of damage from
the air raids because they say it will take time to analyze
photographs taken after the attacks. And without people on the
ground, they say, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and other officials warned Milosevic Saturday not to
try to retaliate by attacking international peacekeepers in
neighboring Bosnia or Macedonia. About 12,000 allied soldiers in
Macedonia are preparing for missions to enforce a peace agreement
in Kosovo if, as the allies hope, the bombing forces Milosevic to
accept one.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, he added, will do their best to see that Serbian
authorities who may be responsible for atrocities against civilians
are prosecuted for them by the international criminal tribunal in
The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation that
signed the peace agreement that Milosevic refused to accept in
Paris earlier this month, said that Serbian military and police
sweeps through Kosovo could only be stopped by sending in NATO
ground forces, an Austrian news agency reported. Wilby said, adding
later, ``Currently, there are no plans for us to take on ground
operations in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding details to earlier accounts of a dogfight Friday
afternoon in which two NATO F-15s shot down two advanced MIG-29
Yugoslav planes over Bosnia, Wilby said the MIG's had apparently
intended to try to lure the NATO planes across the border into
Serbia to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aircraft turned toward them in rule-book fashion and shot
them down,'' he said. The wreckage of one lies in a minefield in a
sector of Bosnia patrolled by Russian troops serving with the
alliance-led peacekeeping force, he said, and the other went down
in an unknown location.

   Foudy is a veteran of two World Cups and is training full-time
with the U.S. team for her third. But in the restaurant that day,
the stranger wanted only to talk about her broadcasting work for
ESPN during the men's World Cup last summer. He spoke effusively in
his native tongue, leaving his son to translate the words into
praise that made Foudy blush.
</P>
<P>
   After the man had returned to his meal, Foudy's husband Ian
Sawyers leaned across the table and whispered, ``What he just said
means more to me than any write-up in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Foudy nodded knowingly. In the world in which she was raised,
her insightful commentary on ESPN was perfectly natural, like
Geraldine Ferraro pontificating on politics. But the real world
Foudy knows to be different. It's a place where some subjects
supposedly remain beyond a woman's comprehension no matter the
qualifications she brings to the task.
</P>
<P>
   It's not right, merely true: Reggie Miller can riff on WNBA
games and no one bats an eye, but Cammi Granato does radio color
commentary for the Kings and gets all kind of guff.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy was determined that, if nothing else, her detractors would
not be able to question her preparedness. She spent four solid
months leading up to the month-long broadcasting assignment reading
up on the participating players, memorizing names and watching
reams of game film. Intensity-wise, her pre-med studies at Stanford
were a friendly compared to what she put herself through to get
ready for her first T.V. gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove I had a lot of knowledge in the sport, that
I wasn't just on (the air) because they wanted a woman,'' Foudy
said. ``That was a big motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when an Iranian gentleman in a restaurant or two
Brazilian men on an airplane or an Englishman in a pub compliments
Foudy on her soccer expertise, the attacking midfielder feels no
small sense of fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   One more defense punctured.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakaway career move can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy's soccer excellence is all she'll be honing for the next
few months. Along with the rest of the national team, she is
focusing on this summer's World Cup. Norway is the defending
champion, having wrested the title from the U.S. in 1995. The U.S.
is the host country so there is much to gain _ and lose _ besides
the championship itself.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. victory could be just the kick this country needs to
establish a women's pro league, which most people agree is
essential if the U.S. is to establish any depth beyond its pool of
national-team players.
</P>
<P>
   A poor showing would slow the momentum created by the women's
gold-medal performance in Atlanta and likely prove the naysayers
right. Already Foudy, 28, has heard it snidely suggested in certain
circles that the only thing less likely to excite the U.S. public
than an international soccer marathon is a women's international
soccer marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still so many critics out there saying we can't pull
it off, that it's so risky to have the World Cup here,'' Foudy
said. ``We don't care. We feel energized having the World Cup in
the U.S. We like that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup final will be held at the Rose Bowl on July 10.
The Americans will get their first collective look at the pitch
today when they meet Mexico in their first match since their
second-place finish (behind China) at the Algarve Cup in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy will be the blur in the middle. Employed as a defensive
midfielder during the 1995 World Cup and 1996 Olympics, Foudy is
the beneficiary of a 3-5-2 offensive scheme that allows her to play
a more attacking role.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been good for her. Foudy joked that it was like
``getting rid of the ball and chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to analyze all those World Cup games last summer
didn't hurt, either. In dissecting other people's games, she
learned much that was useful about her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself playing better this year than I have in the past
and I don't think it's a coincidence,'' Foudy said. ``Watching so
many games totally helped my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Foudy admits she is looking forward to the day when she sees her
husband more than her teammates. She can clearly picture herself in
a career in T.V., talking about something other than soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But all in good time. Foudy realizes her mission in soccer is
not quite accomplished when she goes somewhere and someone says to
her, innocently enough, ``Oh, you play soccer? But you look so
feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   The times, thankfully, they are a'changing. Foudy got a letter
the other day from a high school soccer player. The girl wrote that
her best friend was a boy who was a huge fan of women's soccer.
They watched the U.S. national team's matches together and it ``was
some of the greatest moments they shared together.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Foudy got to the part about the boy's death from a
terminal disease, she was in tears. Sometimes it's easy to forget
you're making a difference until someone takes the time to tell
you. &QL;

MURDER CHARGES FILED AGAINST BOYS RANCH 5 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinal County prosecutors, once forced to drop a manslaughter
indictment against five Arizona Boys Ranch employees, have filed
new charges accusing the defendants of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint, filed Thursday in Pinal County Superior
Court, also accuses the former ranch employees of child abuse in
the March 2, 1998, death of 16-year-old Nicholaus Contreraz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely beyond reality,'' said Darrow Soll,
co-counsel for defendant Montgomery Hoover. ``No one has ever
thought that this was a first-degree murder case.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says the defendants committed first-degree murder
by killing Contreraz as they committed, or attempted to commit,
child abuse. Under Arizona law, first-degree murder charges may be
filed when a death occurs during the commission of a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover was initially indicted Sept. 30 along with Geoffrey S.
Lewis, Montgomery Hoover, Michael M. Moreno, Troy M. Jones and
Linda Babb. All five pleaded innocent at an arraignment in October.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early this year, charges were dismissed by prosecutors who
blamed a technical problem in empaneling the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said the indictment was dropped because some
jurors admitted being aware of previous abuse at Boys Ranch and
because the entire panel was given prejudicial evidence and
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been preparing for an April 13 preliminary
hearing, with defense lawyers pressing Assistant County Attorney
Janna Vanderpool to clarify the criminal charges and provide
discovery materials.
</P>
<P>
   They got their response in the mail Friday _ a new criminal
complaint for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderpool could not be reached for comment. Charles Ratliff, a
spokesman for the Pinal County Attorney's Office, said he was not
aware that murder charges had been lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, meanwhile, blasted Vanderpool.Soll said he
suspects the prosecutor submitted the murder complaint out of
vindictiveness _ retaliating againsttenacious defense efforts to
dismiss the indictment and obtain discovery materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wonder if this is simply a response to aggressive
lawyers,'' Soll added.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Chornenky, attorney for Lewis, said he does not know if
vengefulness is involved, but one thing is clear: ``The prosecutor
doesn't know what's going on. She is ill-prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The new complaint offers alternative charges against each
defendant. All five are accused of first-degree murder or _ ``in
the alternative'' _ manslaughter. They also are charged with child
abuse or _ ``in the alternative'' _ causing or allowing injury to a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Chornenky vowed to seek an immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his client is innocent, and that none of the
defendants did anything even close to first-degree murder. By
accusing the defendants of such a severe crime, Chornenky said,
Vanderpool committed an ``abuse of discretion'' that could ruin
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz, a Sacramento boy with an extensive criminal record,
died of severe lung ailments at a Boys Ranch boot camp in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators concluded that he had been sick for days, but was
subjected to work, exercise, punishment and ridicule by employees
at the residential program for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner discovered 2{ quarts of pus in the lining
of Contreraz's lungs, plus more than 70 cuts, bruises and other
wounds on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Because Contreraz was constantly vomiting and suffered from
diarrhea, he was seen repeatedly by Babb, the Boys Ranch nurse. But
he was considered a malingerer, and the infection was never
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said staffers forced Contreraz to do push-ups over a
pail containing excrement-soiled clothing, and made him dine while
sitting on a toilet. Child Protective Services workers documented
abuse or neglect on the part of 17 ranch employees, but only five
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch's 50-year history is checkered with allegations of
mistreatment. Critics blame the organization's tough, hands-on
method of rehabilitating juvenile violators. Defenders say juvenile
offenders routinely make false accusations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Since Contreraz's death, ranch operations have dissolved. The
Department of Economic Security has refused to renew the non-profit
organization's license until major reforms are implemented. Five of
six campuses are closed, the resident population has dwindled from
about 600 to 40, and most employees have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thomas, longtime president of Boys Ranch, left several
months ago. New leadership is trying to rebuild with revised
policies, guidelines and programs. &QL;

FOUDY GIVES WOMEN'S SOCCER A LIFT

<P>
   Validation can scream at you from the stands of a packed Olympic
stadium outside of Atlanta. Or it can sneak up on you like dinner
on a hectic day.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy was eating at a Thai restaurant in Laguna Beach with
her husband recently when an elderly Iranian gentleman at a nearby
table looked at her quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' she replied.

HOWELL CONANT, TOOKCOVER SHOTS OF STARS FOR `LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANELLE COWGILL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howell T. Conant, a photographer whose shots of Grace Kelly and
other celebrities landed on the covers of ``Life'' and other
magazines, has died.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Conant, who was 83, died at his Carefree home on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Conant is best-known for his striking photographs of Kelly,
whom he met when she first arrived to model in New York. His first
photos of her won a ``Photoplay'' magazine cover and a spot in
``Collier's.'' Her career _ and his _ took off.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Conant was born March 13, 1916, in Wisconsin to a family of
photographers, including his father and grandfather. He attended
the Art Center School in Los Angeles and studied art at the
University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Mr. Conant joined the Navy and was a photographer
during World War II. While in Waikiki, Hawaii, Mr. Conant met his
future wife, Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting there, and he was on his surfboard and he
just pulled that surfboard right up to my feet,'' she said. ``We
were married 30 days later. I guess you could say it was meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to New York City, which was their home for 45
years. Mr. Conant opened his studio there and did a lot of
advertising work.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for ``Life'' magazine and became close friends
with Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She requested him whenever she knew that she would have a
cover,'' Dorothy Conant said.
</P>
<P>
   His numerous photographs of the Academy Award-winning actress
were collected in a book, ``Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Conant's portfolio includes ``Life'' covers of actresses
Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn and Claudia Cardinale, plus shots
of beaches and Olympic swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Conant also photographed former Presidents Hoover, Johnson,
Nixon and Kennedy _ official portraits coupled with candid family
shots.
</P>
<P>
   An avid pilot, Mr. Conant flew to most of his assignments in his
twin-engine Piper Comanche.
</P>
<P>
   He fell in love with Arizona's weather and Indian lore while on
assignment for a magazine story highlighting renowned architect
Paolo Soleri.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the Conants stayed at the Carefree Inn whenever
they flew to Arizona. Then, 12 years ago, they bought a home in Sky
Ranch, complete with its own hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from photography, Mr. Conant divided his time between
deep-sea fishing and scuba diving. The couple had a fishing boat
they took with them on trips to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Conant said that her husband was a good fisherman,
reeling in swordfish and ``anything else that would bite.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also one of the first people to dive near a German
submarine that had sunk off the coast of New England. His deep-sea
photographs later grew into a television documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really enjoyed the creativity of what he did,'' his wife
said. ``That is what he enjoyed most.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mr. Conant is survived by his
daughters, Carol Richter-Blum, Sarah Martabano and Susan; son,
Howell T. II; 12 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Private services were held in Carefree. The family is planning a
memorial service later this summer off Rhode Island. &QL;

US STEALTH FIGHTER DOWNED OVER YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds rescue   of pilot; details throughout)   By BOB HOHLER AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A US F-117A stealth fighter, the most advanced in
the American arsenal, crashed Saturday night over Yugoslavia in the
first allied loss in four days of punishing attacks intended to
disable Yugoslavia's war-making machine. An elite US rescue team
swiftly moved into Yugoslav territory and pulled the pilot to
safety, the Pentagon reported.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of what was long considered a virtually invulnerable
warplane occurred as NATO shifted its air war to concentrate
primarily on Serb tanks and troops in the separatist province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops, meanwhile, defied NATO's aerial siege and stepped
up their deadly attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
increasing pressure on the Clinton administration and US allies to
consider launching a ground war to halt the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning images of a burning plane were first shown on
Serbian TV early Sunday in Yugoslavia, and Serb officials said
their antiaircraft gunners shot it down west of Belgrade, near the
Bosnia border.
</P>
<P>
   The footage showed tail markings that identified the jet as part
of a squadron based at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.
Pentagon officials gave no indication what brought down the plane,
but confirmed the pilot's rescue 7 1/2 hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at a news conference that
the pilot, whom he did not identify, made it out of the plane
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who was ejected from a high-performance
aircraft, and it says something to say he was in good shape,''
another Pentagon official said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the rescue team also returned safely.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth fighters, which served with distinction in the Gulf War,
have crashed before because of pilot error or mechanical problems,
but never in combat.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised the pilot and the rescue team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tremendously proud of the skills of the pilot and the
courageous individuals who participated in the recovery,'' Clinton
said in a statement. Despite the risk, he said, the NATO operation
will ``go forward as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been pressure to expand the targets and geographical
reach of the air war to a riskier phase to try to stop the Serb
killings of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A NATO official warned that
``dark things are happening'' there, including reports of Serb
forces murdering members of the ethnic Albanian leadership,
rounding up and killing military-age men, and bombing and burning
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo stepped up their call for NATO troops
to fight Serb security forces on the ground, and US officials
confronted the public's enduring reluctance since the Vietnam War
to commit US soldiers to foreign wars. ``We welcome the strikes,
but we demand that NATO ground troops come into Kosovo as quickly
as possible,'' said a spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting for autonomy for ethnic Albanians who represent
about 90 percent of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said last week he had no plans to send combat troops to
Kosovo, and officials at the White House and Pentagon Saturday
reiterated his position.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton called for NATO ``to stay
the course'' in order ``to defuse a powder keg at the heart of
Europe.'' Clinton made no reference to the potential for US
involvement in a ground war. But in a letter to congressional
leaders that was released Friday night, he said he had dispatched
100 Marines to defend the US Embassy in neighboring Macedonia, and
he raised the possibility of sending an unspecified number of
additional troops to conduct operations such as combat search and
rescue, intelligence support, surveillance, and reconnaissance in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound military planning may also call for sending a limited
number of additional US military personnel to Macedonia in support
of ongoing operations,'' Clinton said in the letter. Although he
expressed confidence Saturday in the outcome of the NATO operation,
he reported no progress in curbing the alleged Serb war crimes. In
fact, Clinton said, ``Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed
men, women, and children.''
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson provided a bleaker
assessment. ``There are clear signs now that an all-out Serbian
offensive against the Kosovo Albanian people has started and
violence is widespread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the brutality, thousands of Kosovars continued to flee to
neighboring countries. More than 250,000 people already have been
displaced, and the State Department Saturday projected that more
than 500,000 could be driven from their homes in the conflict.
Human rights groups reported that a Kosovo political nerve center
was burned down, as was a food warehouse operated by the Mother
Teresa organization.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, in forgoing ground troops,
ordered allied military forces to expand their attack by targeting
the Serb operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy could place NATO pilots at greater risk because the
jets and helicopters will be required to fly closer to the ground
to hit tanks, artillery, and mobile command posts.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to begin the assault, dubbed Phase Two of
Operation Allied Force, was seen as an indication that NATO leaders
are confident the first stage of the attack crippled much of
Yugoslavia's air defense system and command and control facilities.
In Aviano, Italy, US combat pilots, speaking to reporters for the
first time since the operation began, expressed surprise at the
minimal opposition they have encountered. ``We have not seen
anywhere near the amount of aircraft weaponry employed that we
thought we would see,'' said one Navy pilot, who was not permitted
to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed off Saturday on the second phase of the operation
after meeting at the White House with his foreign policy advisers
and speaking with British, French, and German leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Solana gave the order to the supreme allied commander, US Army
General Wesley Clark. ``I have taken this decision with the support
of all allied governments, which are determined to bring a halt to
violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian catastrophe,''
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said warplanes and cruise missiles will continue
to strike military targets throughout Yugoslavia as part of the
effort to force Milosevic to accept a peace agreement that grants
autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In massive raids Friday night and early Saturday, NATO aircraft
flew 249 sorties, and Tomahawk cruise missiles were seen soaring
across the Belgrade skyline before they detonated. Serbian state
radio reported that NATO missiles and bombs destroyed a military
barracks, a munitions dump, and a telecommunications site. New
attacks began late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the strikes began, Serbian television
also reported that nonmilitary targets were hit, including a
factory and a pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts of Belgrade.
NATO denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds also demonstrated outside embassies in Berlin, Rome,
Athens, Vienna, and London. Some protesters clashed with police.
Others hurled objects at the embassies of NATO nations. And some
burned US flags and shouted anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement over the NATO mission also festered among US
political leaders. Delivering the Republican weekly radio address,
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri said the Clinton administration
had yet to articulate a clear plan for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty obligates us to demand a clearly focused mission for
our soldiers,'' Ashcroft said. ``They deserve the complete
commitment of every American and the certain leadership of the
commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his radio speech, said maintaining peace in Europe
is a vital US interest. ``Through two World Wars and a long Cold
War, we saw that it was a short step from a small brushfire to an
inferno, especially in the tinderbox of the Balkans.''

BLUE DEVILS SURVIVE A SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Michigan State Spartans put Duke on
the floor, put elbows in the Blue Devils' ribs and, for a couple of
minutes at least, put them on the ropes of elimination. One Duke
star, Elton Brand, was on the bench with four fouls. Another star,
Trajan Langdon, found his shooting stroke as icy as the playgrounds
of his native Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   But all Duke needed to propel its way to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association championship game against Connecticut on
Monday night was one pretty play to transcend an ugly game as the
Blue Devils bounced hard-nosed Michigan State out with a 68-62
victory Saturday night. What it proved was that close games or not,
the Blue Devils' 32-game winning streak was built on the same kind
toughness as the 22-game streak the Spartans had clawed out.
</P>
<P>
   Duke now has both its men's and women's teams in the NCAA
finals, the women taking on Purdue for their title on Sunday night
in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Duke did it Saturday night despite shooting just 8-of-22 from
free-throw line down the stretch and shooting just 45 percent from
the field for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils began their tightrope walk with elimination with
10 minutes 12 seconds left in the game when Brand, who was on his
way to a dominating 18-point, 15-rebound performance, made a mental
mistake. Brand ripped down his 14th rebound and decided to lead the
Blue Devils' fast break. He already had three fouls and had
teammates on either side and only guard Mateen Cleaves defending.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8-inch Brand should have given the ball up, but he
kept it long enough to bull over Cleaves and pick up his fourth
foul on a charge with the Blue Devils ahead by 50-42. The Spartans
needed just two minutes to cut the deficit to 51-48 on two free
throws by Charlie Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But Langdon, who had just hit 2-of-8 shots up to that point and
would finish with seven points, picked a perfect time to find his
range. He faked Bell on the perimeter and fired up a fall-away
3-pointer to put the Blue Devils up by 54-48.
</P>
<P>
   When Brand returned with 4:44 remaining, Duke was ahead by
59-52.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scales of history were weighted in favor of Duke. The Blue
Devils were trying to reach their sixth championship game in eight
Final Four appearances under Krzyzewski. They were also trying to
keep Blue Devil Airlines in the air _ the university president,
Nannerl O. Keohane, and the athletic director, Joe Alleva,
chartered a plane to shuttle between here and San Jose, Calif.,
where the women's team plays in the title game against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Izzo of Michigan State was looking to make his first
championship appearance and to return the Spartans to basketball
prominence 20 years after the Magic Johnson-led team beat Larry
Bird and Indiana State for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously slow-starting Spartans remained true to form in
a leaden first half that was notable for how poorly Michigan State
executed its game plan in falling behind, 32-20.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans intended to keep the ball away from Brand down low,
but the 6-foot-8-inch Peekskill, N.Y., native reached through
cracks like he had glue on his fingers and scored six of the Blue
Devils' first 11 points on his way to an eight-point, 12-rebound
first half. With Brand bulling his way along the blocks and Shane
Battier and Corey Maggette flashing through the middle, the Blue
Devils pounded a strong rebounding team on the boards, 26-14, in
the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had outrebounded 35 opponents this season and in
four tournament games had pulled down an average of 11 more than
offensive boards. But Brand and company out-rebounded them on the
offensive end, 11-6, for 13 second-chance points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State had hoped to reduce the Blue Devils to Stone Age
basketball on the offensive end with smothering man-to-man defense.
To some extent it worked, forcing a Duke team averaging better than
50 percent shooting from the field into 42.4 percent shooting in
the half, and just 14.3 percent from beyond the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans were an abysmal 29 percent from the field and
missed their last five shots of the half. Their bench, which had
outscored its opponents' reserves in all but one game, mustered
only six points. The team's leading scorer, Morris Peterson, could
not find his stroke, shooting just 2-of-8.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Duke reserves who provided the only highlights of the
first half and kept the Spartans from clawing closer. Maggette, the
freshman whom National Basketball Association scouts are eager to
get into the league, looked as if he were strapped with rockets
when he picked a rebound off the glass on the defensive end, drove
the length of the floor and picked up the foul. He made the basket
and the free throw and the Blue Devils were ahead, 20-10.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later on a breakaway, Maggette showed why he has
earned comparisons to Michael Jordan with a split-legged dunk. He
led the Blue Devils in the first half with nine points.

MEXICAN TEEN HELD IN DEATH OF POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A teenager who entered Arizona illegally from Mexico
confessed Saturday to the ambush-killing of Phoenix police Officer
Marc Atkinson, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Petrona-Cabanas, 17, was booked into Maricopa County Jail
for investigation of first-degree murder, attempted murder and
aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred Saturday from a hospital to Phoenix police
headquarters for questioning after being wounded in a gunbattle
Friday with a citizen who came to Atkinson's assistance. Sgt. Mike
Torres, a police spokesman, said police would not make details of
Petrona-Caban as' statement public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said the armed citizen, Rory Vertigan, probably kept the
gunman and two other armed men from fleeing to the safety of their
hometowns in Mexico. The other men also were arrested and held on
lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of the shooting were visible Saturday afternoon at the
site: A bloodstain was on the road where Atkinson's car crashed
into a power pole. A bullet hole was in a wall at the side of
Bristow Optical.
</P>
<P>
   But other aftermaths were less visible.
</P>
<P>
   Parents from nearby neighborhoods voiced new fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytime is when when you feel safe letting your kids out to
play,'' said Linda Rodriguez, whose family lives about a mile from
the shooting site.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Milburn of Phoenix, a teacher's aide, dropped by a
basket of mums at a makeshift shrine at the shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there has been a war over drugs and crime but they are
being so blatant here,'' she said. ``This was not a shooting _ this
was an assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started simply enough on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson and two other Maryvale precinct patrol officers
followed through with a police initiative to crack down
aggressively on drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a tip, the three officers went to the Scoreboard
Tavern, 2831 N. 35th Ave., where police believed drugs were being
dealt in the bar parking lot from a white Lincoln Continental.
</P>
<P>
   But Atkinson, 28, and the others were unable to determine who
inside the bar had been driving the car.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers waited for the car to leave, two of them were
called away on other assignments, Torres said. He gave the
following account of Friday's events:
</P>
<P>
   When three men emerged from the bar and got into the Lincoln,
only Atkinson was left to tail them.
</P>
<P>
   They got a good head start. Atkinson barely kept the car in
sight as it rapidly turned east on Thomas Road, north on 31st
Avenue, east on Catalina Avenue and north on 30th Avenue, where it
stopped in the middle of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, who had patrolled the neighborhoods of West Phoenix
for five years, briefly lost sight of the car before he turned
north on 30th Avenue, his vision blocked by a building.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Atkinson turned, Petrona-Cabanas had already jumped
out of the driver's seat and had drawn his .357-caliber revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson never had time to draw his own pistol. Petrona-Cabanas
fired at least twice, striking Atkinson twice in the head as the
officer sped by, eventually ramming his squad car into a light
pole.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Torres said, the three men could easily have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But behind Atkinson was Rory Vertigan, who saw Petrona-Cabanas
shoot Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigan pulled to a stop behind the Lincoln, got out of his car
and exchanged gunfire with Petrona-Cabanas. One of the shots from
Vertigan's Glock 31 pistol wounded Petrona-Cabanas, piercing
through his upper-left shoulder from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Petrona-Cabanas collapsed and later was taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Harold Hurtt said Vertigan's actions were legal,
because Vertigan believed he was acting to prevent imminent harm to
himself or others, the general rule for lawful use of deadly force.
Hurtt praised Vertigan as ``one of the true heroes of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two men in the Lincoln _ Oscar Garcia-Martinez, 22,
and Oberlin Cabanas-Salgado, 26 _ also got out of the car and began
to run. Garcia-Martinez carried a pistol. Cabanas-Salgado had a
shotgun. Neither, however, fired his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to hide, but they were soon captured after witnesses
pointed police in the direction they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   One man was captured in a restroom of Bristow Optical on the
northwestern corner of 30th Avenue and Catalina. The other was
captured nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered as much as a pound of cocaine in the Lincoln.
The drug was already sorted into one-eighth-ounce bags known as
``eight balls,'' a common quantity that is easily exchanged without
detection between dealers and users.
</P>
<P>
   Petrona-Cabanas was taken to Good Samaritan Regional Medical
Center. He was released from the hospital Saturday, questioned at
Phoenix police headquarters and then booked into Maricopa County
Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said that Petrona-Cabanas was read his rights, but there
was no attorney present during his questioning. Torres anticipated
that the courts would appoint an attorney for him.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Martinez was held on an outstanding warrant for
investigation of failure to appear in court on a previous drug
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Martinez and Cabanas-Salgado were held for investigation
of entering the country illegally and illegal possession of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt said he would personally pursue the case against
Petrona-Cabanas and see that he was prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law. If Petrona-Cabanas is found guilty and is
sentenced to death, Hurtt said he would request to be present for
the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators were trying to determine why
PetronaCabanas had such a violent reaction to Atkinson's pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police said the men all come from farming communities
near Acapulco in the Mexican state of Guerrero. They told police
they had come to the United States to find work, but could not get
any.
</P>
<P>
   Petrona-Cabanas has been in the United States about seven
months. His cousin, Cabanas-Salgado, has been here for three
months, and Garcia-Martinez has been in this country for perhaps
three or four years, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Friday's attack was curious, police said, because
a large-scale surveillance of West Phoenix drug stash houses has
been ongoing for weeks by the Joint Drug Intelligence Group, made
up of federal, state and local police agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said extensive drug surveillance usually traces the
source of drugs in the Valley to rich, powerful families in Mexico.
Often, he said, illegal aliens who cannot find work in the United
States are recruited to sell smaller quantities of drugs on Valley
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt said Phoenix police were not pursuing any other particular
individuals who might be connected with the killing of Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   To help heal the deep psychological wounds inflicted on the
Valley's law-enforcement officers, and the community at large,
Hurtt on Saturday ordered upwards of 120 additional officers onto
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt also called on motorists to drive night and day with their
headlights on, at least for the next few days, as a show of support
for law enforcement throughout Maricopa County, which this month
has seen four officers killed or wounded in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Officers began wearing black bands of mourning Saturday across
their badges, Hurtt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have happened to any one of us,'' he said. &QL;

THIS FINAL FOUR NEEDED SOME EXCITEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Magic was in the stands, sitting with his
father, hoping against hope that his old school was primed for a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, magic was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's up to Connecticut to compete. To provide a
much-needed dose of drama. To save the tournament from a crude
coronation and the yawn of a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better basketball game in us, and I hope we
have that Monday night,'' Huskies Coach Jim Calhoun said, and let's
hope he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Without the element of unpredictability, the NCAA Tournament is
nothing. And on Saturday - a day that normally serves as the apex
of drama, normally the best 80 minutes of a three-week extravaganza
- everything went painfully according to form.
</P>
<P>
   A Duke team that would not be seriously threatened. A Michigan
State team green with envy. A Connecticut team continuing to teeter
between greatness and self-destruction. A bunch of Buckeyes happy
to have made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, over the last couple of days, the only suspense
centered on whether Kato Kaelin was really in town for the
proceedings. He was.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has now played 1,525 minutes of basketball this season.
They have trailed for 111 minutes, and not once on Saturday. And
over 38 games, a season that started in Alaska and is ending in
Florida, the Blue Devils have trailed for only 24 minutes in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Duke played all that well against Michigan State. They
missed 13 free throws and 9-of-13 three-point attempts. But in the
first half, they made a travesty of the one Spartan advantage -
offensive rebounding - and had a 10-point lead before Jim Nantz
could utter his first clich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to give it to Duke,'' Michigan State coach
Tom Izzo said. ``For taking our game in the first half ... for
taking the best part of our game and really taking it to us. They
just pounded us on the boards in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Spartans tried to make it interesting. Once they climbed
within three, once within four. Both times, Duke responded within
seconds, each time draining a three-pointer on the ensuing
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Game, set, mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we started to make a little bit of a run, they
answered with something,'' Mateen Cleaves said. ``And that's why
they're a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Great enough to parlay a day of bad basketball into one of the
most boring Final Fours in memory? That is the mission facing
Calhoun's troops.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked like Connecticut had turned the corner.
Twice, the Huskies threatened to blow away the Buckeyes, and they
should have. Ohio State is a nice team, but three weeks ago, they
lost to Illinois. They have one player with any name recognition,
and that guy - Scoonie Penn - was stuck with a nameless jersey when
his uniform turned up missing Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, for a while, the Huskies looked very much like Duke's
equal. Khalid El-Amin was brilliant, Richard Hamilton was scoring
at will and the whole team raced up and down the court as if their
shorts were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the brilliance faded. Not enough to buoy the
Buckeyes. But just enough to raise the same old questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them on the ropes a couple of times and we never put
them away,'' El-Amin said. ``But we're glad we got the `'.''
</P>
<P>
   If El-Amin and Hamilton can duplicate their performances on
Monday, maybe Connecticut has a shot. Especially if they can feed
off the defensive brilliance of Ricky Moore, who hounded Penn into
submission on Saturday, setting the tone for the triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Moore is the best defensive player I've ever coached,''
Calhoun said. ``We've played a lot of great guards and they all
seem to have bad shooting nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he can't check Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, predictability and boredom are setting in, two words you'd
never associate with the climax of March Madness. And now it's up
to Connecticut to save the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   An upset isn't necessary, but is a close game too much to ask? &QL;

CUBA AND BASEBALL: A NATION'S LOVE AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA - Martin Dihigo is a name that carries as much weight in
Cuba as Fidel Castro or Jose Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Because he became the first Cuban-born player inducted into the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, his name may actually be held in a
higher standing than any politician here, at least privately.
</P>
<P>
   Dihigo, who once pitched both games of a doubleheader and batted
cleanup while in his mid-40s in 1946 for the province of Las Tunas,
is an unparalleled legend in Cuban baseball. That his entire career
was played in the relative obscurity of the Negro Leagues only
strengthens his standing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Baltimore Orioles will become the first major league
club in 40 years to play in Cuba, a game that has the people here
in a frenzy and enraged at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, baseball is THE national pastime in Cuba, with
boxing a distant second, barely registering a blip on the screen
when it is placed next to the pride of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's love affair with baseball is thought to have started when
the native Indians played a game called Batos back in the 1860s, a
crude version of what we know today as baseball, and solidified
when U.S. sailors brought the game in the ensuing decades.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, according to the so-called ``baseball scientists''
who make up the respected elite of those who hash out baseball
arguments and theories on a daily basis, insist baseball played
second fiddle to soccer until sometime in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said 84-year-old Esteban Hernandez-Lopez, who
heads a local social club of hard-core baseball aficionados.
``Soccer was a bigger sport here. Remember, this was a Spanish
colony. But then the Cuban player started making his way to the
major leagues, and soccer hasn't been heard of since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cuba will host a major league game at Estadio Latinoamerica,
where Games 1 and 2 of the Cuban version of the World Series took
place with Havana's Industriales sweeping the first two games
against Santiago in the best-of-seven series, which heads to the
eastern province of Santiago for Monday's Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   What has the local fans in a quiet uproar is the Cuban
government's decision to allow fans into the historic game by
invitation only, meaning the true Cuban baseball fan will not be
allowed to watch what many consider the most important baseball
game ever to take place in Cuba since Fidel Castro assumed power in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, after all these years, we the Cuban people who built that
stadium, have filled it for years, why can't we go now?,'' asked
taxi driver Rene Hernandez. ``I'm not a baseball fan, so I wouldn't
go anyway. But it's a total lack of respect. These is a town that
follows baseball _ they are the ones who should be at the game. The
ones who will be here don't even care about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from only the privileged being allowed entry to Estadio
Latinoamerica, this will not be a game between the Baltimore
Orioles and the Cuban National Team, as it's being billed.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players on either Industriales, Havana's club that
is considered the equivalent of the Yankees here, and Santiago, a
club from a far-eastern province that is well-known as Cuban
President Castro's favorite club.

<P>
   ``Granma,'' the Cuban communist newspaper, said of the Cuban
select club that will play Baltimore, ``This selection enters the
game with discipline and dediction and constitutes a representation
of patriotic valor which identifies Cuban sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lopez: ``What they're doing is setting up an excuse. If
Cuba loses, they can say it was only the third- or fourth-best team
they could put together. If Cuba wins, they can in turn say they
beat the imperialists without having their best club. It's a shame
all the best Cuban players won't play against the Orioles. We, the
people, want to see our best at every position on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a country where a child is basically born with a
baseball glove and bat in his hands, where he or she has no choice
but to become a passionate fan.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 2 of the final here, a controversial call was made
when the home plate umpire ruled a ball in play after the pitcher
dove and missed a bunt attempt down the third base line.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago's players all converged on the plate umpire, with the
first baseman actually flinging his glove at the face of the
umpire, smacking him in the cheek. No players were ejected. It can
safely be argued that such a fracas on the streets would have
elicited jail time for several people.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place where there is no doubt, baseball is and will
forever be king. Children play the game anywhere they can find an
empty field or alley with as few as four players and as many as 20.
It's also a country that demands the most from its players, whether
domestic or foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Don Newcombe, the National League Rookie of the Year in 1949,
was actually booted out of the Cuban winter leagues that same
winter because ``he was getting hit too hard,'' said Guillermo
Cosio, another one of Cuba's baseball scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Cubans have made a serious impact in the
major leagues, starting with Adolfo Luque, a 27-game winner for the
Cincinnati Reds in 1923, and leading all the way up to El Duque
Hernandez, who helped the Yankees win last season's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there have been names such as Minnie Minoso, Tony
Perez, Luis Tiant, Campy Campaneris, Jose Canseco, Rafael Palmeiro
and Rey Ordonez, who sat on the bench for Industriales behind
current shortstop German Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The game here is played with a flare that would be misunderstood
in the majors for arrogance. During a rally by Industriales in Game
1 Friday night, six players began doing an imitation of the Radio
City Rockettes in the dugout after a key two-run home run by first
baseman Antonio Scull in the bottom of the eighth that led to a 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the sandlot level, the players display a panache that
was commonly attached to the Cuban player of the 1950s and '60s.
Just about everyone remembers how Campaneris wiggled his bat back
and forth, trying to intimidate a pitcher. Or how Tiant completely
turned his back to the batter before delivering his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban ballplayer has always maintained a certain level of
acceptance for being someone who knew the game inside and out,''
said St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa. ``That's why they were
considered among the best from outside the United States in the
'60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the United States has sent the Orioles to face the Cubans.
Many people in Havana's streets believe this could lead to a
warming of relations between the two rival nations. It's a
viewpoint that seems to have some weight considering the enormity
of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this game may be the start of something, is because
our national pastime is the same as your national pastime,'' said
Javier Valdes, 44, a mechanical engineer. ``It is one aspect of
common ground the two nations have and may very well lead to
something very important occurring. We, the Cuban people, are
certainly hoping so.'' &QL;

BROOKS' IMPACT COMES OFF FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. - In the world of music, he has recorded a bunch
of hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, he has a single hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One'' hit in 16 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   As the Padres slung travel bags over their shoulders and filed
out of the small visitors clubhouse _ ``Ten-minute bus!'' coach
Davey Lopes announced _ Garth Brooks lingered, lost in thought,
staring at a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks pondered his latest missed opportunity in his one trip to
the plate, an eighth-inning pinch-hit appearance against the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking a strike, as planned, he had jumped at
left-hander Mike Magnante's first offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stupid thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, it didn't matter to him that he is the
highest-selling solo artist in U.S. music history or that hundreds
of baseball fans, many of whom listen to and buy his music, were
waiting for him, as they are after every game.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks earned $54 million last year. But he can't ``buy'' a base
hit.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Pritchett caught Brooks' weak pop foul, fans
playfully booed the Angels first baseman for sending the most
popular .063 hitter in baseball back to the dugout unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very frustrating,'' Brooks said. ``I ``hate'' sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't trying to kid anyone. The 37-year-old singer hasn't
played baseball seriously since high school. He didn't expect to
pick up a bat as if it were a guitar and began terrorizing big
league pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks joined the Padres spring training camp as a non-roster
invitee. The team made a donation to the Touch 'Em All Foundation,
a collaboration among major league players, entertainers and
corporate partners that contributes money to children's charities
nationally and in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is a realist. When a cheery TV reporter asked Garth how
he will feel when spring training ends and Brooks is informed he
made the opening day roster and is a full-fledged Padre, the
entertainer offered a reply as ridiculous as the question. ``And
they'll also tell me we have world peace and we're out of debt as a
country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too late in life for him. Brooks knows that. Alone in the
clubhouse, I asked what he would like the Padres to tell him when
spring training ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I like to hear?'' he asked. After a thoughtful
pause, he said, wishfully, ``I would love to be told that if I had
invested the last 17 years playing the game, I would be playing
major league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the closest chance he will have. So he took it, ignoring
critics and cynics and fighting down his fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death of embarrassment and failure,'' Brooks
said. But he made a commitment. He would try.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't, you might as well stay in the house all day. . .
. You're the only one who can see your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   What he has seen during his ``minute a day,'' as he calls his
cameo roles at the plate, are fastballs and curves.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has struck out only once, Brooks sometimes must feel
like former big league catcher Bob Uecker during his playing days.
A career .200 hitter, Uecker jokes that the manager would turn to
him on the bench and bark, ``Uecker, grab a bat and put out that
rally!''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is disappointed in himself. From the day spring training
began, he has said he doesn't want to embarrass the Padres and
baseball. He doesn't have to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Can he hit? No. But not every contribution a person makes
appears in the morning box score.
</P>
<P>
   Those columns of gray type don't record the hours Brooks has
spent after every game patiently shaking hands, posing for
pictures, signing his signature until his hand begins to cramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, what's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris,'' the fan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``C-h-r-i-s?'' Brooks asked. Before autographing each ball, he
checks the spelling.
</P>
<P>
   They call out to him. Reach for him. Offer him gifts. One woman
presented Brooks with a jar of pickled vegetables she had picked
from her garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see your arm,'' Brooks said, singling out a wide-eyed
little girl. The child tossed the ball from the stands. Brooks
caught it, wrote her name and tossed it back.
</P>
<P>
   When Brooks noticed a TV cameraman shooting the autograph scene,
he asked him, politely, to turn off his camera. ``If you don't
mind,'' he said. ``I don't want people thinking I'm doing this for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks stays and signs another ball, and another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more out of this than I'm giving,'' he said
apologetically after another hitless game.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't disagree more. &QL;

MOORE LIFTS UCONN TO TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The game ended and Connecticut trotted
out its marquee players, guards Richard Hamilton and Khalid
El-Amin. They stood in front of the cameras and sat behind the
microphones. Their names flashed on the giant scoreboards next to
impressive point totals.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had 24 and El-Amin 18, but neither deserved credit as
player of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut escaped Ohio State 64-58 Saturday night in Tropicana
Field and advanced to its first NCAA title game because of a tough,
quiet senior guard named Ricky Moore. He made one basket and had
one assist, but that doesn't reflect his impact on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's Moore, you see, who's the best defensive player in the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best defensive player I've ever coached,'' UConn boss
Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's assignment Saturday was Ohio State point guard Scoonie
Penn, the Big Ten Player of the Year who scored 48 points in South
Regional victories over Auburn and St. John's. As Baron Davis is to
UCLA and Andre Miller to Utah, so is Penn to the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   But against Moore's smothering defense, Penn scored just 11
points on 3-of-13 shooting _ his lowest totals in a non-blowout in
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted him to shoot tough shots,'' Moore said. ``I was
taking away the drive first. The second option was jump shots. He
did a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hamilton and El-Amin were superb. Hamilton even hit the
game's biggest shot _ a 10-footer from the right side with 1:43
remaining that gave the Huskies a 61-55 lead. But without Moore's
defense, it would have been Ohio State's game. The Buckeyes did not
hit their free throws (9 of 18), and they didn't have Penn's
production in crucial situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job covering me,'' Penn said. ``He just didn't
let me breathe the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies scored most of their points in transition; when the
pace slowed, their half-court offense was ineffective. They had
little inside presence _ frontliners Jake Voskuhl and Kevin Freeman
combined for seven points _ and they committed 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Connecticut provided no evidence it's ready for
Duke in Monday's title game. If anything, Saturday seemed to
indicate the Huskies are headed for a whipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play at the top of our game,'' Freeman said. ``I
don't think we played particularly well, but things like that
happen. We got too relaxed and let them come back. We know we have
to be more aggressive Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game had an appealing rhythm. The Huskies jumped to a
nine-point lead midway through the first half, then watched Ohio
State produce a 10-0 response. The second half mirrored the first _
UConn in command early, Ohio State late. When smooth sophomore
Michael Redd's layup cut the deficit to 57-54 with 4:13 remaining,
the Huskies appeared on the brink of implosion.
</P>
<P>
   But El-Amin converted an eight-footer, then Hamilton struck from
the right side. In a blink, Connecticut had recovered to a
six-point lead. With Moore close enough to check for cavities,
Penn's last-gasp 3-pointers had no chance, and neither did the
Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically (Moore) cut the head of the dragon off,'' Calhoun
said. &UR;
