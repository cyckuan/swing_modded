<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Political Parties to Organize Joint Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Political party leaders from both
communities of Cyprus are proceeding with preparations of their
first joint event, the Cyprus News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A cultural festival to be jointly organized by the political
parties of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots will take place in
September at Ledra Palace hotel in the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone
in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the preparations, Slovak Ambassador in Nicosia
Dusan Rozbora, under whose auspices the parties had four meetings
in the past, said Friday he hoped there would be no difficulties
for the joint event.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has
not been allowing Turkish Cypriots to participate in most
bicommunal events aiming at bringing together the two estranged
communities.
</P>
<P>
Rozbora stressed that the importance of the event lies in the
mere fact that Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot people will get
together.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders of the two sides of Cyprus Thursday held a
meeting at Ledra Palace to discuss the technical preparations of
the cultural festival.
</P>
<P>
Rozbora said the final date for the event will be confirmed at a
meeting of political party leaders on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Two parties, Greek Cypriot Democratic Party and Turkish Cypriot
Democratic Party, have not taken their final decision as whether to
participate in the event. The two parties did not participate in
Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The only party that has never taken part in such meetings is the
Turkish Cypriot National Unity Party of Dervis Eroglu, so-called
prime minister of the breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983 which is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Jordanians Protest Israeli Policy over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 Jordanians on Friday
marched in Zarqa, an industrial town 25 kilometers northeast of the
capital Amman, to protest against Israeli policy over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The protestors thronged the street after their regular Friday
Muslim prayers in a mosque, chanting slogans denouncing what they
called an Israeli policy to Judaise Jerusalem, a holy city sacred
to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organized by the powerful opposition party Muslim
Brotherhood, ended peacefully without police intervention.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the sporadic protest rallies held in the kingdom
after the July Camp David summit between U.S., Israeli and
Palestinian leaders failed to reach any agreement on the status of
Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, second only to
Egypt to realize peace with the Jewish state, but Amman supports
the rights of Palestinians, especially to the establishment of an
independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Arab East Jerusalem, then under Jordan's
jurisdiction, in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it and
claimed Jerusalem as its indivisible and eternal capital, which is
not recognized by the international community.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Adopts Resolution to Protect Children's Rights against War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to reaffirm the
responsibility of governments, rebel groups and the private sector
to ensure that the fundamental rights of children are protected in
times of war, as well as in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "reaffirms its strong condemnation of the
deliberate targeting of children in situations of armed conflict
and the harmful and widespread impact of armed conflict on
children, and the long-term consequences this has for durable
peace, security and development," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "emphasizes the responsibility of all
States to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,"
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also "urges all parties to armed conflict to
respect fully international law applicable to the rights and
protection of children in armed conflict, in particular the Geneva
Convention of 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under
the Additional Protocol," adopted in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged Member States to ratify the
Operational Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child
on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls upon all parties to armed conflict
to ensure the full, safe and unhindered access of humanitarian
personnel and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
children affected by armed conflict," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "urges Member States and parties to armed
conflict to provide protection and assistance to refugees and
internally displaced persons, the vast majority of whom are women
and children," the resolution said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Hails New Security Council Resolution on Children and War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Friday welcomes the resolution adopted by
the U.N. Security Council to protect the children in conflict,
saying the resolution represents a renewed commitment by the world
body to protect children affected by war.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF strongly endorses the Security Council's call for
governments to sign and ratify this year's Optional Protocol to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which sets 18 as the
youngest age at which a child can participate in armed conflict, a
UNICEF press release said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council has reminded the world that it is both immoral
and illegal to make children the victims and protagonists of war,"
the press release said. "It has helped to maintain awareness of
the unacceptability of turning children into soldiers, of forcing
millions of children and women to flee their homes, and of
subjecting children to forced labor, sexual abuse and the pressure
to commit atrocities."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Friday unanimously adopted the resolution
on children and war, reaffirming the responsibility of governments,
rebel groups and the private sector to ensure that the fundamental
rights of children are protected in times of war, as well as in
peacetime.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution underlines the urgent need for an end to
impunity for those who commit crimes against children," the press
release said. "It also calls for special protection and assistance
for refugees and internally displaced people, as well as for girls
affected by conflicts, including those who have been sexually
exploited or left to care for younger brothers and sisters."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, the only United Nations organization dedicated
exclusively to children, works for child protection, survival and
development within the framework of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Created by the U.N. General Assembly in 1946 to meet the
emergency needs of children in post-war Europe, UNICEF now
supports programs aimed at improving the lives of children
everywhere, particularly those in developing countries.

</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a similar resolution a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council last month, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "In the internecine conflicts
of recent years, children have increasingly been victimized as
both the targets and the perpetrators of violence."
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the world's 21 million refugees are children,
while it is estimated that another 13 million children have been
displaced within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The number of children under the age of 18 who have been
coerced or induced to take up arms as child soldiers is generally
thought to be in the range of 300,000. Each year, between 8,000
and 10,000 children are the victims of landmines.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges "Balanced Decision" on Military Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
on Friday urged the country's military leaders to "wrap up" their
public bickering and try to reach a balanced decision on reforming
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the statement while opening a session of the
Security Council, the top advisory body that includes the country'
s top leaders. The session lasted four hours and a half, Russian
media reported.
</P>
<P>
"I rather tolerantly treated the polemics within the Defense
Ministry and in society in general. Now we have to wrap up this
discussion, make a balanced decision and outline the plan of its
realization," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin was apparently referring to the disputes over the future
of the country's strategic rocket force. Chief of the General
Staff Anatoly Kvashnin wants the force to be scrapped and
integrated into other forces, a view staunchly opposed by Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
"The current structure of the armed forces is hardly optimal,"
Putin said. "How can it be considered optimal if training is not
conducted in many units, pilots almost do not fly and sailors
almost do not put to sea."
</P>
<P>
"The structure of the armed forces must precisely correspond to
the threats Russia faces now and will face in the future," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
He described "the economically unjustified decisions" among
the reasons that led to the failure of military reform over the
past 10 years, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The state's needs and capabilities must be clearly established,
" all our steps must be absolutely balanced, calculated and
economically justified," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against the "unrestrained accumulation of piles of
weapons," noting that this was one of the reasons behind the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Russia can oppose today's emerging threats "only thanks to the
courage and devotion of the people wearing shoulder-boards," Putin
said. "But the people's enthusiasm cannot be endlessly exploited."
</P>
<P>
At the end of Friday's session, Security Council Secretary
Sergei Ivanov told reporters that participants had managed to make
a balanced decision with the realistic capabilities of the economy
and the needs of all Russian armed forces services for their
further development taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov noted that "the state, and not
narrow departmental approaches, triumphed" while issues of crucial
importance to the country were considered.

<HEADLINE> Annan Tells Indonesia to Halt Infiltration to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday told Indonesia to stop militiamen infiltrating
into East Timor after a Nepalese United Nations peacekeepers was
killed in a firefight there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by his spokesman, Annan said he was
"concerned over the increase in activities by armed personnel" in
parts of the territory close to the Indonesian province of West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his condolences to Nepal and to the family of
Private Devi Ram Yaishim who died of gunshot wounds Thursday after
a skirmish with militiamen in the border district of Suai earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference here Friday that Annan "expects the government of
Indonesia to take effective measures to prevent any infiltration
into East Timor."
</P>
<P>
In a similar statement, the Security Council called on
Indonesia to prevent cross-border incursions and "to disarm and
disband the militia and bring to justice whose militia members
guilty of crimes."

<HEADLINE> Greek Fire-Fighting Forces on Alert Due to Prolonged Dry Season </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The fire-fighting forces in
Greece have once again been put on alert in order to combat forest
fires due to the prolonged dry season and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the use of fire outdoors remained strictly
prohibited through the entire season, the fire department
authorities urged people, especially in the areas of Attica, Evoia
and the Dodecanese, to inform local fire departments of any fire-
related incidents.
</P>
<P>
Three forest fires were reported in progress on Friday
afternoon in the country, with the first being in the central
Larissa prefecture, the second in the Pelios mountain range and
the third in the Corinth prefecture.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 hectares of forestland and a lot of houses
have since early this summer been destroyed in the wildfires,
which were caused by the high temperatures and arsons.

MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Between 20 to 30 mild earthquakes
are registered daily in some areas in Russia's Far Eastern island
of Sakhalin, the Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting the
local seismology station.
</P>
<P>
The tremors are the aftershocks of the earthquake that occurred
on the island on August 5 and they may continue for a long time,
seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
Though much weaker in magnitude, they still produced rather
strong shocks because the epicenter was closer to the surface,
said Alexander Spirin, chief of the local seismology station.
</P>
<P>
Some residents, worried over the quakes, took to the streets
with their essential belongings, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel ELN Denies Kidnapping Venezuelan Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN) leader Antonio Garcia Friday denied that his
organization had kidnapped or is keeping prisoner Venezuelan
businessman Richard Boulton.
</P>
<P>
Garcia rejected the versions that have appeared lately in the
press, in which the ELN is blamed for the kidnapping of the
Venezuelan rich man, occurred July 15 in the central Venezuelan
state of Carabobo.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla chief denied that the ELN Domingo Lain Front is
keeping Boulton hostage. "The central command made a statement in
which it says that the ELN does not have Boulton in its hands and
that we are always willing to fulfill the purpose of reducing the
tensions in the border," said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
Bouton's kidnapping puts the Venezuelan government in a
delicate spot and also the various sectors of the Colombian
guerrilla, since Chavez has said that he wants peace in Colombia,
for which he has offered his assistance.
</P>
<P>
Garcia asked the Venezuelan press that published the version of
the kidnapping supposedly made by the ELN," to say who was its
source and what does it know, because if they are accusing the ELN,
the right thing to do is to say which front and who has him."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the ELN is not interested in taking part in
those actions, but in collaborating for the distension of the
border between Venezuela and Colombia, "and up to now we have
fulfilled our part," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Negotiation Not Just Presentation of Positions: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Friday that the Greek Cypriot side has requested to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan that the next round of indirect talks
on the Cyprus issue be "one of negotiations and not just a
presentation of positions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in southwestern Paphos town, on his way to Greek
islands where he will spend his summer holidays, Clerides said the
Greek Cypriot side has informed Annan that "September should be a
month of negotiations and not just having each side outlining its
positions."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the east Mediterranean island after a failed pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect, or "proximity," talks
between the two communities to reach a settlement in Cyprus have
been held in December last year as well as February and July this
year. A fourth round is to begin on September 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks, during which the two sides did not talk face
to face but through U.N. officials shuttling between them, were
aimed to prepare grounds for substantive negotiations on a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots insist on not holding direct talks with the
Greek Cypriot-controlled government side unless their breakaway
republic in the north, declared in 1983 and recognized only by
Turkey, be internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots want a confederation of two states, a
stance rejected by the Greek Cypriot side which insists on a
bizonal, bicommunal settlement according to relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Clerides has set off for a two-
week cruise to Greek islands, accompanied by his wife and some
friends. He will return to Nicosia on August 28.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old president will fly to New York on September 3 to
address the U.N. General Assembly Millenium Summit and for the the
fourth round of Cyprus proximity talks.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air to Ban Smoking on All Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Air has decided to extend
its no-smoking policy to all its flights as of September 1, the
United Arab Emirates official WAM news agency quoted a company
statement as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision is an extension of the smoking ban currently
adopted by Gulf Air on intra-Gulf routes, Australia and Singapore,
some European and Middle East flights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The airline had introduced no-smoking rules on many flights
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Gulf Air's decision to extend the ban to all flights is in line
with the directives and instructions of the World Health
Organization (WHO) which calls for opposition to smoking and its
hazards to mankind," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Surveys done before the ban was adopted showed that an
overwhelming majority of the passengers were against smoking on
board.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company was "one of the first carriers in the
Middle East to introduce the concept of no-smoking on board its
intra-Gulf flights," said Abdulla Abdul Karim, secretary of the
board and public relations manager of the company.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Proposes 4,200 Peacekeepers in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday proposed establishing a 4,200-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force to monitor an accord halting a two-year border
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, which is being
circulated here Friday, Annan proposed turning this into a full-
scale military force of up to 4,300-strong personnel, including
220 military observers, three infantry battalions and support
units, such as logistical, medical and support staff.
</P>
<P>
Annan also proposed that the mission monitor the redeployment
of Ethiopian forces to the positions they had held on May 6, 1998,
as well as the position of Eritrean forces, which are to remain 25
kilometers away from the redeployed Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he recommended that the mission be charged with
monitoring the temporary security zone and providing technical
assistance for mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
"Given the difficult terrain and weather conditions, the
significant length of the temporary security zone from East to
West and the requirement that the parties be confident would be
required to carry out the mission's tasks," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been locked in a border conflict
since May 6, 1998, with sporadic fighting costing the two Horn of
African nations tens of thousands of lives and millions of U.S.
dollars in armaments.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire accord in Algiers on
June 18, under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), to halt a conflict that has uprooted more than 1 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, an Italian colony until World War Two, was an
Ethiopian province until 1993, when it became independent with
Ethiopian support.
</P>
<P>
Fighting which first broke out along 965-kilometer border in
1998 flared up again in May this year, with each side accusing the
other of seizing disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened by a severe drought in the
region which the Ethiopian government estimates has left more than
10 million of its people in need of emergency food aid.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Eritrea and Ethiopia have suffered terrible
losses during two long years of war," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged U.N. assistance to help solidify the cease-fire
agreement but cautioned that "in the end it is only the parties
themselves who can bring lasting peace to their countries."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to discuss Annan's report on
Monday, but no action on a resolution to expand the force to 4,200
and is expected until later this month or early September.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the Security Council approved an advance party of
up to 100 military observers, called the U.N. Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea (UNMEE), to maintain liaison between the two sides and
help prepare for a full-scale peacekeeping operation.

<HEADLINE> Mars Society Meet in Toronto to Showcase Major Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Mars Society is
holding a four-day convention in Toronto with a simulated Mars
habitat as its centerpiece attraction, the 30,000-member
organization has said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of its third annual meeting Thursday, the
society's president Robert Zubin hailed the organization's
Flashline station "a step towards the exploration of Mars."
</P>
<P>
As the organization's first major project since its inception
in 1998, The Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) is
being used as a tool to train the first six-person crew for a Mars
landing.
</P>
<P>
The two-storey cylindrical structure of 1.8 million Canadian
dollars (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) is located near the
Haughton crater on Devon Island, Nuavut, in the Canadian High
Arctic.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest meteorite crater is 23 million years old
and spans 20 kilometers. Researchers describe the polar desert
environment as best resembling Mars on earth.
</P>
<P>
FMARS "is designed to simulate the day-to-day activities of six
people living in a small space and to simulate the working
environment that a crew living on Mars would experience," Nick
Welke of the society said.
</P>
<P>
All the six crew members are expected to share their
experiences at the meeting of more than 1,000 participants. The
crew underwent its first field operation last month.
</P>
<P>
While showcasing the society's first major project, the
convention will also discuss the technical, scientific and social
aspects of exploring and establish human settlements on Mars.
</P>
<P>
The agenda includes speeches by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz
Aldrin and Shuttle astronauts Scott Horowitz and John Grunsfield.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Remain Unchanged in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. wholesale prices
remained unchanged in July after a huge jump in June caused by
soaring energy costs, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation
pressures before they reach the consumer, was flat in July as
energy costs declined 0.7 percent in July after having jumped 5.1
percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale prices surged 0.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Friday's wholesale inflation report, likely a harbinger of good
news for next week's report on consumer inflation, was viewed as
providing a further reason for the Federal Reserve to leave
interest rates unchanged when policy-makers next meet on August 22.
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core
rate of inflation was up just 0.1 percent in July, after having
fallen 0.1 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level has risen at
an annual rate of 4.1 percent, an acceleration from a 2.9 percent
rise in wholesale prices for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, this speed-up was caused by the surge in energy prices.
Excluding energy and food, wholesale prices have risen a moderate
1.1 percent, basically unchanged from last year's 0.9 percent
increase in core inflation.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department reported that retail
sales rose a stronger-than-expected 0.7 percent in July, propelled
by sharp gains in purchases of autos and other big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates six times over the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy enough to keep inflation
in check.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Bars Imports of British Pigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgium on Friday announced its
ban on the import of English pigs after an outbreak of swine fever
spotted in eastern England.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a similar decision by the neighboring
Netherlands that on Thursday instituted a ban as a precautious
measure against any potential spread of the disease that killed
millions of pigs on continent Europe in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"This is no way hostile against the British," said Philippe de
Jaegere, spokesman for Belgium's agriculture ministry. "It's just
a precautious measure while the situation there is cleared up."
</P>
<P>
The agriculture ministry also banned movement of pigs from some
40 Belgian farms that have imported pigs from England in the past
two months.
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the imported English pigs is still waiting for
the results of government tests. Results of initial tests showed
no trace of the disease of swine fever while full results are
expected in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
Belgian authorities were hopeful that the full results would
also turn out to be negative.
</P>
<P>
Three outbreaks of swine fever in Belgium in the 1990s have led
to destruction of some 2 million pigs, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
British authorities confirmed this week that confirmed cases of
swine fever have been found on three farms in eastern England,
where a total of 6,350 pigs had to be destroyed. Government
officials announced later on Thursday that three more farms had
been put under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Swine fever, an infectious disease lethal to pigs but harmless
to human beings, had not been known in Britain for 14 years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Backs Palestinian Statehood, Cautious on Timing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday Moscow backs Palestinian statehood but that
the timing of the proclamation should be "carefully weighed first.
"
</P>
<P>
"Russia has no problems with recognizing Palestinian statehood,
" Ivanov told reporters after his talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, who arrived here Thursday on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
"As for the timing of the proclamation, Moscow believes that
all possible courses of further developments should be very
carefully weighed first," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question whether Russia would recognize
an independent Palestine if it is so proclaimed on September 13,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary "that this step guarantees a Palestinian-
Israeli settlement and result in the appearance of a full-fledged
state on the world map," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally it's the prerogative of the Palestinians to decide
the issue, and Russia will respect their choice."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said his talks with Arafat "did not work out ready
solutions" but the two "managed to conduct a thorough exchange of
opinions... in order to actively continue the work."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also met Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Putin had "ordered that Russian diplomatic contacts
in the Palestinian- Israeli direction be intensified."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will soon hold "a series of consultations with a
number of countries, on the basis of which it will formulate
proposals and discuss them with its Palestinian colleagues and the
Israeli side."
</P>
<P>
Russia is a co-sponsor in the Middle East peace process, which
is now stalled following the failure to reach a breakthrough
between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Camp David,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Although final understandings were not reached at Camp David,
we are as close as ever to such understandings now," Ivanov said.
"Every possibility should be used so as not to squander this
historic chance."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, for his part, said the Palestinian side had asked
Russia to intensify its efforts in all spheres, including
preparations for a four-party meeting between Palestine, Israel,
Russia and the United States, which also will probably "involve
other countries in the meeting, Arab ones among them, namely Egypt,
and also France as the current chair of the EU."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Harvest Record Crops of Corn, Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
harvest record crops of corn and soybeans this year, thanks to
timely rains and excellent growing conditions this summer across
the Midwest, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Based on its monthly survey of farms, the department estimated
U.S. corn production at 10.4 billion bushels, up 10 percent from
last year and 6 percent from 1998. The average yield also is
expected to be a record at 141.9 bushels an acre, an increase of
more than 8 bushels from last year.
</P>
<P>
The projected corn harvest would break a record of 10 billion
bushels set in 1994.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers are expected to harvest 2.99 billion bushels of
soybeans this year, a 13 percent increase from 1999 and 9 percent
above 1998's record crop. Yields this year are expected to average
40.7 bushels per acre, which would be the second highest yield on
record.
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybeans, which are used for both food and animal feed,
are the nation's biggest crops.
</P>
<P>
The bumper crops will serve to hold down the prices that
farmers are paid, which remain well below support levels that
trigger government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimated that the average price of
corn this year will be 1.65 U.S. dollars a bushel, down 5 cents
from its projection in July. The estimated price for soybeans was
lowered 5 cents from last month to 4.35 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The department expected cotton production to rise 13 percent to
19.2 million bales this year from 1999 despite a lingering drought
in parts of the South.
</P>
<P>
Production of spring-planted varieties of wheat is expected to
jump up sharply this year. Production of durum wheat, the type
used to make pasta, is forecast at 115.2 million bushels, up from
99.3 million bushels in 1999. Production of other spring varieties
is forecast at 553.7 million bushels, up from 503.1 million last
year.

<HEADLINE> France Orders Fresh Measures to Ban Use of Yahoo! Nazi Objects Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A French judge Friday ordered the
drafting of a new experts' report to make precise the techniques
imposed on the U.S. Internet giant Yahoo! to stop the use in
France of its web-site for the auction of Nazism-related objects.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Jacques Gomez, a judge of summary procedure of the
Tribunal of Grand Instance of Paris, made the decision after a
defense lawyer of Yahoo! said on July 24 that the techniques
imposed since May 22 have proved inefficient and difficult to stop
people from consulting the site.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a French public prosecutor ordered "complementary
experts' examination" in order to decide which is the best way to
stop Internet users from consulting the web-site, which displays
swastika and other Nazi-related objects.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, Gomez ordered Yahoo! to take necessary measures to
make it impossible for people to consult the web-site in France.
</P>
<P>
He said that these objects make up "an offense to the
collective memory" of France.

LHASA, August 11 (Xinhua)-- Puqung, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region's People's
Congress, met with Paulo Delgado, vice-president of the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, and his
party here today.
</P>
<P>
Puqung briefly introduced to the guests the regional people's
congress. He said that Tibetans account for over 90 percent of its
members and the most of its leaders are Tibetans, and these fully
show that Tibetans are the masters of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
He told the visitors that before the democratic reform in 1959,
a feudal serf system was practised in Tibet, under which the serfs
have neither the means of production nor the right for subsistence,
let alone political and democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
However, since 1959, the broad masses of the Tibetan people
have won not only what they need in everyday life and production
but also the rights and interests endowed by China's Constitution,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Delgado and his party are paying a three-day visit to Tibet at

<HEADLINE> Bank of Japan Decides to End Zero-Rate Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided at
its policy-setting meeting Friday to terminate its zero-interest-
rate policy despite pressure from the Japanese government and
ruling parties urging the central bank to maintain the 18-month-
old ultra-easy monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the BOJ's Policy Board decided by a majority
vote to lift the policy of guiding the key short-term rate to near
zero, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Following the decision, the bank's target for the key unsecured
overnight call money rate will rise to around 0.25 percent from
zero, marking its first rate hike in 10 years. Its official
discount rate was left unchanged at 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the board meeting, the Japanese government, which was openly
opposed to ending the policy, asked for a one-month delay to the
vote, but the board immediately rejected the request by a majority
vote, the BOJ said.
</P>
<P>
The decision reflected the central bank's belief that Japan's
economy has recovered to a point where a slight rise in interest
rates can be justified.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Japan's economy is showing clearer signs of
recovery, and this gradual upturn, led mainly by business fixed
investment, is likely to continue," the BOJ said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it said, the Japanese economy has
reached the stage where "deflationary concern has been dispelled,"
which was the BOJ's stated condition for lifting the policy,
originally instituted as an emergency measure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank also emphasized that ending the
zero-rate policy would not represent a shift to credit tightening,
but rather a "small adjustment to the degree of monetary easing"
in line with the improvement of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ's decision, however, drew criticism from three of
Japan's four major business organizations, which argued that the
country's economy has yet to come out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
"Given (data for) personal consumption and prices, it can
hardly be said we have come to a point where we can be certain
that concern for deflation will be wiped out," said Takashi Imai,
chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).
</P>
<P>
The BOJ adopted its ultra-easy monetary policy on February 12
last year in what it described as an extraordinary measure to fend
off a financial crisis and get the economy out of prolonged
recession.

<HEADLINE> One Million Tires Being Recalled in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A sweeping recall of nearly one
million tires has begun in Canada, with details to be announced on
Friday, according to Bridgestone/ Firestone Canada Inc.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident in the safety of our product, but we
appreciate our customers' concerns, and that's why we are taking
this voluntary step," said company spokesman Jerry Priddle in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The details of the recall will be announced later in the day
while the vehicles will be serviced through the company's 570
authorized dealers, Priddle said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 14.4 million of those tires have been produced in
North America, with most of the tires in Canada being on Ford
sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars are involved in the massive recall, which
costs 150 Canadian dollars (about 101 U.S. dollars) for a
replacement tire and more than 212 million Canadian dollars (about
143 million U.S. dollars) for the Ford vehicles alone in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Firestone Canada followed its U.S. counterpart in the voluntary
recall and replacement of Firestone Radial ATX and ATXII tires in
the size P235/75R15, as well as Wilderness AT tires in the size P
235/75R15.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has
received 270 complaints about the tires, including reports of 46
deaths and 80 injuries.

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Phelps Abandons Olympic Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A week before the U.S.
Olympic trials, gymnast Jaycie Phelps had ended her bid to make
her second Olympic team because of an injured right knee, local
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Phelps, 20, was one of five members of the U.S. first women's
gymnastics team to earn the Olympic gold medal in 1996, who were
attempting comebacks. The others of Amy Chow, Dominique Dawes,
Shannon Miller and Dominique Moceanu, remain in contention for the
six-person team.
</P>
<P>
Phelps said it was "one of the toughest decisions I've had to
make. I couldn't take my dog for a walk and I couldn't go up and
down the stairs."
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1997 after her third left knee surgery, Phelps
received medical clearance to return nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
Phelps said her left knee was fine, but she began favoring the
knee, which led to the injury to her right knee.
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Championships two weeks ago, she was 17th in the
all-around preliminaries but withdrew before the finals.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Urges Annan to Resume Lifeline Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government urged United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday to speed up the
resumption of a suspended U.N. humanitarian program in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
As a first official response to the U.N. decision to suspend the
Lifeline Operation, the Sudanese Ministry of Social Planning issued
a statement, urging the international community to pressures the
Sudanese rebel movement in the south into complying with a
ceasefire agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret over the U.N. decision, saying
that it would harm the inhabitants in the rebel-controled south. It
also regretted the failure of the U.N. decision to "condemn the
rebel movement" for its violation of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to delivering humanitarian aid to
the inhabitants of the areas under its control as well as the areas
under rebel control such as Bahr el-Gazzal by land and railway
routes," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated the government's commitment to protect
inhabitants of war-afflicted areas and the delivery of humanitarian
aid to them.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Annan issued a decision to suspend all humanitarian
relief flights under the Lifeline Operation in southern Sudan
temporarily, pending an appraisal of the security situation in the
area. The decision was officially conveyed to the Sudanese
government on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hebron's Shuhada Street Remains Closed to Palestinian Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Shuhada Street in the West Bank
city of Hebron remained closed to the passage of Palestinian
vehicles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The road, which borders the Jewish and Palestinian communities
in Hebron, has been closed by Israel Defense Force (IDF)
authorities, which maintained that the measure is necessary to
prevent clashes between Palestinian and Jewish residents in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Shuhada Street was closed on Thursday after the daughter of Noam
Arnon, spokesman for the Hebron Jewish settlers, was injured by a
sharp object thrown at her at Kikar Gross in the Israeli-controlled
sector of the Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
As a response to the incident, dozens of settlers crowded into
Shuhada Street, blocked traffic and confronted a growing crowd of
Palestinian demonstrators. The IDF closed the street after
dispersing the Jewish settlers from the scene.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Arnon's daughter has been involved in
violence, resulting in settlers massing to confront the
Palestinians near the Jewish settlement in the town center.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Hebron, the only city divided between areas of
Israeli and Palestinian control, has witnessed a wave of violent
incidents between Jewish settlers and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israeli Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz
called the city "the most difficult place" while addressing IDF
paratroopers serving in the city.
</P>
<P>
The IDF spoke of an atmosphere of growing extremism in the city,
which, to a large extent, has been created by settlers in the
Jewish enclave.
</P>
<P>
The IDF withdrew from most parts of Hebron in January 1997 in
line with an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on the re-deployment of
forces in the city. The city has now about 130,000 Palestinians and
450 Jewish settlers living in 63 settlements.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Palestinian media quoted Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat as saying that the Israeli negotiators
agreed to evacuate the settlers in Hebron. The report evoked strong
denial from Israeli Prime MInister Ehud Barak and other officials
as well as angry response from the settlers.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Stresses Housing as Philippines' Centerpiece Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that providing shelter for millions of
Filipinos without houses is the government's centerpiece program.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, Estrada made the
commitment as he inaugurated a socialized housing project in
Bacolod City, the last activity in his four-day swing of Mindanao
and the Visayas before returning to Manila.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as of June, the government has
accomplished 58 percent of the government's target of constructing
204,000 houses within the year.
</P>
<P>
"At least 3 million houses have to be constructed" to alleviate
the plight of the masses, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that with the high birth rate of the country, one
of the highest in the world, which translates to more than a
million people a year, it is imperative that his administration
must give focus on housing development.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered housing agencies to cut red tape so that the
beneficiaries of the government's housing programs can transfer to
their new homes sooner and developers can get their capital back
faster in order for them to build more houses.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the president asked the people anew to be more
patient with him as he raises more funds to bankroll his pro-poor
projects.

ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Yashiro Mori will discuss with Pakistan Chief Executive General
Pervez Musharraf about the nuclear issue and Indo-Pak tension
during his visit to the South Asian country on August 21.
</P>
<P>
Mori will arrive in Islamabad on August 20 on a two-day visit
to Pakistan as part of his seven-day tour to four south Asian
countries, Japanese Ambassador in Islamabad Sadaaki Numata made a
background briefing here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit of a Japanese prime minister to the
region in the past ten years. Mori will visit Bangladesh on August
19 before flying into Islamabad. He will leave for India on August
21 and then will go to Nepal on the last leg of his tour.
</P>
<P>
There is no "fixed agenda" for talks between the two leaders
but bilateral relations would figure in their discussion, said a
diplomatic source in the Japanese Embassy requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan-India tension, the source said, had been a source of
concern to Tokyo which had been urging both the sides to solve all
the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the resumption of development assistance to
Pakistan, the diplomatic source said, signing the Comprehensive
Test Ban Test (CTBT) remains the main hindrance in way of its
restoration.
</P>
<P>
"Japan awaits Pakistan's positive signals in its response to
CTBT," said the source.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has suspended its development assistance to both
Islamabad and New Delhi in the wake of their nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
When asked how Japan could play any role in scaling down
tension between India and Pakistan, the source said, it will
depend on the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We are following recent developments with keen interest, given
this very difficult problem between India and Pakistan," the
diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
Any initiative which has some chance of success in reducing
tension between the two sides, it said, should be encouraged.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Moves to Boost Coconut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Coconut Authority
(PCA) said Friday that it is exploring the possibility of
producing hybrid coconut trees to improve the coconut industry.
</P>
<P>
PCA Administrator Eduardo Escueta told a meeting here that the
program is part of the Integrated Coconut-based Farming System (
CBFS), which also seeks to transform idle coco lands into a highly
productive coconut farms.
</P>
<P>
Base on PCA records, some 70 percent or about 2.1 million
hectares of the country's coconut lands remained underutilized or
unproductive. That's why coconut farmers still considered as one
of the poorest sectors in the country, Escueta said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the CBFS, instead of monocropping of coconut,
which gives the farmers a measly 10,000 pesos (250 U.S. dollars)
income per hectare per year, there will be intercropping.
</P>
<P>
"Coconut farmers with small farms will be encouraged to form a
group or cooperative, while the PCA will provide the technology,
training and farm inputs to increase their income to as much as
100,000 pesos (2,500 dollars) per hectare per year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Escueta, more than 100 farms under the CBFS
program have been established in 65 coconut-producing provinces
all over the country, and another 700 more farms are expected to
be established this year.
</P>
<P>
Coconut is considered the country's top agricultural export,
bringing it a profit amounting to 900 million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Around 2.4 million metric tons of copra is produced yearly by
the coconut industry and these are processed into various coconut-
based products such as oil, shell charcoal, beauty and food
products, which are exported to some 45 countries all over the
world.

<HEADLINE> France Maintains Suspension of Concorde Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday that it will
maintain the suspension of the flight of Concorde supersonic
aircraft because the cause for the crash of the Air France
Concorde on July 25 has not been definitely determined.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport said after a meeting of experts that
some uncertainties remain about the link of different factors in
the crash as well as some details about how the big fire broke out,
although the explosion of a tire could most probably the primary
cause resulting in a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a metal strip among the debris on the
runway of the plane and they think the strip could have cut one of
the tires of the undercarriage.
</P>
<P>
Then the explosion of the tire could have thrown pieces onto
the left wing, damaging one or more reservoirs and causing a
leakage of oil which led to the outbreak of a fire, said
investigators of the Bureau of Accident Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Concorde plane caught fire immediately after taking off
from the Roissy airport north of Paris and crashed minutes later,
killing 113 people, most of them German tourists.

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In starkly personal remarks about his moral failings and
spiritual revival, President Clinton expressed anew his remorse
for the sex scandal that nearly toppled his presidency two years
ago and said voters must not hold Vice President Al Gore
responsible for sins that weren't his.
</P>
<P>
-- President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela held talks with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, defying the U.S. by being the first head
of state to enter Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- French investigators said a piece of metal found on the
runway probably caused a tire to blow out, sending debris into
fuel tanks and sparkling the fire that erupted as the Air France
jet took off last month.
</P>
<P>
-- The Reform Party split into separate conventions in Long
Beach, California, with Patrick J. Buchanan expected to be the
nominee of one faction and John Hagelin of the other. The party's
founder, Ross Perot, gave no sign of trying to mend the rift.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Dell's earnings rose 19 percent to 603 million U.S. dollars
in its second quarter, exceeding estimates, but revenue increased
at its slowest rate in nearly six years. The mixed results
reflect a slowing of growth in its desktop PC sales and Dell's
growing reliance on server computers for its revenue and profit.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Democrat ventured into the deep South while the
Republican was joined by Senator McCain on a swing through
California and the Northwest.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua)-- Beijing Mayor Liu Qi today
invited foreign companies to join the development of the city's
commerce, while meeting with Daniel Bernard, head of the

</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city's commercial industry is enjoying a

great efforts still need to be made to reduce the existing gap
between Beijing and other international metropolises in this

commercial development plan for the next five years which would
encourage wider opening of the commercial services sector, and

<HEADLINE> Sudan Reaffirms Commitment to Aid Delivery Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
reaffirmed commitment to delivering necessary relief materials to
people in both the government-controlled north and rebels-
controlled south, pledging to fully secure the involved roads and
railway lines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday in response to a recent U.N.
resolution which stalled the U.N.-sponsored Operation Lifeline
Sudan, the Ministry of Social Planning said Khartoum shared U.N.
Secretary- General Kofi Annan's concerns over the U.N. humanitarian
program, local daily Al-Shara Al-Siyasi reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on international organizations and the
international community to exercise pressure on the southern rebels
to abide by the ceasefire so as to ease the sufferings of the
people living in the troubled southern areas.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government regretted over the suspension of the U.
N. relief program because it would inflict more hardships on the
people in the war-torn areas, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government also regretted over "the U.N.'s
failure to condemn the rebels movement which violated the truce
deal and undermined the aid delivery process."
</P>
<P>
The government appeals for Kofi Annan to take immediate actions
to ensure the re-operation of the program in Sudan, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Annan announced on Thursday that all flights of relief aid
agencies to Sudan would be suspended until further notice,
expressing deep concerns over the safety of U.N. aid workers in
southern Sudan and accusing Sudanese army of targeting U.N. aid
stations.
</P>
<P>
The North African country has been ravaged by a long-standing
civil war between the predominantly Muslim north and rebels in the
south, who are mainly Christian and animist and seeking autonomy
from the government in the north.

<HEADLINE> Barak Proposes Low-Level Talks on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak proposed Friday that Israel, the Palestinians, and the United
States each name an envoy for talks on the future of Jerusalem, the
major stumbling block which deadlocked the Camp David summit last
month.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made while Barak held phone conversations with
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, who arrived in the
Norwegian capital of Oslo early Friday and prepared to meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat there later, according to Israel
Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Peres called Barak to ask for his guidance for his talks with
Arafat, the first direct contact between the Palestinian leader and
a senior Israeli official following the Camp David talks, which
failed to reach any agreement after 15-day-long talks in July.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is vacationing in northern Israel this weekend,
reportedly told Peres that he should explain to Arafat that the
Israeli government really wants to make peace with the Palestinians
through talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Peres and Arafat are touring foreign countries to explain
to world leaders their respective views on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process. In his recent visit to Russia, Arafat was seeking
Moscow's support for his plan to declare Palestinian independence
this September. Israel is against the unilateral plan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are scheduled to brief Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland on the
Middle East peace process respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is intractable as Israel regards the holy
city as its "eternal and undivided" capital, while the Palestinians
want to secure at least the eastern part of the city, which Israel
captured during the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of their
own future state.
</P>
<P>
During the Camp David talks, several sovereignty-sharing
proposals were discussed but neither proposal managed to win the
support of the Palestinians, who argued that the Jerusalem issue is
not only a issue for the Palestinians, but for the whole Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's office said that since the conditions for a
second three-way summit is premature, it should be better to have
lower-level talks to resolve the issue first and convene another
summit only to put final touches on an Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Reduce Diplomatic Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 11 (Xinhua)-- Cambodia Prime Minister Hun
Sen chaired a government meeting Friday to set new measures to
control diplomatic passports in which sources claimed that more
than 4,000 passports have been issued nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Pen Thol, spokesman of the cabinet, told reporters that the
government will reduce a big amount of diplomatic passports which
had been provided to many government officers including some
business people.
</P>
<P>
He said the reduction will be carried out from Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said some foreign countries have complained
about Cambodian passports being obtained by many people including
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Thailand with the population of about 80 million, has about 1,
000 diplomatic passports while Cambodia with a population of 12
million has more than 4,000 diplomatic passports.
</P>
<P>
Pen Thol, however, said Cambodia is a member of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), therefore, diplomatic
procedure shall be in conformity with the norm as being
implemented by other ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that some government officials have used diplomatic
passports for personal trips to foreign countries, and their
family members also used that kind of passports for their own
trips.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen will issue a sub-decree next Monday for who are
entitled to obtain diplomatic passports and in what occasion they
should hold them.
</P>
<P>
Lack of law enforcement and regulation on who should hold
diplomatic passports are the causes to the inflation of the
passports.

<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary
Ricardo Puno downplayed Friday the perceived "witch-hunt" of
government officials who are said to be supporters of the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Puno said in a statement in the southern Bacolod City that he
took notice of rumors that Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta is
an alleged sympathizer o the MILF, the country's largest rebel
group fighting for an independent state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, Puno said that Secretary Araneta has vehemently denied
the accusation and should be taken as such.
</P>
<P>
Puno added that there should be a "formal complaint" before the
government looks into it. He also said that government's
investigation will be done on a "case-to-case basis."
</P>
<P>
The press secretary's statement came about in the light of a
report of an alleged intelligence official who bared a "watch list
" which involved some government officials as MILF sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Puno clarified that unless there is clear and convincing
evidence, it will be set aside. However, he added that the above-
said officials should be ready to undergo investigation.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-year-old Porcelain Animals Unearthed in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Archaeologists have
excavated nearly 3,000 colored porcelain figurines of domestic
animals dating from the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The porcelain sheep, dogs, goats and pigs were found a dozen
meters underground in a pit near the tomb of Jing, the fourth
emperor of the Western Han, and his empress.
</P>
<P>
There are 231 porcelain goats standing in 19 rows which stretch
for seven meters. These black or salmon-pink goats are 40 cm long
and 25 cm tall. To the west of the formation of goats are 465
porcelain dogs which stand in 28 rows also extending for seven
meters. These dogs, colored yellow, white, black, grey or salmon-
pink, are each 30 cm long and 18 cm tall.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three porcelain sheep, which stand in six rows, and 53
piglets, in two rows, are standing to the west of the dogs. The
sheep, which are black or salmon pink, have thin and long legs,
thin tails and big buttocks. The piglets are each 18 cm long and
six cm tall.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Nanfeng, leader of the archaeological team excavating the
tomb of Emperor Jing, said that these animals are funerary objects.
He explained that this custom existed in China as long ago as the
Neolithic Age. Pigs, dogs, chickens, cows, sheep and horses were
the six common sacrificial animals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have already discovered porcelain pigs,
thought to be funerary objects, in the ruins of the Hemudu Culture
in east China, dating back 8,000 years.

<P>
HOHHOT, August 11 (Xinhua)-- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region in north China is now well prepared to offer emergency
assistance services for foreign visitors.
</P>

This has come about because the local public health bureau has
signed an agreement with the International Emergency Assistance
Service Center recently.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will cooperate to provide emergency
treatment, transportation and other medical first-aid services to
foreign visitors, the number of whom is increasing as China is now

<HEADLINE> Talented Overseas Chinese Encouraged to Develop in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China is a good place for
overseas talent to develop their skills and expertise, according
to a senior official in charge of overseas Chinese affairs.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Guo Dongpo, director of Office of
Overseas Chinese Affairs of the State Council, said that since the
mid-1990s, Chinese professionals residing abroad have been coming
back in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics showed that so far overseas talented
Chinese have established over 3,000 enterprises in various
economic development zones.
</P>
<P>
Most of the enterprises are involved in information technology,
bio-engineering, medical science, financial services and education.
Some of them have been listed on overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages and supports overseas Chinese
to develop their skills in China. A number of preferential
policies have been issued to attract more talent to return home.
</P>
<P>
China's imminent entry into the WTO and the ongoing drive to
develop its vast western regions provides enormous opportunities
for overseas talent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese who want to return home will find a lot of
opportunities to use their skills in areas such as agriculture,
the information industry, telecommunications and bio-engineering,
Guo said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Israel, Palestinians Not to Act "Unilaterally" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government called on
Israel and the Palestinians not to take unilateral actions that
will harm the Mideast peace process, Turkish Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials told visiting Israeli envoy Shlomo Ben-Ami
that Ankara wants the two sides to sort out their disputes through
U.S. mediation, without taking any "unilateral" action to deride
the current peace process, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
As envoy of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Ben-Ami, the
Israeli public security minister and acting foreign minister, paid
a one-day visit to Ankara on Thursday, informing Turkish leaders of
the developments of the Middle East peace process after the failed
Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's visit was viewed as a counter-measure against a recent
visit to Turkey by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat who sought
Ankara's support for his unilateral declaration of the Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Ben-Ami's visit, Israeli officials said that they
were "satisfied" with Turkey's statements issued after the Camp
David peace talks and Arafat's visit to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
During his last Saturday's visit, Arafat urged Muslim Turkey to
play a more active role in the Mideast peace process, especially in
the talks with Israel over the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Ottoman Turks had ruled Jerusalem, as well as the rest of
the Middle East, for 400 years until early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders assured Arafat that they would stress Ankara's
sensitivity over the Jerusalem issue, but they made no clear
support for Arafat's decision to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's meetings with the Israeli delegation, Turkish
officials raised the Jerusalem issue, saying that the city is a
holy place to three religions and its status should be determined
by taking this fact into consideration, the diplomatic sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ankara is not eager to get involved in the
Mideast peace because it faces a dilemma between its Muslim brother
Palestine and its Mideast ally Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, however, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday
that Turkey would seriously consider ways to contribute positively
to the peace process which is vital for the stability and
prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Israel did not want Turkey's direct
intervention in the Mideast peace process, but appreciated Ankara's
moderate advice to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is trying to pursue a balanced position in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, they added.
</P>
<P>
When the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid,
Spain, in 1991, Turkey allowed the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Office in Ankara to be turned into an embassy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Turkey has formed close military, political
and economic ties with Israel in order to contain their common
rivals Syria and Iran in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948, but then lowered its level of diplomatic representation to
charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv in 1981 when Israel declared
Jerusalem as its "eternal" capital. It also closed its consulate-
general in Arab East Jerusalem as well.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey reciprocally upgraded its diplomatic relations
with Israel to the level of ambassador in 1991 when it turned the
PLO Office in Ankara into an embassy.

<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Holding Company for Food Industries has sold 90
percent of the shares of the Alexandria Company for Sweets and
Chocolate, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, clinched on Thursday, is worth 27.5 million Egyptian
pounds (7.97 million U.S. dollars). It saved 10 percent of the
shares for the company's Employee Stock Ownership Program, the
holding company chairman, Adel el-Shahawi, said.
</P>
<P>
The buyer, who was not identified, has pledged to retain the
firm's employees and inject capital to upgrade production.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The trade volume between Saudi Arabia and Japan in
1999 surged to 65.11 billion U.S. dollars, thus placing the kingdom
on the first rank among member states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) in terms of trading with the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
A report on the GCC-Japan trade in l999, issued by UAE's Dubai
Commerce and Industry Chamber, said that Saudi Arabia exported 5.86
billion dollars worth of oil to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC member states jointly provide about 71 percent of
Japan's total crude oil needs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
MONTREAL -- Saudi Arabia set a new record in crude oil sales
to the U.S. market in May, with 1.5 million barrels of crude going
to the U.S. on a daily basis, said a monthly report by the U.S.
Energy Department's Energy Information Section.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Saudi Arabia was promoted to be the biggest oil provider
to the U.S., outpassing principal rivals Canada, Mexico and
Venezuela. The four provide about two thirds of the U.S. oil needs.
</P>
<P>
Canada came the second with an average of 1.4 million barrels
per
day, followed by Mexico with 1.3 million barrels, Venezuela with 1.
1 million barrels, the London-based Arabic daily Al-Haiyat on
Friday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian Power Authority (PPA) has decided to
construct a power station in the West Bank early next year.
</P>
<P>
The project's total cost, estimated at 150 million U.S. dollars,
would be funded in full by the local private sector.
</P>
<P>
PPA Chairman Abdularahman Hamad said, "After we work out the
relevant feasibility study, we will survey a location for the
project which is scheduled to be completed by 2003."
</P>
<P>
"The aim behind the venture is to terminate Israel's monopoly of
power supplies to Palestinian territories by encouraging local and
foreign entrepreneurs to invest in this area," he explained.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) composite index grew 7.18 points to close at 316.60
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip SET 50 index also gained 0.58 points to 22.33.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners 151 to 43, with 51 stocks
unchanged, on volume of 2.68 million lots worth 2.80 billion baht
(70 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The banking sector expanded 2.91 percent to 167.25, as Krung
Thai Bank (KTB) gained 5.88 percent to 13.29 baht (0.33 dollars)
per share.
</P>
<P>
Property issues ended higher as the property index climbed 0.80
points to 30.01.
</P>
<P>
The finance counter gained 33.96 to 662.92, with Ekachart
Finance growing 5.8 percent while National Finance climbed 3.17
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the market has grown 11 percent this month, analysts
said the recent rebound after a miserable year is a short-term
spike fuelled by hot money and not backed up by fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Thailand could stand to gain if Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) changes the weighting system used for
its stock indices has had much to do with the market's recent
climb, analysts said.

<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A 39-year-old lawyer was elected
on Thursday as Nigeria's third Senate president since the
restoration of democratic rule in the country last May, local
media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anyim Pius Anyim, who was born in Ishiagu village in Ebonyi
State in 1961, was sworn in as the country's youngest Senate
president in the history of the National Assembly to succeed Chuba
Okadigbo, who was removed from office on Tuesday in an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alhaji Irahim Mantu, a senator from Plateau State,
was elected as deputy Senate president to replace Alhaji Haruna
Abubakar, who resigned on Tuesday to avoid being forced to step
down.
</P>
<P>
Both Anyim and Mantu were elected after earlier nomination by
the ruling People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The crisis of the leadership in the Senate was caused by a
probe panel report last week allegedly accusing the leadership,
including former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, of violating the
anti-corruption law and enriching themselves by awarding contracts.

LUANDA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Opposition members of the Angolan
parliament ended a three-day series of encounters here on Thursday,
calling in their final declaration for an immediate cease-fire and
initiation of dialogue to end the country's decades-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Jornal de Angola quoted Filomeno Viera
Lopes, member of the Front for Democracy, as saying that there
exists consensus among the opposition parties on the necessity of
reaching peace and creating mechanisms to guarantee the
realization of free elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also consider that the decentralization
and deconcentration of power can guarantee better governance and
participation of civil society in the country's decision-making
process, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that the
opposition parties, in their final declaration, said the current
situation of the nation is "devastating" and civil war is "one of
the causes".
</P>
<P>
The final text also defends the need for the next elections to
be held in a climate of peace.
</P>
<P>
Seven opposition parties took part in the encounters, among
them are the Renovated National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, the Social Renovation Party, the National Front for the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market rode
on a winning streak this week as investors traded with direction
and in determinant fashions.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index clocked in 4.68 points or 3.95 percent to 123.
07 points at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover was 730.81 million HK dollars, which was
41.42 million HK dollars or 5.35 percent less than the total of
last week.
</P>
<P>
The market was consolidating around its strongest level since
June 30th, 1999. Due to increased appeal in broad sectors, bargain
hunters started to lift the oversold sector as well. As the
advance was broad-based, the index reaped the benefits.
</P>
<P>
Even when profit-taking set in, it did not form a force strong
enough to disperse optimism over future corporate earnings growth
and economic fundamentals that had provided key support for the
attempt to trek higher.
</P>
<P>
The market will trade with nice gains on the plus side, as a
drag is not likely to be created on a strong conviction for bulls,
according to Homeway, a leading on-line financial and securities
advisory company.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review of Shanghai A Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite Index
advanced 36.31 points or 1.8 percent to 2062.67 points this week
compared with last week's 2026.36 points.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover this week stood at 74.15 billion yuan, 14.8
percent more than last week's 64.59 billion yuan, according to
Homeway, a leading online financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Shanghai Composite Index continued to
rewrite new high records almost every day and touched 2070.3
points on Friday. The market bullish trend moved reposefully and
turnover was extended properly.
</P>
<P>
Another feature in the upward trend is that the index always
jumped after the market opened every trading day and continue to
move upward most of the trading time, and then ended just below
the day's peak. Hence, the index could touch a new high easily the
next day.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more companies reached their ceiling prices within
one day this week, which rarely happened in the past few weeks'
upward trend, implying that some big players started buying. Big
player-held shares and some ST shares performed actively during
the week.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, five companies' 271 million transferred rights
shares were listed on the Shanghai stock market. At the same time,
three new A shares made their debuts on the Shenzhen market,
however, the market expansion did not influence the market's
upward trend.
</P>
<P>
High-tech shares performed differently early this week and on
Friday. Tsinghua Tongfang Co., Ltd and CITIC Guoan Information
Industry Co., Ltd the bellwethers of high-tech shares, released
their interim reports Friday morning, and the two companies'
earnings per share in the first half of the year declined more
than 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively, from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
When the two companies resumed trading this afternoon, they
brought down high-tech shares and the market as well.
</P>
<P>
Although more interim report risks will be exposed in the
coming days, the Shanghai Composite Index may move to 2100 points
next week, bolstered by the sound economic development and
favorable government policies toward the stock market.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Japanese Cabinet Members Planned Homage to Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today made a comment on some Japanese
cabinet members' decision to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, a bastion
of the wartime government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of
militarism in Japan before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that paying homage to the shrine concerns whether or
not a correct attitude is adopted towards the history of
aggression committed by Japanese militarists in the past, which
constitutes the core of the matter.
</P>
<P>
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Japan's attitude towards visit to
the Yasukuni Shrine directly concerns the feelings of the Asian
people, including the Chinese people, who were victimized by
Japanese militarism, and also affects the relations between Japan
and other countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the Japanese side to proceed from the perspective of
deep introspection with a correct attitude towards history, and
handle the matter in a cautious manner, so as to win the trust of
the Asian people and maintain the Sino-Japanese friendship with
concrete actions.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Terms Baghdad Visit as Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez said here late Thursday night that his visit to Iraq
has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
During the short visit, the first by a head of state to Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War, Chavez discussed with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein on the issues of common concern, including the oil
prices, the relationship between the oil-producing countries and
oil-consuming nations, as well as the unity among the members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Chavez expressed belief that the visit
will surely improve the bilateral relations, adding that the two
countries signed two agreements of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chavez invited Saddam to attend the OPEC summit meeting due to
be held in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas in September, but he
did not say whether Saddam had accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president has not left Iraq for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
As to the oil prices, Chavez said that they should range from 22
to 28 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, the current OPEC president, told reporters that he will
make a proposal at the OPEC summit meeting that when the oil prices
are below 22 dollars or over 28 dollars, the OPEC should
automatically increase or decrease oil production by 500,000
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Chavez made clear at the press conference that the United States
can not dictate its foreign policy. "We are an independent country
and have our independent foreign policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's trip has been under U.S. criticism.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on Tuesday
that Washington could not understand the visit and would be raising
the issue with "relevant" Venezuelan officials.
</P>
<P>
"We do think it is a rather dubious distinction to be the first
democratically elected head of state to go and meet with the
dictator of Iraq," the spokesman said, adding that Chavez is making
the visit without the approval of the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel has rejected the
criticism by declaring that there is no U.N. resolution banning
dignitaries from visiting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only interest Chavez has in visiting Iraq is
that it is an OPEC nation, of which Venezuela is also a member.
</P>
<P>
Chavez arrived at the border point overland from Iran, and was
received upon arrival by senior Iraqi officials including Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan and Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Aboard an Iraqi military helicopter, Chavez arrived in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad at 15:53 local time (1153 GMT) and Izzat Ibrahim,
vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, has been
waiting for his arrival at the Saddam international airport.
</P>
<P>
The key objective of Chavez's ongoing 10-nation tour is to
personally invite all OPEC members to attend the OPEC September
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will leave Baghdad on Friday morning for Iran and from
Iran he will head for Indonesia for a visit.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Indonesia, the trip will also take him to Libya,
Nigeria and Algeria before returning to Caracas on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Besides Iraq, Chavez has visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates and Iran.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Signs Show Shas Not to Rejoin Barak's Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Lou Jian
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A series of signs in the past
few days show that the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's former ruling partner, will not return
to the coalition in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing party resigned from the cabinet ahead of last
month's Camp David summit talks, accusing Barak of refusing to show
them his "red lines", or uncompromisable conditions, in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, along with the bow-out of other right-wing
parties in Barak's government, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National
Religious Party, made the coalition's control in the Knesset
(Parliament) shrink from a 68 majority to a 42 minority. Later, the
two-member Gesher Party led by former Foreign Minister David Levy
also jumped ship.
</P>
<P>
Since the Camp David talks failed to reach any agreement, Barak
returned to strengthen his ruling base, in hope of resurrecting a
coalition similar to that ahead of the Camp David summit, that is
to say, including Shas.
</P>
<P>
However, it now appears that Barak tried in vain to tempt them
back, and the coalition talks with Shas, which holds critical 17
seats in the 120-member Knesset, may have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef said in an
interview, published by the Ma'ariv daily Friday morning, that he
will support Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's Likud predecessor, as the
next prime minister if early elections are held.
</P>
<P>
According to the interview, Yosef said Barak "is persecuting"
his party. "He threw us behind his back...I don't see anyway to go
back to a coalition with him...He doesn't behave like a leader,
doesn't listen to others," said the Shas mentor.
</P>
<P>
"He (Barak) is no heir to (late Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin...
with Netanyahu we could solve everything...if there are elections
we'll support him and he'll beat Barak," Yosef added.
</P>
<P>
The Rabbi was caught into a great political disturbance because
of his last Saturday's sermon, in which he said 6 million Jews
murdered by Nazis during the World War II were reincarnated
sinners, and the Palestinians are "snakes".
</P>
<P>
The controversial remarks deeply hurt Israel's leftists and
Holocaust survivors' feelings, which might make Barak reconsider
his plan to reintroduce Shas to his coalition.
</P>
<P>
The second sign, showing Shas may become the opposition
permanently, is that in the past few days, Barak announced a series
of cabinet nominations, completing filling the four vacant slots of
the ministries left behind by Shas.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, coalition ruling partner Center Party's senior
legislator Roni Milo was appointed as Acting Health Minister.
Barak's Labor party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen was also
nominated Wednesday as Acting Labor and Social Affairs Minister,
which was once held by Shas leader Eli Yishai.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, it was announced that Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
also would head the Religious Affairs Ministry, and Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat act as National Infrastructure Minister
concurrently.
</P>
<P>
If Barak had made progress in coalition talks with Shas,
analysts said, he may not bother to name interim ministers, which
he would have to fire if Shas ministers returned.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the left-wing Meretz party, Shas's political natural
enemy, is poised to rejoin the coalition. Barak left the three
portfolios previously held by Meretz unoccupied until now.
</P>
<P>
The secular party's ministers resigned from the government but
remained in coalition in June due to their differences with Shas
over the financial funding for the religious party's educational
network, which is under the authority of Meretz-controlled
Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader and former Education Minister Yossi Sarid said
Thursday that his party is ready to return to the government
immediately, adding that he will manage the Education Ministry
himself.
</P>
<P>
Considering Shas is vehemently opposed to Sarid's re-nominating
as education minister, the optimistic remarks made by Sarid show
there is trouble in Barak-Shas talks.
</P>
<P>
All these signs let analysts speculate that Barak may begin to
accept the fact that any post-Camp David government will not
include the Shas party, which simply objects to making concessions
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, some cautious analysts also pointed out that Shas,
which had been famous for its master brinkmanship, may change its
mind regarding joining Barak's coalition at the last minute, as it
had done before.
</P>
<P>
To play safe, Barak's office also maintained that the latest
ministerial appointments were not aimed at excluding any potential
partners from joining the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, a coalition without Shas will be a minority government,
if Likud does not participate in. Such a minority government will
depend on some Israeli Arab parties' support for its survival in
the votes of future no-confidence motions and early elections
bills.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, early elections may be unavoidable. Sarid
conceded Thursday that at the current stage, "it will be very
difficult to form a stable, lasting coalition."

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tianchi, a lake on the top of
Mount Changbai in northeast China's Jilin Province, has been
recognized as the highest volcanic lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
A nearby waterfall, which plunges 68 meters over a cliff, is
also regarded as the largest waterfall originating from crater
lakes.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Office of the Guinness Book of World Records has

recently.
</P>
<P>
With an altitude of 2,189.1 meters, Tianchi covers an area of 9.
82 square kilometers. The lake is the deepest mountain lake in
China with an average depth of 204 meters. The Changbai Waterfall
is 1,250 meters away from the crater lake.
</P>
<P>
Mount Changbai is a famous scenic spot which has attracted
tourists worldwide, including Chinese and foreign senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that now Mount Changbai has found an entry in
the Guinness Book of Records, it will become better known
throughout the world and help boost the local tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Reforms For China's Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China's railways expect to
implement reform by separating its administrative departments from
business ones, following the information and civil aviation
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The industry will establish some passenger and cargo transport
firms and a railway network company, taking the place of the
current system combining railways administrative with business
departments, according to an official with the Ministry of
Railways.
</P>
<P>
The railway network company will be in charge of railways
construction and management under the Ministry, while transport
enterprises will become independent market entities.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the reform is to build up passenger
transport companies, said the official, adding that the reform
will take about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
To date, four local railway bureaus have established
independent passenger transport companies.
</P>
<P>
The integration of administrative and business departments
have negatively affected the industry's development, resulting in
a significant drop of passenger and cargo turnover. In 1994, China
's railways became a loss-making industry.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Central Bank Cuts Bank Reserves to Spur Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Jordan has
freed some 423 million U.S. dollars to the kingdom's banking system
after the bank cut, twice in less than six months, the compulsory
reserve requirement on private bank's foreign and domestic
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The statutory bank reserve has been cut to the current 10
percent from 14 percent in March, with the latest 2 percent cut
conducted on August 1, to encourage more lendings to spur the
sluggish national economy, bankers here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to raise commercial banks ability to lend further to
help in activating the economy in an unprecedented period of
monetary stability," Governor of the Central Bank Ziyad Fariz told
reporters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign and local currency deposits of the 23
commercial banks operating in the kingdom stood at 7.9 billion
Jordanian dinars (11.14 billion dollars) at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the reduction of reserve requirement was part of
the efforts by the central bank to encourage banks to further lower
their lending rates and to increase returns and funds available for
lending.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and other monetary authorities believe that if
banks lend more cheaply to companies, it would spur the economic
growth which balked at around 1.5 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting a 3 percent economic growth this
year with free lending policies, more foreign investments and
tourism revenues as well as measures to increase the kingdom's
exports to Iraq, Syria, Palestinian self-rule areas and its
traditional markets in Arab Gulf countries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Democrat Party to Elect New Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Democrat Party will
soon elect new secretary-general to replace Sanan Kachornprasart,
who stepped down from the post on Thursday, hours after the
Constitutional Court ruled that he intentionally submitted a fake
report on his assets and liabilities to the National Counter
Corruption Commission, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Akrapol Sorasuchart, who is also a
Democrat was quoted as saying that the Democrat Party's
administrative committee would soon convene to select a new
secretary-general to take over Sanan's tasks.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiseth, who
is currently Deputy Secretary-General, was to be acting secretary-
general, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the party's rule, the appointment of a new
secretary-general would be completed within 90 days after the
stepping down of an old one, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Sanan resigned from the posts of Deputy Prime Minister and
Interior Minister on March 29, the day before the National Counter
Corruption Commission ruled that he had lied in declaring his loan
worth 45 million baht (about 1.125 million U.S. dollars) to a
financial institute, named AAS Auto Service Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He stepped down from the post of Secretary-General of the
Democrat Party, just hours after the Constitutional Court ruled
with unanimous votes on Thursday that he submitted a fake report
on his assets and liabilities to the National Counter Corruption
Commission, and banned him from taking any political office for
five years.
</P>
<P>
Sanan has said he will accept a final ruling of the
Constitutional Court, which does not allow any appeal, but has
reiterated that he did not corrupt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted as saying
that he called Sanan to express his regret and sympathy to the
former secretary-general, but stressed that the party accepted the
Constitutional Court's ruling, and would have to face the truth,
though it would, more or less, affect the party in the next
general election.
</P>
<P>
The Thai leader pledged that he would dissolve the House after
the passage of key bills over the next weeks, including the 2001
budget bill and the amended election law.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government has just
formulated new rules to ensure State-financed Vietnamese students
to return from abroad, according to a report of local English
daily Vietnam News Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision which came into force as of August 4 is applied to
the country's State officials, post graduate and undergraduate
students and vocational trainees from the 1999-2000 academic year.
</P>
<P>
Refund must be paid if a student does not return to the country
three months after his training course's conclusion, or if the
student has to return to Vietnam ahead of time due to violation of
academic rules or because he has chosen to drop out of his course.
</P>
<P>
Besides, refund will also be claimed from students who return
to the country as planned but refuse to work for their former
office, or who apply for residence in another country while
studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
This also extends to students who quit their offices or apply
for residence in a foreign country when their time of public
service is less than three times the length of their study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Refund would include overseas and domestic training fees,
airfares, monthly stipends and other relevant expenses.
</P>
<P>
In another measure, the above-said students will be required to
either deposit 1,000 U.S. dollars as a guarantee or present their
family's warranty before leaving Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Coup Leader, Supporters Charged with Treason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's coup leader George
Speight and 14 others were charged with treason and conspiracy to
commit treason on Friday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
(ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
All have been remanded in custody till August 25, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The charges are related to the military takeover of Fiji's
Parliament on the May 19 and other events stretching into July.
</P>
<P>
Speight and his fellows accused were brought to the Suva
Magistrates Court very late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They had hopes of winning bail but that sentiment was quickly
dashed with the prosecution introducing three new charges, the ABC
said.
</P>
<P>
The new charges include treason, conspiracy to commit treason
and being accessories to treason.
</P>
<P>
The treason charge in theory carries the death penalty and the
other charges have a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Speight and 12 others were charged with a range
of firearms offenses and unlawful assembly in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Push Through Peace Process With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will push through despite the
bounty on three of its leaders who are not involved in the
negotiations, the Philippine government maintained Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said security and safety
guarantees (SSGs) issued to members of the MILF peace panel remain
valid, with another meeting set for August 15 with government
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Zamora issued the statement after the government offered to
provide 9-million-peso (225,000 U.S. dollars) reward for the
capture of MILF's chairman Hashim Salamat, its vice chairman for
military affairs Al Haj Murad and its spokesman Eid Kabalu.
</P>
<P>
The three MILF leaders are facing murder and multiple
frustrated murder charges for their involvement in a series of
bombings incidents in Metro Manila and Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"The three are not involved in the negotiations. All those
involved in the talks have been given SSGs," Zamora said in a
radio interview adding that "we are confident the meeting will
push through."
</P>
<P>
Zamora also stressed that the government continues to
rehabilitate Mindanao and pour resources into the island, as shown
by the recent visit of President Joseph Estrada starting on August
9.
</P>
<P>
Estrada plans to spend one month in office in Mindanao and the
Visayas and return to Manila only for brief breaks to attend to
urgent matters in the Presidential Palace.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN+3 Ministers to Unveil AMF Blueprint by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Finance Ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, and South
Korea (ASEAN+3), are expected to unveil a blueprint of the so-
called Asian Monetary Fund (AMF) by the end of this year, a Thai
government report said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are actively examining technical details of a web
of central bank swap lines and repurchase agreements concerning
the AMF, it said.
</P>
<P>
China, Japan, and South Korea are also working closely on
sharing information, and monitoring economic and financial trends
in the region, which is a landmark step of the planned Asian
surveillance process to underpin the agreed swap scheme, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The AMF is a currency safety net accord, agreed by the ASEAN+3
finance ministers at the annual meeting of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) in Thailand's northern resort province of Chiang Mai in
May.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of setting up the AMF is that any country of
the ASEAN+3 finding itself short of foreign reserves will be able
to borrow from others in the agreed network to absorb and address
unjustified selling pressure on its currency by speculators
without having to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Fish Ban on Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
finally approved the resumption of Uganda's fish exports to its
member states, Ugandan Fishery Minister Kisamba Mugerwa told
Xinhua Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The decision took effect on August 4, and now the member
countries of EU have already imported fishery products from Uganda,
with the Uganda authorities' safety guarantees of the fishery
products," Mugerwa said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to confirm the Uganda's guarantees and upgrade its
fish exports, Uganda offers EU an on-the-spot inspection of Uganda
's facilities from October 2 to 6," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a ban on Uganda's fish exports to its member
states in March 1999 following reports of fish poisoning in the
East African country, causing loss of over 30 million U.S. dollars
in export earnings for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kagoda, Permanent Secretary in Ugandan Ministry of
Tourism Trade and Industry, said last month that the Ugandan
government has spent millions of U.S. dollars on laboratory
equipment to test the quality of fish exports to the EU.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Diversify Fish Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
planning to diversify its marketing of the country's fish and fish
products to avoid over-reliance on the European Union (EU) markets,
a senior governmental official has said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure Thursday told outgoing
Iranian Ambassador Mohamned Tabatabae to Kenya in his Nairobi
office that the ban on fish and fish products by the EU about two
years ago has impacted negatively on Kenya's economic growth, the
state-run Kenya Times newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ban was frustrating the government's war against poverty as
it denied families their only source of livelihood, Obure said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister expressed optimism that the ban would be
lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
The EU banned fish from Kenya in January 1998 because it failed
to meet the hygiene demands set by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exported 52,000 tons of fish, mostly Nile perch from
Victoria Lake, to the EU in 1997 and earned 862 million shillings
(about 14 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Obure told Tabatabae that his government will soon send a
delegation of agricultural experts to Iran to learn how to manage
fish processing and water resources.
</P>
<P>
Tabatabae said the Iranian government will offer training
opportunities to personnel from Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti President Ismail
Omar Guelleh has urged the Somali National Peace Conference to
hold the first sitting of the transitional national assembly (TNA)
by this weekend, said reports reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Djibouti government officials as saying it
is hard to predict the schedule of the proposed TNA meeting. But
meeting organizers said two major clans in Somalia, the Darood and
the Hawiye, handed in their nomination lists for the proposed
meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Darood clan gave 55 percent of its allocated 44 seats to
the Harti subclan confederation, the reports said, while among the
Harti's quota of 24 seats, the Majertein has received the lion's
share with 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Marehan, the clan of former Somali president Mohamed Siad
Barre, received nine seats within the Harti confederation,
accounting for 21 percent of the distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Somali National Peace Conference, which has been going on
in Djibouti since May, is trying to bring a final peace to the war-
torn country.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Government Forces Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The government forces of
Kyrgyzstan are Friday fighting some 40 rebels that invaded the
Batken region in the south of the Central Asian republic Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two Kyrgyz servicemen have been wounded in the fighting, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting Osmonakun Ibraimov, Kyrgyz
presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report of rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
Ibraimov said the rebels invaded Kyrgyzstan in order to get
into neighboring Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Military operations are taking place in an unpopulated
mountainous region, Ibraimov said, adding that the Kyrgyz armed
forces have enough manpower and resources to liquidate or drive
the invaders away from the Kyrgyz territory.
</P>
<P>
The rebel detachment is most likely headed by Dzhuma Namangani,
one of the leaders of an Islamic separatist movement, Interfax
said, citing sources in the Kyrgyz Defense Ministry. Namangani's
detachment was seen the other day in the Leninabad region in the
northern part of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan is fighting between 70 and 100 Islamic militants
who entered southern Uzbekistan on Saturday. Government forces
reportedly killed 16 of the rebels on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan believed that the Islamic militants entered its
southern border from Tajikistan, but Dushanbe denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic terrorists in Uzbekistan are also believed to be
followers of Namangani's movement, which aims to create an anti-
government terrorist base in southern Uzbekistan. The movement
plotted a massive terrorist invasion into southern Kyrgyzstan a
year ago.

TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo, boosted by active buying by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 141.85 points, or 0.89
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 16,117.50.

89.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index opened lower on Thursday's decline in New
York's Nasdaq composite index but soon turned upward partly
because foreign investors, the major driving force in the Tokyo
stock market, turned net buyers, providing domestic investors with
an incentive to buy, traders said.
</P>
<P>
While market focus was on whether the central bank will scrap
its zero-interest-rate policy at its Policy Board meeting, which
started earlier in the day, traders said a rate hike would not
have a large impact on the stock market.

<P>
TIANJIN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Haidong, a customer manager
for a international trading website company, is often seen in
China with a notebook computer and a digital camera shuttling back
and forth among cities and villages. His task is to talk to local
entrepreneurs and show them what the Internet and e-business could
bring for them.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues and I are like e-missionaries preaching the `new
economy,'" said Zhou, who is in his 30s and works at the Tianjin
Office of Global Sources, a business to business(B2B) website
engaged to international trade.
</P>
<P>
The new economy is based on the Internet and technological
innovation that has helped the growth of the economy in his home
country, the United States. It means new business opportunities to
Zhou and other e-missionaries like him.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and his colleagues have been trying to convince local
people who are unfamiliar with the Internet through demonstrations.
He has been trying to tell them the Internet is a rare bridge
linking their remote towns with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The e-missionaries have to repeatedly tell the customers that
online trading will save 85 percent of the cost compared with
traditional trading. The more important thing is that they will
then be able to play in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
"It's no easy job," he admitted. "Usually these entrepreneurs
are ambitious to explore the market, but they know little about e-
business."
</P>
<P>
While an increasing number of urban youngsters are turning
themselves into "netizens,"(a citizen of the net) most Chinese
have never had access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the new Internet vocabulary, using words like ".
com," "online," "website," and "e-mail", has flooded into the
lives of Chinese people overnight. From time to time, people are
reminded of the cyber age by the dazzling ads of the online
businesses painted on buses and in subway stations.
</P>
<P>
Figures are convincing. According to an estimation by the
Ministry of Information Industry, China's e-business trade volume
will hit 800 million yuan (96.4 million U.S. dollars) at the end
of this year and will reach 20 billion (2.4 billion U.S. dollars)
by the year 2002.

E-business is like a pizza pie just out of the oven, people can
't wait to have a piece of it, but some are hesitant.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the State Economic and Trade Commission among 300
leading Chinese enterprises showed that 70 percent of them have
yet to fully make use of the Internet. All that they have done so
far was to establish a homepage and register an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoyang, president of Sohu company, said traditional
businesses in China are still not motivated enough to embrace the
cyber age.
</P>
<P>
He warned that they would have to cross swords with their major
competitors from abroad once China gains access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO). There will be no way out for the traditional
businesses if they are still taking a "wait and see" attitude
towards the growing e-business.
</P>
<P>
Some experts even believed that after trade barriers disappear
along with China's entry into the WTO, e-business is likely to
emerge as a new trade barrier for those who have not yet converted.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that all traditional businesses take e-business as
a way to integrate into the 'new economy', which will break down
the traditional economic barriers that have been set up in
different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The cyber-based 'New Economy Age' is a time that players are
given a chance to reshuffle the cards. China has been left behind
in some areas since the first industrial revolution. The 'new
economy' enables China to begin the economic race at the same
starting point with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zongtang, chairman of China Industrial Economics
Association, pointed out that the Internet has provided the
traditional industries in China with the possibility of cutting
management costs and increasing market share by making use of
resources around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is a high-powered engine which can lead a
business and even a country to the expressway of development,"
said Zhou.

higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
They were found to have submitted false statistical reports to

<HEADLINE> China Increases Investment in Relics Excavation at Yangtze Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China will allocate 100
million yuan to excavate cultural relics at the dam area of the
gigantic Three Gorges Project before the area is flooded around
2003.
</P>
<P>
The figure is equal to the total amount of special funds China
earmarks each year for cultural relics protection and half of the
investment in excavating cultural relics at the Three Gorges over
the past three years, said Shao Weidong, an official with the
Chongqing Municipal Cultural Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to excavate cultural objects buried at a
120,000-square-meter dam, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project on the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River, the world's largest hydro-electric power project, will
flood a land area of 632 sq km upon its completion. After a three-
year investigation, Chinese archeologists worked out a protection
plan in 1992, listing 1,087 sites of cultural relics for top
government protection costing 1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 2,000 rare cultural relics dating back to
the stone age period have been unearthed from the dam area near
Chongqing. These relics are of great importance to the study of
the history of civilization along the upper and middle reaches of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the reservoir will climb to 135 meters
around 2003. Cultural relics below 135 meters must be excavated
and moved to other places before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 archeologists from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and universities and cultural relics protection
departments across the country have arrived at the Three Gorges
for speedy excavation of the valuable relics.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Jelawat has caused a
series of traffic problems in China's largest city of Shanghai
although emergency measures have been taken to minimize its impact.
</P>
<P>
Since yesterday morning nearly all shipping routes from
Shanghai Port have been forced to close and 18 passenger liners
could not run, leaving more than 5,000 passengers stranded.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains and winds have also forced the motorized ferry on
the Huangpu River, which separates downtown Shanghai from Pudong,
suspended.
</P>
<P>
Seven passenger flights scheduled to arrive at the Pudong
International Airport had to land at the Hongqiao International

<HEADLINE> China to Sell Sugar Reserves to Curb Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to sell part of its
sugar reserves to push down surging prices on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission announced today that
the government will sell the sugar reserves at an open auction on
the Beijing sugar market soon.
</P>
<P>
All domestic enterprises and foreign trade companies that are
allowed to process and trade in sugar will be eligible to apply
for a bid at the auction.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the move is designed to ease a
shortage of sugar supplies caused by frost strikes in sugar
production bases in south China last winter and reduced area of
sugar crops this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the price of granulated sugar has
reached 4,000 yuan (481.9 U.S. dollars) per ton in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, the largest sugar producer in China,
from around 3,000 yuan at beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the China Sugar Industry Association said that
despite the expected short supply of one million tons of sugar at
the domestic market, China does not need to import sugar this year.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the sales of state reserves will push the prices
down to around 3,500 yuan (421.7 U.S. dollars) per ton, the
current price level on the international market.
</P>
<P>
China closed down 149 small sugar refineries last year and
reduced the area of sugar crops by 200,000 hectares this year to
cut redundant sugar production capacity and improve the
profitability of sugar companies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Authorities Postpone Decision on Cyprus Drug Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian authorities have
postponed until next Wednesday making decision whether to release a
Cyprus drug suspect on bail, Cyprus Weekly newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maria Antoniadou, a 19-year-old Nicosia woman, has spent the
last fortnight in an Egyptian jail after she was arrested in Port
Said for possessing 3.5 kilograms of marijuana as she was ready to
board a Cyprus-bound cruise liner.
</P>
<P>
Antoniadou's mother Angela told the paper from Egypt that the
attorney-general of Egypt's Ismailia Governorate has postponed his
decision whether to release her on bail until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the attorney-general has postponed his
decision, initially scheduled for last Saturday and then Monday.
</P>
<P>
After enormous efforts by Antoniadou's parents and a second
statement by her to the Egyptian authorities, the attorney-general
agreed to study Antoniadou's file and decide whether to release her
on bail until she stands trial.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian law, the Egyptian authorities have the right to
detain Antoniadou for six months until her trial.
</P>
<P>
Antoniadou's mother claimed that her daughter was innocent and
the victim of a drug ring which misled her and set her up.
</P>
<P>
After seeing her daughter Thursday for 20 minutes for the first
time in ten days, she said her daughter was "on the verge of a
nerve breakdown, with very low morale."
</P>
<P>
Antoniadou was arrested by Egyptian police on July 25. Police
said they found the drugs concealed in a secret compartment in her
suitcase.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a tough policy on drug-related crimes for the past
decade, with the maximum sentence for drug trafficking being death.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Strives to Sustain National Unity and Territorial Integrity: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indonesian Foreign
Minister Alwi Shihab has said that the Indonesian government is
striving to sustain national unity and protect its territorial
integrity despite the fact that it has to contend with many
threats to peace and order currently, especially communal strife
in Maluku and separatist movement in Irian Jaya and Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Distinguished Public Lecture
organized by the Institute for Defense and Security Studies of
Singapore, the minister said that the Indonesian government is
earnestly striving to redress the people's grievances that have
accumulated under the past regime and to restore investors'
confidence by establishing a level playing field for all economic
players, rebuilding and strengthening the banking sector, helping
the corporate sector out of its financial difficulties and
reforming the national economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating the conflict in Maluku, the foreign minister said
that the conflict there seems to have religious overtones, but
actually is a communal strife driven by local economic disparities
and intensified by the presence of forces from other parts of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The government, while actively encouraging the local leaders to
engage in dialogue toward reconciliation, is doing its best to
enforce the law firmly and impartially in line with the
presidential decree imposing a state of civil emergency on June 26,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tension in Irian Jaya or West Papua, Shihab
said that the separatist movement there has become a matter of
grievous national concern, particularly after the Congress of the
People of Papua in early June this year which asserted that Papua
had become a sovereign national and an independent state on
December 1, 1961, which a Dutch-sponsored pro-independence group
at that time declared to be the Papua's national day.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indonesian government rejects "the result of
that Congress as a blatant distortion of history, a travesty of
the Indonesian constitution and a violation of the UN Charter".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Indonesian government will take firm
measures against any action to implement the result of that
Congress although his government will maintain dialogue with the
people of the Province of Irian Jaya in order to address their
needs and aspirations in the framework of the Unitary State of the
Republic of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the Aceh problem, he said the government and the
Free Aceh Movement signed on May 12, 2000, the Joint Understanding
on Humanitarian Pause for Aceh, which would facilitate the
distribution of humanitarian aid in the province and give the
weary population a respite from the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from audiences, Shihab said that his
government is striving to do its utmost to create a healthy
investment environment and to this objective President Abdurrahman
Wahid has decided that he should delegate some of his
responsibilities to the vice president in order to lesson
political controversy and tension.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of East Timor, Shihab said that Indonesia plans to
close down the refugee camps in its territory and needs help from
the international community to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
As a first step towards the shutting-off, he said,
registrations will be made to know who is willing to return to
East Timor and who is willing to relocate to other parts of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia has to exercise a good relationship with all
its immediate neighbors including Australia with which Indonesia
had bitter experience.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that efforts are going on to pave way for a
visit to Australia by Indonesian President Wahid in October this
year.
</P>
<P>
Shihab is here on a two-day official visit to Singapore and has
called on Singapore President S.R. Nathan, and Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and met with his Singapore counterpart S. Jayakumar and
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo since his
arrival on Thursday. He will also call on Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew who is a member of the International
Advisory Panel of Indonesian President Wahid.

<HEADLINE> Political Parties Not Banned in Pakistan: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The military government of
Pakistan has no intention of dissolving any political party
despite the ban of convicts to hold party office, an official
spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The amended Political Parties Act is just to purge the corrupt
and dishonest elements from political parties, the anonymous
spokesman was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The criticism against the amended Political Parties Act 1962
is uncalled for as legitimate political parties are already
functioning without any restriction," he added.
</P>
<P>
The political parties, including Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)
and Pakistan Muslim League (PML) would not be prevented to take
part in the democratic process, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were announced by President Rafiq Tarar on
Wednesday providing that a convicted person or anyone who is
otherwise disqualified to be elected as a member of the parliament,
will not be able to hold party office.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will hit the heads of PPP and PML as both
Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, the two former prime ministers of
Pakistan, have been convicted by the accountability court on
charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the national interest that criminals should not take
part in the political process," the spokesman said, adding that
the law is not directed against any political party or person.
</P>
<P>
However, both PPP and PML have condemned the amended act and
decided not to replace their party heads to defy it. The two
parties will also challenge the act in the supreme court.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Send Delegation Over U.S. Anti-Zimbabwe Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A Southern African Development
Community (SADC) delegation will leave for the United States next
month to campaign against the controversial Zimbabwe Democracy Act
of 2000, the Herald newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Minister of Foreign Affairs Stan Mudenge Thursday
told reporters that the decision to send a delegation was made at
the newly-ended SADC summit meeting in Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is a major trading partner with most of the
countries in the SADC region," Mudenge said. "The Heads of State
decision was taken in view of the fact that any form of sanctions
against Zimbabwe will seriously hurt their economies as well."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Democracy Act of 2000, passed by the U.S. Senate in
June and due to be considered by the House of Representatives,
would bar aid and debt relief and instruct U.S. executive
directors of multinational lending institutions to oppose credits
to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Describing the act as a shocking piece of legislation, Mudenge
said contrary to the West's view that it will promote peace and
order, the Bill will actually promote chaos and instability.
</P>
<P>
According to the United States, the bill was introduced in
response to state-sponsored violence and intimidation in the run-
up to Zimbabwe's fifth parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Withdraw Court Action Against President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers
Union (CFU) is withdrawing all its litigation against President
Robert Mugabe, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri and war
veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi over farm acquisition and
occupations, The Herald newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday night, CFU President Tim Henwood
said "the union is withdrawing all litigation that it has
initiated in the past two weeks on matters concerning the
acquisition and occupation of commercial farms in the country."
</P>
<P>
"This has been done with a view to improving the atmosphere for
meaningful dialogue from which it is anticipated that a solution
will be attained that will be more satisfactory than any that can
be secured by continuing to pursue the protracted process of law,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But the CFU will only, in its two-pronged bid to end the farm
occupations, drop the legal proceeding after the president takes
immediate action to end the occupations, Henwood said.
</P>
<P>
The CFU application named President Mugabe as a respondent "
because of the material role that he has played in the persistence
of the farm invasions".
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white commercial
farms since February this year.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Deepen Reforms in Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Finance Daniel Yona has urged African countries to deepen reforms
in their financial sectors to ensure a sustainable growth of the
overall economy, newspapers here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day symposium of the Association of African
Central Banks Thursday, Yona said reforms in the financial sector
have stimulated growth in many African countries through increased
savings and mobilization.
</P>
<P>
He said over the past two and a half decades, financial sector
reforms in Africa have been considered an integral part of overall
economic and structural reforms because of the crucial role played
by the sector in economic growth and social development.
</P>
<P>
"While strong financial systems reap the full benefits of
globalization, weak financial systems act as a conduit for the
spread of financial crisis," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that weakness in the financial sector,
particularly banking, weak regulatory and disclosure framework
clearly contribute to the crisis in emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
"As we liberalize our financial systems, we need to ensure that
we strengthen our mechanisms for proper regulation and supervision
of our financial institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is high time that Africa took stock of its current reforms
and other initiatives being pursued in the wake of accelerated
globalization, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Review Import Duty Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ)
has called on the government to examine the import duty structure
in the country ahead of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa Free Trade Area scheduled for October 31, the Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ has particularly called on the Ministry of Finance and
Commerce, Trade and Industry to check on the import duty structure
in relation to other countries in the region especially for raw
materials, intermediate goods and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ, in a recent report on exporters audit, complained that
Zambian exporters are at present disadvantaged in relation to
competing exporters in the region whose production for export is
subsidized and is able to get inputs at world market prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zambia's only hope for better economy
lies in Non-Traditional Exports (NTEs), which, when expressed as a
percentage of total exports, increased by 39.4 percent in 1999
against 33.2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This increase has to be viewed against a decline in total
exports in the same period, the report stressed, saying one of the
ways of stimulating positive growth of NTEs is through offering,
to exporters, Value Added Tax relief on telecommunication charges
and excise duty relief on electricity, by making them refunded or
zero rated.
</P>
<P>
This would in turn improve exporters' working capital base and
reduce production costs, thereby enhancing their price
competitiveness on the world market, the report said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Resume Import of Belgian Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to resume
the import of Belgian pork as from this month, said the
Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the ministry investigated breeding
conditions of pigs and sanitation of slaughter houses in Belgium
last April.
</P>
<P>
The first shipments of Belgian pork are expected to arrive in
early September.
</P>
<P>
All Belgian pork will be inspected with dioxin detectors, which
were recently set up, and the government will stop the imports if
any harmful chemicals are detected, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many countries prohibited the import of Belgian pork when they
found serious dioxin contamination in the pork last year. South
Korean experts found dioxin in Belgian exported pork and chicken
in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The dioxin issue re-appeared this year when a Belgian brand of
animal feed was found to contain the cancer-causing chemical.
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision of the South Korean government is expected to
meet resistance from farmers and civic organizations as the South
Korean Swine Association has already met troubles in exporting
Belgian pork.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has a stock of 160,000 tons of domestic pork after
an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease restricted its pork export.

GUANGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at Jiangmen,
a port city in south China's Guangdong Province, uncovered and
investigated 39 cases involving passengers sneaking pornographic
publications from overseas into the Chinese mainland in the first
seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Customs sources said that they confiscated 99 video compact
disks (VCD), 77 pornographic books and 1,619 pornographic computer
pictures from the 39 cases they investigated.
</P>
<P>
Most of the carriers were young men who attempted to smuggle
the pornographic publications by way of hiding the pornographic
materials inside their luggage.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated pornographic publications will be destroyed
according to the regulations of the state, said customs sources.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the negative impact of pornographic publications on
Chinese youngsters, China has issued decrees banning entry of
pornographic publications from overseas. Offenders will be given
fines ranging from 100 yuan to 50,000 yuan in accordance with the
amount and type of pornographic publications.

restore an ancient Tibetan temple damaged in an earthquake 73
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Banta Temple, located 20 kilometers southeast of Wuwei in
northwest China's Gansu province, can serve as an evidence that
Tibet has been a part of China since Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
In 1247, a historic meeting was held between the Chinese
government and a Tibetan religious and political leader, who later
declared from that time on that Tibet was under Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A pagoda was built in the temple to preserve the body of the
leader, who died in 1251.
</P>
<P>
However, a strong earthquake in 1927 destroyed the 42.7-meter-
high pagoda. At the request of scholars and local people, the
Central government will restore the temple and the pagoda and set
up an exhibition hall and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The relics of the pagoda are under strict protection and 0.67
hectares of land has been chosen for the site of the temple.
</P>
<P>
"It is really significant to restore the temple," said
Professor Su Bai, an archaeologist from Beijing University.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
intensified their struggle for diplomatic support Thursday, as
newly appointed Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami visited
Turkey, and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat made stops in Iran and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both are attempting to garner support from world leaders ahead
of next month's threatened deadline for unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly won Turkish support during his Monday visit
there for a declaration of statehood on September 13. However, Ben-
Ami said that this support is not completely ensured.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's stop in Turkey was the first leg of a trip that will
also take him to spain, Italy, the Vatican, and the European Union
in an attempt to counter the intensive lobbying efforts Arafat has
undertaken around the world since the failure of the Camp David
summit to explain the Palestinian position.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli treasury Thursday unveiled its 2001 budget,
which puts priorities on education, infrastructure development and
R&AMP;D. It foresees a 1.75 percent deficit, down from 2.5 percent this
year, and inflation of 2.5 to 3.5 percent, down from this year's
expected 3-4 percent. Unemployment is expected to drop to 8.1
percent, down from the current 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total government spending is targeted at 194.2 billion shekels
(about 48.5 billion U.S. dollars), up from 166 billion shekels (41.
5 billion dollars), but overall tax burden will decline by 2
billion shekels (500 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
More spending can be expected in communities outside the
metropolitan areas for social welfare and vocational retraining.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef of the Israeli ultra-
Orthodox Shas party, aired support for former Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu as the next prime minister and accused Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of "prosecuting" Shas, the third largest
parliamentary group after Labor and the opposition Likud with 17
seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Yosef also said that Shas, which used to be the largest ruling
partner in the coalition led by Barak's One Israel, refused to
return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's office said that, at least for now, it had
no intention of commenting on the rabbi's support for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak continued his cabinet
reshuffle efforts on Thursday and completed fulling the slots of
the ministries left behind by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, naming
Center Party Knesset (Parliament) Member Roni Milo as acting health
minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak's offer of the Heath Ministry to the Center Party was
originally intended for Knesset Member Dan Meridor, chairman of the
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Barak appointed Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami as acting foreign minister, sealing a political
alliance with Ben-Ami, as well as energizing the Foreign Ministry
with an activist leader ready to throw the ministry's expertise
into the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Have Own Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese journalists now have
their own festival -- "Journalists' Day", which is set for
November 8.
</P>
<P>
Journalists' Day has been approved by the State Council, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The festival for the 550,000 Chinese journalists will be a work-
as-usual holiday, just like the country's Teachers' Day and Nurses
' Day, when they have to work on their posts.
</P>
<P>
The date was chosen because on November 8, 1937, the China
Young Journalists Association was founded by left-wing reporters
headed by well-known journalist Fan Changjiang in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Journalists' Day will encourage all
Chinese journalists to carry forward the fine traditions of their
profession and continue to make great strides in this area.

<HEADLINE> China's Military Eyes Hi-tech in Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Warfare in the future will
become more high-tech and the Chinese military is conducting
drills focused on fighting against high-tech weapons like stealth
planes, cruise missiles and armed helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The drills also devote equal attention to enhancing their
defense capabilities against precision strikes, electronic
interference, reconnaissance and monitoring, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new round of drills will enable the Chinese military to
catch up with the high-tech developments, and will have far-
reaching significance on its success in future wars, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The drills also marked an enormous shift from the previous
round of drills.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the focus of the Chinese military drills were
directed toward fights against tanks, planes and airborne forces,
and defense against A-bombs, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Chinese military are trying their best to
achieve good results from the drills, and military leaders have
seen noticeable improvement in some units.

<HEADLINE> IMF Lauds Malaysia's Policies for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has commended the Malaysian government for implementing
policies that have placed the economy on a recovery path.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's improved economic performance has boosted confidence
and helped improve banking and corporate balance sheets, the IMF
said in an annual review of the Malaysian economy released in
Washington Friday, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The policies implemented by Malaysia following the regional
financial crisis in July 1997 included selective capital control
measures, the pegging of the local currency ringgit to the
greenback and deficit budgetary measures.
</P>
<P>
The IMF praised the Malaysian authorities for their fiscal
prudence and noted that greater flexibility in the budgetary
process could promote more effective use of fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's real GDP recorded a 5.5-percent growth in 1999 and
has maintained its momentum so far this year, with the
manufacturing sector expanding by over 13 percent in 1999 led by
buoyant exports in the electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
Private investment remained subdued and consumption has only
recently showed signs of recovery while inflation remained below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Composite Index recovered by 39 percent
during 1999 and rose further by 10 percent by end-May this year
while the indices of the stock markets in most neighboring
countries fell, the IMF noted.
</P>
<P>
It said, "A key challenge facing the authorities is to
strengthen the recovery and achieve high and sustainable economic
growth while keeping inflation under control."
</P>
<P>
It observed that a move toward a more flexible exchange rate
should be timed to coincide with the lifting of the remaining
capital controls and the authorities should consider taking
advantage of the current favorable conditions to act soon on both
fronts.
</P>
<P>
However, it cautioned against a premature move toward exchange
rate flexibility given the continuing volatility in regional and
global foreign exchange markets.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Indonesia Strives to Lure More Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
hammered out a plan to attract more Chinese tourists to the
country and expects the number of Chinese tourists to keep
increasing, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here on Friday,
Indonesian State Minister for Tourism Hidayat Jaelani said the
government will simplify all bureaucratic procedures considered as
barriers to the arrival of Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that out of the 9 million to 10 million
Chinese who are expected to travel abroad in 2001, as many as 1.3
million could be attracted to Indonesia if the government's
efforts are paid off.
</P>
<P>
"And we expect that from the figure, we will get foreign
exchange revenues mounting to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars," he said
with full confidence.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, "we have decided to remove several
barriers to clear the way for the arriving of Chinese tourists in
the future. We will officially remove a clearing house procedure
for Chinese tourists, as of September this year."
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has also decided to ease visa
application procedures and reduce the visa entry fees and is even
considering to provide a visa-on-arrival facility for Chinese
tourists, Jaelani said.
</P>
<P>
"And the visa application procedures will only take three days,
" he said, adding that that has been one of the most intricate
issues for promoting tourism cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the former Indonesian government imposed a
strict procedure and a high cost for visa applications of Chinese
tourists, causing reluctance among the Chinese to come to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jaelani also disclosed that Indonesia will actively
start promoting the country's tourism industry in China,and
declare China as a country eligible for a visa-free facility in
due course. At present, 48 countries enjoy the visa-free facility
provided by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with the expansion of the cooperation between
Indonesia and China in the tourism field, more and more Chinese
tourists will visit Indonesia in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is a vast and beautiful diverse country stretching
for more than 5,000 kilometers across the equator. As the biggest
archipelago country in the world with at least 13,000 islands, it
has a lot of tourist attractions ranging from natural scenery,
beautiful beaches and mountain ranges to historical relics.
</P>
<P>
For the country, tourism is a very important sector, as it
could bring in billions of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
In term of revenues, the Indonesian government set the target
of earnings from the tourism sector at 5 billion dollars from 5.1
million foreign tourists.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Confident of 5-Percent Growth Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth this
year will not fall below 5 percent, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted Friday by Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Projections by the National Economic and Social Development
Board that growth would drop to 4.7 percent from earlier forecast
of 5 to 5.5 percent were only tentative, said Supachai, who is
also the country's commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
He said he disagreed with the board's basing the revision on
higher oil prices, arguing that other elements would offset the
negative effects of oil price increases, such as an improvement in
the global economy, strengthening exports and the government's
fiscal stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the possibility of a second economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government raised gasoline and diesel prices to an all-
time high earlier this week. The price hike and the recent
depreciation of the Thai baht triggered fear that a new economic
crisis will come soon.
</P>
<P>
Supachai pointed out that Thailand is on track for an adequate
current account surplus of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars this
year. Inflation was only 1.3 percent in the first half of this
year and was projected not to exceed 2.5 percent for the whole
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the economy needs close monitoring until the
situation is totally clear. After next year, the government would
have to impose tighter fiscal discipline because economic growth
would increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Sansern Vongcha-um, the board's secretary-general, said the
board has yet to officially revise its growth projection, adding
that it has to wait and see the factors that affect business,
particularly gas prices.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the surge in oil prices should not have a
serious impact as many positive signs are present.

<HEADLINE> Genty Named Coach of Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Clippers named
Alvin Gentry as their coach for rebuilting the team, it was
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gentry, 45, was fired by the Detroit Pistons in March and was
named coach. He became the successor of Jim Todd, who replaced
Chris Ford during the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
The Clippers finished the campaign an NBA-worst 15-67 and have
been searching for a coach the entire offseason.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has reached the playoffs only three times since
moving west from Buffalo in 1978. The franchise has had two
winning seasons and six 60-loss campaigns since arriving in
California.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see the need to address the issue of what's
happened in the past," Gentry said. "Everything's going to be
positive. We're not concerned with what happened in the past."
</P>
<P>
Gentry joined the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant in June
but left them for his third NBA head-coaching job. He also was the
interim coach of the Miami Heat for 36 games during the 1994-95
season.
</P>
<P>
The Clippers figure to be the youngest team in the NBA next
season. Their starting lineup could feature five players less than
25 years old.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles's brightest rising star is second-year swingman
Lamar Odom. Centre Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 overall pick in
1998, is entering his third season.
</P>
<P>
Also featured could be third-year forward Brian Skinner,
second-year forward Corey Maggette and draft picks Keyon Dooling,
Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles, who entered the NBA out of
high school.
</P>
<P>
Gentry has a career coaching record of 88-93, including 73-72
with the Pistons. Detroit was 28-30 when it fired Gentry and
replaced him with assistant George Irvine, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Huge Increases in Investments Under BOI Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- During the first seven months of
this year, 920 projects worth a combined 385.6 billion baht (9.6
billion U.S. dollars) sought Thailand's Board of Investment (BOI)
promotional privileges, up 341 percent on a year-on-year basis,
according to government statistics released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, 305 projects worth a total of 177 billion baht (
4.4 billion dollars) were submitted to the BOI for approval,
compared with only 60 projects worth 6.5 billion baht (162 million
dollars) in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show a pickup in July after softer figures for
May and June this year, when 162 and 135 projects respectively
submitted applications.
</P>
<P>
But analysts warned that the size of the increase was due in
part to investors rushing in to lock up projects ahead of
anticipated BOI policy changes, which will require firms to
demonstrate a healthier balance sheet, good corporate governance
and recognized quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The increase also came amid warnings from bankers that unclear
political direction in the country might hurt foreign investment
and overseas banks' lending activities.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Sri Lanka's New Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Ratnasiri Wickremanayake was
sworn in on Thursday as Sri Lanka's new prime minister, succeeding
Sirimavo Bandaranaike who resigned earlier on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake was born on May 5, 1933, and had his higher
education in the United Kingdom where in 1955 he was elected
president of the Ceylon Students' Association. He was the convener
and chairman of the First Conference of Afro-Asian Students in
London and led the delegation to the World Youth Conference in
Warsaw, Poland.
</P>
<P>
At the death of his brother Munidasa in 1959, who was in active
politics in the Horana electorate, Wickremanayake stepped in to
fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
He successfully contested the parliamentary elections in March
1960, as a member of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, defeating a
powerful minister in the former government, M. D. H. Jayawardene,
by a comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
In the July 1960 elections he contested as an independent
candidate and won. In 1962 he joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party
and again successfully contested the Horana electorate in 1965. He
once again won the elections in 1970 and assumed duties as deputy
minister of justice and later as minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake was a member of the parliamentary delegation to
the Inter Parliamentary Union Conference at New Delhi and later
attended similar conferences in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea and the Soviet Union. He also led Sri Lankan delegations
to a number of other international conferences.
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he was elected general secretary of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party, the major partner in the present People's Alliance
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Wickremanayake contested and won a seat in the Western
Provincial Council with the largest majority in the Kalutara
District and was appointed a provincial council minister.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994 parliamentary elections he again won the largest
number of votes in the Kalutara District and assumed office in the
People's Alliance government as minister of public administration,
home affairs and plantation industries. He also served as the
leader of the ruling party group in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's New Prime Minister Urges Cooperation From Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's new Prime Minister
Ratnasiri Wickremanayake has called on the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) to cooperate with the government to resolve
national issues.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden speech in the parliament on Thursday,
Wickremanayake invited the opposition to work with the government
on grave national issues for the well-being of the nation which he
said was faced with a grave situation due to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year war between government
troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who are resorting to bomb attacks
and assassinations in their campaign for a separate state in the
country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The government of the ruling People's Alliance has drafted a
new constitution in a bid to end the long-running civil war by
devolving more powers to regional councils including one
administered by minority Tamils. However, the debate on the draft
constitution was indefinitely postponed early this week as the
government could not muster the required two-thirds majority in
the parliament without the support of the UNP and other parties.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake said terrorism should be defeated by military
means and at the same time the grievances of the minority
communities should be addressed by the majority community.
</P>
<P>
He described war as the only means to eliminate terrorism which
did not respect justice, fair play, law and democracy. However, if
the minorities had any grievances a solution to them should be
found, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister nostalgically recalled his entry into
politics in 1960 and said he had worked closely since then with
the outgoing Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike who had rendered
great service to the party and the country over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake vowed to uphold democratic norms and
parliamentary traditions and to protect the rights and privileges
of members on both sides of the parliament.

Sydney Olympics, according to reports on Thursday.
</P>

nationality must wait three years before competing for their new

reduce or waive the restriction.
</P>

Spain for nearly three years and was granted Spanish citizenship a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Suffers First Career Loss to Henman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras lost his first
career match in seven played against Briton Tim Henman 306, 4-6 on
Thursday night at the Tennis Masters Series-Cincinnati, it was
reported.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Sampras gave all the credit to his buddy for
the third-round victory.
</P>
<P>
"Tim was playing great," Sampras was quote as saying. "He
served well and had some unbelievable passing shots. I wasn't at
my best, but he outplayed me."
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who recently made history by winning a record-
breaking 13th Grand Slam trophy at Wimbledon last month, looked
sluggish throughout the match.
</P>
<P>
He missed shots that he usually could place just within the
boundaries of the court, on Thursday sending them sailing just
wide. Several times, Sampras watched balls go by that he normally
would have moved to hit.
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt that Henman hit his stride in the match,
serving precisely and executing winning passing shots seemingly at
will.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was the fourth marquee name to depart the Cincinnati
tournament with fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, eighth-
seeded Marat Safin of Russia and 16th-seeded Mark Philippoussis
losing third-round matches earlier Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thompson, Torres Secure Sydney Olympic Swimming Berths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thompson clocked in 57.78 seconds, namely 0.2 seconds away from
the fresh American record set by Dara Torres on Wednesday,
striding a step further towards reaping her first-ever singles
gold medal from the Olympic Games despite a credit of five golds
from the relay events.
</P>
<P>
However, Torres was also a winner, becoming the first American
swimmer to qualify for four Olympics as she finished second in 57.
86. The 33-year-old Torres only returned to swimming last year
after a seven-year retirement following her outings to the 1984,
1988 and 1992 Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty sweet victory," Thompson said. "There's a lot
of pressure. People think this just comes to me, but it's not as
easy as one might think."
</P>
<P>
Ed Moses, 20, who gave up swimming for six years after burning
out at age 10, set an American record of 1:00.44, just 0.08
seconds off the world mark held by Russia's Roman Sloudnov.
</P>
<P>
Pat Calhoun claimed the other Olympic berth at 1:01.09.
</P>
<P>
"First things first - I just wanted to make the team," Moses
said. "My work is not done yet. I have four weeks to prepare for
the Games. This is just a step ahead. Hopefully, I'll bring home
the gold."
</P>
<P>
In the other two finals, Tom Dolan, 24, finished first in his
speciality of 400m individual medley in 4:13.72 to claim his
outing to the Sydney Games, together with 19-year-old Erik Vendt
who came in second at 4:13.89.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, world record-holder in the medley, skipped the freestyle
on Wednesday as a precaution to ensure his victory in the 400m
medley wherein he set the world mark of 4:12.30 six years ago in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
The women's 400m freestyle was won by 18-year-old Diana Munz
and 20-year-old Brooke Bennett. Munz clocked in 4:08.71 while
Bennett finished second in 4:08.76, both are far away from the
world record of 4:03.85 set by their compatriot Janet Evans at the
Seoul Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Women's Doubles Tennis Players Get Olympic Wild Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian women's doubles
tennis players Yayuk Basuki and Wynne Prakusya finally earned a
wild card for the Olympic Games in Sydney from September 15 to
October 1.
</P>
<P>
"We received the letter on August 8, saying that Yayuk, along
with Wynne, is eligible for the women's doubles competition in
Sydney," Benny Mailili, the public relations officer for the
Indonesian Tennis federation, was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the second wild card awarded for Indonesia by the
International Olympics Committee (IOC). Wynne got one for the
singles event in July following a decision from tripartite
commission involving IOC, Asian National Olympics Committee and
International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
Wynne will make her world debut in the Olympics while old hand
Yayuk is making her third appearance in the doubles event after
the 1992 Barcelona Games with Suzanna Anggarkusumah Wibowo and the
1996 Atlanta Games with Romana Tedjakusuma.
</P>
<P>
Benny predicted that Yayuk and Wynne has better odds of winning
medals than China and Japan. He said the Indonesian pair would not
face tough challengers from Asian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Li Na and Li Ting (of China) are very young players in their
18s. While Tamarine and Benjamas of Thailand are less skillful
than our women's doubles," Benny said.

<HEADLINE> Urumqi Uses Waste Water in Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Urumqi, capital of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is building a sewage
treatment plant to provide water for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
The Yagmalike Mountain waste water treatment plant, to be
completed in two years, has a designed capacity of treating 50,000
cu m of waste water daily. Upon completion, the 90 million yuan
project will provide enough water for tree planting on the 6,700
hectares of the barren Yagmalike Mountain and for irrigating local
farmland.
</P>
<P>
The Yagmalike Mountain is the only barren hill in Urumqi. The
mountain scatters more than 26 tons of dust per square kilometer
to the city each month, which account for 91 percent of the
monthly total in the city.
</P>
<P>
Urumqi has invested 16 million yuan in tree planting on the
Yagmalike Mountain since 1996 and a total of 133 hectares of trees
has been planted on the mountain since then.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission approved the waste
water treatment plant and has invested 20 million yuan in it.

<HEADLINE> Human Has Impact On Antarctic Eco-system </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have warned that
increasing scientific expeditions and other human activities have
made a negative impact on the eco-system of the Antarctic Pole.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jie, associate research fellow with Nanjing Institute of
Pedology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Hans-Peter
Blume, researcher of Germany's Kiel University, published their
views in the latest issue of Chinese Journal of Polar Research, a
magazine sponsored by the China Polar Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
They listed soil and vegetation pollution, introduction of non-
native species, and bacteria brought by humans as major problems.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, nearly 20 countries and regions have sent
scientific expeditions to the Antarctic Pole and established more
than 40 research stations there.
</P>
<P>
Tourists have also flocked to the region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said soil around some of the stations has
already been polluted by hydrocarbon due to oil use as fuel.
</P>
<P>
Burning garbage as well as oil has also affected the quality of
air, the scientists said, adding that human activities are
responsible for 20 percent of lead in the air.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, wildlife in the region is
declining sharply.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that humans have brought to the region a
number of non-native organisms including thermophilic bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Water Conservancy Project to Protect Pasture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China will initiate a large water
conservation project to protect its largest natural pasture in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to cover 600,000 hectares of grassland within
ten years. And the autonomous region is expected to harvest 700
million kilograms more of forage grass each year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The central government will fund two-thirds of the total cost
of 300 million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars), and the rest will
be allocated by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Kang Yue, a senior engineer at the local water conversation
office, said that the project will mainly adopt the spray
irrigation and low-pressure pipe irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region is the home to 70 million hectares of
natural grassland. This largest natural grassland in China also
serves as a "green shield" in the north.
</P>
<P>
However, about two-thirds of the grassland has been severely
damaged by drought, excessive reclamation and foraging. The Xilin
Gol Prairie in the autonomous region has degenerated into the main
headstream of the rampant sandstorms that have slashed Beijing
lately.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, large amounts of livestock has died due to the
harsh environment, deteriorating with the lasting drought and
infestation of locusts and mice in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Stunned during his inspection tour of the Xilin Gol pasture in
May, Premier Zhu Rongji urged the local government to take
effective measures to curb the deterioration of the pasture
environment.
</P>
<P>
Kang said irrigation will help rehabilitate the natural
grassland by replacing them with small sized high-yield forage
bases.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Village in Harmonization with Han Culture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua)-- Despite pouring rain outside
about 400 Muslims came swarming into the Dingda Mosque in Sang Po
village, from all directions.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Islamic congregation ceremony is the most important
activity of the week, when chanting of sutras resounds in all 11
mosques there, just like it was 600 years ago when the villagers'
ancestors arrived. The village, inhabited by the Hui ethnic group,
only has a population of no more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Besieged by cities and villages of the Han people, Sang Po
village is located in the northwest of Henan Province in central
China, where China's first dynasty, Xia (21th-16th century B.C.),
was founded and inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells of the
Shang Dynasty (16th-11th Century B.C.), known as the characters of
"Jiagu," were excavated.
</P>
<P>
"Non-Islamic culture is everywhere," Liu Zhiheng, imam of the
Dingda Mosque said, "But the Islamic culture still exhibits
distinct characteristics."
</P>
<P>
The roofs of the buildings here are built in the design of the
ancient Chinese palace roofs, but the symbol of the crescent moon
on top of these roofs represents the existence of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Written in the language of Arabic, Han antithetical couplets
are used by Sang Po villagers now to spread the teaching of
Alcoran.
</P>
<P>
Intermarriage with Han people are also acceptable now in the
village. Some Han women have married in after converting to Islam,
but Sang Po women are still prohibited to get married with Han
people.
</P>
<P>
"Islam means "peace" in Arabic," said Liu. "It is a non-violent
religion that is prone to a peaceful coexistence with different
cultures, just like Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism that Han
people deeply embrace."
</P>
<P>
The Doctrine of the Mean and The Great Learning, two of the
famous Four Books, are Liu Zhiheng's favorite readings. He often
quotes from Confucius, a figure of worship for the Han people,
when he preaches Islamic tenets.

<P>
CHANGSHA, August 11 (Xinhua)-- The Hong Kong International
Foundation for Culture and Education is to offer 90 million yuan (
over 10.8 million U.S. dollars) to set up computer classrooms in
500 middle schools in this capital of central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The foundation Thursday made the announcement to promote
computer education in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local schools are now busy installing computer equipment to the
value of over 20 million yuan (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars).
Advanced multi-media software items are also provided by the HK
side.
</P>
<P>
All teaching equipment sponsored by the foundation will be
given gratis to local middle schools after three years, according
to the foundation's executive president Feng Danli.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation is dedicated to the promotion of cultural
exchanges between China and other countries, as well as the
development of education in China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Village in Harmonization with Han Culture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the 20 million Muslims in China live in Xinjiang Uygur
and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions in the northwest, with about
700,000 in Henan Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
Ancestors of Muslims may be traced back to the business envoys
trading among Empire Tang, Persia and Arabia since the 6th century
A.D..
</P>
<P>
There used to be some conflicts between the Hui and Han people
in past history, when the Qing government implemented the policy
of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
But all of these are in the past, as the Great Han nationalism
was extinguished and now economic development is bringing more and
more people together, Liu believes.
</P>
<P>
What Liu cares most for now is other Islamic regions all over
the world. "Wars and chaos break out due to the prevalence of
hegemonism in some western countries," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Peace produces prosperity for the Sang Po village. Succeeding
to its commercial tradition, Sang Po is engaged in the industry of
pelt processing and exportation, which makes it Asia's largest fur
processing base, with annual earnings of tens of millions of U.S.
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Han people account for over 90 percent of all laborers coming
in to pursue job opportunities as well as wealth.
</P>
<P>
Although they never celebrate the Lunar Spring Festival, Sang
Po villagers like to present gifts to their Han friends.
</P>
<P>
Lots of western people are also lured to do business here, but
Sang Po people do not disseminate Islam to Christians. "Religion
is a personal affair, we never force others to take our belief",
78-year-old villager Ding Yuanqin said.
</P>
<P>
But it is a pressing task to teach children in the village with
Islamic doxy, since many of them are increasingly infatuated with
the Internet and singing Karaoke.
</P>
<P>
"Islam is the spiritual sustenance of all Muslims," Bai Huzhan,
an official with the village said.
</P>
<P>
"Smooth syncretizing with the principal culture enables the
Sang Po people to sustain and even develop their Islamic culture
in the very core area of Chinese culture," according to Shui
Jingjun, a sociologist who has made several investigation there.

<HEADLINE> 12 Indonesian High-Ranking Officers Named as Suspects in Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As many as 12 high-ranking
military officers have been named as suspects in the bloody riots
which took place in Indonesia on July 27, 1996, according to a
National Military Police officer.
</P>
<P>
Director of Investigation at the National Military Police
headquarters Col. Hendardji said the suspects would be charged
under Article 170 of the Criminal Code with uses of violence.
</P>
<P>
The article carries two separate maximum jail sentences to the
violators: Seven to nine years' imprisonment if the violence
causes the victim to suffer severe injuries and 12 years in jail
if the victim dies.
</P>
<P>
Hendardji, also a member of a joint National Police-Military
Police investigation team, however, refused to disclose either the
identities of the suspects or their roles during the riots.
</P>
<P>
"If we disclose the suspects' identities to the press now, the
public will tip them as guilty. Meanwhile, they have yet to be
prosecuted. It's not only the suspects, but also their families
who will suffer if their identities are revealed," he was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hendardji admitted that the team had faced some scheduling
problems in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the officers have moved to new duty areas... Others
have important jobs which they couldn't abandon," he said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the team would soon complete the questioning. "We
'll complete the questioning in early September," he added.
</P>
<P>
The riots were triggered by an imbroglio between supporters of
Chairman Soerjadi of the government-backed Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI) and former PDI Chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri, now
Indonesian vice president.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Soerjadi, believed to be backed by government
officials and the military at that time, tried to take over the
party's headquarters on Diponegoro Street in Central Jakarta which
had been occupied by the Megawati camp.
</P>
<P>
The Megawati camp resisted, resulting in clashes between the
two camps and the death of dozens of people.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Import 25 Million U.S. Dollars of Thai Pineapples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan has agreed to import 400
containers of Thai pineapples, worth 1 billion baht (about 25
million U.S. dollars) annually, representing a success of the Thai
government's efforts to expand exports of Thai fruits to the
Japanese market, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Newin Chidchob was
quoted as saying the Japanese offer to place regular orders for
Thai pineapples followed an earlier export of Thailand's Phuket or
Trad Sri Thong pineapples to the Japanese market on a trial basis
by the Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Newin said he had discussed the issue with visiting Toshiro
Fuji, managing director of Ryutsusoken Co., who offered to import
the large amount of Thai pineapples annually.
</P>
<P>
Newin had ensured Fuji and his entourage that the Agriculture
and Cooperatives Ministry will continue to support research
projects to improve production technique and quality of Thai
pineapples and monitor and control the quality of the pineapples
to be exported to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The Departments of Agriculture and Cooperative Promotion had
also been authorized to conduct feasibility studies on exports of
Thai pineapples in forms of processed products and ready-to-serve
fresh pieces to add value to Thai exports and meet consumers'
demand, said Newin.
</P>
<P>
Newin also invited Japanese entrepreneurs to jointly invest
with their Thai counterparts in the ready-to-serve and processed
pineapple projects, which are believed to greatly boost the market
share of Thai pineapple products in the Japanese market from a
minimal 2 percent currently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has urged Tokyo to open its market further
for Thai fruits and has implemented measures to promote Thai
fruits in the Japanese market, which has seen some progress so far,
the report noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Gustavo
Noboa Thursday strongly expressed his concern over the current
parliamentary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The top leader lamented that the parliamentary conflict
occurred at a time when Ecuador had begun making its way toward
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Noboa deplored the fact that parliament's members hadn't
resolved the crisis derived from the dispute over the election of
the parliamentary speaker.
</P>
<P>
On August 1, the new parliament's majority elected Susana
Gonzalez, an independent, the speaker. However, Gonzalez' election
was challenged by the minority, which backs Social-Christian
Xavier Neira.
</P>
<P>
The conflict split the legislature into two parts, which now
meets separately and hasn't mutually recognized each other since
August 1.
</P>
<P>
Noboa has been awaiting a decision from the Constitutional
Court on whether the election of Gonzalez was valid and fair.

takes at this level."

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Host Sculpture Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Sculpture Festival will
be held on September 6 in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 sculptors worldwide will attend the festival, and
100 of them will take part in a contest. The top prize will be 150,
000 yuan (about 18,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Carving seminars, exhibitions and tourism activities will be
arranged during the event, to be hosted by Hui'an County, a home
of sculpture, together with the China Industrial Arts Association.
</P>
<P>
Carving is a pillar industry in Hui'an. The annual production
value of stone carvings is five billion yuan (about 600 million U.
S. dollars), and wood carvings earn 400 million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The oldest carvings in Hui'an are gravestone images of humans,
tigers and sheep carved in relief some 1,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hui'an-made works are seen today in the Great Hall of People in
Beijing, a cemetery in the port city of Xiamen and a monument in
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The largest stone carving in China is a masterpiece by a Hui'an
craftsman. The work, now located on Gulang Island in Xiamen, was
executed in memory of Zheng Chenggong, who drove Dutch forces out
of Taiwan in the 17th century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Skilled at Building Weather-Proof Dwelling 7,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists say that Chinese
people as early as 7,000 years ago could build homes which kept
them cool in summer and warm in winter.
</P>
<P>
This finding is based on the excavation of the Hemudu Culture
ruins dating back 7,000 years in Yuyao, east China's Zhejiang
Province, according to Zhao Xiaobo, curator of a museum in Humudu,
located in Yuyao.
</P>
<P>
The site was first found in 1972 and is the earliest Neolithic
culture discovered thus far in the country's eastern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
In the ruins were found a large number of wooden structures,
which were propped up with numerous wooden posts and interlaced
wooden girders.
</P>
<P>
These structures aroused the attention of scholars and experts
worldwide, because they are very distinct from the architecture of
prehistoric crypts and semi-crypts which were unearthed elsewhere
in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts found at least seven almost paralleling rows of the
wooden buildings in the ruins after two excavation attempts.
</P>
<P>
Some of the wooden houses face southeast and others due south.
Their orientation are conducive to good airflow, receiving
sunlight and remaining cool in summer and retaining heat during
the winter, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Experts restored some of the original wooden structures in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Zhao's paper about the new findings of the wooden structures
in the Hemudu ruins, it makes the point to highlight not only the
ancient Chinese's building skills but also their consideration for
the orientation which helps weatherproof the houses.
</P>
<P>
This means, according to her paper, that primitive human beings
were able to adapt themselves to their surrounding environment as
they got to know nature and geography.
</P>
<P>
In addition to wooden structures, the Hemudu Culture,
introduced the earliest cultivated rice, painted pottery, knitting,
lacquerware, and jewelry made of jade, bone and the teeth of
various animals.

<HEADLINE> China's Sugar Price Should be Stabilized: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The surging price of sugar in
China, if not moderated, may sour the industry that is struggling
to get out of the red, experts warn.
</P>
<P>
China's white granulated sugar price has reached a record high,
with per-ton price in its largest producer, Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, jumping from 1,850 yuan last year to 4,000 yuan
this year, today's China Daily quoted Jiang Tiansheng, president
of the Guangxi Sugar Industry Corp, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price is higher than on the global market. A ton of raw
sugar was posted at between 210 to 235 U.S. dollars, the Daily
cited the New York sugar price list published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although China's efforts to cap annual sugar production at 7.5
million tons leaves a shortfall of 1 million tons, China does not
need to import sugar this year because it has sufficient reserves,
said Lian Xuezhi of the China Sugar Association.
</P>
<P>
"If China sent a signal that it would import sugar, the
international price might rocket by a margin of 100 U.S. dollars a
ton," Jiang said, also a senior expert of the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
China has 539 sugar refineries with a total annual production
capacity of 10.53 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result of oversupply, the sugar industry has reported poor
results over the past four years, with a cumulative loss
approaching 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this situation, China has shut down 301 small sugar
refineries since last year, which helped reduce the 1999-2000
sugar production by 2.01 million tons to 6.81 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"If the current irrationally high price of sugar is not curbed,
the procurement price for sugar cane and sugar beets will rise,
and some small sugar refineries that have been shut down may be
tempted to resume operation, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes Diplomatic Move to Revive Postponed SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to revive a postponed
summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (
SAARC), Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has sent a top
diplomat to persuade South Asian leaders to attend the meeting,
burying their past bickering for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh would continue to work for promotion of cooperation
and fraternity among the SAARC states," the prime minister said
while talking to members of the executive committee of the Dhaka
Reporters Union here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent visit of Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami
to New Delhi and his planned trip to Islamabad shortly, Hasina
said, "We feel that the SAARC is revived and peace and stability
exist in the region."
</P>
<P>
The next SAARC summit -- the 11th in the 15-year life of the
association --- had been scheduled to be held in Katmandu last
November, but was postponed as India declined to sit at the same
table with Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami Wednesday said Dhaka
was making efforts to create a congenial cooperation and revive
the SAARC process.
</P>
<P>
" I traveled to Delhi as a special envoy of Sheikh Hasina to
convey the feeling that enhanced socioeconomic cooperation among
neighbors would ensure greater peace and development in the region.
I will also visit Islamabad on August 22 and 23 conveying almost
the same feeling," Sami said.
</P>
<P>
He termed his visit to India as "productive and useful for
regional cooperation and the revival of the SAARC process."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic observers here believe that sending the special
envoy by Hasina to Pakistan after a visit to India indicated that
New Delhi has changed its mind about sitting with the Pakistani
military ruler.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Offer Atlantic Oil Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose
Vicente Rangel said Thursday that Venezuela Petroleum (PDVSA) is
studying the possibility of granting concessions to foreign firms
working in Venezuelan Atlantic territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has not delineated the Atlantic waters with Guyana
yet. Nonetheless, this zone faces the Venezuelan state of Delta
Amacuro.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister ordered a seismic study of the area in the
event they are able to grant these concessions to foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
American oil companies Century and Exxon would be ready to
reconsider their presence in the area, as Venezuelan sources
report.
</P>
<P>
For Venezuela, it would be important to reach definitive
accords with the Guyana government over land and sea delineation.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has a century-old dispute with Guyana, relative to
the Esequibo zone which has not yet been clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
Esequibo is a plot of 159,500 square kilometers which has been
claimed for over 30 years by both Venezuela and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
Guyana in 1999 sold 50,000 hectares of Esequibo to the
American firm Aerospace, which intends to install a satellite
launching platform; the sale raised protests from Venezuela.

Agassi retired Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sparks (28-4) swept the three-time defending champions
during the regular season, including a 10-point away win at the
Compaq Center, becoming the only team to win consecutive regular-
season series against Houston (27-5).
</P>
<P>
Yet, in order to claim their first-ever title, the Sparks will
need to get past the Phoenix Mercury (20-12) in the best-of-three
opening round in the Western Conference started on Friday, wherein
the Comets will face the Sacramento Monarchs (21-11) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the Eastern Conference, the Orlando Miracle (16-16) host the
Cleveland Rockers (17-15) on Friday, while the New York Liberty (
20-12) travel to Washington to play the Mystics (14-18) on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Houston Comets can become the first professional
basketball team to win four consecutive championships since the
Boston Celtics (1959-66) as it will be the final championship run
for Cynthia Cooper, the three-time WNBA championship MVP, who may
retire after the season.
</P>
<P>
Houston's Sheryl Swoopes is the top scorer of the league
averaging 20.6 points, a spot Cooper has held for the last three

<HEADLINE> Rural Children Enjoy Better Cultural Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China has made great effort in
recent years to offer cultural activities to a large number of
children in rural areas who previously had limited access to such
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has built 41 State-level "cultural gardens"
which provide rural children with entertainment facilities, films,
books, sports and a means of education.
</P>
<P>
Luo Feiling, a 10 year-old boy from Guizhou, a southwest China
province, has been taking singing lessons at the Shawen Town
Children's Cultural Garden for four years.
</P>
<P>
"Just like urban children, my son often performs here and there,
and he has won some prizes," said Luo's mother.
</P>
<P>
Building "cultural gardens" for rural children is an effort
China has made in implementing the "Dandelion Project," which aims
to narrow the gap between rural and urban children in enjoying
cultural entertainment, said Chen Qilin, an official with the
Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
The "Dandelion Project," a program for the development of
children's cultural activities, was launched by the Ministry of
Culture and seven other ministries in 1992. The program is aimed
at providing rural children with easy access to cultural
activities .
</P>
<P>
China has 360 million children, 80 percent live in rural areas,
distant mountainous areas or ethnic minority regions. The
youngsters do not have enough places where they can engage in
cultural activities. They also read few books, watch few films and
have no effective channels to enjoy modern entertainment like
those in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that apart from the State-level "cultural gardens,"
provincial and city governments and grassroots rural authorities
have also helped build a large number of cultural gardens, centers
and facilities, which provide an opportunity for rural children to
touch and experience modern cultural life.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Factories Consume Less Water to Produce More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The annual water
consumption of Beijing-based industries remained the same while
the industries grew at an annual speed of 10 percent over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of municipal industries did not result in
increased water consumption, thanks to the readjustment of the
industrial structure which started in the 1980s, said Yan
Changyuan, a standing committee member of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Beijing Municipal
Committee, recently at a symposium on water resources in Beijing,
Tianjin and their neighboring province of Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, located at the core of the Bohai Economic Rim, has
devoted itself to building factories in an attempt to make itself
into a productive municipality since 1949 when New China was
founded.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, most of the capital-based industries produce
heavy pollution and consume excessive water. The structural
readjustment in the 1980s resulted in the creation of some
industries that used comparatively less water while new technology
were introduced to save water in more factories. Newly opened
plants were required to adopt technology that helps conserve water.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Beijing factories today recycle 84.7 percent of all
the water they use, up 36 percentage points compared with that of
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The rare early summer heatwave and a long drought in many parts
of China has made some cities impose water rationing on residents.
</P>
<P>
The per capita water resources in the capital are just one-
eighth of China's average. And north China has received as little
as 10 percent of its usual rainfall this year, lowering reservoirs
and aquifers.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of China's 668 cities are facing water
shortages in varying degrees, and 100 face serious problems.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have a total annual water shortage of 6 billion
cubic meters, while per capita water resources for China is less
than one-quarter of the world's average.

<HEADLINE> Hotlines to Help Find Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua)-- China has opened two hotlines to
recruit professionals for the development of the western regions,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The hotlines, (8610)84226767 and 84226969, will be an
information channel between those willing to work in west China
and enterprises looking to hire, said Si Yilei, deputy-director of
China National Center for Human Resources under the Ministry of
Personnel.
</P>
<P>
Keeping lists of vacant positions in State key projects to be
built in the western regions, the hotlines will soon be available
around the clock to offer advice on the preferential policies
offered by local governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Trained people with high-technology skills will continue to be
in high demand in the years ahead, experts said.
</P>
<P>
China's personnel authority is drafting a plan to attract
talented workers to contribute to the development of west China,
sources with the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is in the initial stages of forming a series of
preferential policies to recruit high-skilled workers needed in
the long-term for infrastructure construction and to improve
science, technology and education in the region.
</P>
<P>
Home to 20 percent of the country's population, China's western
regions have long faced a lack of talented workers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to enlist overseas Chinese experts and
students to study the development potential of western China. Some
of them will be offered jobs by western localities, the ministry
said.

NADRID, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Leonardo Piepoli clinched
the Tour of Burgos win on Thursday after the Banesto rider
finished safely in the main pack on the final stage.
</P>
<P>
Another Italian, Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom took the final
leg over 164 kilometers from Medina de Pomar to Burgos in a time

Piepoli had all but settled the Tour with his brilliant
victory in Wednesday's penultimate stage, a tough climb up to
Lagunas de Neila.
</P>
<P>
That win had given him a decisive 25-second lead over his
nearest challenger Oscar Sevilla of Spain, who also finished in
the main body of riders to secure second place overall.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian World Indoor Champion Cleared over Failed Dope Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KIEV, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Bagach, World and
European indoor shot put champion, has been cleared by the
Ukrainian Athletic Federation (UAF) after earlier failing a dope
test, according to reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bagach tested positive in February for an anabolic steroid,
but the UAF had cleared Bagach of doping and was sending the case
to the International Amateur Athletic Federation for confirmation,
Valery Alexandrov, vice-president of the UAF, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
As the sport's ruling body, the IAAF can accept the UAF's
findings or, if it disagrees, send the case to its doping
commission and on to abitration, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We're simply shocked to know the dose itself was huge enough
to kill a horse. I don't think he(Bagach) would do that to himself
even for the sake of winning a medal," Alexandrov was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Based on these facts, our federation was unable to prove
Bagach guilty of the doping offence, therefore we have asked the
IAAF to drop the case against him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bagach, who won a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Games, had
strongly denied knowingly having taken drugs and hopes to compete
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old was also stripped of his outdoor title just
five days after winning in Athens in 1997, having tested positive
for the banned stimulant ephedrine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Bergkamp has confirmed
his retirement from international football, accorting to new Dutch
coach Louis van Gaal in Zeist, the Netherlands on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal striker had said he planned to retire after Euro
2000 but until he made a definite announcement, Van Gaal had been
hopeful of persuading him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
But when the former Barcelona coach named a squad of 21
players to take part in the first training sessions under his
supervision, the 31-year-old Bergkamp was not included.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp was quoted as saying: "I have decided, after months
of weighing the pros and cons, to take this decision. Because of
the busy programme I will not get enough rest to perform well. I
want to focus fully on the (English) club competition."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch squad will start a three-day training session next
week, after which they will play a friendly against a Dutch
amateur side.

warning to Athens, saying it should speed up preparations or risk

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak proposed Friday
that Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States each name an
envoy for talks on the future of Jerusalem, the major stumbling
block which deadlocked the Camp David summit last month.

The proposal was made while Barak held phone conversations with
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, who arrived in the

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat there later, according to Israel

The protestors thronged the street after their regular Friday
Muslim prayers in a mosque, chanting slogans denouncing what they
called an Israeli policy to Judaise Jerusalem, a holy city sacred
to Muslims, Jews and Christians.

The protest, organized by the powerful opposition party Muslim
Brotherhood, ended peacefully without police intervention.

JERUSALEM -- Shuhada Street in the West Bank city of Hebron
remained closed to the passage of Palestinian vehicles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The road, which borders the Jewish and Palestinian communities
in Hebron, has been closed by Israel Defense Force (IDF)
authorities, which maintained that the measure is necessary to
prevent clashes between Palestinian and Jewish residents in the
city.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Selects Female Teacher as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Republican Pat
Buchanan Friday selected a black female teacher and conservative
political activist as his running mate for November election.
</P>
<P>
Introducing Ezola Foster at a press conference in Los Angeles,
Buchanan said, "I think this lady will be a tremendous benefit to
our cause, to our campaign and our movement."
</P>
<P>
Foster, 62, has been a strong supporter of Buchanan's bid to
head the party, which was founded by Texas billionaire Ross Perot
during the previous two elections.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan has been vying with another faction of the Reform
Party for being nominated as the party's presidential candidate.
The party split into two factions Thursday, with each holding a
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
One faction is to nominate Buchanan as its candidate on Friday
night while the other is to nominate Natural Law Party
presidential John Hagelin at its own convention.
</P>
<P>
The two factions will fight with each other for the right to
get 12.6 million U.S. dollars in federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
The Hagelin wing filed a complaint with the Federal Elections
Commission to block Buchanan from getting the fund from the
government.

<HEADLINE> McDyess Replaces Tim Duncan for Olympic Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Denver Nuggets forward
Antonio McDyess was named Friday to replace Tim Duncan for the U.S.
national basketball team to compete in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream come true," said an elated McDyess. "My goal
to play in the NBA began in 1992 watching the USA Olympic Team win
the gold medal in Barcelona. I cannot wait to represent my country
in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
"Antonio is an outstanding addition to this team," said USA
head coach Rudy Tomjanovich. "We are going to take full advantage
of the incredible athletic abilities of the players on this team
by playing an exciting, up tempo style of game. Antonio will fit
nicely into the scheme. He not only runs the floor extremely well,
but possesses very good shooting range and is someone who
defensively will offer us a definite shot blocker."
</P>
<P>
Duncan officially withdrew because of a knee injury suffered on
April 11 which resulted in surgery.
</P>
<P>
McDyess completed his fifth NBA season in 1999-2000 and while
leading the Nuggets in scoring and rebounding, he ranked 14th in
the NBA overall in scoring averaging 19.1 points a game, 16th in
the NBA in rebounding grabbing 8.5 rebounds per game, 19th in the
league in block shots rejecting 1.7 shots a game and was ninth in
the NBA in field goal percentage shooting 50.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Selected as the No. 2 overall pick of the 1995 NBA Draft,
McDyess played in 76 games for Denver and was named to the NBA's
All-Rookie First Team after posting averages of 13.4 points per
game, 7.5 rebounds per game and 1.5 blocks per game.
</P>
<P>
Upping his scoring to 18.3 points per game in his second year,
he was traded to Phoenix for the 1997-98 season and averaged 15.1
ppg.
</P>
<P>
Returning to Denver in 1999 as a free agent, he averaged career
best of 21.2 ppg, 10.7 rpg and 2.3 bpg, and capped the year with
his selection to the All-NBA Third Team.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the U.S. basketball Olympic team consists of Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen, Vin Baker, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett,
Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, Jason Kidd, Alonzo Mourning, Gary
Payton, Steve Smith and Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
Tomjanovich is the head coach, with Larry Brown, Gene Keady and
Tubby Smith as assistant coaches.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Urges Corsican Nationalists to Abandon Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-
Pierre Chevenement Friday urged Corsican nationalists to abandon
violence after the assassination of a moderate nationalist leader
early this week.
</P>
<P>
``It is not enough to condemn a crime when it was committed. It
would be more useful to condemn it in advance, and by consequence
renounce violence and put down the arms which the Corsican
nationalists illegally hold,'' Agence France-Presse quoted
Chevenement as saying.
</P>
<P>
A former leader of the Corsican nationalist movement, Jean
Michel Rossi, and a friend of his were assassinated on Monday in
front of a bar in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect the murder was committed by Rossi's rivals in
the nationalist factions on the island.
</P>
<P>
Rossi resigned from the leading post of a radical nationalist
group in 1998 and was believed to have made enemies with many
people for his public condemnation of violence perpetrated by
Corsican nationalist radicals, including the assassination of a
prefect of Corsica in 1998.

BUENOS AIRES, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A collision of two buses
Friday left eight people dead and 16 injured near the Argentine
city of Cordoba, some 900 kilometers northeast of the capital city
of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 07:40 local time when a bus of the
Andesmar bus line that was coming from Rawson, in the Chubut
department, collided with a local collective minibus of the Satag
firm which was running in opposite direction, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were among the people riding in the Satag
minibus, which almost split into two, with several of its
passengers trapped in the twisted irons.
</P>
<P>
Some of the survivors said that the weather conditions were
good at the moment of the collision and that it occurred in a
straight section of the road.
</P>
<P>
The first estimates determined that the Andesmar bus line
omnibus had invaded the other lane, causing the collision with the
minibus. The exact number of passengers in the two vehicles has
not been determined, said the same sources.

MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The company that manages the
commercial operation of Russia's Mir space station has reached a
deal with a U.S. television producer to put the winner of a future
game show into space, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
MirCorp, an international company that leases the orbiting
complex from the Russian rocket corporation Energia, said that
Mark Burnett, the executive producer of the "Survivor" TV series,
will send to Mir the winner of a new show, "Destination Mir."
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how much the deal will cost.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the show, about one and a half dozen Americans
will be selected. They will travel to the Russian Gagarin Space
Center to start training for the mission. The course of the
training will be broadcast on TV.
</P>
<P>
The training will ultimately produce the winner, who will
become a member of a space mission to Mir on the Russian
spacecraft Soyuz TM.
</P>
<P>
This is the second commercial project to take advantage of Mir.
The first is connected with prominent U.S. financier Dennis Tito,

<HEADLINE> Sacrificing Inflation for Success of Reform: Governmental Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Inflation has been a piece
sacrificed by the government so as not to miss the target of
economic growth, governmental aide Adrian Vasilescu said in a
statement carried by most newspapers here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu, on taking over the job at the
end of last year, announced he would pursue two major objectives --
economic growth and halved inflation against last year's inflation
rate of 54 percent. Developments in the first half of 2000, when
the inflation rate stood at a combined 19 percent, gave good
reason for hopes that Romania would meet the targeted inflation of
27 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the severe drought that hit the country this summer
prompted a chain of price increases for foodstuffs, power and
fuels. The inflation rate in July stood, therefore, at 4.3 percent,
or the equivalent of a year-on-year inflation of more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the government was forced, therefore, to give up
the target of halved inflation and focus on the more important
goal of his tenure, i.e., economic growth, said Vasilescu, adding
that the forecast 1.3 percent growth of the gross domestic product
is certain to be surpassed this year, with the Romanian economy
likely to expand nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vasilescu said that the key to lower inflation is increased
production. Romania, over the past 10 years, has been forced to re-
think the production-consumption relationship inherited from the
era of a centralized economy; under the pressure of a more
democratic society, stress has been laid on consumption to the
detriment of production. This explains, according to Vasilescu,
the high inflation rate over the past decade and the difficulties
in keeping it within reasonable limits.
</P>
<P>
Pursuing reform, privatization and the resurgence of production
are as many unfailing ways of fighting inflation, Vasilescu said.
</P>
<P>
While the government hopes that the inflation rate will be no
more than 30 to 33 percent this year, analysts estimate that it
will stand at more than 40 percent.

four South American countries.
</P>
<P>
Fox arrived in Montevideo on Thursday, where he talked with

American integration.
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment is to turn our attention to Latin America. This

<HEADLINE> 7,600 Phone Lines Put Into Operation in 1st Half of 2000 in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 11 (Xinhua) -- MoldTelecom, the state-run
telecom company in Moldova, has put into operation as many as 7,
600 new phone lines across the country, the company said in a
press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
MoldTelecom also opened Friday two new digital stations in
Soldanesti and Durlesti, with a capacity of 2,464 and 6,688 users
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In June, the company opened a phone station for 11,216
subscribers, which is already used by some 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan government had repeatedly stated that it would
privatize MoldTelecom to patch up the 300-million-U.S.-dollar
deficit budget.
</P>
<P>
The government later said that the MoldTelecom sale was
postponed for next year in order to invest into its infrastructure
and make the company more attractive for the potential investors.
</P>
<P>
Among the possible bidders could be Union Fenosa and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The latter has
already offered a 30-million-dollar pre-investment credit.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, MoldTelecom has opened 200,000 phone lines,
planning to set up 43,000 new lines by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in terms of phone density, Moldova ranks between
Georgia (11.41) and Romania (16.60) with 15.3 subscribers per 1,
000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The world telecommunication market is set to liberalize by 2003.
Experts say Moldova should hurry up with the privatization of its
national telecom company.

ATHENS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of international divers,
Jews and Greek government officials began their hunt in southern
Peloponnese peninsula Friday for the sunken treasure seized by
Nazis from Greek Jews during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Moldova to Reach Level Before Crisis in 10 Years: Deputy Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Moldova will reach the
economic level it registered in 1990, the year before the crisis
boom, in 10 years, the Moldovan Basa-Press news agency Friday
quoted Deputy Premier Andrei Cucu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cucu, who also holds the office of economics and reforms
minister, has predicted a 5-percent growth of the gross domestic
product (GDP) for 2001 and the next years, under a good governance
and efficient economic recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
Cucu described the economic situation in the ex-Soviet republic
as a "depression," aggravated by a wave of natural disasters this
year. According to him, Moldova's economic potential was now three-
fold weaker than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said in a report early this week that the GDP
dropped 1.7 percent in the first quarter of this year compared
with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Cucu, the "optimistic" scenario of economic
development sees Moldova at the same level of 1999, and the "
pessimistic" scenario predicts a 5-percent decline of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate compared with December 1999 was 12.2 percent.
The incomes to the consolidated budget amounted to 1.645 billion
lei (133.31 million U.S. dollars), with a spending of 1.711
billion lei (138.65 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report also said that foreign trade totaled 563 million
dollars, with a deficit of 126 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and some independent experts had earlier
predicted that Moldova would reach the 1990 economic level in at
least 15 years, while others pointed to a longer period -- 20
years.
</P>
<P>
More than 48 percent of respondents in a poll conducted in 1998
believed that the country would need more than 10 years to get out
of the impasse; another 29 percent said it would need seven to 10
years to tide over the crisis; and some 18 percent said seven
years would be enough.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is to reform its
judicial system to ensure accessible and timely justice for all, a
senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The system is outdated in significant ways and not responsive
to emerging social, political, economic and technological
development and the lack of widespread public trust in the system,
" Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs Bakari Mwapachu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a legal task force formed in 1993 had carried out
a comprehensive review of the legal sector and made
recommendations for the government to endorse.
</P>
<P>
He said a stable and reliable legal and regulatory environment
is important to the country's social, political and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the need to have a legal and judicial system that
enjoys public confidence cannot be overemphasized," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he officially launched the new office
of Mkono &AMP; Company in association with the London-based Denton

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new Senate President
Anyim Pius Anyim and his counterpart in the representatives have
pledged closer cooperation between the legislative and executive
of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks during a visit to President Olusegun
Obasanjo on Friday a day after a new Senate leadership emerged,
Nigerian press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two branches of government had been
straining, with the presidency accusing the lawmakers of
selfishness and low efficiency from time to time, and the
lawmakers criticizing the presidency of autocracy.
</P>
<P>
A 39-year-old lawyer was elected on Thursday as Nigeria's third
Senate president since the restoration of democratic rule in the
country last May.
</P>
<P>
Anyim Pius Anyim, who was born in Ishiagu village in Ebonyi
State in 1961, was sworn in as the country's youngest Senate
president in the history of the National Assembly to succeed Chuba
Okadigbo, who was removed from office in an impeachment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alhaji Irahim Mantu, a senator from Plateau State,
was elected as deputy Senate president to replace Alhaji Haruna
Abubakar, who resigned on Tuesday to avoid being forced to step
down.
</P>
<P>
The crisis of the leadership in the Senate was caused by a
probe panel report last week allegedly accusing the leadership,
including former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, of violating the
anti-corruption law and enriching themselves by awarding contracts.

LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has formally asked
Liechtenstein to help recover some 100 million U. S. dollars
deposited in Liechtenstein's banks, suspected as loots by Nigeria'

</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Saturday quoted a lawyer with the Geneva firm of

stashed in various foreign countries by Abacha and his entourage
during his 1993-98 rule.
</P>
<P>
In late June, a Liechtenstein judge ordered frozen some 100
million dollars in accounts at three banks pending receipt of the

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers
in the Nile Basin Countries have expressed their desire to see
tangible results of cooperation which suit the needs of the member
states.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement carried by local
newspapers on Saturday that they wanted the Nile Basin Initiative
(NBI) project to address common problems such as poverty
eradication and drought.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Khartoum, the Sudan, last week in a bid
to strengthen cooperation that would achieve sustainable
development through equitable utilization of Nile water resources.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Water Musa Nkangaa stressed the urgent
need for all the countries to better utilize the opportunity to
transform the region so as to achieve economic growth and reverse
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Most proposed projects at the meeting were related to the
initiation of hydroelectric power schemes in water falls in the
area, environmental conservation and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers of water from Tanzania,
Ethiopia, Rwanda, the Sudan, Uganda and the representatives from
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which has not yet joined the NBI ever since, was
represented by a minister and expressed its desire to participate
as an observer, thus marking the first time all ten Nile Basin
countries were present.
</P>
<P>
Major partners in the NBI are the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) as well as the governments of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> EU Renders Support for Kenya's Public Sector Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will use
a 42-million-Euro (37-million-U.S. dollar) package to help Kenya
implement the ongoing public sector program and diversify the
tourism sector, the East African Standard reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lutz Salzman, outgoing head of the delegation of the EU mission
to Kenya, Friday told Kenyan Minister for Tourism, Trade and
Industry Nicholas Biwott that the aid would be available before
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Salzman, who has been in Kenya for four years and posted to
Brussels, said 31 million Euro (27.9 million U.S. dollars) will go
towards public sector reform while the remaining will be used to
support the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
He also told the minister that Kenya was also likely to receive
another package from EU's Export Stabilizing Fund to help improve
its balance of payment following the dismal performance of the
coffee sector last year which led to substantial losses in export
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The EU is involved in a number of projects in Kenya ranging
from road construction, tourism to micro-enterprises. Most of the
EU's support is in grants.

<HEADLINE> Severe Drought Predicted in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner for Meteorology
Bwango Apuuli has warned of severe droughts in Uganda and East
Africa during this season, the New Vision reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Africa will have severe droughts, while southern Africa
will face floods, he said, adding that the extreme weather events
such as floods and droughts will increase in the frequency and
intensity because of global warming.
</P>
<P>
"Global warming, associated with periodic warming of the
neighboring oceans, has resulted in changes in the strength and
characteristics of the monsoon winds that bring moisture into
Uganda," Apuuli was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The global atmospheric temperature had increased due to
increase in greenhouse gases, said Apuuli, noting: "If significant
reduction in greenhouse gases is not done, the average global
temperature is predicted to raise by three degrees centigrade by
the year 2001."
</P>
<P>
Communities should be prepared to adapt to the new weather
phenomena, he said, urging the government to encourage rainwater
harvesting, supplementary irrigation and energy conservation
practices.

<HEADLINE> SADC Backs First Zambian President Over AIDS Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state and governments in
the Southern African region have given first Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda full backing for his new role in fight against HIV/
AIDS, Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at the just ended 20th summit of the
14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) in
Windhoek, Namibia, Kaunda who led Zambia for 27 years, was urged
to continue with what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year old Kaunda retired from politics early this year
and formed the Kenneth Kaunda Children of Africa Foundation to
wage war against the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its impact on the
underprivileged, especially children.
</P>
<P>
He was invited to Namibia to brief the region's heads of state
and government representatives on his new role.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kaunda as saying in an interview in
Johannesburg, South Africa, he was touched by the reception
accorded him by all the delegates.
</P>
<P>
He said his contribution to the liberation of Southern African
countries from colonial rule to apartheid was particularly
acknowledged. The mood generally was that he would play a role in
the advocacy campaign against HIV/AIDS in the same spirit he
successfully helped liberate the sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Zambian government will support his new
initiative in the struggle against the killer disease, Kaunda said
he was confident that such support would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"I think that they will support us. This is not politics. The
virus is killing many people than any war or the slave trade has
ever done. It is killing millions of men, women and children. The
campaign is an urgent matter to save mankind. This is above
politics. I am very happy that the reaction after my speech was
very warm all round, and it was quite protracted in the Zambian
camp," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said since the death of his son from HIV in 1986, he has
carried the campaign against the disease to many parts of the
world. Having become the first head of state to publicly
acknowledge that the virus had caused the death of his son, he has
been receiving many invitations to address conferences on HIV/AIDS
overseas.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community to help his campaign
with financial and material resources, saying without these, the
fight against the disease is almost impossible.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Broadly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
broadly higher Friday as the new economic data relieved fears of
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04 at 11,027.80,
climbing back to the 11,000 threshold for the first time since
April. The blue chip index finished at 11,124.82 points on April
25.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index reached the record closing high of 11,722.98
points on January 14, this year.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index was up 11.59 at 1,471.84 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 29.48 at 3,789.47, rebounding from a
loss of 60 points in the early session.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied today after the Labor Department reported
that its Producer Price Index was flat in July, a significant
easing of price pressures following a 0.6 percent increase in June.
The index showed a new sign that inflation remains under control
in response to six hikes in interest rates since last summer and
therefore the Federal Reserve will probably leave rates alone at
the August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris led the Dow's advance. The cigarette maker rose
after Goldman Sachs said the company's stock was severely
undervalued and could rise 50 percent to 60 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Other companies in banking, drugs and health care also helped
driving the Dow index higher.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite fell earlier in the session on worries
about a possible slowdown in corporate earnings in the second half
of 2000 but the index recovered.
</P>
<P>
Dell Computer, the Nasdaq's component, fell after announcing
that its second-quarter earnings hit the target but failed to beat
Wall Street's expectations. Cisco Systems rose sharply, helping
the Nasdaq secure a positive close.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 5.49 to close at 664.74 and the American
Stock Exchange index rose 13.48 to 923.74. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 8.62 to 536.50.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,006 up, 865 down and 495
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 833.80 million shares from 937.02

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Many U.S. Dotcoms Now Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A study released this week
predicted boom time ahead for mergers and acquisitions as U.S.
dotcoms see their liquidity options diminish.
</P>
<P>
Including AOL's purchase of Time Warner, buyers have spent 208
billion U.S. dollars on 225 Web properties this year alone,
according to the study by Webmergers, a San Francisco-based
service on mergers and acquisitions involving Web properties.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 Web companies have laid off workers in the last year
and 238 Internet start-ups have taken some action to cope with the
harsh funding climate, Webmergers said.
</P>
<P>
The study also found 29 cash-strapped Internet companies have
been sold so far this year, most of them in "fire sales" -- under
duress at less than optimal price. "Duress" in the case of
Internet companies usually means cash is running out and funding
sources are drying up. So far 41 Internet companies have shut down
this year. Another seven dotcoms are actively looking for buyers.
</P>
<P>
Besides cutting staff and budgets, Webmergers said, at least 17
companies out of the 238 companies in published reports have said
they will refocus their businesses. The most common change is
moving from a business-to-consumer model to a less cash hungry
business-to-business structure.
</P>
<P>
Most Internet start-ups are going for a second round of funding
and finding that money is simply not available or the terms are so
onerous that they are difficult to take, the study found. High-
tech California leads the list with 91 companies having disclosed
some type of action to cope with the slow funding climate.
Following behind the Golden States are New York, Massachusetts and
Colorado in that order, according to Webmergers study.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges African Central Banks, Governments to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa on Friday urged African central banks and
governments to work together to maintain the momentum of economic
reform and attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the two-day 24th ordinary meeting of
the Association of African Central Banks (AACB) opened on Thursday
in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, Mkapa said Africa has
now reached a critical point in its economic development and
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
African countries have either to sustain these efforts and
raise further average GDP growth rate to at least 7 percent, which
is the minimum required to make a significant impact on the
reduction of the incidence of poverty, or relax these efforts and
miss the opportunity of achieving high growth rates and poverty
reduction, Mkapa said in the message read on his behalf by
Tanzanian Minister for Finance Daniel Yona.
</P>
<P>
He told over 100 participants including governors, deputy
governors and directors of African central banks that the process
of liberalizing national economies in African countries has
created a more favorable environment for regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
"As exchange controls have been dismantled, custom tariffs
reduced, and as African countries have continued to assume their
obligations under the WTO (World Trade Organization), intra-
African trade has flourished, the ongoing initiatives in regional
integration has been made more productive and meaningful," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the AACB to hold its meeting in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, the association has enabled central banks of
African countries to benefit from exchange of experiences.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Security Personnel in Colombia to Prepare Clinton Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- An advance group of U.S.
technicians and security agents have arrived in Colombia to
prepare for the visit of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto said
Friday that Clinton's visit "has a profound meaning of solidarity"
with Colombia, especially in the matter of the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The visit also implies the U.S. acknowledgment of the
responsibility of the drug consuming countries for the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez de Soto said that the visit "is a success of the
international policy" of Colombian President Andres Pasatrana and
"a goal we have striven for".
</P>
<P>
He said the agenda for the Pastrana-Clinton meeting has not
been defined yet, but the Colombian side will underscore "the need
to seek more investments and more commerce for Colombia".
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Clinton will be accompanied by Democrat
and Republican congressmen in the visit, an indication that his
policy of supporting Colombia in the anti-drug war is "a policy of
state".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. Navy ship has also arrived in Cartagena to
participate in the preparations for President Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Germany Plans Far-Right Party Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the German federal
government and 16 states Friday began the legal proceedings aiming
to prohibit a far-right party, giving a clear signal against
growing extremism.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting between the officials and a judicial expert
panel in Berlin decided to draft a report on whether it was proper
to ask the Constitutional Court to outlaw the radical National
Democratic Party (NPD).
</P>
<P>
The German Interior Ministry said officials and experts would
issue a "driving map" pointing out legal steps against the NPD in
this October.
</P>
<P>
"The present investigation into the NPD is being carried out
not only daftly, but also carefully," a spokesman of the ministry
said, adding that the ministry had put back probes into other far-
right radical parties and focused its work on the NPD.
</P>
<P>
Although a poll by the N-TV television said some two-thirds of
plain Germans support a ban on the NPD that was well known for
advocating anti-Semitism, officials were still afraid insufficient
testimony might lead to a failure at the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed it would not support a prohibition on the
NPD before all sides reached an agreement since "a failure of the
petition at the Constitutional Court will mean a failure of the
legal country and a triumph of the NPD."
</P>
<P>
Harald Kunkel, police chief of Thuringia state, warned a
failure of the petition would strengthen the far-right groups, and
added, "The present material is enough to bear out that the party
is an anti-Basic Law organization."
</P>
<P>
The opposite Christian Democratic Union (CDU) recommended a
petition jointly issued by the government and the two chambers of
the parliament, namely the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Schmit, legal expert of the CDU, told the Die Welt
newspaper that the Constitutional Court would more possibly accept
a joint petition aiming to prohibit the NPD.
</P>
<P>
Germany's post-war constitution, or the Basic Law, says that

<HEADLINE> Barclays Takes Over Rival Woolwich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) - The UK's fourth-biggest High
Street bank, Barclays, announced on Friday the takeover of its
rival Woolwich in an 8.1 billion US dollars deal.
</P>
<P>
The merger will more than double Barclays' 4 percent share of
the UK mortgage market, which is increasingly competitive, and
will unite the two leaders in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the deal will cost at least 1,000 jobs as
both banks integrate their "back office infrastructure",
management of business, running of accounts and other financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
But Barclays said both the Woolwich brand name and some of its
branches will be retained, with the firm set to become the
mortgage arm of the Barclays Group.
</P>
<P>
Woolwich chairman Brian Jenkins said: "From the Woolwich we
bring our popular brand, innovation and highly successful
management team to join in this exciting venture."
</P>
<P>
"Combined with Barclays' strengths, we can all go forward
changing the nature of retail banking in the United Kingdom," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Observers also believe the news that the deal finalized will
renew hope that there could be other bids for a handful of UK
mortgage banks that have been hurt by competition from new
entrants and online banks.
