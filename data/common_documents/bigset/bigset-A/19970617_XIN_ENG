<HEADLINE> France, Germany Welcome EU Budget, Job Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany, the primary
engines behind the European monetary union, welcomed an agreement
struck today by European Union (EU) finance ministers on a budget
pact and a jobs resolution on the sideline of an EU summit in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Chirac had welcomed the agreement which resulted from "a
perfect coordination between the president and the prime
minister," said Catherine Colonna, spokeswoman of Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was in line with the provisions of both French
President Jacques Chirac, a champion of domestic austerity
programs to qualify France for the single currency by its launch
date in 1999, and new socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who
calls for job creation and education reform, she said.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigal said that the deal was on
the right track and he was happy with the progress made. "We are
on a good path," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The deal has reconciled Germany's insistence on strict monetary
discipline with France's demand for programs to stimulate growth
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm told reporters that the
ministers had reached "complete agreement" on the stability pact,
which stricts budget rules for countries joining in EU's single
currency, and the resolution for growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht treaty requires the EU members joining the
monetary union to reduce their public deficits to below 3 percent
of Gross Domestic Product and to keep a low unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Debt-For-Ivory Deal Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Rural communities from southern
Africa said today they are against the bid by some western
organisations to exchange debt owed by their countries for ivory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conferfence of the ongoing 10th conference
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) in Harare, the Southern African Forum for Communities and
Non-governmental Organisation (SAFCAN) said it wanted sustainable
trade and not aid.
</P>
<P>
SAFCAN representatives from seven southern African countries
said they supported the bid to downlist the elephant from
appendix one to appendix two because this would allow communities
to use the resources available to them.
</P>
<P>
The representatives said they would not support the
debt-for-ivory proposal because this would not directly benefit
conservation programmes in rural communities.
</P>
<P>
An international conservation group said at the beginning of
the conference last week that southern African countries could
consider selling their ivory stocks which have accumulated since
1989 to pay off their foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is to manage our own resources and earn
something from those resources. We do not accept the
debt-for-ivory alternative," a Botswana representative said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Youth Urged to Participate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki today urged the youth of the country to be
more actively engaged in nation-building and creating a better
life for all.
</P>
<P>
He said that the youth could "play an indispensable role and
open the way for change" when making the call at a special youth
assembly in Cape Town to mark Youth Day and commemorate the 21th
anniversary of Soweto student uprising of June 16, 1976 to
protest the forced use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 young students were killed and 1000 injured when
police opened fire during the uprising.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said: "We can look forward to the future with optimism
and we await the birth of the national youth policy with great
expectations."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the country was moving in the right
direction and the government was prepared to invest in the youth,
urging the young people to join the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the issue of Afrikaans, Mbeki said the
government had taken a decision not to prohibit Afrikaans from
being used as a language of instruction at universities and other
tertiary institutions.
</P>
<P>
Afrikaners' fear that they and their language were being
marginalized was based on false information, said the Deputy
President, adding he was concerned about what appeared to be a
sense of unease about the future among the Afrikaner section of
the population, especially its youth.
</P>
<P>
Afrikaner youth representatives speaking during the assembly
proceedings also urged the government not to repeat the mistakes
of the past by conducting a policy of language imperialism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairwoman of the National Youth Movement
Mahlengi Bhengu told the assembly that June 16 should be observed
in a responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
"Use the opportunity to tell the government about the problems
you face where you live," said Bhengu.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Iranian Co-op on Border Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today urged Iran to make
further efforts to ensure the security along the Turkish-Iranian
border areas.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli told
a weekly press briefing that more work had to be done to make the
border of the two countries a peaceful region.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that there have already existed some mechanisms
designed to ensure border tranquility, Atacanli said Turkey was
not satisfied with the present situation.
</P>
<P>
"No concrete results have been achieved so far in this
respect," the spokesman said, adding that Turkey was monitoring
closely the developments on the Turkish-Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would be possible for military officials to
participate in certain security committees between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has conveyed its security concern to Iran time and
again, and hoped to see a positive reaction, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has denied that Iran is
hosting the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, outlawed in
Turkey for fighting a separatist war for autonomy in eastern and
southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the PKK
rebels, who it alleged were holing up in Iran to launch sporadic
attacks and cause disturbances along the Iranian-Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who is in here to attend a summit of eight Muslim
states, told reporters that the infiltration of the PKK rebels
into Iran also affects the benefits of the Iranian people.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho PM Explains His Political Moves to State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle today has given a detailed explanation of his latest
political moves to the Lesotho Council of State, reported the
South African Press Association from Maseru, capital of the
land-locked kingdom.
</P>
<P>
An informed government source was quoted as saying that the
meeting, called by King Letsie III and attended by several other
members of the Council, asked many questions relating to
Mokhehle's latest political moves, which allegedly plunged
Lesotho into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mokhehle resigned as leader of the ruling
Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and formed a new political party,
the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), to which he transferred
governance immediately followed its registration.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's hearing, the Council members asked whether
Mokhehle's political movements did not imply that his government
should have resigned and sought a new mandate under a new
political party, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehel's reply was not because "there is a separation
between political party affairs and the government".
</P>
<P>
Following Mokhehle's explanation, senior government officials
were convinced that Mokhehle's moves constituted no violation of
the kingdom's supreme law, the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, during a mass protest march in Maseru, the BCP
presented a petition to head of state King Letsie III, demanding
the resignation of Mokhehle.
</P>
<P>
The petition requested the King to ensure that democratic rule
was reinstated in Lesotho, failing which the people would have no
option but to see to it that this was done.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Blames Arafat for Renewed Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today charged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for
giving order to the recent rioting renewed by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Netanyahu held Arafat responsible for the
Palestinian rioting last Thursday near the Kush Katif settlement
in Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
One Palestinian died and several others were wounded in clashes
with Israeli soldiers who fired rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse the protesters.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu noted that Arafat was careful not to launch a new
round of full-out violence for two reasons: tougher reaction from
Israel and international criticism.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat's game of playing with pressures on Israel from
Egypt and the United States had failed. On the contrary, the
U.S. was exerting pressure on Arafat for the alleged official
corruption and the murder of Palestinian land dealers who sold
land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the Palestinian National Authority was
at a political crossroads now: either to advance peace or return
to violence. He expressed hope that the Palestinian side would
stop the violence and resume negotiations with Israel in order to
continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the situation between Israel and Syria and
Lebanon, Netanyahu said he saw no immediate signs of impending
war with Syria. But He quickly added it did not mean that Israel
does not maintain vigilance.
</P>
<P>
On the continued clashes in south Lebanon, Netanyahu said
Israel did not intend to occupy Lebanon, and its occupation of the
so-called south Lebanon security zone was only aimed at preventing
Hezbollah forces from attacking its northern border.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu came under strong criticism in the committee from
opposition lawmakers, including Labor Party's faction chairman
Rannan Cohen and Meretz leader Yossi Sarid. Both of them accused
Netanyahu of leading the country to new clashes with the
Palestinians, and possibly with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Labor's new leader Ehud Barak also pointed an accusing finger
at Netanyahu for his hardline policies which he said not only
lead the country to the brink of war, but also push it onwards.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel had nothing to gain from the
confrontation -- although Israel could inflict 10 times more
casualties in clashes with its enemies, but it would also pay a
high price.
</P>
<P>
Barak advised Netanyahu be ready to make compromises by
taking into account of the vital interests of the Palestinian
side, while trying to preserve Israel's own security
interests.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
his country will implement human rights principles and
democratization according to its own norms.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters this morning aboard the plane taking him
home from Istanbul, Turkey, the president said pressure on
Indonesia to democratize and implement human rights principles is
getting stronger, the official Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was referring to U.S. Senator Patrick Kennedy who has
recently criticized Indonesia's human rights record at the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's stance and the U.S. Congress' plan to issue an
anti-Indonesia bill has pushed Indonesia to cancel the planned
purchase of nine F-16 fighters from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto attended the Development 8 (D-8) summit in Istanbul on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 groups Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On the D-8, the president said the group was formed to make its
member countries' cooperation with bigger groups more effective
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
At its summit on Sunday, the D-8 agreed to promote dialogue
instead of confrontation, cooperation instead of exploitation,
justice instead of double standard, equality instead of
discrimination and respect instead of oppression.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will host the second D-8 summit next year.

<HEADLINE> African Population Meeting Opens in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A 4-day second general
assembly of the African Population Commission opened here today,
to discuss how to meet the population challenges facing the poor
continent.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening ceremony, Vijay S. Makhan,
assistant secretary general of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), said African continent is the last region to venture into
the field of elaborating population policies aimed at addressing
conclusively the challenges of the time.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that with an annual population growth of almost
three percent, the African continent's population is expected to
reach 850 million by the end of the century and by the year 2025,
the figure will be doubled to 1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The OAU official wondered in his statement how African
countries can produce enough food, create enough jobs and provide
adequate education for an additional 15-20 million people each
year when they are unable to do so for their present population.
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries to "adopt bold measures and take
courageous steps to prevent the continent from further stagnation
on account of its hitherto inability to tackle the population
problems".
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Ethiopian Minister of Economic
Development and Cooperation Girma Biru emphasized that the
challenge facing Africa today remains great and the imbalance
between excessively rapid population growth and social and
economic development still continues.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the assembly has a vital role to play in helping
OAU member countries to review the issues and challenges in
Africa, devise policies, strategies and programs to address these
challenges, he added.
</P>
<P>
The population meeting, jointly organized by the OAU, UN
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the African Development
Bank, is to review population and development activities, share
experiences and revise strategies to accelerate the
implementation of the Dakar/Ngor declaration and the pledges made
in Cairo.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif arrived here today for talks with Iranian leaders on the
Afghan issue and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was received at the airport by Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati. He said upon his arrival that Pakistan
believes that the Afghan issue should be solved by peaceful
instead of military means.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is now holding talks
with Sharif in Sadabad Palace in northern Tehran, the capital of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is expected to hold talks with Iranian President-elect
Mohammad Khatami Tuesday on the bilateral issues and international
topics of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Khatami today called for broadening relations between Iran and
Pakistan. He has sent separate cables to Pakistan President
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Sharif, urging Pakistan to
consolidate the friendship between the two neighboring Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is widely believed to have given financial and
military support to the Taliban Islamic militia, a faction that
captured the Afghan capital of Kabul in September and took control
of two-thirds of the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was also the first country to recognize the Taliban
government.
</P>
<P>
Taliban repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the ousted
government of Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied giving military assistance to any of the
Afghan factions, saying it had sent only humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Inter-clan Fighting Continues in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The inter-clan fighting
continued in the southern Somali port town of Kismaio for the
second day today.
</P>
<P>
The rival militiamen of Marchan and Majerten have exchanged
attack and counter-attack around the outskirts of the town early
today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the local field radios, the port
town of Kismaio is once again falling into renewed clan-based
rivalry over the control of the strategic town for the first time
for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
The hostility has been growing ever since the Marehans had
been driven out of the town early this year, and only now their
militiamen have started guerrilla fighting against the Majertens.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is reported in the villages of Gobwein and
Madhamato just outside the town where the opposing sides have
suffered heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said more than 13 people died and more than 25
others were wounded today, thus bringing the total death to at
least 23 and more than 40 injuries since yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This new round of hostility in the second most sensitive
region after Mogadishu is worsening the already lingering

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash with Israeli Soldiers in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 Palestinian
protesters and one Israeli soldier were injured during the clashes
between them for the third consecutive day today in the West Bank
town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place along the line between Jewish
neighborhoods and Palestinian areas in the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight day when violent confrontations
erupted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, apparently triggered
off by the United States Congress resolution last week to
recognize united Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers of Morag Settlement
opened fire at a group Palestinians, claiming that the
Palestinians "have broke into the settlement property and tried
to move a fence."
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the US House of Representatives voted 406-17
to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel,
despite opposition by the US government.
</P>
<P>
The house also voted to provide 100 million US dollars
for moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of
a future Palestinian State, sharply criticized the resolution,
which they said would hurt the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) cabinet
issued a statement, blaming the US, the Israeli soldiers, and
Jewish settlers for what it said was an "explosive situation
everywhere because of Israeli settlement aggression."
</P>
<P>
PNA chief Jerusalem representative Faisal Husseini, who
participated in a demonstration today opposite the US Consulate
in East Jerusalem, warned that if the US approves the
resolution, "the whole peace process will be lost."
</P>
<P>
The US congressional resolution about Jerusalem was taken by
Palestinians as implicit US support for Israel's stand for
creating facts on the ground prior to final status
negotiations which include Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also criticized the
resolution, saying "the resolution was unwise, especially that
it came at a time when the peace process was passing
through a crisis, which would escalate the situation."
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March when Israel started to build a
controversial new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu
Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while, Israel is insisting that the
PNA must crack down on terror and reestablish full security
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Prompt Lift of Ban On Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) today called for a prompt lift of international sanctions
against Libya over the Lockerbie crisis and aired support for
Tripoli's overtures to settle the dispute with the West.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU secretary general, who arrived here last
Friday for a week-long visit, made the statement today after
meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on several
issues on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The OAU secretary general said that he probed with Moussa the
UN imposed sanctions and flight embargo on Libya and the Tripoli's
dispute with the West.
</P>
<P>
The UN imposed sanctions against Tripoli for its refusal to
hand over two Libyans suspected of involvement in the bombing of a
Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270
people on board.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Mummar Gaddafi has suggested the two stand trial
anywhere other than in the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Salim called for the removal of such sanctions that are "not in
the interest of the Libyan people and the African region."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU called for an immediate end of the sanctions imposed
on Libya and urged the implementation of the initiatives and
proposals made by the OAU, Arab League and Non-Aligned Movement to
secure a solution to the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU sees that these proposals "the only way out of the
current crisis and ending the sufferings of region, Libya and the
entire African continent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said that he will discuss with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid on coordinating stances of
the League and his organization.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West crisis was discussed for the first time at the
latest African summit which called for lifting the sanctions and
taking temporary measures to help ease the sufferings of the
Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, during his two-day visit to
the Libyan coastal city of Tobruk on June 12-13, also denounced
the UN imposed ban on Libya and urged its immediate removal.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 orphaned children
in Lusaka have got help with all the basic needs from Children In
Distress (CINDI), a non-governmental organization (NGO), since
its inception in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A latest report from the CINDI said its aim is to alleviate
the suffering of the orphans in the city. As a NGO, CINDI is
trying to tackle the huge challenge of the growing number of
orphans, some of whom have lost both parents.
</P>
<P>
The organization's dreams are to care for the children,
provide education and medical facilities and to start small self
help projects for those out of school, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The CINDI has already started three small agricultural
projects to help children who are not in school.

ABU DHABI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain' parliament today
expressed resentment over a US Congress resolution declaring
Jerusalem as the "undivided capital of Israel" and sanctioning
funds for shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's parliament said in a statement issued today that the
US Congress decision was a threat to the Middle East peace process
and was against internation rules, particularly the UN 242
resolution which calls for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied
Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also said that the U.S. vote has hurt the
sentiment of the Islamic and Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding resolution, opposed by Clinton administration,
was passed on Tuesday and has since sparked criticism and
condemnation from among the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lesotho Government Faces Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (xinhua) -- The Lesotho cabinet led by
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has been strongly denounced as the
"usurped" government by the former ruling Basutoland Congress
Party (BCP) and its supporters since he formed the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) last week.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle announced on June 9 the formation of LCD and
immediately transferred the government power to the newly formed
party, saying that his new party had controlled a majority
parliament with the support of 41 of 64 parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's moves sent shockwaves in the tiny land-locked
mountain kingdom, forcing opposition parties to form a coalition
with the BCP, which unanimously condemned the move and termed it
"unconstitutional" or even as "coup d'etat".
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, 20 parliament members of BCP walked out the
National Assembly in protest against Mokhehle's latest political
moves.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the walkout, some BCP members questioned Parliament
Speaker Teboho Kolane why he was legitimizing the "unlawful"
actions taken by Mokhehle. There were several attacks by members
of the BCP against the speaker, accusing him of bias, informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They were demanding a normal swearing-in process for members
of the new party, including the prime minister, as well as
notification of the changes to the King Letsie III.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand supporters of Lesotho political parties,
waving the multiple colors of party flags, today participated in
a demonstration against the Mokhehle government, informed sources
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"The march against the usurped government of Mokhehle was very
successful. People came in from all districts in trucks and
minibuses to support our protest against Mokhehle," demonstration
organizer Vincent Malebo said.
</P>
<P>
A BCP memorandum was handed to King Letsie III's secretary
Mabotse Lerothodi during the demonstration, Malebo said, adding
that the King was at that time attending a council of state
meeting, where Mokhehle was explaining his latest political
moves.
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, the BCP pointed out that the formation of
Mokhehle's LCD in the National Assembly was not only a
manipulation of the democratic process and a travesty of justice,
but also a betrayal of the trust that was reposed upon him as
leader of the BCP, Malebo said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, singed by its Secretary-General Godfrey
Kolisang, also drew the attention of the King to Mokhehle's
resignation from BCP, both as leader and member -- a move which,
the BCP said, carried serious implications for the people of
Lesotho as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Mokhehle's resignation signifies a complete failure on his
party as leader to meet and satisfy the aspirations of the party
members and the electorate," Malebo quoted the memorandum as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Mokhehle said he left the BCP due to infighting which
plagued the party for a long time, noting that his opponents
within the party made it difficult for him to run the party
effectively.
</P>
<P>
For now, there is no sign of any suspension of anti-government
campaign in Lesotho. The opposition coalition has vowed to make
the country ungovernable and parliament unworkable, yet
Mokhehle's loyalists, ignoring the threats, said the prime
minister would continue his leadership as he enjoyed support of
the majority in parliament.

LUANDA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos is always willing to meet UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, but
he proposes that such a meeting should be held on the territory
of Angola, a diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Angolan ambassador to Portugal Jose Patricio said in an
interview with the Portugal TV Station that with the
establishment of the Angolan government of national unity and
reconciliation, next meeting between Dos Santos and Savimbi
should be held in their motherland in order to promote the
credibility of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The venue for such a meeting can be anywhere in Angola, not
limited to Luanda, he said, reacting to Savimbi's recent remarks
which suggested that next meeting between him and Dos Santos
still be held in a foreign country, such as Italy.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader and President Dos Santos is due to hold their
fifth meeting in recent two years. Their last four meetings have
been held outside their own country.

KUWAIT CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today rejected
the U.S. congress recognition of Jerusalem as the "undivided
capital" of Israel and the decision to allocate 100 million
U.S. dollars to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Faresi said in a statement
after a weekly cabinet meeting chaired by Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz that the resolution adopted by the American House of
Representatives on Jerusalem would undermine the international
efforts to save the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Faresi said that the
cabinet expressed appreciation over the position of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's administration which criticized the
Congress resolution.
</P>
<P>
Saudi second Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz said after his talks with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen in Jeddah last Saturday that Riyadh fully
rejected the decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan said "Saudi Arabia will be glad to hear the
U.S. leaders' opposition to this decision."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the resolution last Tuesday amid
international criticism and Arab attacks against Israeli
insistence on the construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs considered the decision as an encouragement to
Israel's continued expansionist policy.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Adopt EMU, Jobs Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union leaders
adopted at their summit meeting in Amsterdam today two resolutions
designed to strict budget rules in the monetary union while
putting strong emphasis on fighting unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who hosts the two-day EU summit
in Amsterdam, announced the adoption "with great satisfaction" at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The European Council Resolution on Growth and Employment said
that employment issues would be kept "firmly at the top of the
political agenda of the Union."
</P>
<P>
The employment accord, a non-binding political resolution that
includes a role for the European Investment Bank, comes in
response to the new French government's demands that more should
be done to help the 18 million unemployed in the Union.
</P>
<P>
However, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that the
employment resolution involved no additional spending for
job-creation projects.
</P>
<P>
France wants funding for major infrastructure programs such as
Trans-European Networks (TENs) as a way for creating jobs. TENs
include large road, rail and telecommunications links between and
within the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Germany has ruled out costly Europe-wide job-creation
programs, which, it argues, have in the past merely raised
inflation and interest rates and failed to cut unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Bonn believes that the way to fight joblessness is through
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact, an accord reached in principle in December
to stop countries running large deficits after the single currency
is launch in January 1999, was, as expected, adopted unchanged
from its original form, despite French protests in advance of the
meeting that they may need more time to consider the pact before
agreeing it.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch prime minister also confirmed at the press conference
that a special EU summit meeting would be held during the
six-month Luxembourg EU presidency, which starts on July 1, to
address the 15-nation bloc's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The summit will not create miracles, but we can learn from
others' experiences (in fighting unemployment)," the Dutch prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the two resolutions has reconciled Germany's
insistence on strict monetary discipline with French demands for
programs to stimulate growth and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Introduce Value Added Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
accepted and confirmed its readiness to introduce the Value Added
Tax (VAT) system following recent consultations between the Isles
government and the Union government of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Commissioner General,
Melkizedeck E. Sanare said here today that his authority was
assisting in the introduction of VAT in Zanzibar and details are
being worked out with the Ministry of Finance in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
"The VAT Bill gazetted in March 1997 was for a Mainland VAT
system only. Following recent consultations between the Union
government and the government of Zanzibar the latter has
confirmed its readiness to introduce a VAT system," said Sanare
in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The TRA chief said that the Vat Implementation Project to be
introduced in the country next year, was currently being funded
by the World Bank, European Union (EU) and the Union government.
</P>
<P>
Sanare said the World Bank has provided a loan of 1.1 million
US Dollars for professional staff, technical assistance, office
equipment and training since 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU has provided a grant of 1.52 US Dollars which
covers computerisation, technical assistance and staff training
and the government of Tanzania has submitted a request to the EU
for additional funding for the program.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been providing funds for meeting the
recurrent expenses of the project," said Sanare, adding that in
the next financial year the government was also intending to fund
the project through its allocation to TRA.
</P>
<P>
He said introduction of VAT in the country was a decision of
the government aimed primarily at broadening the tax base and
increasing government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The authority last month also said that advantages of VAT
would be abollition of a number of taxes sucha as sales tax,
hotel levy and stamp duty.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the introduced VAT system was not
prohibitive and unfriendly to the tax-payer and was also self
policing.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) said today that African ministers of information will
discuss a plan to privatize their regional news network.
</P>
<P>
This came in a report prepared by OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim on information and communication in Africa, endorsed
at a working session of the Inter-Governmental Council on
Information and Communication today.
</P>
<P>
The report stated that a plan has been approved to revive the
financially-strapped Pan-African News Agency (PANA) in cooperation
with the UNESCO and the OAU.
</P>
<P>
PANA Board of Directors has proposed selling 25 percent of its
capital to national news agencies in African countries and offer
the rest for private interests.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said earlier
today that the ownership and service of a restructured PANA has
to remain African in order to maintain its function as Africa's
voice to the world and information disseminator.
</P>
<P>
Discussions around PANA will be high on the agenda of the
three-day meeting in Cairo of the information ministers from more
than 30 African countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministers will discuss a proposal to establish
an OAU radio station to enable Africans to participate in issues
related to their continent.
</P>
<P>
They will also review offers submitted by many international
institutions to launch the African Satellite and an African
information system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia will continue to supply defensive
weapons to Cyprus, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Cypriot counterpart,
Yiannakis Cassoulides, today, Primakov said that Russia cannot
deliver these weapons to Cyprus unless it declares a
demilitarized zone and demilitarized order is indeed established
there.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has long been a sore spot in Europe. Primakov
said Russia is interested in its peaceful and speedy resolution.
He hoped that its settlement should ensure the security of both
communities living in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides expressed satisfaction with the relations between
Cyprus and Russia, calling the relations "exemplary."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said the U.N.-brokered talks on the Cyprus
conflict settlement will be held in New York in early July. He
believed Russia could play an important role at these talks as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Adopt EMU, Jobs Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union leaders
adopted today the jobs agreement reached by their finance
ministers earlier to incorporate an employment resolution in the
stability pact.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who hosts the
two-day EU summit in Amsterdam, "with great satisfaction" at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kok also confirmed that a special EU summit meeting would be
held during the six-month Luxembourg EU presidency, which starts
on July 1, to address the 15-nation bloc's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The summit will not create miracles, but we can learn from
others' experiences (in fighting unemployment)," the Dutch prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The jobs deal has reconciled Germany's insistence on strict
monetary discipline with French demands for programs to stimulate
growth and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm told reporters that the
ministers had reached "complete agreement" on the stability pact,
which stricts budget rules for countries joining in the EU's
single currency, and the resolution for growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
EU monetary affairs commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy told
reporters after the finance ministers' meeting that there would be
a link between an EU budget pact and the one on growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the accord provided for a special lending
program by the European Investment Bank, the EU's main lending
arm, to help small businesses and high-technology companies.

<HEADLINE> Britain-Sinn Fein Contacts Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
suspending contacts with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, after the IRA admitted shooting two
policemen in Northern Ireland today.
</P>
<P>
Following the murder, there was now "no question" of meeting
Sinn Fein, sources at the Northern Ireland Office confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Government officials had held two meetings with Sinn Fein to
clarify the conditions under which the party could be admitted to
peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland. A third meeting had
been planned, probably for some time this week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned Sinn Fein for "sickening"
cynicism and hypocrisy after calling off the talks.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam described today's murder
of the two policemen, who were shot at close range while on
routine patrol, as "an appalling outrage."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ports Handle Record Foreign Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian ports handled a record
tonnage of international cargo last year, said a newspaper report
today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian ports handled 358 million tons of cargo in 1996, down
0.7 percent from 1995. International shipments totaled 260 million
tons, up 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, domestic cargo shipments have been on a
decade-long slide and fell 3.1 percent in 1996, the report quoted
Statistics Canada as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver was the busiest Canadian port, which handled nearly
27 percent of the country's international shipments last year.
</P>
<P>
Higher movements of coal and sulphur contributed to a 2.5
percent rise in international shipments through the Vancouver
port.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Province to Sue Tobacco Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- In a ground-breaking move in
Canada, British Columbia (B.C.) province will introduce
legislation today that will enable the province and its residents
to team up in class-action suit against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
It is the province's hope that the law would help claw back
some of the estimated 370 million U.S. dollars it pays each year
to treat smoking-related diseases, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The threat of broad, government-backed class-suits is designed
to persuade the tobacco companies that it is time to become "more
responsible corporate citizens," said a B.C. government official.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking them to change their ways. If they don't, we are
saying we'll change for them," the official was quoted as saying
by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would speed up litigation by making it easier
to prove smoking's harmful effects, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in B.C. and Canada as a whole that
the cost of smoking-related health costs is recovered directly
from the tobacco industry, not via the tax system.
</P>
<P>
The B.C. government will also propose hefty fees for tobacco
manufacturers if they wish to sell cigarettes in the province,
seek a crackdown on teen-age smoking.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 5,500 B.C. residents are killed by
smoking each year, more than drug overdoses, alcohol, car
accidents, suicides and AIDS combined together.
</P>
<P>
Today's move by B.C. is being closely watched by the federal
government and the other provinces, which are considering similar
court efforts to recoup billions of dollars that smoking costs
them each year.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies in the United States have begun to buckle
under the threat of class-action lawsuits from at least 37 states
in recent weeks, which would be boost for their Canadian
counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Number of Women Executives Increases Sharply in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- More women are reaching the top of
the business ladder and the pay gap with their male counterparts
is narrowing, the Institutes of Management said today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the number of female executives has
risen 60 percent, accounting for 15.2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The surge in women's presence in management, including in the
boardroom, comes as some companies are appointing high-profile
women to senior posts, such as Marjorie Scardino, chief executive
of Pearson.
</P>
<P>
Personnel and marketing are the most promising routes for women
to get to the top. There are as many female personnel managers as
there are men, while one in three marketing managers is a woman.
</P>
<P>
The findings emerge from the institute's national management
salary survey, which covers 867 directors and more than 23,600
managers in almost 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
Women had bigger pay rises than men last year. Their salaries
rose 7.4 percent compared with 4.7 percent in the previous year,
while rises for men were up from 4.7 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The typical female manager is 37, earns 31,550 pounds (50,480
US dollars) a year and has been with her present employer for 11
years.
</P>
<P>
Their male counterpart is 44, earns 35,761 pounds (57.218
dollars) and has spent the last 17 years with his company.
</P>
<P>
At boardroom level, the average female director is 40, earns
71,126 pounds (113,802 dollars) and has worked in her present firm
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Their typical male colleague is 48, earns 91,957 pounds
(147,131 dollars) and has 14 years with his current employer.
</P>
<P>
Another survey of 4 million executives, compiled by a business
information agency, also showed that 29 percent of British company
directors are female. And it revealed that they are generally
younger than male directors.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Poverty Eradication in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) today called for the freeing of African
countries from the devastating burden of debt and the adoption of
other actions to eradicate poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Marking today's observance of the Day of the African Child,
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF executive director, said that huge debt
obligations in many African countries were severely undermining
their capacity to care for their children. Total external debt in
sub-Saharan Africa represented about 800 dollars per child.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there was no "magic formula" for sustainable
economic growth and the eradication of poverty in Africa, she
called for action on a number of fronts -- the facilitation of
broad-based economic growth, the provision of basic social
services for all, the enhancement of income opportunities for the
poor, a fair international trading system, foreign investment and
donor assistance.
</P>
<P>
The answer was to couple appropriate economic policies with
sustainable investment in children and their families, she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that recent reports of the United Nations
Development Program pointed to the potential for real economic
recovery in Africa. In 1995, economic growth in Africa rose above
population growth for the first time in a decade. In 1986, 18
countries recorded more than 5 percent growth in their gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"There is truly good news in these figures for a continent too
often associated with want and suffering," she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite these positive trends, Bellamy acknowledged that the
progress was fragile. In sub-Saharan Africa, some 40 percent of
the population -- more than 220 million people -- still lived
below the poverty line. As large families were most vulnerable to
poverty, children were the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
"It's an outrage that in this era of unprecedented global
wealth creation, about one quarter of the world's population lives
in poverty," she added.

MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Moscow and Pyongyang today began
consultations on bilateral relations here at the level of deputy
foreign ministers, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held, from the Russian side, by Grigory Karasin

(DPRK) Lee In-Koo, who arrived here last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the Russia-DPRK consultations, the news
agency quoted DPRK Ambassador to Moscow Song Sung-Pil as saying,
is to thrash out the draft of a new inter-state treaty.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said, "The treaty must reflect the new realities and a
new approach must be made more realistic."
</P>
<P>
The previous treaty, which is now invalid, was signed by the
former Soviet Union and the DPRK in Pyongyang in 1961.

<HEADLINE> British PM Condemns Killing of N.Irish Police by IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today condemned the IRA for the killing of two policemen in
Northern Ireland and decided to cut off official contacts with
the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Blair, while attending an EU summit meeting in Amsterdam, said
in a statement that the IRA's "cynicism and hypocrisy are
sickening. Their actions defy normal understanding. It is
difficult to interpret this latest attack as anything but a signal
that Sinn Fein and the IRA are not interested in peace and
democracy."
</P>
<P>
He said any further meeting with Sinn Fein was now out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
"My reaction to this outrage is the reaction of decent people
everywhere -- one of horror at the act of murder and anger at what
looks like a deliberate attempt to place obstacles in the road of
peace," local reports quoted the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were killed at close range by gunmen late this
morning in the town of Lurgan, southwest of Belfast, and the IRA
claimed responsibility hours later for the murder.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain's Labor government and Dublin resumed talks with
Sinn Fein last month with the hope of bringing about a new IRA
cease-fire and reaching an agreement to end Northern Ireland's 28
years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
In response to today's attack, a spokesman for the Northern
Ireland office announced that the government had broken off
contacts with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
"Following today's murders there is no question of agreeing to
meet Sinn Fein," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's election campaign for a
new democratic government started today as scheduled despite
reportedly poor preparations for the country's first election
after six years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian Television Authority report showed that all the 11
presidential candidates signed the documents in Monrovia, capital
of Liberia, to kick off their election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The three former warlords, Charles Taylor of the National
Patriotic Party, Alhaji Kromah of the All Liberia Coalition Party
and George Boley of the National Democratic Party, are among the
presidential racers.
</P>
<P>
The election, slated for July 19, will produce a president, a
vice-president and a 90-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said preparations for the election were not
sufficient as voters' education had not begun even in Monrovia
and polling centers had yet to be named, while the electoral
commission had not got enough money to do its work.
</P>
<P>
However, as the campaign has begun, Liberians surviving the
six-year fraternal killing that claimed the lives of more than
200,000 people and left more others homeless will have a taste of
ballot.

CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mideast peace process will
dominate the summit between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his French counterpart Jacques Chirac in Paris Thursday, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
The summit during the visit of Mubarak to France is part of the
coordination and consultations held by the two leaders on
salvaging the Mideast peace process and exploring ways to bolster
the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and bilateral relations, said
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat lamented that a gap still exists
between the Palestinians and Israelis but said that Egyptian
efforts are under way to change the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked for three
months since Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also criticized the recent U.S. Congress resolution
recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's "undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and has claimed the city
as its undivided capital while the Palestinians also want
Jerusalem as their future capital.

<HEADLINE> Mahatir Calls for Israel-Arab Good-Neighborliness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahatir Mohammed today called for "good-neighborliness and
sincerity" between Israel and surrounding Arab states, stressing
that violence is not a solution to Israel's security problems.
</P>
<P>
Mahatir, who arrived here this afternoon as the first Malaysian
premier ever to visit Lebanon, made the remark while addressing a
dinner held by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in his honor.
</P>
<P>
Mahatir said that any country that forcibly takes over land
and properties belonging to others and destroys other people's
homes in order to impose its own settlements "can not be said
sincere in seeking peace."
</P>
<P>
Yet Israel tries to justify its aggressive actions by accusing
its Arab neighbors of threatening to retaliate, "if others can
not retaliate or even can not threaten to retaliate, then all
aggressions must be condoned," the Malaysian premier noted.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of world we will create, if aggression, and
disregard for world opinion, is considered as right?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must learn to reject violence as solution for its

</P>
<P>
"Violence is not the solution," he underlined, "Good
neighborliness and sincerity are."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's sympathy with Lebanon, whose
one-tenth territory has been occupied by Israel since 1978, and
support for U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for
an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The current Israeli government must also honor commitments
made by its preceding government," he said, and asked if a new
government ignores all the promises made by its predecessors, "how
do we conduct international relations?"
</P>
<P>
"Peace can only come about with sacrifice." he added.
</P>
<P>
"No one, Arab, Palestinian or Muslim, regards Jews as his
eternal enemy. What Israel is required is a change in the current
Israeli government's mind-set which condemns Muslims and Arabs as
their eternal enemy. This mind-set prevents any progress towards
peace," Mahatir said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day official visit, the Malaysian prime
minister will hold meetings with his Lebanese counterpart Hariri,
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and
other ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Down for Third Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
dropped by 4.8 percent in May, the third straight month of
decline, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.40 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, down from 1.47 million in April.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since January-March of 1995 that the
starts have fallen for three consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, the housing starts in the U.S. were 3.3
percent fewer than the first five months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that single-family starts, about 80 percent of
new construction, were down 2.5 percent, the third straight
decline.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartments and condominiums fell 12.2 percent
after advancing 4.5 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts in the West rose by 5.2 percent and
were flat in the Midwest. They fell by 11.3 percent in the South
and 8.1 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
activity, inched up 0.1 percent in May after falling 1 percent a
month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Recent signs showed that the U.S. housing market will remain
strong in the second half of the year because of favorable weather
and lower borrowing costs. The U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. said that 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.93
percent in May, compared with the high rate of 8.32 percent last
June.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Journalists boycotted here today
a press conference of the visiting British Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett in protest against the "unfair"
attitude of the British High Commission's security staff.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit to
Pakistan, is scheduled to talk to the press at 5 p.m. today at the
commission.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen journalists from leading local publications and
foreign news agencies were kept waiting for 15 to 20 minutes
outside the commission in the sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
Today's outdoor temperature was above 40 degrees Celsius,
according to weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The journalists who tried in vain to persuade the security
guards to open the iron gate eventually got angry and decided to
boycott the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Most of the journalists complained to a commission official,
who came to the spot at 5:05 p.m. to ask them in, that it is the
routine practice of the security staff to keep reporters waiting
on the pretext of some security reasons.

ALGIERS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's shore is facing a threat
of pollution as oil leaked in the port city of Sakikda, some 500
kilometers east of the capital city of Algiers, approaches.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources disclosed today that the leakage took

meters, was discharged. The petroleum was carried away by 18 oil
tanker-trucks.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today ended their consultations on
the development of bilateral relations, which started Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the consultations
further coordinated a draft interstate treaty to replace the
former treaty signed by leaders of the Soviet Union and the DPRK
in 1961.
</P>
<P>
The two-day consultations focused on five major projects, that
is, cooperation in oil refining, the use of the Rajin port by
Russian vessels, joint investments in the Rajin-Sonbong free
economic zone, development of a coke field in Yakutia, and
cooperation at a metallurgical plant built with participation of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that another round of negotiations to
coordinate the draft text is still needed and is expected to take
place in the second half of this year in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to hold the second meeting of the
bilateral intergovernmental commission on trade, economic,
scientific and technical cooperation in Moscow in fall.
</P>
<P>
Visiting here, Lee In Koo, deputy foreign minister of the DPRK,
met with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov Monday and
passed over to the Russian minister a message from DPRK
Vice-Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam. Lee In Koo
also invited Primakov to visit Pyongyang.

<HEADLINE> Rita Fan Shrugs Off Boycott of Swearing-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Rita Fan, president of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, today shrugged off some western countries'
threat to boycott the swearing-in of the interim legislature.
</P>
<P>
"They have the right not to be there. The PLC works for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and doesn't work
for the government of any foreign country," said Rita Fan at the
fourth of a series of news conferences organized by the Foreign
Correspondents' Club for journalists who have come to the city for
coverage of the handover.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said that they would not attend the
swearing-in ceremony of the PLC on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't even try to imagine or interpret the action," said
the PLC president. She said there are various political
considerations behind the boycott threat.
</P>
<P>
"Does it really matter to me that other people thousands of
miles away have misunderstanding of what we're doing here? It
really doesn't matter," she said.
</P>
<P>
The PLC president explained why the interim legislature came
into being. "Establishment of the PLC is not the best option, but
it is the best option in a situation that was not created by us."
</P>
<P>
Since the current Legislative Council produced under Chris
Patten's political reform package in violation of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration has to stop functioning by June 30, 1997, it is
necessary to set up a law-making body to avoid a legal vacuum
right after the establishment of the HKSAR. As an interim
arrangement, the PLC only enacts laws that are absolutely
indispensable to the HKSAR and will not extend beyond June 30,
1998, she said.
</P>
<P>
In response to media misunderstanding of the PLC, she said:
"The best way to judge a person, an organization, a government or
a country is to judge them after the event."
</P>
<P>
So far the PLC has passed three readings on nine bills and
endorsed three motions. "These bills have no legal effect until
July 1," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the coming Saturday, the PLC will hold its last meeting in
Shenzhen, south China, before Hong Kong's handover. Four more
bills are expected to pass the third reading, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of July 1 after the swearing-in ceremony,
the legislative body is going to have three readings of the
Reunification Act -- an arrangement to reaffirm all the previously
endorsed 13 bills before they become law.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the Reunification Act has not yet been made
public, but Fan expected that the Chief Executive's Office will
publish the draft in a day or two.

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Song Jian said
here today that effective measure should be taken to ensure that
by the year's end, industrial enterprises along the Huaihe River

<P>
Song, also head of the Environmental Protection Committee of

the task will be difficult.
</P>

Over the past two years, some departments under the State
Council and local governments of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and
Shandong provinces have exerted great efforts to control and
prevent pollution in the Huaihe River valley, Song said.
</P>
<P>
And local governments have raised funds and enacted regulations
to clamp down on some polluting enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He called on local officials to do more to urge industrial
enterprises to be conscientious in treatment of wastewater, so
that it can meet national standards.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises which cannot meet the standards as scheduled
must be shut down, Song noted.

desertification is threatening nearly 70 percent of Ethiopia's
land.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting held to commemorate the World
Desertification Day here, Christian Lehembre said Ethiopia is one
of the countries in which desertification threatens the lives of
millions of people and constrains the ability of the country to
develop a healthy agricultural and natural resources base.
</P>
<P>
Lehembre said drought is another major problem in Ethiopia
and recurs every 7-8 years causing famine and loss of human and
animal lives.
</P>
<P>
There is sufficient evidence that the highest incidence of
poverty occurs in drylands, he said, adding that the world day to
combat desertification is an opportune occasion to call for and
encourage the work that is required on a sustained basis at many
levels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, General Manager of Environmental
Protection Authority of Ethiopia Tewolde Berhan Gebre-Egziabher said
Ethiopia has already approved a countrywide conservation strategy
whose main focus is combating land degradation.
</P>
<P>
He said a national steering committee has been created consisting
of representatives of the Environmental Protection Authority, several
relevant ministries, non-governmental organizations, higher
educational and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, about 900 million people
across the world suffer from desertification related problems, of
whom 80 percent live in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, one third of the population suffers from this
problem, while three fourth of the people of the member countries
of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) are
facing the problem.
</P>
<P>
The World Desertification Day was established following the
agreement on the United Nations convention to combat
desertification in 1994. enditem

SHENYANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 Chinese and foreign
businessmen will discuss issues related to economic and
technological cooperation during an international trade fair that

administration department.
</P>
<P>
The zone was established in the capital of northeast China's

and regions have made a total of 2.48 billion US dollars in
contracted investment in 552 projects.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, these projects are expected to create 39.8
billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) in output value, and earn

<HEADLINE> Round-up: US Increases Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will soon announce an aid
package of 100 million U.S. dollars to Jordan in addition to the
300 million dollar military assistance pledged by the Clinton
administration, the semi-official daily Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, now in the U.S. on an official
visit, on Monday met Vice President Al Gore, who assured him that
"the 100 million additional aid package was American money - an
American concern," the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
However, when addressing the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy Monday, Hassan said that "it is coincidental that 100
million dollars (which the U.S. Congress allocated to move its
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem) is almost equivalent
to the sum total of the aid package promised to Jordan, which of
course will not go down well at home."
</P>
<P>
According to local Arabic newspapers, both sides still have
differences as to what form the aid will take. The U.S. wants to
provide Jordan with 100 million dollars worth of equipment and
projects, whereas Jordan wants the aid in cash.
</P>
<P>
The differences are expected to be settled during Hassan's
current visit to the U.S., the papers said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever form it will take, equipment and projects or cash, the
aid package can without doubt contribute to the kingdom, which is
suffering from decreased foreign aid, reduced expatriates'
remittances and in effect an economy in recession.
</P>
<P>
Local financial markets have seemed encouraged and registered
sharp increases in trading volume on the news reports that the 100
million dollars is on the way and King Hussein won 60 million and
9 million dollars in grants from France and the Netherlands
respectively during his current European trip.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming money will help stabilize the kingdom, which
enjoys political importance because, among others, of its
geographical location and its efforts to bring the peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the U.S. aid will help secure its own interests in
the Middle East region.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wheat Output to Drop, Others to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wheat output is
projected to drop in the coming year while outputs of wool, sugar,
meat and dairy products are expected to rise, according to an
official forecast released today.
</P>
<P>
Australia's wheat production would plummet by nearly a third in
the 1997/98 fiscal year (July 1, 1997-June 30, 1998) to 16.25
million tons, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) said in its June quarter Commodities outlook.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the outlook for Australian wool growers has
improved, with boosted demand, production and prices expected in
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said demand would rise in 1997-98 as a result of higher
economic growth in key wool-consuming countries, such as the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"This higher demand, coupled with little change in Australian
supply to the market, is forecast to result in an increase in the
eastern market indicator to average 650 Australian cents each kg
for the year," it said .
</P>
<P>
Australia's total wool production would rise to 688 kilotons in
1997/98 compared to the expected 682 kt the current financial year
ending June 30 and 697 kt in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
It said abundant water and ideal weather conditions contributed
to a forecast record cotton production for 1996/1997.
</P>
<P>
"Harvesting is nearing completion and production is estimated
to be 2.7 million bales, eclipsing the previous record of 2.2
million bales set in 1991/92," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
"The volume of exports increased in 1996/97 and is forecast to
rise again in 1997/98."
</P>
<P>
"The value of exports in both years is forecast to exceed 750
million US dollars."
</P>
<P>
The bureau said sugar production is tipped to rise from 4.9
million tons in 1995/96 to 5.4 million tons in 1996/97 and 5.6
million tons in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the widespread destruction to the crop caused by
Cyclone Justin (earlier this year), Australian sugar production is
forecast to increase in 1997/98 from an increased harvest area".
</P>
<P>
The bureau said total beef and veal production was seen rising
to 1.73 million tons in the coming financial year compared to 1.66
million tons in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
Australian meat producers could expect higher returns in
1997/98 as production by the main competitor, the United States,
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Australian milk production was forecast to rise 3.8 percent in
1997/98, following an estimated 3.3 percent increase in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
But ARABE warned the prospect of poor pasture conditions in
1997/98 would hit milk output.
</P>
<P>
Strong international demand was expected to push Australia's
dairy export earnings up by almost 13 percent in 1997/98 to 1.42
billion US dollars from 1.27 billion US dollars from the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Hails New EU Budget Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
hailed the budget stability pact reached Monday at the European
Union (EU) summit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, saying "there are
no losers" from the compromised result, a German newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The budget pact, designed to reinforce the credibility of the
planned single European currency which is scheduled to be launched
in 1999, was endorsed on the first day of the EU leaders' two-day
negotiations on a new EU treaty to modernize the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with the German daily General Anzeiger, Waigel,
a main backer of the stability pact, said he was happy that there
had been no changes to the pact, which would create the conditions
for the 1999 launching of the single currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist government eventually dropped its
resistance to the deal after other EU leaders agreed to couple it
with a resolution promising fresh efforts to combat unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact, aimed to ensure an Euro as strong as the
German mark, foresees huge fines for members joining the single
currency if they have budget deficits above 3 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
While noting that Germany did make efforts to take into
consideration the French concerns over employment, Waigel said
that what has been agreed upon in Amsterdam on the job issue was a
compromise which did not include binding commitments.
</P>
<P>
The job resolution fell short of France's demand to use the
excess reserves of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the
European Coal and Steel Community to fund new European employment
programs, and merely called on the EIB to consider new lending
possibilities, including a venture-capital fund for high-tech
industries and loans for education, health, the environment and
urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said the resolution conformed to the German position and
job creation remains a national responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"There will be stronger coordination of the national measures
(on job creation). But there will be no new spending and
responsibility for the EU," Waigel said.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that Germany would not pump additional money
into new European job programs.

<HEADLINE> 2 Soldiers Killed in Rebel Attack in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers were killed and five
others wounded today in a clash between the Philippine government
forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Citing a military report, the Philippine Television reported
that the clash took place this morning in Carmen Town, North
Cotabato Province, in central Mindanao when a group of rebels
attacked an army patrol.
</P>
<P>
The military expected a higher casualty number on the rebel
side and additional troops have been rushed to Carmen and other
parts of the province, the television report said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the former larger Muslim
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which
already signed a peace deal with the government last September.
</P>
<P>
The government has been seeking to forge a similar deal with
the MILF, which is currently the strongest anti-government group
in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began their initial peace talks early this year,
but the peace process has been stalled because of sporadic
fighting between the two sides.

AMSTERDAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders today
condemned the killing of two Northern Irish policemen by the Irish
Republic Army (IRA) on Monday and extended their sympathy to the
victims' families.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union heads of state and government meeting in
Amsterdam have heard with horror of the murder of two policemen by
the provisional IRA in Northern Ireland...," the leaders said in a
statement which was issued at their two-day summit here.
</P>
<P>
"They condemn this callous act of terrorism and extend their
deepest sympathy to the families of the victims," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Two Northern Ireland policemen were killed Monday near Belfast,
capital of Northern Ireland. The IRA, who has been fighting for
an end to British rule over Northern Ireland in the past 28 years,
immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair today repeated his
condemnation of the IRA, saying that the ambush was designed to
derail peace efforts. On Monday after the killing, he ruled out
any fresh meeting between government officials and the IRA's
political wing, Sinn Fein.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government will lodge
protest to the United Nations over the fresh violations of its
airspace and territorial waters by Turkish aircraft and navy
vessels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here today, Government
Spokesman Manolis Chistofides said 16 Turkish F-16 fighter
aircraft violated Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR) on June
15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed the earlier reports on the presence of
Turkish navy vessels in the ports of the Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish Cypriot press today, a total of nine
Turkish navy vessels have dropped anchor in the ports of
Turkish-occupied Kyrenia and Famagusta, on the island's northern
and the eastern coasts.
</P>
<P>
Among them, two Turkish frigates, two submarines and one
destroyer have docked in Famagusta port. In Kyrenia harbor,
there are three missile boats and one submarine. Their presence
was also confirmed by the Cypriot Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Turkish vessels have docked in the
two ports after taking part in the Turkish seaborne military
exercise "Sea Wolf '97" and will remain there until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Government Spokesman noted that official protests will be
lodged with the United Nations for all violations.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the Greek
Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when
Turkish troops occupied its northern third in the wake of a
short-lived pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the division of the island, the Turkish
Cypriot side established a breakaway state "The Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus", which is recognized only by Turkey.

ROME, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic gold medalist Hassiba
Boulmerka pulled out of the 13th Mediterranean Games in Bari,
Italy on Tuesday after injuring her leg in training, according to
reports from Bari.
</P>
<P>
Amar Brahmia, head of the Algerian delegation, said: "She has a
problem with her leg. She is in a training camp in Germany and her
doctor informed us. It's a recurring problem."
</P>
<P>
Boulmerka won a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics in
1992 but pulled out of the 1,500 meter finals at Atlanta last year
after a bad fall.
</P>
<P>
Dionisio Ciccarese, communications director of the
Mediterranean Games, said the poor turn-out of leading athletes
was because regional events were being hit by the bigger cash-rich
international meetings.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tight schedule running up to the world
championships in two months meant long-distance runners could not
be expected to also compete at Bari.
</P>

After the third day of competition in 27 sports, Italy led the
medal table with 20 golds. Turkey was in second place with 14
golds and France third with 12.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- France today described as
"insufficient" the nine-hour mediation meeting on the crisis of
the Republic of Congo held Monday in Libreville, Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"It could be difficult to be otherwise with so little time,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France encourages the international
mediation committee to continue making initiatives to help foster
rapprochement between the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
He said first measures to be taken by the Congolese should be
the arrangement of a cease-fire, which would "make up a solid
basis for the return of confidence."
</P>
<P>
Fighting began on June 5 when government troops surrounded the
home of former president Denis Sassou N'Guesso in a crackdown on
private militias and unauthorized arms in the runup to the July 27
election.
</P>
<P>
A number of African leaders, headed by Gabonese President Omar
Bongo, talked with the envoys of President Pascal Lissouba and
Sassou N'Guesso for nine hours to seek a solution to the crisis of
the country. But no agreements were reached.
</P>
<P>
Fighting resumed today in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville
between government troops and the "Cobras" militiamen of Sassou
N'Guesso, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Lissouba has made "a strident appeal to the French
people" to help him out, as French troops are leaving the country
after completing its "Pelican Operation" for evacuating foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Congo was a former colony of France.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily "La Croix," Lissouba
accused French President Jacques Chirac of "abandoning and
rejecting" him.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the French oil group Elf-Acquitaine, which
produces 80 percent of the oil products of Congo, for doing
nothing while his country was plunged into "blood and fire."
</P>
<P>
Followers of Sassou N'Guesso said today that Lissouba asked
France for help because he was "afraid of failing."
</P>
<P>
"When Mr Lissouba launched a strident appeal to French
soldiers... maybe he is unaware that there does not exist a
military agreement between France and Congo," said a radio serving
Sassou N'Guesso.

<HEADLINE> Two Accidents Claim 44 Lives in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 44 people were killed and 48
severally injured in two separate accidents in Iran, a press
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Hamshahri reported that the first accident
occurred near Eshtehard, some 70 kilometers west of the capital
city of Tehran, at 7 a.m. Monday morning. Some 35 passengers were
 killed and 41 people were injured as two buses collided.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an eyewitness, the daily said that both bus drivers
were killed on the spot. He added that the accident occurred as
one of the buses tried to overtake a vehicle on the road without
observing the traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the injured were in critical
condition and warned that the casualties may rise. The injured
are hospitalized in Tehran and Karaj, a city some 46 kilometers
west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The second accident occurred in southwestern Iran near
Afghanistan border, some 80 kilometers south of the border city of
Zabol, on Sunday, according to the Persian daily Jomhuri Islami.
</P>
<P>
Nine people were killed and seven injured as the driver
of Toyota pickup truck who had fallen asleep veered to the
left side of the road and collided with a bus.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been taken to hospitals in Zabol and
Zahedan, provincial capital of Sistan and Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
In a move to check accidents and lower the casualties resulting
from collisions, Iranian authorities have announced that starting
June 22, the fines for major traffic violations including illegal
speeding and violating the lane that belongs to the incoming
traffic will be increased by 500 percent.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Remains Top Cash Earner in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's agriculture recorded a
four-percent growth rate last year, the third consecutive year
for increase, with tea production jumping to the number one in the
world for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The rise is due to the stability of the economy, coupled with
better output of coffee, tea, sugarcane, wheat and horticultural
produce, said the official 1996 Economic Survey.
</P>
<P>
Coffee yield shoot up by 7.7 percent from 95,800 tons in 1995
to 103,200 tons last year, the Daily Nation newspaper quoted the
survey as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production went up by five percent from 128,600 tons in
1995 to 135,000 tons in 1996. However, the yield fell below the
domestic requirement, entailing the importation of 485,000 tons
during the year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of fresh horticultural produce mounted by 18 percent
from 71,800 tons in 1995 to 84,800 tons last year, earning the
country a total of 7.7 billion Shillings (142.6 million U.S.
Dollars) in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Cut flower exports recorded a 20-percent increase in 1996
compared with 1995. Export of mangos to the Middle East almost
doubled to 4,245 tons last year as a result of better farming
methods.
</P>
<P>
The major handicaps to horticultural development remains the
supply of high quality seeds, especially beans, slow added value
tax refunds and poor infrastructure, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of maize and beans dropped because of
poor rains, driving market prices up. enditem

of African Ministers of Information in 1999, according to a
decision adopted at the 8th session of the ministers' meeting
which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 24 African information ministers and a dozen of
chief delegates to the inaugural session unanimously approved
Libya's request to host the forthcoming conference.
</P>
<P>
The request was forwarded by Libyan Secretary of Information
Fawziya Shalaby.
</P>
<P>
During the ministers' first working session held closed-door
this morning, a number of topics tabled on the agenda was
endorsed, including the reports on African media and information
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the participants stressed the importance of holding
bi-annual meetings especially that the "current unstable
conditions in the continent require continued consultations among
the African information ministers."
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions at the previous meeting in Cape Town,
South Africa in 1995 that the conference should be held every four
years, instead of two years.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, chairman of the
conference, asserted in his inaugural address the importance of
keeping abreast of rapid technological development to establish a
African T.V. and radio channel as well a communication system.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on setting up regional information and
communication ventures and tackling challenges facing the African
development will top the agenda of the African information
ministers in their three-day meetings.

<HEADLINE> China Marks World Day to Combat Desertification, Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of tourists gathered
today at the Badaling section of the Great Wall to mark the third
UN-designated World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the National Greening Committee, the Ministry of
Forestry and the Beijing Municipal People's Government were
present.
</P>
<P>
Similar activities have been held for the past month in other
major cities in China, involving about 1.1 million people across
the country, according to the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang said "We hope this will help
spread the knowledge of desertification among Chinese citizens
and raise public awareness about the need to combat
desertification.
</P>
<P>
A 1,997-meter long scroll with more than one million signatures
of Chinese people will be sent to the UN conference on fighting
desertification, scheduled for September, according to the
Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that 27.3 percent of China's total land
suffers from desertification, and the area of desertified land is
spreading by 2,460 sq km yearly.
</P>
<P>
To hasten the desertification efforts, China has initiated a
series of ecological improvement plans, such as the "Three Norths"
shelterbelt systems project, the world's largest ecological
endeavor, which covers the north, northeast and northwest, Xu told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, the first and second phases of the "Three Norths"
project were successfully completed and the third phase begun, Xu
said, adding that the project has increased the forest coverage in
the three northern areas from 5.05 percent 20 years ago to the
present nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"A 'green wall' has been basically formed in this area, putting
20 percent of the sandy land in the area under control," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in addition to the recently-released
national report on desertification, China is now working on its
first law to combat desertification.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Gives Final Push for New Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- European Leaders, having put a
rift over the single currency behind them, are trying on Tuesday
at the Amsterdam summit to give a final push to conclude a new
treaty to prepare the 15-nation bloc for the next century.
</P>
<P>
After the talks of the heads of states and governments on
Monday, officials said most of the new treaty was already agreed
but major sticking points remained over such sensitive issues as
foreign and defense policy and EU's institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There is broad agreement on many issues but unanimity on
none," Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told reporters,
"There are some important questions still unresolved."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the leaders have defused the tension between France
and Germany, the major engine behind the European integration, on
the single currency by reaching a compromise in which Germany gets
guarantees that strict budget rules will be maintained and France
gets a non-binding pledge to fight unemployment.
</P>
<P>
On the treaty talks, some EU sources said that the
negotiations held during a dinner on Monday night "went pretty
badly."
</P>
<P>
A draft treaty prepared by the Dutch EU presidency and now
being under discussion by the EU leaders, is the culmination of 15
months of negotiations, formally dubbed the Inter-governmental
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The modest text seems to have dashed the high hopes expressed
earlier on in the Treaty renegotiating process.
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be watered down by adding to it a series of opt
outs and protocols.
</P>
<P>
On institutional reforms, Britain, France and Germany want to
enhance their influence within the Union, but the Dutch draft
treaty, bowing to the pressure of small states, more or less puts
off any reform to the EU and its institutions until the next wave
of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign policy issue, six countries -- France, Germany,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and Spain -- have called for the
incorporation into the Treaty of the objective of an eventual
merger of the European defense club the Western Union into the EU
and the introduction of a Protocol defining the stages of and
strategy for this merger.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch text merely alluded to the Protocol, because Britain,
supported by the "neutral" member states, is opposed to the idea.

<HEADLINE> 60 Iraqi Kurds Arrested for illegal Entry in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities said that they
have arrested 60 Iraqi Kurds in western and southern Iran after
they entered illegally in search of jobs and economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Kar-O-Karegar today quoted security sources as
saying that the Iraqi Kurds were from the Sulaymaniyah city in
Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi Kurds were caught in such Iranian cities as
Zahedan, Salmas, Bonab, Divandarreh, Sanandaj, Saqqez and Qeshm
Island in the Persian Gulf," the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that those who were arrested admitted that
they entered Iranian territory to find jobs because of
economic hardships and the unstable political situation in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The daily reported that those arrested were deported back
to Iraq after going through the legal steps here in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting between pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) and pro-Baghdad Kurdistan's Democratic Party (KDP)
has destabilized the economy in Iraqi Kurdistan, forcing many of
the Kurdish youth to seek employment in other neighboring countries
including Iran.

<HEADLINE> China, Australia Sign Documents on Cattle Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia signed here
today two quarantine documents concerning China's import of
Australia's live cattle, other animals and their products, which
could open a new market for Australia's beef producers.
</P>
<P>
The two documents include a protocol on quarantine and
sanitation conditions of Australia's live cattle and a memorandum
of understanding on anthrax quarantine of Australia's animals and
their products to be exported to China.
</P>
<P>
The two documents were signed this afternoon by Wang Dahai,
director of the Plant and Animal Quarantine Bureau as
representative of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, and Paul
Barrantt, director of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service
as representative of the Primary Industries and Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the protocol is the first of its kind China has
signed with a foreign country on large-scale import of live
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum involves such animals as cattle, sheep, horses
and pigs.
</P>
<P>
Australia's national newspaper The Australian said today that
the deal is seen by the beef industry as an important step toward
removing long-standing Chinese concerns about disease in
Australian cattle, especially the blue tongue disease in northern
Australia, and could open a new live-cattle market for embattled
beef producers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the deal is likely to see up to 60,000 head of
Australian cattle shipped to China "in the near future."

<HEADLINE> Britain Satisfied With Treaty Enabling Border Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
satisfied that the new Amsterdam Treaty leaves certain member
states of the European Union (EU) to exercise control of their
borders, British officials said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are allowed to keep doing what we want in this field,"
officials said, "We have reached an agreement on this."
</P>
<P>
EU leaders are holding a summit in Amsterdam to try to work out
a new treaty for bloc in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Border control is one of the key issues in the rewrite of the
EU treaty designed to prepare the bloc for new member states from
the east.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly stated that
there would be no surrender of control over Britain's borders,
mainly involving immigration and rights of asylum.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Blair remains opposed to the incorporation
of the Western European Union (WEU), Europe's fledgling defense
arm, into the EU, fearing that the WEU may undermine the position
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The idea of gradual EU-WEU merger, supported by some EU states
including France and Germany, is also resisted by EU's five
neutral nations which do not wish to get involved in large
international military operations.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 15 EU states except Austria, Denmark, Finland,
Ireland and Sweden, are WEU members.

<HEADLINE> US Assures Commitment to Gulf Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said his country will continue to commit itself to Gulf
security by maintaining a strong military presence in the region
to face what he called threats from Iran and Iraq, according to
news reaching here today from Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed our commitment to maintaining the region's
security and we will continue to keep strong and enough military
capabilities." the Bahraini news agency quoted Cohen as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in Bahrain this morning before his
departure for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cohen said the
military capabilities are able to "protect our warships and
interests" of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that all of the countries in the region are currently
reliant on the U.S. presence with around 20,000 troops deployed
there for their security arrangements, and he expected these
countries would be able to contribute to the security in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops will remain in the region so as to strengthen
its relations with its Gulf allies, and his country will honor its
long-term commitment to the region's security, Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some Gulf countries are seeking to develop
their defense system by upgrading and purchasing advanced weapons
that U.S. troops possess. U.S. supports the desire, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the military of the Gulf states will work shoulder to
shoulder with the U.S. troops in the future.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Bahrain Monday, the third leg of his first
tour of Gulf region as defense secretary. He had visited Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and would travel to the UAE and Oman, before
flying home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran and Iraq, the U.S. official said that his
country still regards the two as threats to the region, and
Washington will continue to pursue tough policies towards them.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Iran and Iraq are still "violating international
rules and regulations," and refuse "obedience to U.N. decisions
and store weapons of massive destruction" has clearly shown that
they are threatening peace and stability in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Iran of continuing to support international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still endorses the policy to maintain the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad complies with all the U.N.
resolutions adopted during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis and the
collapse of the rule by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen explained that the recent U.S. Congress resolution
justifying Jerusalem as Israel's "undivided capital" was not the
opinion of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed the non-binding resolution
Tuesday and set aside 100 Million dollars to move the U.S. embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This sparked criticism from the Arab
world and renewed violence in the occupied Arab lands.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Rein On Extra-Budgetary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China will step up its annual
review of extra-budgetary funds this year to standardize their
management, a senior financial official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official examination of extra-budgetary funds between early
June and late August this year has got off to a good start in
some provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, according
to Jin Lianshu, a Ministry of Finance official in charge of the
check-up.
</P>
<P>
Jin said this year's examination of extra-budgetary funds will
focus primarily on units in the public security sector, in
industrial and commercial administration and in the system for
civil affairs administration.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aimed at establishing and improving the
management system of extra-budgetary funds and tightening
supervision over the collecting and spending of such funds, Jin
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's examination of extra-budgetary funds was highly
successful, uncovering 34.5 billion yuan of wrongly collected
funds and 10.2 billion yuan of wrongly spent funds, and checking
corruption by penalizing officials caught in illegal activities
involving extra-budgetary funds, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
But problems still remain in the funds' management, which calls
for this year's review to come up with the answers, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 check-up will mainly deal with problems such as
illegal charging of fees, unauthorized funds, mismanagement of
extra-budgetary funds, and illegal spending of the funds, Jin
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri today termed the recent U.S. Congress resolution
recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital as "a scandal and a
conspiracy against Islamic states."
</P>
<P>
The hardline speaker made the remarks at a meeting with
members of the central council of the Association of the Islamic
Coalition, the state-run Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
On June 10, the U.S. Congress voted 406 for and 17 against, to
transfer the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The
Congress also adopted a decision recognizing Jerusalem as
Israel's "undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress move, though non-binding, has in the past
week invited condemnation by Iranian officials and local press, as
well as by the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Sunday told
reporters that the U.S. Congress resolution showed that the
U.S. did not care about Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing Qods (Jerusalem) as the capital of the Israeli
regime is a sign of snubbing the Muslim world and shows the unjust
positions of the United States," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Propagation Organization, the Association for the
Defense of Values of the Islamic Revolution and the Council on
Coordination of Islamic Propagation Monday issued statements
calling on Iranians to take part in anti-U.S. demonstrations
this Friday to protest against the U.S. Congress resolution.

<HEADLINE> Focus of the Lenses by Xu Xingtang, Chang Kefei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- It is hot here these days -- due
not only to the sweltering weather that makes reporters dripping
with sweat, but also the pre-handover atmosphere that has the
attention of the whole world focused on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With less than two weeks to go before Hong Kong's return to
China, more than 8,000 journalists who applied to cover the
historic occasion have been flying in from every corner of the
globe.
</P>
<P>
The world is keen to know what is going on in Hong Kong. What
will the reporters tell the world?
</P>
<P>
"The handover ceremony will be the top subject of our
coverage," said Fok Yit Wai, a reporter from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This is a common view held by nearly all the 700-plus media
organizations joining this media battle of the century. In fact,
all major events scheduled to take place between June 30 and July
1 will be of great interest, such as the handover ceremony, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region inauguration ceremony, the
July 1 meeting of the Hong Kong Provisional Legislative Council
and the British withdrawal ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the dominant scenario, every contender in the media
competition will focus on its own particular fields. "We'll pay
attention to common people's feelings and reactions about the
handover," said Fok Yit Wai. "Over 8,000 Singaporeans are working
in Hong Kong, and we are interested in their opinions about Hong
Kong's return to its motherland."
</P>
<P>
Chief Editor of AFP Hong Kong Bureau Richard Ingham said his
agency has an ambitious program of advance coverage, including
features and analyses of Hong Kong at the moment, and predictions
about what Hong Kong will be after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Toine Berbers from De Volkskrant, a major Dutch newspaper,
said: "During the handover, I will focus my attention on whether
China will stick to its 'one country, two systems' promise. I've
made many interviews and spoken to many people."
</P>
<P>
Commenting that all over the world places which were once
subjected to colonial rule have been returned to their peoples, he
said, "I think the handover of Hong Kong to China is only natural
and should have taken place much earlier. I hope it will go
smoothly because it is important both for Hong Kong and for
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
CNN International announced an ambitious plan for coverage of
the handover as early as in April, saying that it will present
in-depth analyses of the historic event in addition to live,
extensive coverage immediately preceding and following the
handover.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for CNN International said: "We try to cover the
handover in a comprehensive and global perspective, and explore
its impact and implications for Hong Kong, China, Asia and the
rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
The cable network has already broadcast a series of special
reports on Hong Kong, such as "Hong Kong one year and counting"
and "Hong Kong, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Goran Leijonhufvud, who has been living in Hong Kong since 1989
as a reporter for Sweden's largest morning daily Dagens Nyheter,
said his paper will invite a group of readers to Hong Kong at the
end of June to witness this historic moment.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not agree with the ideas of a Fortune magazine
cover story in 1995 entitled "Death of Hong Kong." "Ninety-five
percent of western reporters stationed in Hong Kong would say that
the argument is wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his eyes, most Hong Kong people are confident about their
future.
</P>
<P>
A phenomenon that should be noticed is that journalists from
western countries and those from Asian countries have quite
different stresses in their coverage.
</P>
<P>
AFP's Richard Ingham said it is a difference of ways to
interpret the same issues. A western reporter is likely to put
emphasis on freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and other
values and rights popular in the West, while a reporter from a
developing country tends to stress the fundamentals of human
progress and economic aspects.
</P>
<P>
"To a large extent, this disparity is related to cultural
background and economic development," he said, admitting that
there are people who come to Hong Kong with prejudices and fixed
ideas and who know nothing about the place and the people.
</P>
<P>
Kieu Tinh, who came to Hong Kong last year to open the Hong
Kong Office of Vietnam News Agency, said his major task was to
present an overall picture of Hong Kong to the Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
"I've interviewed civil servants and bankers, and talked with
people in the street, and I found that most of them believe Hong
Kong will have a bright future," he said. "Things here are quite
different from those depicted in some western reports."

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Palestinian-Israeli Gap Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that gap remained between the Palestinian and Israeli
sides despite intensive efforts to remove obstacles to resuming
the deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after President Hosni Mubarak reviewed the
latest developments of the Mideast peace process and discussed his
upcoming tour to France during a meeting held earlier today with
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, his political advisor Osama
el-Baz and Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a gap regarding the Middle East peace process
but Egyptian efforts are underway to change the situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked for three
months since Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent U.S. threat to block aid to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the Congress decision to
move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Moussa
described it as an unwise decision that contradicts the bases of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he added that it was counterbalanced by a U.S. State
Department statement Monday that reaffirmed the status of
Jerusalem is open to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's intensified diplomacy brokered the meeting in three
months between the Palestinian and Israeli negotiations in Cairo
on June 8 but failed to bring them together for a second round due
to big rifts upon the Jewish settlement issues.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to new substantive talks is the disagreement
over Israeli settlement activity, especially in Arab East
Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
"Some sort of continuity is required to deal with many problems
mainly the settlements issue," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt's latest contacts with the parties, Moussa and Baz met
with PNA Minister of Local Administration at Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa ruled out another imminent shuttle tour by Baz to bring closer
viewpoints of the Palestinians and Israelis and denied that Egypt
harbors any specific proposals to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he said freezing the construction of settlements for a
reasonable period would "help and go in line with resumption of
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian decision makers' meeting today came before Mubarak
meets with his French counterpart Jacques Chirac in Paris on
Thursday to discuss the European role in the peace process and the
settlements issue.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also begin a European tour on Wednesday to Rome,
Paris and London for talks on Egyptian efforts exerted on the
European scene to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A French draft prepared for the upcoming European Union summit
in Amsterdam declares the willingness of the EU along with the
U.S. and Egypt to help promote a resumption of talks between
Israel and the PNA.

<HEADLINE> Sensitive Index on BSE Market Gains 62.23 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market today gained 62.23 points to
4087.64 as against yesterday's close of 4025.41.
</P>
<P>
The National Index also shot up by 23.66 points to 1748.93 from
1725.27 previously.
</P>
<P>
The BSE market today made a recovery again after yesterday's
hesitancy with several front-line shares scoring impressive gains
in hectic activity on heavy speculative support and continued
purchases by foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Great Eastern Shipping recorded a sharp upswing on brisk buying
prompted by news that the company has recommended 30-percent
dividend following excellent performance in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
While some brokers attributed the buoyancy to the deferment of
a decision on the contentious issue of a hike in prices of
petroleum products till June 27, a few others said the market
would have witnessed a firm trend even the government had
announced the gas price hike Monday.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Biotechnology Gives Solutions to Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
today that solutions have been found to a number of problems
confronting the human race since biotechnology emerged in the
sphere of science.
</P>
<P>
"Biotechnology has provided solutions to problems like genetic
diseases, environmental pollution, destruction of biodiversity,
starvation and energy crisis," Soeharto said when opening a
biotechnology conference at the state palace.
</P>
<P>
He said history clearly points out how the human race has made
incredible progress through science and technology, particularly
in the field of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto added that although biotechnology provides
solutions to a number of problems, it can also cause disasters
when improperly implemented.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developing countries including Indonesia to
use science and technology to achieve people's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, however, we can see there is a wide gap between the
developing countries and the industrial states, which can control
modern technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
If such a gap could not be overcome, human beings will always
be subjected to unfair situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that developing countries should keep on narrowing
the gap using science and technology, through the United Nations
and other international and regional forums.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 local and 87 foreign experts from 16 countries or
regions are attending the conference which will last until June
19.
</P>
<P>
The head of the conference's organizer, Asril Darussamin, said
the meeting provides opportunity to experts to present their
findings and exchange information on the field of biotechnology.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Basic Law is Creative Law  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The formulation and promulgation of the Basic Law is of
historical importance. It has legalized the great concept of the
"one country, two systems", defined the basic system and basic
policies of the Hong Kong SAR and drawn a clear blueprint for
future Hong Kong. It serves as a fundamental legal guarantee for
the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, and is in the
fundamental interest of the entire Chinese people including the
Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The late leader Deng Xiaoping highly praised the drafting of
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, describing it as a law of
historical and international significance.
</P>
<P>
As for its historical significance, the Basic Law involves the
past, the present and the future. As for its international
significance, it is of long-term significance to not only the
third world, but also the entire mankind. It is a creative
masterpiece, he said.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the public opinions agreed that it was rare in
history that a county devoted such an enormous amount of manpower,
materials and funds to the careful formulation process of the
basic law.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, since its promulgation, the Basic Law has been
well received by all Hong Kong compatriots, and has won favorable
comments from the international community as well.
</P>
<P>
The drafting and formulating the Basic Law is a democratic
process, as can be seen from the composition of the drafting
committee. Of the committee's 59 members, 23, or well over one
third, were Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the stipulations, each article of the Basic Law is
subject to passing by a vote of two thirds of all committee
members. Should an article fail to be passed by a two-thirds
majority, it is subject to passing by a two-thirds majority after
being revised.
</P>
<P>
Every drafting committee member cast a total of 164 votes on
the foreword, 160 articles and the three appendixes of the Basic
Law. This is rare in the legislation of any other country.
</P>
<P>
The process of drafting and formulating the Basic Law is also a
successful practice in which the Hong Kong people became involved
in Hong Kong's transition. In the course of drafting the Basic
Law, the drafting committee held nine plenary meetings and
conducted two large-scale consulting activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Drafting committee members made 100 revisions of the draft
Basic Law. Half of the revisions were based on opinions expressed
by the Hong Kong residents and the opinions were collected by the
Consultancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News
Agency, said, "The drafting of the Basic Law made a good beginning
for the Hong Kong people to participate in regional affairs."

<HEADLINE> Meteorological Satellite Finds its Position in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists this morning
succeeded in positioning the Fengyun 2, a meteorological satellite
launched on June 10, over the equator at 105 degrees east
longitude.
</P>
<P>
Fengyun 2 will start its assigned mission after a period of
orbital examination and debugging.
</P>
<P>
The successful positioning at 10:20 Beijing time and future
operations of the satellite mark a milestone in China's
meteorological modernization drive, sources from the China
Aerospace Corporation (CAC) said.
</P>
<P>
The overall performance of Fengyun 2 has reached the
technological requirements set for satellites of its kind
developed in the 1990s, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Satellite Control Center, a CAC test team and marine
surveying ships have been tracking and controlling the satellite
for one week to ensure its proper positioning.
</P>
<P>
Fengyun 2 is the first meteorological satellite developed by
China that is in synchronous orbit with the earth. Covering about
100 million square kilometers of earth surface with China in the
central location, Fengyun 2 can provide meteorological information
such as cloud maps, temperatures, and wind movements over China
and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Weighing 1.38 tons, Fengyun 2 is equipped with a scanning
radiometer, a cloud coverage information system, and a data
collection translator. It will help improve medium- and long-term
weather forecasts and those for natural disasters in China.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese and Malaysian Premiers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed started his official activities on the second day of
his visit in Lebanon Tuesday with talks with Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri in the presence of senior officials from both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanon Radio said that the Lebanese-Malaysian
talks in the Beirut Governmental Palace "ended up this morning
with the political, economic and diplomatic relations between
the two countries being consolidated."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Hariri held a half-an-hour closed-door meeting
at the beginning, in which "they reviewed the bilateral
relations and completed what they had discussed during the
Lebanese premier's visit to Malaysia in 1995," the state-owned
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Then the two heads of government presided an enlarged meeting
which was attended by Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz and
other governmental ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with issues "to which the Malaysian side
expressed concern, including the dispatch of a Malaysian
ambassador to Lebanon and the establishment of a Malaysian
trade representative office in Beirut."
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysian side also expressed its interests in the
Lebanese projects of roads and civil air-navigation and an
enhancement of air communication between the two countries, in
addition to an activation of trade between them," the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement on the setup of an agency
for Malaysian-made cars in Lebanon to make Lebanon the center
for marketing Malaysian cars and other industrial products in
the region, the radio announced.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese officials briefed their Malaysian counterparts
the projects which Lebanon is executing as well as the country's
ambition, and "explained to the Malaysian side that they not
only want to obtain foreign investments, but also need to learn
Malaysia's experience in developing medium and light
industries," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Lebanese side also put forward the
possibility of establishing Malaysian-Lebanese joint ventures in
various sectors, especially in industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Following the meetings, the Malaysian premier inspected sites
of reconstruction projects in central Beirut and visited
SOLIDERE, a company which, as the brainchild of the billionaire
Prime Minister Hariri, is in charge of the rebuilding and
developing the commercial district in Beirut's downtown.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet he held in honor of the visiting Malaysian
premier Monday night, the Lebanese prime minister said his
government wants to encourage Malaysian businessmen to invest in
Lebanon's hotel sector and establish joint industrial projects
with Lebanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Hariri spoke highly of Malaysia's achievements in attaining
"the highest level of international competitiveness in trade,
industry and services" since Mahathir took office in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir believed that "Lebanon will rise again," noting that
"the remarkable recovery currently underway is a testimony of
Lebanon's indomitable spirit."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Monday afternoon for the first visit of
a Malaysian head of government to this country.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Deng Xiaoping's Contribution to Hong Kong's Return -- Xinhua Commentary (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During his meeting with guests from Hong Kong in June 1984, he
expounded the "one country, two systems" concept. When he met with
Britain's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
Geoffery Howe in July of the same year, he discussed five possible
situations that China did not want to see happen during the
transition period. But, he also pointed out that China would be
prepared for possible contingencies. His foresight in this was
later proven by the developments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Hong Kong and Macao compatriots attending
National Day celebrations in Beijing in October 1984, he discussed
his thoughts about the maintenance of prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In December of the same year, he again met with Prime Minister
Thatcher, who came to Beijing for the signing of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration. Earlier in 1982, he had stated that China would
only wait for one or two years before resuming its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong but this could not be put off
indefinitely. So, the two countries completed their talks on the
Hong Kong issue according to his timetable.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Deng Xiaoping paid special attention to the
drafting of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with members of the Drafting Committee for the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR who were attending its ninth
plenary session in February 1990, he praised the basic law as a
creative masterpiece with historical significance and profound
importance for humanity. He warmly thanked the committee members for
their work and congratulated them on the document.
</P>
<P>
Deng's penetrating theoretical exposition of the "one country,
two systems" principle and the guidelines and policies that he
formulated for resolving the Hong Kong issue are our powerful
weapons to accomplish the great cause of reunification of the
motherland as well as our invaluable spiritual wealth.

<P>
Showing his deep love for the Hong Kong compatriots, he
said: "We are convinced that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run it
well. The distrust of the Chinese people's ability to run Hong
Kong well is the mentality left over from old colonialism."
</P>
<P>
He stated that the Hong Kong people have the sense of pride of
the Chinese nation and should have the self-confidence to manage
Hong Kong well.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's past prosperity was achieved by Hong Kong
residents with Chinese as the main body," he said. "The wisdom of
the Chinese is no inferior to foreigners'. The Chinese are not
incapable. We must not always think that only foreigners can do a
good job and we must believe that we Chinese can also do as well on
our own."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong must be run by Hong Kong
residents with patriots as the main body and that others could
also be included.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng, the criteria for a patriot mean respect for
the nation, sincere support for the motherland's resumption of its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and refrainment from
damaging Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who meets these criteria is a patriot, whether he
believes in capitalism, feudalism, or slavery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's respect, trust and love of Hong Kong
compatriots and his bold political vision won the respect
of Hong Kong compatriots and benefited us greatly.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Deng Xiaoping's Contribution to Hong Kong' Return -- Xinhua Commentary (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Showing his deep concern for the reunification of the
motherland, Deng said: "China's reunification is the aspiration of
all the Chinese people"; "we are determined to achieve the
reunification that has not yet been done"; "the compatriots in the
mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as the overseas
Chinese are all offspring of the Chinese nation. We should strive
together for the reunification of the motherland and the
rejuvenation of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's outstanding contribution to the reunification
of the motherland will go down in history.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core will adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics. While attaching great importance to
economic development to strengthen the country, the Central
Committee will follow the "one country, two systems" principle,
exercise strong leadership in the return of Hong Kong despite all
kinds of interference, and make a tremendous contribution to
realizing the goal of transition, prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
We believe that, after this important step in the reunification
of the motherland, we will certainly be able to follow the
orientation set by Deng Xiaoping to solve the Taiwan question
appropriately, reunify the motherland completely, and create a new
turning point for the Chinese nation to live up to the
expectations of the great patriot, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and the
millions of martyrs who advanced wave upon wave for a unified
motherland and a powerful and prosperous nation from 1840 on.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Starts to Mark Special Bus Lanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Police Bureau
announced today it will open two-way lanes for buses only
beginning June 25 on Chang'an Avenue, the city's busiest downtown
thoroughfare which runs east-to-west for five kilometers.
</P>
<P>
This is just one step taken by the Chinese capital to solve the
problem of the city's traffic snarls.
</P>
<P>
The two-way lanes will be the first of their kind in China,
according to a notice issued by the Traffic Control Department of
the Police Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Each of the special bus lanes is at the far right lane of
traffic, and is marked with two lines of yellow dashes. Vehicles
other than buses and mini-buses which are approved by the police
departments are forbidden to enter these lanes.
</P>
<P>
Line-painting on the roads will be done after 10 p.m. when
traffic is light.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing's roads can't keep up with the
demand of the increasing number of motor vehicles. In 1993, there
were 27 traffic-jam prone sites in the city; now there are
99. Every day, more than 50 traffic jams occur on the main streets
alone.
</P>
<P>
To encourage passengers to commute via public transportation so
as to ease traffic jams, Beijing has already adopted several
measures for the convenience of buses and the public, such as
increasing the number of bus stops and allowing buses to pass
across other vehicle lanes except the farthest left lane -- the
fast lane.
</P>
<P>
According to police surveys, about 500 vehicles travel Chang'an
Avenue per hour, and more than 340,000 passengers per day.
</P>
<P>
"The special bus lanes on this avenue will help more of
Beijing's passengers enjoy the convenience and efficiency of
public transportation," a police official said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that after the opening of the special bus lanes,
bus speeds will be at least 15 percent faster.
</P>
<P>
Other such lanes are expected to be opened this year in other
major streets in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> 25 Killed in Ambush by MTA Splinter Group in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five civilians were killed
and five others wounded in an ambush last Friday laid by a
break-away group of the Khun Sa-led Mong Tai Army (MTA), a former
drug trafficking armed group in Myanmar, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Forty members of the MTA splinter faction, led by Khay Ngim,
ambushed a civilian convoy in Myanmar's eastern Shan state near
Tachilek, they said.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa and the majority of his MTA have unconditionally
surrendered to the Myanmar government in succession since January
1995, bringing the number of the surrendered to 14,949 by the end
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
There is still a handful of people from the MTA splinter group
who have not yet laid down their arms to the government.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Celebrity Praises "One Country, Two Systems" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ikuo Hirayama, president of
Japan-China Friendship Association, today spoke highly of China's
"one country, two systems" principle proposed by late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping for its great significance.
</P>
<P>
The principle is of great importance not only to China but also
to the whole world as it has set an example for countries which
could hardly resolve existing problems like the Hong Kong case
with only one system, Hirayama said in an interview with Xinhua at
his residence in Kamakura city, 45 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Hirayama described the principle as "a new truth" which is
unprecedented and reflects Deng's foresight and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
If it is successfully carried out, those countries will surely
follow suit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will retain its present
economic and social systems at least for the next 50 years after
its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
During the hour long interview, Hirayama also expressed his
belief that Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be
maintained after the handover, for "a prosperous and stable Hong
Kong is in the interest of China."
</P>
<P>
Hirayama, who is also a well-known Japanese painter, said Hong
Kong, as an important center of arts, will help promote China's
arts exchanges with the outside world as a "window" after its
return to China.
</P>
<P>
Hirayama, who has visited China more than 50 times, has been
invited to go to Hong Kong to attend commemorating ceremonies
there by the Chinese government as one of the three distinguished
Japanese guests together with former Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and Tomiichi Murayama.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Deng Xiaoping's Contribution To Hong Kong's Return -- Xinhua Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- As China's resumption of its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong approaches, the Chinese
people are filled with joy and inspiration in erasing the traces
of the 150-year disgrace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all countries around the world are following
the event closely. The smooth return is based on Deng Xiaoping's
"one country, two systems" principle, his concept for solving the
Hong Kong and Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
It was Deng who led the push for Hong Kong's return with
revolutionary courage and a realistic approach. Showing his deep
affection for Hong Kong, he said he wanted to live until 1997
so that he could see with his own eyes China's recovery of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Today, as the time approaches, we hail all the more this great
man of the 20th century and his legacy in Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
That return has followed a difficult and tortuous course. The
people of China never gave up its sovereignty over Hong Kong for
the past 150 years and more, and never recognized the unequal
treaties imposed by the imperialists and colonialists.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always regarded the imperialists'
occupation of Hong Kong by force as an enormous national
humiliation and they have firmly be convinced that Hong Kong would
return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Senior Legislator Stresses Economic Growth in Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator has
said that to boldly develop the economy and greatly improve the
people's life are a "magic weapon" for administering our nation
and making it stronger.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, made the remarks during an inspection
tour in central China's Hunan Province from June 15-17.
</P>
<P>
At this critical time with the turn of the century in sight,
"it is quite necessary for us to further broaden our minds, be
bolder in work and advance at a faster pace" to deepen the
country's reform and opening-up, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reform of state-owned enterprises, local
officials should go all out to boost the growth of share-holding
companies, non-state businesses, foreign-funded ventures and
tourism, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To carry forward the Communist Party's fundamental policies
for rural areas is key to the country's long-term stability, he
said, adding that in particular, the household contract system
will remain unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Deng Xiaoping's Contribution to Hong Kong's Return -- Xinhua Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the founding of New China, the return of Hong Kong was
only a national dream. Since the People's Republic of China was
founded, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it
would solve the Hong Kong issue at the right moment, but the issue
was repeatedly delayed because the time was not ripe both
internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, with the stable political situation and a thriving
economy, Deng Xiaoping made the bold decision to take back Hong
Kong in keeping with the nation's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, in a meeting with Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret
Thatcher, he firmly stated that in 1997 China would take Hong Kong
back and then pointed out: "It was under this premise that China
and Britain have started negotiations on ways and methods to solve
the Hong Kong issue."
</P>
<P>
Should China and Britain fail to reach accord, he said, "China
will reconsider the time and way to take Hong Kong back."
</P>
<P>
Today, we are deeply moved by Deng Xiaoping's patriotic
compassion and his firm stand on safeguarding China's sovereignty
and dignity as we are reviewing his remarks. Comrade Deng Xiaoping
was indeed a most ardent patriot and firmest national hero who
safeguarded our country's interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
"It is the Chinese nation's common aspiration to reunify the
motherland and it was a great invention of Comrade Deng Xiaoping
when he introduced the 'one country, two systems' concept for
peaceful reunification." Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said
this in his speech at the memorial service for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the Communist Party's experience, Deng Xiaoping
came up with this concept to solve the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
issues. It is an important part of his theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and has far-reaching
importance in solving similar historical problems in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the concept, China will practise socialism on the
major part of the country while allowing Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan to maintain their capitalist system for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Deng pointed out that this was developed in view of the reality
of both the historical and present situations for the purpose of
maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan and peacefully resolving the reunification of the
motherland in a peaceful and reasonable way that can be acceptable
to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
In developing this concept, Deng set a fine example in solving
practical problems with dialectical materialism and historical
materialism. As he himself repeatedly said, this concept provided
a way of solving other conflicts existing in the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore his invention is not only a monumental contribution
to the great cause of the reunification of the Chinese nation but
also represents his strategic thinking for solving remaining
historical problems and maintaining peace and stability around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
It is also a major contribution to humanity made by a great
statesman who loved peace and was deeply-concerned about human
destiny.

<HEADLINE> HK's Overall Labor Market Conditions Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's overall labor market
conditions remain generally stable in recent months, with both
unemployment and underemployment rates showing only marginal
change, a Hong Kong government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on the latest labor force
statistics released here today by Hong Kong's Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the period
February - April 1997 was 2.6 percent, and the underemployment
rate was 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the period March - May 1997, the provisional seasonably
adjusted unemployment rate was slightly lower, at 2.5 percent,
while the provisional underemployment rate was slightly higher, at
1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the decline in the unemployment rate
in the three-month period March - May 1997 was mainly concentrated
in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the other major sectors was generally stable.
As to the underemployment rate, slight increases occurred in the
construction and manufacturing sectors. The situation in the
other major sectors was likewise stable.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that labor demand remained
robust amidst steady growth in the economy. In the three months
ending April 1997, total employment continued to grow
significantly, by 3.9 percent over a year earlier, faster than the
growth of 3.1 percent in total labor force.
</P>
<P>
During the period February - April 1997, the number of
unemployed persons was estimated at 73,000, and the number of
underemployed persons at 37,300.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment and underemployment statistics were obtained
from a continuous General Household Survey, in which the
definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment
follow closely those recommended by the International Labor
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Being "seasonably adjusted" refers to the fact that
unemployment rate has been adjusted for seasonal variations in the
proportion of first-time job-seekers in the labor force.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Court Upholds Death Sentence on Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Appeal Court in
Malaysia's northern state of Pulau Pinang today upheld the death
sentence imposed on three Nigerians found guilty of trafficking in
612.3 grams of heroin seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Technician Adekunle Johnson Oshodi, 32, civil servant Tunde
Apatira and businessman Oladotun Lukmanu Umaru, both 35, were
charged with trafficking in 117.8 grams, 231.7 grams and 262.8
grams of the drug respectively, stuffed in 126 sausage-like
pallets and found in their stomachs when the trio were taken to
the Butterworth district hospital in the state on August 13, 1990.
</P>
<P>
They were sentenced to death by a high court in Pulau Pinang on
June 30, 1995, after they were found guilty under the Dangerous
Drugs Act 1952.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting their appeal against conviction and sentence, Appeal
Court Judge Shaik Daud Mohamed Ismail said today that the trial
judge had actually invoked the presumption (of possession and
knowledge) under Section 37A of the Dangerous Drugs Act in his
written judgment although he did not say so when delivering his
judgment, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are also unanimously satisfied that the judge had carefully
considered the facts and are of the opinion that the comments he
made (during the trial) were to assess the evidence and not to
create an adverse inference of the case," Shaik Daud was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> OAU Says Africa Must Stand up to Prejudiced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) today said Africa is increasingly falling prey to the power
of prejudiced propaganda, calling for Africa's awareness of the
importance of information.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the Eighth Conference of
African Ministers of Information here this morning, OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahamed Salim pointed out that Africa has been
getting "unfair treatment from the foreign media tycoons."
</P>
<P>
Africa is represented in biased coverage, distortion of news
and projection of woes and negatives, he complained.
</P>
<P>
"We are portrayed in a way as if Africa is the only domain of
catastrophes in the world," he complained.
</P>
<P>
"As much as we were warning at the beginning of the 1990's
against the political and economical marginalization of Africa
in the post cold war era, it should be emphasized today that the
communication marginalization is more serious and threatening," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the deplorable situation on Africa's poor
communication and telecommunication infrastructure, lack of
adequate links and network as well as its inability to afford the
modern information technologies.
</P>
<P>
Terming information as the "strongest and most viable component
to the development process," the African leader criticized some
African governments for removing information sector from the
priority list of the national development plans.
</P>
<P>
Failure to realize the importance of information means Africa
"would remain passive impotent and recipient" in the international
information arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief called upon the African nations to first
seriously put its disheveled information and communication house
in order.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent of all, he said, is to salvage the
financially-strapped Pan African News Agency (PANA), an
OAU-affiliated inter-governmental institution of news service, and
"give it a new orientation."
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, Board of Directors
of the Dakar-based PANA has proposed selling 25 percent of its
capital to national news agencies of African countries and offer
the rest for private interests.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on setting up regional information and
communication ventures and tackling challenges facing the African
development will top the agenda of the three-day meeting of the 24
African information ministers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government today
hosted a panel briefing on "Investment Opportunities in Hong Kong"
for local and overseas journalists covering the Hong Kong handover
event.
</P>
<P>
The briefing was chaired by Director-General of Industry
Francis Ho, Chairman of the Hong Kong American Chamber of Commerce
Douglas Henck, and Michael Enright, visiting professor of Business
Administration at the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Francis Ho noted that Hong Kong enjoys a
unique economic environment, which finds expression in low taxes,
a rule of law and a free flow of capital and information.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming historic return to China provides a good
opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its economy," he said. "I
believe that the government will not change its current hands-off
policy toward the economy after July 1."
</P>
<P>
Describing the Hong Kong economy as "one of the freest
economies in the world," Ho pointed out that Hong Kong has the
busiest shipping sector and the most significant stock market in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has also made great contributions to the
globalization process of the world economy," he added. "As the
gateway to the Chinese interior area, it is the most popular
location for foreign investment".
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, Hong Kong brought in over 100
billion US dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Professor Enright, who has been in Hong Kong for years to study
the competitiveness of the Hong Kong economy, said that Hong Kong
has become a control center for manufacturing and service
industries throughout Asia,
</P>
<P>
"The future of Hong Kong is quite bright, because it is in the
interest of both China and the international investors to keep the
economic independence of Hong Kong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that confidence has been expressed by both local and
overseas business communities, and many people who know Hong Kong
are placing their hopes on Hong Kong for the future.
</P>
<P>
Enright recently published a book titled "The Hong Kong
Advantage," in which he gave a detailed explanation to Hong Kong's
economic vitality and bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
According to Douglas Henck, Hong Kong possesses the first-class
civil service in the world, which has played a key role in its
economic success.
</P>
<P>
He said that the latest survey his chamber conducted among its
2,800 members showed that 95 percent of the respondents thought
that the business climate in Hong Kong would be "very favorable"
or "favorable" over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"This has shown that the majority of American businessmen here
are optimistic about Hong Kong's future as a business center after
the handover," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta to Form Economic Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen powerful Chinese cities
in the Yangtze River Delta area have joined together to form a
highly competitive economic community to prepare for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi,
Ningbo, Suzhou, and Changzhou, established an economic
coordinating association in May in Yangzhou city, in Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The mayors of these cities have agreed to increase regional
cooperation in tourism, the building of chain-stores, and economic
integration over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The 15 cities generated a GDP of more than one trillion yuan
last year, a sixth of the nation's total. That figure is expected
to rise to over two trillion yuan by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
As the country's most developed area, the 15-city economic belt
has attracted more than half the world's 500 largest
multinationals and provides more than 20 percent of China's
exports.
</P>
<P>
For mutual benefits, these city governments are making an
effort to eliminate various administrative barriers and economic
limitations between each other to improve resource distribution
and flow of key production elements.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Manage HK Well: Shi Hian Chen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Shi Hian Chen, vice chairman of
the Chinese Culture Promotion Society in Thailand, has expressed
the belief that the Chinese government will unswervingly implement
the principles and policies initiated by the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a Chinese-Thai, who is also president of Thailand's
Chinese Journalists Welfare Association, said Hong Kong will
certainly be better tomorrow, when Deng's principles of "one
China, two systems," high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong and
Hong Kong's existing systems remaining unchanged for 50 years are
carried out.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted endeavors of the entire Chinese nation,
Hong Kong will be administered well, letting those who have this
or that kind of misgivings at the moment be fully convinced," he
said in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can play an exemplary role, he noted, adding that if
Hong Kong is well administered, it will have a great, positive
impact on Taiwan's reunification with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said the overwhelming majority of the people of Chinese
origin are overjoyed at Hong Kong's return, regarding it as a
giant laudable step toward China's eventual unification.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese securities brokers in
Hong Kong tell the local media that they are full of confidence in
business prospects in Hong Kong after it returns to the embrace of
the motherland on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to concern over whether or not Taiwanese securities
companies in Hong Kong will be treated fairly after July 1,
Stanley Lai, head of the Taiwan Securities (HK) Co. Ltd., said he
is confident in Hong Kong's future and expects that Taiwanese
securities companies will receive fair treatment.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Lip, head of the Masterlink Securities (HK) Corp. Ltd.,
expresses the same opinion, adding, "Transactions handled by
Masterlink have not declined but recorded a sustained growth in
recent months."
</P>
<P>
The company has recently set up a branch in Shanghai to expand
business on the Chinese mainland and develop underwriting business
for local companies to be listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in recent months an increasing number of
Taiwan-based securities companies have come to Hong Kong to engage
in the underwriting business, leading to fiercer competition among
themselves and with other brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Hwang, managing director of the Taiwan International
Securities Ltd., says Hong Kong will maintain its status as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to develop in Hong Kong, he says, his company
will open a representative office in Beijing and Shanghai
respectively in the near future and expand regional operations via
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher On Resources, Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A lower Australian dollar boosted
the resources sector and a strong banking sector pushed the
Australian sharemarket to another record closing today.
</P>
<P>
"A weaker Australian dollar is helping all the resource
stocks," Intersuisse equities manager Andrew Sekely said, adding
that the improvement in the gold price overnight had also been a
contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that South African mining company Gencor Ltd. might
launch a 1.05 billion U.S. dollar takeover bid for nickel and
cobalt producer QNI Ltd. had also added value to the resources
sector, Sekely said.
</P>
<P>
QNI requested a trading suspension pending a board
announcement, fueling the takeover speculation. The bid would be
pitched at 3.4 Australian dollars (2.55 U.S. dollars) per share,
market players said.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries closed at another high of 2681.7, up 12.4
points, after reaching an intra-day high in early afternoon
trading of 2695.
</P>
<P>
BHP, the largest mining company in Australia, gained 40 cents
to 19.3 Australian dollars while Rio Tinto, another mining giant,
rose 58.7 cents to 23.195 Australian dollars and WMC 28 cents, or
3.39 percent, to 8.55 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, analysts said investors seeking higher
yields mainly in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and continued
speculation about further bank rationalization drove the share
prices higher in morning and early afternoon trading, only to
taper off near the close.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank gained 19 cents to 15.19 Australian dollars,
National Australia Bank 7 cents to 18.85 Australian dollars and
Westpac 9 cents to 7.79 Australian dollars, but ANZ dropped 15
cents to 9.7 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index closed 19.5 points higher at 1518.3
while the All Industrials Index increased 5.8 points to 4194.9.
</P>
<P>
The gold index closed down 9.6 points at 1529.1, with
Goldfields, Plutonic Resources, Ranger Minerals and Normandy all
falling.
</P>
<P>
Goldfields lost 8 cents, or 4 percent, to 1.92 Australian
dollars, Plutonic 8 cents to 4.6 Australian dollars and Ranger
Minerals 25 cents, or 5.26 percent, to 4.2 Australian dollars
while Normandy was down 1 cent to 1.62 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 420.56 million shares valued at 990.3

NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Two floors of a multi-story
building housing several government and private offices on Janpath
Road of the city proper of New Delhi, capital of India, were
gutted in a fire today.
</P>
<P>
Thick smoke billowing out of the building enveloped the entire

More than 25 firemen were busy working to control the blaze,
the cause of which is yet to be ascertained. Deputy Chief Fire

SHENZHEN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's first special economic
zone, Shenzhen, is doing a good job of providing funds to help
needy people elsewhere, as part of the country's efforts at common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The boomtown set up an economic cooperation development fund in
1989, to promote economic growth in poor areas and loaned money at
half the banks' interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The fund has financed 146 poverty relief projects in other
parts of China with 575 million yuan. The projects are expected to
add 2.36 billion yuan in output value and 568 million yuan in
profits, upon completion.
</P>
<P>
The city invited more than 20 senior managers of large
enterprises to serve as advisers in selecting aid projects. It
spent 4.2 million yuan on a ferroalloy smelter to make use of the
rich hydropower resources in Jinggangshan, one of China's
revolutionary bases. As a result, the smelter brings 10,000 yuan
in profits every day on average.
</P>
<P>
The fund also provided 19.2 million yuan for resettling
villagers in the Three Gorges reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was asked by the State in 1995 to help Guizhou
Province, so the fund sent experts there, selected six key
projects, and provided 24 million yuan. The assistance is said to
have greatly helped the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Coup Attempt to Topple S. Leone's Koroma Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 military officers and
politicians were arrested on Monday in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, for allegedly planning a counter-coup to overthrow
the three-week military junta.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, the officers
arrested included a major, two colonels and a lieutenant colonel.
They had reportedly suborned some members of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to oust Major Johnny Koroma who
took power in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 rebel troops of the RUF, which spearheaded the
civil war in the country in 1991, are known to have joined the
Sierra Leone army following the ouster of President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The six politicians arrested were said to be mainly ministers
under the civilian government led by Ahmed Tejan Kabbah toppled
in May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Reports said heavily armed soldiers loyal to Koroma enhanced
security of the Pademba prison in Freetown, cordoning all roads
leading to it.
</P>
<P>
About 700 criminals escaped from the prison last month after
soldiers broke into the premises. Koroma who had earlier been put
in the same prison for alleged coup plot was freed by soldiers
who launched the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The military junta headed by Johnny Koroma under a threat of
imminent attack by the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
have received wide-spread international condemnation even as they
seek to consolidate on their power through shuttling diplomacy in
some African countries to curry support.
</P>
<P>
it was reported that delegations sent by the military junta to
Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana were rebuffed by these countries who
demanded the unconditional restoration of President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
At home, civil servants defied the ruling junta's repeated
order to go back to work, continuing their peaceful strike, while
schools, shops, banks and other service facilities remained
closed.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members and religious leaders have also called on
the junta for returning power to civilians.

<P>
HANOI, June 17 (xinhua) -- The foreign-invested sector in
vietnam grew by 22.8 percent in the first five months of this
year, said the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
However, the domestic industrial growth was "more humble," one
percentage point lower than last year's 11.9 percent, the
english-language weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed slower industrial growth to insufficient
investments in various sectors while a handful of domestic
industrial enterprises incur great debts.
</P>
<P>
The review added that outdated and backward technology also
drags on industrial productivity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, industries also suffered from the slump in prices
in the past three months. Increased industrial production has
resulted in production exceeding demand, prompting last year's
high trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that in order to give fresh impetus to their
development, the domestic industries must strengthen their own
financial power and operational effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Exchange Reserve Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) --Foreign exchange reserve in Nigeria
increased drastically in the first quarter of this year, hitting
5.9 billion U.S. dollars by March 31, from 4.086 billion dollars at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure is enough to pay for several months of imports,
local newspaper " This Day" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted finance ministry sources who attributed the sharp
reserve growth to proper management of the nation's foreign exchange
resources as well as positive effects of government's fiscal measures.
</P>
<P>
Higer foreign exchange reserve is believed to help a nation keep its
currency strong. But with the increase of reserve, the country's
currency has been depreciating at local market. The market rate
has changed from about 80 Naira to the dollar at the beginning of
this year to present 87 Naira or so.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Nigerian government, instead of using the
reserve to meet exchange demand, might have applied substantial part of
the accumulated reserve to increasing funding for upstream (exploration)
and downstream (refining) oil sector which are said to be at the verge
of collapse due to inadequate funding.

SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The most popular Chinese cartoon
of San Mao, with a shaven head and only three locks of hair on the
forehead and a bulb-like nose, was estimated to be worth 590
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The character was created in 1935 by the popular Chinese
cartoonist Zhang Leping and was immensely successful in the
cartoon strip "Urchin San Mao" which appeared in a Shanghai
newspaper from 1947 to 1948. The image of little San Mao stayed in
the memories of millions of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation was made by the Shanghai Youlian Agency for
Assessing and Calculating Intangible Assets. The agency was one of
the first of its kind in Shanghai and has worked on several
cultural evaluations.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pengsheng, the head of the agency, says that the estimate
of value was based on several things like amount of publications,
degree of publicity, social impact, and various honors it won.
</P>
<P>
With the success of the strip, Zhang also produced a series of
other works involving San Mao, including "San Mao Past and
Present" and "San Mao Greets Liberation", with the founding of the
People's Republic of China in October of 1949.
</P>
<P>
'Urchin San Mao' has been appeared in many different art forms,
including films, TV dramas, and puppet shows. A feature film
entitled "Urchin San Mao" was shown on China Film Day at the
Cannes Film Festival and ran in six Paris cinemas for two months.
</P>
<P>
A special forum was organized in Shanghai on June 15 to mark
the 50th anniversary of "Urchin San Mao".

<HEADLINE> Most Int'l Treaties To Continue To Apply to HK: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 international
treaties will continue to apply to Hong Kong as of July 1, 1997,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai announced here
today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Chinese government has recently presented notes to
the deposit organs for all the relevant treaties on the issue
concerning the application of relevant multilateral international
treaties to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) as
of July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the days to come, the Chinese government will also
comprehensively elaborate, through the Secretary General of the
UN, to the international community the principles and approaches
regarding the application of the relevant international treaties
to the HKSAR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Through the above-mentioned actions, the overwhelming majority
of the multilateral international treaties currently applying to
Hong Kong will continue to be applicable to the HKSAR as of July
1, 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
These treaties are relating to economy and trade, customs,
science and technology, civil aviation, merchant ships,
intellectual property rights, resources, environmental protection,
postal service, human rights, labor, international crimes, private
international laws and other areas, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that altogether there are more than 200 such
individual treaties, over 80 of which China hasn't acceded to by
now.
</P>
<P>
The cations mentioned above are taken for the purpose of
implementing the "one country, two systems" principle as well as
the relevant provisions of the Basic Law of the HKSAR, he said,
adding that they are, therefore, of great significance to Hong
Kong's smooth transition and to the preservation of its long-term
prosperity and stability.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Appointment of HKSAR Provisional District Organizations Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Hong Kong, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The appointment of all existing
members of Hong Kong's district organizations to the provisional
district organizations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) is widely acclaimed here as good for maintaining the
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a decision announced by the Office of the
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, all existing members of the
Urban Council, the Regional Council and the 18 District Boards

Provisional Regional Council and the Provisional District Boards,
while 116 new appointed seats were added.
</P>
<P>
Ngai Shiu-kit, a member of the Preparatory Committee of Hong
Kong SAR, said that the additional appointment of a large number
of professionals and personalities with rich experiences in
regional affairs to the provisional regional organizations
embodies the principle of a balanced participation.
</P>
<P>
While the full participation of the existing members in the
provisional organizations facilitates the maintenance of social
stability, the additional appointments which have drawn people
from all walks of life are in the interests of all social strata,
noted Lee Lin Sang, a deputy to the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The decision to retain all the existing members while adding new
appointments epitomizes the spirit of tolerance, observed Sze Chi
Ching, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Daniel W.K. Lam, chairman of the Hong Kong Regional
Council, noted that from the list of appointment, professional
appointees have made up the bulk of the organizations and many of
them have work experience in the district and regional boards and
the Urban Council. This will be conducive to the operation of the

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Haikou, the capital of
China's southernmost province, Hainan, says that Hong Kong's
return on July 1 will bring more opportunities for economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businessmen have invested a total of 1.75 billion US
dollars in Haikou in the past few years, accounting for half of
the city's overseas investment, Mayor Zeng Haorong says. Overseas
investment in the city has reached about 3.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong investors have become extensively involved in the
local economy, investing in local industrial, agricultural, real
estate, and tourist projects, and in infrastructure," he says.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,650 ventures in the city funded by Hong Kong
businessmen, and nearly 60 percent of the city's exports go
through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Both Hong Kong and Haikou have benefited a lot from this
economic cooperation, and Hong Kong businessmen have good returns
on their revestments," Zeng says.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's Ninth Five-Year Plan, it will
concentrate on developing high-tech, high value-added,
highly-profitable industries, and the tourist industry to make it
an international tropical tourist city.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will 'mirror' Haikou's economic growth, which has
similar economic opportunities as Hong Kong 30 year ago, and the
return will help speed up development of the local investment and
finance business," Zeng notes.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can also channel more overseas economic information
into Haikou, and help improve the local information industry, he
says.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region Improving Household Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region has become China's largest cotton producer and a major
grain production base thanks to an improved household contract
responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the system, which links profit to output, in the
early 1980s, and agricultural productivity was greatly raised as a
result. Xinjiang was one of the places that experienced these
changes. But this largest region in China, with more than 1.6
million sq km of land and vast amounts of farmland, has its own
farming methods distinct from other parts of China where parcels
of land are much smaller. So it added something to the system.
</P>
<P>
This included local governments being responsible for
efficiency, and farmers having the right to manage their own
farmland. Also important were five processes: unified production,
water conservation, mechanical operations, major technological
improvements, and various services.
</P>
<P>
"These five unified steps are meant to improve farm management
and are in line with the shift of economic growth from extensive
operations to intensive ones. And local officials are tied more
closely to farmland and field management," explains Zhang Zhennan,
research fellow of the regional Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Officials are especially helpful in seeing that techniques are
applied or in providing information. Officials give on-the-spot
lectures on every aspect of the production chain. Banks in Hotan
county provided more than 16 million yuan of loans to cotton
growers in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now produces more than a quarter of China's total
cotton output, and the improved system has played a major role in
this.

official said today.
</P>
<P>
The unabated deforestation, which goes at an annual average of
130,000 hectares, is a main reason for the country's watershed
degradation, said Virgilio Marcelo, undersecretary for operations
at the Environment and Natural Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the status of the country's watersheds, Marcelo
said watershed degradation is one of the causes of water shortage
experienced in parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Watershed degradation can also result in more serious problems
such as the increasing rate of soil erosion which can cause
landslides and flash floods, particularly during the southwest
monsoon period.
</P>
<P>
To abate the degradation of watershed areas, Marcelo said that
the environment department has taken a series of rehabilitation
and protection measures, including the establishment of forest
plantations, erosion control and environmental resources
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
For this year alone, the environment has targeted to establish
some 29,564 hectares of forest plantations and another 13,070
square meters of vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo also noted that the protection of some 132,460 hectares
of existing forests and 10 watershed areas is a priority for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Five more watersheds are scheduled to be declared as watershed
reservation this year to prevent inappropriate forest exploitation
and other disruptive land use.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Leads to Expected Fall in Australia's Farm Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's chief commodities
forecaster today downgraded its long-term commodity exports
forecast by 1.2 billion US dollars because of an expected five
percent drop in farm exports due to dry weather and the developing
El Nino.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) increased its forecast for total commodity
exports in the 1996-97 financial year (from July 1, 1996 to June
30,1997) to 44.4 billion US dollars, up from an earlier prediction
of 44.2 billion US dollars and 2.6 percent higher than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In its June quarter commodities outlook, the bureau said total
commodity exports were expected to rise to a record 46.2 billion
US dollars in 1997-98, mainly due to 29 billion US dollars from
minerals and energy exports.
</P>
<P>
But the figure compared to earlier predictions of exports worth
47.4 billion US dollars in 1997-98, due mainly to a 3.35 billion
US dollar fall in the expected value of farm exports.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects of drier than normal seasonal conditions, as a
result of a developing El Nino weather pattern, will contribute to
a forecast five percent fall in the value of farm exports to 15.3
billion US dollars in 1997-98," ABARE acting executive director
Stephen Beare said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said lower winter crop production and lower grain exports
were major factors in the forecast fall in farm exports.
</P>
<P>
Crop yields were expected to be below average in Australia's
eastern states, reflecting the Bureau of Meteorology's
announcement that it was confident an El Nino weather pattern will
persist for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
El Nino suppresses winter rains in southern Australia and then
the monsoonal summer rains in the north. The full effects of El
Nino were last felt in Australia during the drought of 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the value of wheat exports is forecast to plummet
40 percent in 1997-98 to 1.9 billion US dollars from record levels
this year of 3.19 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production is also seen falling from 23.586 million tons
this financial year to 16.245 million tons in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
But one bright spot on the horizon is wool, with the eastern
market indicator forecast to average six percent higher in 1997-98
at 494 US cents per kg clean, due to higher demand.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment for China's Urban Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Great changes are taking
place in the cities of northern Hebei Province thanks to increased
overseas investment in urban construction in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The province has halted its practice of spending freely on
urban infrastructure, and has increased cooperation with overseas
investors instead. It used more than 14 million US dollars worth
of government donations or loans to build and upgrade public
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Sewage treatment plants in Handan and Shijiazhuang have begun
work, as has a gas project in the coastal city of
Qinhuangdao. Construction of 12 other projects is under way, for
water supplies, sewage disposal, and gasworks in major cities at a
total cost estimated at nearly 2.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An urban water supply and environmental protection project,
involving a loan of 150 million US dollars, has been listed as
part of the 1997-1999 World Bank plan.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have shown an interest in the province's
real estate market, and a total of 130 million US dollars has been
put into 115 joint ventures and another 100 projects have been
started in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has 34 cities and plans to urbanize 35 percent of its
area by the end of the century. This will require more than 10
billion yuan for urban infrastructure. So it has 70 key projects
that are open to overseas funding, for water supplies, sewage
treatment, garbage disposal, road improvements, and building
machinery.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian province has
collected more than 2.7 billion yuan through various channels to
build two important railways.
</P>
<P>
The Zhangping-Quanzhou-Xiaochu railway line and another railway
from Nanping to Hengfeng in neighboring Jiangxi province (Hengnan
railway) need a total investment of nearly four billion yuan,
while the state has provided only 55 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To ensure enough funds for the construction of the railways,
Fujian adopted different measures, such as using bank loans,
issuing credits and shares, attracting foreign investment, and
collecting funds from local units, the provincial authorities say.
</P>
<P>
At present, tracks on the Zhangquanxiao railway have been laid
to Shanyao station in Quanzhou, and that on the Hengnan railway,
to Wuyishan station. Part of the railways has gone into
operation.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Has 1,230 Overseas-Backed Agricultural Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have started more
than 1,230 agricultural projects in the province of Shandong in
east China, accounting for 6.6 percent of the province's total
number of overseas-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, contracts on these projects
involve 112 million U.S. dollars of overseas funds, 4.5 percent of
the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is a leading agricultural producer in China and has
been ranked high in the production of grain, cotton, edible oil
and vegetables. Plentiful resources have created a lot of
opportunities for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Many of the overseas-backed enterprises are engaged in farm
processing business. They delivered 1.54 billion yuan worth of
processed farmed produce for exports in 1996, accounting for 14
percent of the province's total exports for the year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the inflow of overseas investment into
the province's agricultural sector has not only brought in a big
number of improved varieties of agricultural products and advanced
technologies, but also advanced the industrialization of the
province's agriculture and urbanization in the province's rural
areas.

<HEADLINE> HK to Enjoy More Eminent Status beyond 1997: ROK Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- "After Hong Kong returns to
China on July 1, not only my chamber and I myself will remain in
Hong Kong, my son and daughter will come to work here, too," Sung
Suk Joo, chairman of the Korean Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
One of the founders of the chamber, the 50-year-old Sung has
been in Hong Kong for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
"I love Hong Kong, especially its free trade and financial
systems, freedom of entrance and exit, and good investment
environment, which have brought easy accesses to business people
from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and other countries here," said
Sung at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The chamber now boasts more than 260 members as against the
merely 40-plus people when it was first established in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The trade between the ROK and Hong Kong is also developing
rapidly, with an average annual growth rate of 15 to 20 percent,"
Sung added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the total trade volume between the ROK and Hong Kong
reached 12 billion US dollars, mainly from automobiles, chemical
and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
To help more people to acquaint themselves with the ROK and
expand new scope for the ROK-Hong Kong trade, Sung said, his
chamber has, through the local ATV, sponsored a special "Korean
Hour" program, and a 30-minute English new reports program a week
with Chinese subtitles.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 800 ROK enterprises and some
7,000 ROK nationals residing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that more businessmen from ROK and other countries
will come to Hong Kong after July 1, for ROK business people there
are more opportunities here than in their own country," Sung
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, he would ask both his son and daughter,
who are now studying at college in the ROK, to come to work in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I am also thinking of sending them to Beijing first to learn
Putonghua (or Standard Chinese), because they will have more
chances to communicate with people from the Chinese interior area
after the return of Hong Kong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Describing Hong Kong as a metropolis in the world playing the
role of international financing, trading and shipping center, Sung
predicted that Hong Kong will acquire an still more important
position after its return.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "China's interior area is a huge market
with vast potential, and Hong Kong will play a crucial role in
supporting and promoting the modernization drive there."
</P>
<P>
The principle of "one country, two systems", which the Chinese
government is to implement in Hong Kong from July 1, is in the
interest of both Hong Kong and the Chinese interior area.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the full implementation of this principle is
guaranteed, the existing economic system in Hong Kong will remain
unchanged," Sung said, adding that it is not only good for Hong
Kong but beneficial to the Chinese interior area.

KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Rebels raided and partially
overran Bundybugyo district town in western Uganda early Monday
and were soon repulsed by Uganda army, said a senior Ugandan
officer.
</P>
<P>
Jeje Odongo, State Minister for Defense in charge of training,
said the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels launched the raid
along with soldiers from former Zaire and Rwandese Hutu militia
and occupied a part of the town.
</P>
<P>
According to Odong, between 100 and 200 rebels had taken part
in the attack. They acted in two groups: one manoeuvred outside
Congo-Uganda border to attract heavy deployment from Bundybugyo,
and the other raided the town where only a few soldiers and
policemen stationed.
</P>
<P>
However, the remaining unit in the town resisted, and when the
reinforcement arrived, the attackers escaped, Odongo said.
</P>
<P>
Five rebels were killed in the battle whereas casualty of
government troops is not available.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Madagascar today
agreed to form a joint commission as soon as possible to further
enhance their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting here today between
Malaysian Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Madagascar
Deputy Prime Minister Tantely Andrianarivo, Secretary-General of
the Finance Ministry Clifford Herbert told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposed joint commission would include cooperation in the
field of cultural and scientific development as well as technical
cooperation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The (Madagascar) Prime Minister is planning to come to
Malaysia in the later part of the year. So we are working on some
agreements to enable us to sign them during the visit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar and Andrianarivo, both finance ministers of their
respective countries, also agreed to enhance trade relations
between the two countries which at present was very minimal.
</P>
<P>
"They are very keen to invite our businessmen to go there and
help develop tourism and other sectors. Our businessmen are also
going there and are looking for possibilities to explore business
there," Clifford Herbert added.
</P>
<P>
According to Director of the Malaysian External Trade
Development Corporation (MATRADE) Mohammed Abdul Halim, Malaysia's
trade with the republic showed a 15 percent decrease in exports at
20.24 million ringgit (about 8.1 million U.S. dollars) last year
from 23.89 million ringgit (about 9.56 million dollars ) in l995.
</P>
<P>
But, imports from Madagascar rose by 69 percent to 1.76 million
ringgit (about 700,000 million dollars) in l996 from l.04 million
ringgit (about 400,000 million dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main exports to Madagascar include animal and
vegetable oils and fats, miscellaneous manufactured articles and
manufactured goods while its main imports from that country were
food and live animals, commodities, manufactured goods, machinery
and transport equipment.

<HEADLINE> East China Farmers Become Townfolks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The dream of Chinese farmers of
becoming townfolks has come true almost overnight in east China's
Zhejiang Province, as local authorities offer farmers a permanent
residence card that carries with it urban residence status.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers have often had difficulties finding jobs in
cities because they don't have the necessary urban residence
cards. But many farmers expect their children to go to college or
find better work or become cadres of some kind and try to move to
urban areas to escape the limits there.
</P>
<P>
But, in a counter move, booming townships and villages became
more attractive to farmers after China's rural reforms began in
the early 1980s. This caused a growing number to remain in the
countryside and contribute to rural urbanization.
</P>
<P>
One example of this was farmers in 18 districts and 12 villages
of Zhejiang's Longgang Township who recently began to receive the
same treatment as city dwellers in schooling, employment,
insurance, family planning, and other rights.
</P>
<P>
Longgang was just a small fishing village in the early 1980s
when the county began to encourage farmers elsewhere to open up
wasteland there. So, the farmers poured in, and with their hard
work, set up an entirely new city on the beach.
</P>
<P>
Its population has grown to 140,000 and it has nearly four
billion yuan in industrial and agricultural output value
annually. Its 87 streets are crowded with businesses, factories,
and tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
Longgang was the first to benefit from China's effort to
promote urbanization in small townships.

<HEADLINE> S.African Official Stresses Need to Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) --The South African Deputy
Agriculture Minister has stressed the need for South African
farmers to work with overseas partners to overcome the legacy of
a segregated agriculture system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing foreign envoys at a function here last week, South
African Deputy Agriculture Minsiter Thoko Didiza said that it was
necessary for the partners to understand what each other wanted
from such a relationship in agriculture, especially commercial
farming, local daily "Business" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Didiza said that to guarantee food security and close the gap
between rich and poor farmers, while creating a dynamic and
competitive sector that contributed to economy, interaction with
the international community would be mainly targeted in the areas
of technological transfer, agricultural research, training,
information and trade.
</P>
<P>
"From the South African perspective, we move from a premise
that in achieving our goals for transformation, we will require
various expertise, some of which we do not have as a country, but
some of your countries indeed offer," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that South Africa needed to locate its
economic growth within the parameters of the international trade
environment and see how they would benefit from South African
farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Anhui Expressway Co. Ltd, the
first expressway company to list its shares on the Hong Kong stock
exchange, has become one of the best-performers on Hong Kong's H

<HEADLINE> India to Maintain Good Relationship With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Veena Sikri, Consul General of
India in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong's return to China is a
historical event.
</P>
<P>
"The event is also very important for us as we have a large
Indian community in Hong Kong," she said in a recent interview,
adding that the Indian community in Hong Kong has approximately
28,000 members and has existed here for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
Indians have been involved in every aspect of economic
activities in Hong Kong -- in trade, business and commerce. The
Indian community in Hong Kong leads a very happy life and looks
forward to continued prosperity here, she said.
</P>
<P>
India and Hong Kong have always maintained good relations,
according to Sikri. Hong Kong has been India's fourth largest
trading partner, and their bilateral trade reached almost three
billion US dollars in value last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sikri expressed satisfaction over Hong Kong's investment
environment as well as appreciation for what she called its
laissez-faire financial policies. Such policies, she said, have
promoted the development of Hong Kong as an international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope that Hong Kong will continue to develop and
prosper in future," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us in Asia accept the 'one country, two
systems' formula. We look forward very much to the implementation
of this policy."
</P>
<P>
On consular matters, Sikri said, the Indian government has
decided to recognize the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
passport as a valid document from July 1. "We'll continue our
bonds and our relationship with Hong Kong after the handover," she
said.
</P>
<P>
India has also maintained very active and good relations with
China, she said, citing as proof Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to India in November, 1996. "It was a good visit. There is a
good prospect for both sides. We look forward to continuing good
relations with China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dipak Mallik, counselor of the Indian Consulate in Hong Kong,
said India's trade with Hong Kong grew by two percent to reach
2.711 billion US dollars in 1996, compared with 2.655 billion US
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A big number of Indian companies are doing business with many
countries from Hong Kong as it is a very important trade and
financial center in this part of the world and serves as a link to
America, Latin America, Europe and Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's investment in India has increased
steadily in recent years, according to Mr. Mallik. With the
liberalization of the Indian economy since 1991, he said, there
has been greater scope for making profits in India. Investment has
kept flowing into India from all over the world, and Hong Kong has
been one of the major sources of such investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indian nationals who are highly qualified in the
fields of technology, banking, finance and insurance have kept
coming to Hong Kong in large numbers, he said. The Indian
community is contributing to their own prosperity and to the
prosperity of Hong Kong.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South African construction
expertise is heavily involved in building one of the world's tallest
hotel in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), local daily the Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 321-meter high Chicago Beach Tower hotel -- built in the
shape of a ship's sail -- already dominates Dubai's spectacular
skyscraper horizon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The building will be topped off by a 104-meter mast and includes
200 suites, an aquarium at ground-floor level, and swimming pools 150
meter above the ground. There is also a helicopter landing area and an
all-glass sky restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The construction will be the third largest in the world, being
bettered only by the new Hong Kong airport and the Petronas Towers in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The South African partners in the international joint venture
putting up the building are Murray and Roberts Construction

<HEADLINE> I'm Proud to Be Member of HKSAR Govt, Says Gordon Siu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong is my home and China
is my
motherland. I am proud to be a member of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, serving my home and my
motherland," said Secretary for Transport Gordon Siu Kwing-chue in
an inclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Hong Kong Government's transport branch since
June 1996, Siu oversees the construction and management of the
road, railway and ferry systems in Hong Kong. He has been
appointed SAR's Secretary for Transport upon nomination of Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The road system related to Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap
Kok, which is now under construction and due to be completed in
1998, plays an important role in the overall improvement of the
local transportation network.
</P>
<P>
"With the completion of this road system, we've begun an
overall study into Hong Kong's transport needs in the next
century," Siu said.
</P>
<P>
An outline focused on transport improvement for the period
2000-2015 with up-to-date technologies is to be ready by 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has long been challenged by the world's busiest road
network, with more than 467,000 licensed vehicles traveling on
roads totaling just 1,743 kilometers in length.
</P>
<P>
Among the major projects to be considered are the so-called
Western and Eastern Corridors, passageways located in the eastern
and western parts of Kowloon, and bridges which link Hong Kong and
South China's Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The two cities are in the
Zhujiang River Delta, which represents one of China's most
vigorous economies.
</P>
<P>
The Delta area, which has witnessed rapid economic progress
during
the past decade, has established close ties with Hong Kong. Even
closer cooperation is foreseen after Hong Kong's handover, Siu
said.
</P>
<P>
It poses a big challenge for Hong Kong to improve interport
transportation with the area, which is predicted to witness a
considerably increased volume of transport in the years to come,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Railway and Mass Transit Railway (MTR) network is also to be
extended. After the West Rail passenger railway project is
completed around 2002-2003, large areas of land would become
available for development.
</P>
<P>
And the MTR line along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island
is planned to be extended eastward to cover almost the whole of
the coast line, he said.
</P>
<P>
To make better use of Hong Kong's waterways is also important.
With marine and river transportation reaching almost all ports in
Guangdong Province, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from
chances offered by the waterways, Siu predicted.
</P>
<P>
With about 10 different projects on the blue print for the next
10 to 15 years though, Siu is not worried about implementation.
"I'm very optimistic. Just look how we did for the New Airport
Core Program and related projects during the past five years. It
has most clearly demonstrated Hong Kong's capability in
infrastructure projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And we can do it even better since we've learnt a lot and we
can apply the experience gained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong in November 1945, Siu got a Master's Degree
in Public Administration from the University of Birmingham,
Britain, in 1975. He joined the government in February 1966, as
an Executive Officer. He joined the Hong Kong Administration
Service in 1968.
</P>
<P>
He later took up such posts as Postmaster General, Commissioner
for Transport and Secretary for Economic Services before being
appointed Secretary for Transport in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Divorced, Siu has two sons.
</P>
<P>
Siu gets up early, goes out for a walk and does golf swings in
the morning air. "This makes me feel fresh and energetic the
whole day," he said.
</P>
<P>
With wide-ranging hobbies including reading, golf and swimming,
his top spare time favorite is music -- classics, jazz, pop to
rock and roll Chinese and Western. He plays the violin, the
viola, the double bass and the guitar.
</P>
<P>
"Music is for one's soul," he said.

<HEADLINE> Irani, Pakistani Leaders Share Views on Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Irani and Pakistani leaders have
shared the view that it is not war but peace talks that will solve
the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan, the Iran's official IRNA news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This view was expressed at a meeting here last night between
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the visiting
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad and Tehran are at odds on their supports for rival
Afghan factions. Iran accuses Pakistan of supporting the Islamic
militia Taliban which has already controlled 90 percent of the
territory in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The only basic way and a permanent solution to the ongoing
crisis is the participation of all factions (in peace talks) based
on the interests of the Afghan people who have suffered through
the crisis," Rafsanjani said during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani termed as positive the role of Iran, Pakistan and
other regional countries in efforts to resolve the crisis in
Afghanistan and the crises elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sharif arrived here yesterday afternoon. This is the first
visit by Sharif since becoming prime minister last February.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Sharif said that Pakistan is always holding
the opinion that military solution can not be successful in any one
of the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders expressed their satisfaction over progress towards
broadening of ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called for further promotion of bilateral relations
particularly in the economic, trade and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by IRNA, Iran and Pakistan reached an
agreement on defining of the two countries' marine borders in the
Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed in the presence of Rafsanjani
and Sharif, is the first ever document to be signed between
Iran and its neighborly countries on defining the territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
The accord is designed to safeguard the marine interests of
the two neighboring countries and is expected to play a
significant role in the exploitation of regional sea resources
in addition to promotion of cooperation and regional solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition entitled the
History and Development of Hong Kong opened here today at the
Birendra International Conference Center to mark Hong Kong's
upcoming return to China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the exhibition sponsored by
the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, Chinese ambassador Zhang Jiuhuan
said Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland in 13
days. This great event is drawing much attention of the whole
world not only because it is a return after 150 years, or a return
realized in a peaceful manner, but also because it is a return
realized out of the concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that under the guidance of the great concept of late
Deng Xiaoping, a great man of this century, the Chinese government
will carry out in Hong Kong, after its return to the motherland,
special policies unprecedented both in China and in the world at
large, the basic content of which can be summarized as "one
country, two systems, " "rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people"
and "a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned policies guarantees the stable transfer of
Hong Kong, said Zhang, adding that it is predictable that after
its return, Hong Kong will continue to enjoy stability and
prosperity, and will have a better future.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Finance Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma took part in the
opening ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Chand.
</P>
<P>
He said the resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty by
China over Hong Kong from July 1, 1997 will be a great event of
national pride and dignity for China and its people.
</P>
<P>
About 200 people attended the opening ceremony of the
exhibition, which will last a week.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Firm Seeks to Have Its Software in PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- BackWeb Technologies, an Israeli
company, is negotiating with major international computer
manufacturers to have its program included in each machine sold,
today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Eli Barka, BackWeb's chief executive officer
(CEO), as saying that the personal computers (PC) will become
much more user-friendly for those interested in the Internet, when
the deals are signed and the software is included in the PCs.
</P>
<P>
The user will be able to take the PC out of the box, plug them
in and customize their own Internet "channels," whose icons will
appear on the screen while they work.
</P>
<P>
As a very young company with a 34-year-old CEO, BackWeb already
has 100 staff members, 40 of them in Israel and the rest in the
United States, and has captured 22 percent of the business of 50
leading companies using "push" technology in the world.
</P>
<P>
Majoring in computer science and mathematics, Barka graduated
from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and was a key person in
the development of the BackWeb 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
He started his career as a software developer with local
computer firms, and then moved to Daizix Technologies near Tel
Aviv, where he developed computer-assisted design applications.
</P>
<P>
BackWeb recently announced an agreement with U.S.
Microsoft Corporation for expanding broadcast and delivery
options for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0, scheduled for
release soon.
</P>
<P>
The firm has also just released BackWeb version 2.0 with
several new enhancements that conserve the corporate network
bandwidth, and the new version is especially useful for
companies sending information to employees over their own
Internet.

<HEADLINE> China Not Ready to Excavate Qin Shihuang's Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists say that they
will not excavate the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the first man to unite
China 2,000 years ago, in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Lack of advanced scientific means may bring problems to the
protection of relics during excavation, said Zhang Wenbin,
director of the State Cultural Relics Bureau, adding that the
bureau's current focus is to rescue those relics which are being
threatened by on-going construction projects.
</P>
<P>
But Qin Shihuang's tomb, 30 kilometers away from Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi province, is not on the emergency
list, he said. "It is impossible for us to dig any ancient
emperor's tomb without large amounts of funding, materials and
human resources."
</P>
<P>
The Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) existed only for five
years. However, construction of the tomb started when the emperor
was only a 13-year-old boy. More than 800,000 workers spent dozens
of years completing the project, probably the biggest mausoleum in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists from both at home and abroad are very interested
in the things that may be in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zhongyi, head of a team to study terrecotta figures, said
that many technological problems have not yet been solved related
to the excavation of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
"To excavate the tomb, we must first remove the artificial
hilltop, a historical landmark, built on the tomb. It will be a
big job, and that would mean the destruction of the hilltop which
itself is of importance," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed the underground flow beneath the tomb. It is
not easy to pump the water out without damaging the tomb, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the treatment of a huge mercury layer in the
tomb.
</P>
<P>
In addition, iron and wooden materials buried with the emperor,
as well as silk and cloth fabrics, can not be well preserved if
they are exposed in the air. How to protect them is still a
technological problem, Yuan added.
</P>
<P>
"But someday we will be able to uncover the myth of the tomb in
line with the advancement of science and technology," he said.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Set up National Youth Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African Youth
Council (SAYC), the first co-ordinating body of its kind to deal
with youth matters in civil society, will be set up on August 2,
a local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the National Economic Development and
Labour Council (NEDLAC) in Cape Town, about 40 youth
organisations nationwide agreed on the establishment of SAYC.
</P>
<P>
NEDLAC was approached by the youth movements of the African
National Congress, National Party and Inkatha Freedom Party to
spearhead moves to form a national youth body and it convened two
meetings in April and June to facilitate the process, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The proposed August launch signaled an important coming
together of youth organisations in order to play a more active
role in broader civil society, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The SAYC will also ensure that youth issues are catered for
in forums such as NEDLAC and the Non-Governmental Organisation
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
It aims to assist in the integration of youth in all
government programs and policies through organs such as the
statutory National Youth Commission.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, South African youths held a series of gatherings
throughout the country to mark Youth Day and commemorate the 21st
anniversary of the Soweto student uprising of June 16, 1976 to
protest the forced use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Second-phase construction has
started on a 140-km-long expressway from Baoding, in north China's
Hebei province, to Tianjin, the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
In Xiongxian county of Hebei, piers are being built for a
bridge with a length of 1,800 meters, over a tributary of the
Haihe river. It is regarded as the most difficult part of the
expressway.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will be linked with the Beijing-Shenzhen
super-highway in the west, and another expressway from Tianjin,
via Shanhaiguan, to northeast China, in the east.
</P>
<P>
It will also be a major road for Tianjin to reach the capitals
of Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Construction work for the four-lane expressway will be
completed by 1998. First-phase construction began in March last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei section of the expressway is 105 km long, costing an
investment of 1.9 billion yuan. There are now five expressways
being built in the province, with a combined length of nearly 800
km.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is also building four expressways totaling about 140 km
long, sources say.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Housing Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China now has more than 5,000
housing cooperatives since the first such body was established in
Shanghai in 1986.
</P>
<P>
This information was provided at a recent training class on the
management of apartments built by housing cooperatives held in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the training class, Li Zhendong, Vice Minister of
Construction, said that building flats by housing cooperatives
conforms with reform requirements, people's actual income standard
and their demand for a more comfortable living condition, and
should be practised in more large cities since successful
experience has been gained from practices in some medium-sized and
small cities, as well as in county seats.
</P>
<P>
To solve housing difficulties, moderate and low wage earners in
some cities and towns have voluntarily formed housing cooperatives
and paid a certain amount of money in advance to repay investment
for construction of apartments, which will be distributed among
members of housing cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
This has gone in tandem with the "comfortable living" project

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Tap Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region is trying to turn its resources into an economic
advantage by following China's strategy of shifting energy and
resource development westward to speed up economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The region's mineral resources are estimated to be worth 13
trillion yuan. But the lack of technology has limited its
exploration of the resources, says Wang Jie, an official with the
regional Department of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
The region has 133 of China's 165 types of minerals, 30 of
which rank among the largest reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
Its coal reserves are said to be more than 200 billion
tons. They lie in the valleys of the Yellow and other rivers
which provide abundant water for generating electricity. But the
current annual mining capacity is less than 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In the Horqin, Erenhot, and Ordos oilfields, 140 million tons
of available oil and 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas have
been found.
</P>
<P>
The region also leads the world in proven rare-earths reserves
which are estimated at 100 million tons, and its reserves of
nonferrous metals amount to 30 million tons, while iron ore
reserves are as much as two billion tons.

<HEADLINE> SEC Minister on Cooperation with HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, an increasing number of Hong Kong students
have come to study in universities in inland areas and, after
graduation, they have contributed to the development of Hong Kong,
Zhu said. He noted that at present more than 1,000 Hong Kong
students are studying some 30 majors in more than 100 universities
in the interior.
</P>
<P>
Universities in inland areas will take necessary steps to
make it more convenient for Hong Kong students in entrance exams,
tuition, and in their daily lives, he pledged. "After Hong Kong's
return, universities in inland areas will, as always, welcome Hong
Kong students to enroll in these universities."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether middle school students from inland areas
will be permitted to enroll in universities in Hong Kong, Zhu
pointed out that this issue will be decided by the SEC and the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region through
discussions.
</P>
<P>
As for entrance exams, the number of admissions, and the amount
of tuition, these must be negotiated by the two sides in
accordance with their particular situations, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Mutual recognition of academic scores and degrees by
universities in inland areas and Hong Kong must be taken into
account when they are decided by the central educational department
and its Hong Kong counterpart through negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the nine-year free education system was
implemented in Hong Kong very early and Hong Kong's achievements
in primary and middle school education, vocational training, and
higher education are worth studying by inland areas.
</P>
<P>
He said it takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred to
raise a person. In similar fashion, cooperation in education
between inland areas and Hong Kong will be a long-term project and
will contribute to both the enduring prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong, and to the educational and scientific development of
inland areas.

<P>
Beijing, June 17 (Xinhua) -- With the determination to help
build a clean and efficient government, the Chinese Communist
Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection will send
work group across the country to supervise anti-corruption
operations.
</P>
<P>
The central task of the inspection groups is to check the fight
against extravagant acts in some government establishments while
promote a thrift and honest work style. Extravagancy includes
spending lavishly on meetings and ceremonies, using public funds
for private housing decorations and buying mobile-phones.
</P>
<P>
The groups will go to selected provinces and cities as well as
central government departments and commissions in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee issued in March this year a set of
rules asking Party officials and members to guard against
corruptive activities. The document will be used as the main
guideline for the coming inspections.
</P>
<P>
The check will start first among leading officials.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Party Wants to Learn Blair's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The new leader of Israel's
opposition Labor Party is considering everything from learning
secret of election success of Western politicians to renaming his
party's name -- with an aim to topple the current government.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak is planning to learn the secret of British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's stunning success in elections on May 1, the
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts will be sent to London to find out how Blair
rehabilitated the British Labor Party and brought it back to power.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make use of his experience and to employ his
methods here," Barak was quoted Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a former army Chief of Staff, said he did not
rule out the possibility of renaming his party as Blair did
with his party. He is seriously considering changing the name
to "the New Labor Party."
</P>
<P>
"This may have a psychological significance, though I am
aware that a name isn't everything and that the really
important thing is the substance of the message. But even
names and appearances have their importance," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's suggestion of renaming the party has aroused both
positive and negative reactions from within the Party.
</P>
<P>
Barak scored a convincing victory in the party leadership
election held on June 3 by winning 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Barak, 55, is widely regarded as a heavyweight challenger
to the current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of the Likud
Party. Barak has openly declared his goal of toppling the
Netanyahu government to replace it.
</P>
<P>
Despite his endorsement of the peace process with the Arabs,
Barak is a hawk in the leftist camp who stresses the importance of
preserving Israel's security in any peace deals. So he is dubbed
as "Mr. Security" like the slain premier Yithzak Rabin, whose
political legacy of striving to reach peace in the Middle East
Barak has been vowed to carry on.

<HEADLINE> Rockwell to Expand R&AMP;D Centers in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Rockwell Semiconductor Systems,
the world's leading modem manufacturer, expects to increase the
number of employees at its Israel-based centers from next year,
today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, a subsidiary of
industrial automation giant Rockwell International Corp.,
announced the establishment of a research and development center
in Herzliya near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The company already had a center in Karmiel in northern
Israel which it acquired from the US-based Comstream.
</P>
<P>
"We came here because of the people and talent and because we
felt we could build a strong product development team," company
president Dwight Decker said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of employees will raise Rockwell's
local investment from 10 million U.S. dollars to 15 million
dollars per year, Decker said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up a local R&AMP;D center is part of the
company's transition from an aerospace and defense company to a
high-tech commercial electronics firm, he added.
</P>
<P>
The center in Herzliya will design software-based modems,
which are more flexible and less expensive than the currently
used hardware modems, and the Karmiel center is engaged in
developing satellite modems.
</P>
<P>
Decker revealed that Rockwell Semiconductor Systems' revenues
totalled 1.5 billion dollars last year, representing some 20
percent of Rockwell International's 8 billion dollars in
annual sales.

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's inter-bank treasury bond
trading market has officially begun.
</P>
<P>
The central bank announced June 6 that all commercial banks had
to stop trading treasury bonds on securities exchanges and
securities trading centers nationwide. The inter-bank bond market
will help stem the flow of credit into the stock market, which has
increased speculation there and as a result bank credit risks,
according to market observers.
</P>
<P>
It also helps the central bank use indirect or market-oriented
means to achieve its monetary goals, they said.
</P>
<P>
All treasury bonds in circulation will be traded only on the
inter-bank money market from now on. Its members include 16
commercial banks and 11 urban cooperative banks. The Central Bonds
Registration and Settlement Company is empowered to provide
trusteeship and settlement services for inter-bank trading in
treasury bonds.

<HEADLINE> ADB Hosts Meeting to Assist Poor Micro-Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- About 130 representatives of donors
and multilateral institutions gathered here today at the Asian
Development Bank headquarters to explore ways of providing more
financial services to poor micro-enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth meeting of the Consultative Group to
Assist the Poorest (CGAP) that will last three days, ADB President
Mitsuo Sato introduced the bank's efforts in providing financial
support to these enterprises and lessons from the operations.
</P>
<P>
"ADB's leading mix is consciously oriented to balance economic
growth objectives with projects that provide direct support for
human development, reduction of poverty, improvement of the role
of women and environmental protection," he added.
</P>
<P>
Financial services to poor micro-enterprises may be the single
most effective way to alleviate poverty and achieve broad-based
economic growth in the Asian Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, the micro-enterprise sector employs 30
to 80 percent of the economically active population and often
absorbs excess labor during periods of economic restructuring,
according to a document released by the CGAP Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
However, it was estimated that only fewer than two percent of
the five million people running micro-enterprises have access to
financial services in the region, where more than two thirds of
the poor people in the developing world are living and about one
billion of them are considered to live in absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1995, the CGAP has now 23 member donors with a fund
of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also attending today's meeting is the World Bank's vice
president Ismail Serageldin.

<HEADLINE> India to Study Gimmick of Transfer Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry said today
it will probe a tax swindle which involves India-based
multinational companies (MNCs) with respect to dealings with their
international affiliates.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said MNCs are using transfer pricing
to understate their tax liability.
</P>
<P>
The system of transfer pricing determines the price at which
products or technology are sold between group companies.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry believes that with steep cuts in import
tariffs since 1991, several MNCs have started to source their
imports from foreign group companies, and similarly, domestic
units are engaging in exports to either the parent outfit or
affiliate companies.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is no database in the country on the transfer
pricing practice adopted by the MNCs vis-a-vis their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
"They are not charitable organizations. In countries like
America they know how these MNCs function, that is distribute
their prices between branches and subsidiaries across the world
and what part of it is in their country and what is remitted. So
we have major gaps in the area," a Finance Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Finance Ministry has asked the National
Institute of Public Finance and Policy to undertake a study on
transfer pricing and the arms length practice adopted by MNCs
operating in India.
</P>
<P>
India's Revenue Department had earlier ordered a crackdown on
the practice of payment adopted by MNCs with regard to the
emoluments of their employees. It found that in several cases part
of the wage bill was paid by the company in their parent country
because the income tax rates there were much lower.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that MNCs tend to underinvoice their exports from
India and overvalue the imports from their foreign affiliates
located in countries with low tax regimes. By transferring goods
back to India (through imports) at a higher price, the incidence
of tax on the domestic entity is considerably lowered.

<HEADLINE> Education Minister on Cooperation With Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Kaixuan, the minister in
charge of China's State Education Commission (SEC), said that it
will not interfere in Hong Kong's educational affairs, nor will it
establish any institution in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added in an interview with Xinhua: "The State Education
Commission and its Hong Kong counterpart will not be subordinate
to each other, according to the stipulations of the Basic Law and
the central government."
</P>
<P>
However, this does not mean that there will be no connection
between the two, he added, expressing confidence in the future of
their cooperation. He said that after the return of Hong Kong,
both sides will most certainly increase cooperation and supply
more talented people for the country.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between educational groups from both sides
has grown rapidly in recent years, and schools at different levels
have had many exchange programs involving mutual visits, study
tours, seminars, and summer camps.
</P>
<P>
Patriots from various walks of life in Hong Kong have been
especially helpful in the educational development of inland areas
for years, donating money, building schools, and setting up funds,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Schools and institutions under the State Education Commission
organized trips involving 2,500 people to Hong Kong in 1996, while
more than 2,000 people from Hong Kong visited inland areas, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Import Refined Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Petroleum
Enterprise announced Monday that Ethiopia was making preparations
for importing refined petroleum as the Assab Oil Refinery will
stop operation starting from August 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Yigzaw Mekennen, general manager
of the enterprise following an agreement reached between Ethiopia
and Eritrea with regard to the cost effectiveness of importing
petroleum rather than using the refinery.
</P>
<P>
A local report said, the cost for petroleum refining at the
Assab Oil Refinery has been rising each year whereas that of the
imported oil was declining. The cost for a metric ton of refined
petroleum at Assab in the first quarter of the year was 520 Birr
(about 57 U.S. Dollars), much higher than that of the same amount
of imported oil.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has already begun importing oil via Djibouti.

ZHENGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China is putting the final
touches on flood-prevention efforts on the Yellow River, the
country's second largest, which has been lying tamed for about 50
years.
</P>
<P>
But the river bed has continued to rise, increasing the
potential for flooding.
</P>

banks, according to an official from the Yellow River Anti-Flood
and Drought-Control Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Henan and Shandong provinces, which lie along the lower reaches

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A report released by east China's
Anhui Province shows that environmental protection in the Huaihe
River valley has improved.
</P>
<P>
The province straddles the middle section of the river and
pollution from its upper reaches has made pollution control work
more difficult. So, since last year, the government has taken a
number of measures to increase pollution controls, officials
say. They studied all pollution sources and asked 2,686 polluters
to meet state standards within a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province shut down 458 small factories with
serious pollution problems, and increased spending on
environmental protection and strengthened local environmental
control departments.
</P>
<P>
The province has gotten nearly 10 million US dollars from
overseas to help with its pollution control work, and the World
Bank has offered 60 million dollars in loans to the province's
river pollution control project.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Xiamen has ordered a
number of heavily polluting factories to stop production as part
of its efforts to make the city a model in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The factories are mainly situated near the city's two big water
sources. Eight of them have been fined and 31 asked to improve
within a prescribed time limit.
</P>
<P>
Industrial pollution is one of the major reasons for a
deteriorating urban environment, but pollution controls have meant
that the city's environmental quality has been kept at the level
of the 1980s while it enjoys rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The city has since the beginning of this year intensified its
efforts to fight pollution. It has closed 28 factories with
serious pollution problems last year, and the result of follow-up
study showed that nearly 86 percent of them are operating better.

MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- World champions Brazil fought
back from two goals down to beat understrength Mexico 3-2 in an
enthralling Copa America match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This victory in the group C games has ensured Brazil a place in
the quarter-finals with six points from two games. Mexico have
three and their fate will be decided Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two first-half goals by striker Luis Hernandez put Mexico on
top. But Brazil replied through Aldair and a superb Romario
effort in the first 15 minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
A stunning left-foot strike by Leonardo 10 minutes from the end
sealed the Brazilian triumph in a match that served up the best of
Latin American football in what has been a generally lackluster
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Mexico fielded only about half of their regular team. Brazil,
who do not have to play the qualifiers as world champions, have
brought all their top players.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Good to Sino-British Ties: Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Tom McNally, a member of the
British House of Lords (the upper house), today urged the British
people to be more positive and see the return of Hong Kong to its
motherland as an opportunity to widen the range of contacts
between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Baron McNally said the return of
Hong Kong should and could be used as an opportunity to develop
new and deeper relations with China.
</P>
<P>
McNally warned that the next few weeks before July 1, when
China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, were
delicate and sensitive for the British and Chinese relations. The
issue should be handled carefully as some British people were
nostalgic and backward looking.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we've got to make sure of is that the way issues
are raised in the country, particularly in the next few weeks, is
in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, I don't think the problem exists, because
in the longer term, it is so obviously in Britain's interest to
build good relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will still be important in those contacts (between
the two countries) and still be an important point of entry for
anybody who wishes to enter China" for business, said McNally, who
served as political adviser to the Labor prime minister in 1976-79
(James Callaghan).
</P>
<P>
He admitted that because of Britain's Hong Kong
responsibilities, Britain had not been able to take a "broader"
look at relations with China. "Hong Kong, in a way, has been
distortion of our link with China."
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that disputes arose sometimes between Britain
and China on the Hong Kong issue, he was confident Hong Kong's
future would be bright because it would still retain the advantage
of being the most attractive gateway to China for many Western
countries and many Western enterprises.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, "we will have the
advantage of being integrated into a wider Chinese market and
society," McNally added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about some negative reports over Hong Kong's return in
British newspapers recently, McNally said it was easy to make
noises about Hong Kong and to play anti-Chinese sentiment in some
of British media. "But it doesn't do anything for the people of
Hong Kong; it doesn't do anything for the broader relations with
China which are in the interests of both Britain and China."
</P>
<P>
"I do think there are those in government, in parliament, and
in business who will be looking for a new approach to relations
with China and I am optimistic those are the views that will
prevail."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the future policies of Britain's new Labor
government, he said Labor came to office very close to the
transfer of power, and it could not change anything in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong
Kong, signed by the British Conservative government and China on
December 19, 1984, he said:"My view is that Labor wants to honor
the agreement."
</P>
<P>
McNally said the Labor government will be sensitive to opinion
back home, but "I don't think it will want to damage the long-term
and broad relations with China. I think in the contrary, Labor
wants good and positive relations."
</P>
<P>
He added that Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook had all indicated that policy clearly. "They wish to
establish, very quickly, very positive and business-like links
with China at both political and business levels."
</P>
<P>
On future relations between the two countries, McNally said
there were no major obstacles on the road to better ties. He hoped
what happened next after the hand-over would be a positive impetus
to boost ties with China and increase trade and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope there will be, at a reasonable time after the
hand-over, some high-level visits, and there will be real efforts
to identify areas of opportunities for increasing trade and
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
McNally dubbed as unnecessary fears that China would not keep
its commitments and would meddle in Hong Kong's administrative
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that China has an excellent record of honoring its
international obligations, and I see no reason why that shouldn't
be the case for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said China's dynamic and fast-growing economy had offered a
wide range of possibilities for Britain, including cooperation in
the fields of culture, tourism, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the return of Hong Kong to China will usher in a new
era for British-Chinese relations," he said confidently.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Magurchhara Gasfield Still Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The gas-ignited devastating fire is
still out of control but the height of flame showed some reduction
for the third day today in Magurchhara Gasfield in northeastern
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Two fire fighting teams from Singapore and the United States
are expected today to begin their fighting against the biggest
gasfield fire, which erupted early Sunday following a massive
explosion in a gas well in the gasfield being operated by
Occidental of Bangladesh Ltd, a United States Company.
</P>
<P>
Witness said that the heat of the fire can be felt from a
distance of one kilometer and at night, the flames illuminate an
area of at least five kilometers. The flame is even visible from
Moulvibazar town, 26 kms away from the gasfield.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Noor Uddin Khan, who visited the gasfield
Monday morning, told the parliament that the massive fire has
caused no loss of life though it has damaged half a kilometer rail
track and the drilling rig and other accessories of the drilling
company.
</P>
<P>
The extent of damage was limited to a rig, few other drilling
equipment and the investment made by the Occidental for the
drilling, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The fire would not affect the reserve of the field, estimated
at about half a trillion cubic feet, he added.
</P>
<P>
A high-level inquiry committee, comprising representatives from
local administration and Occidental, has been formed to
investigate the cause of the devastating fire.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers said the fire broke out as gas was found at a
very early stage of drilling while they thought it would take very
deep digging.
</P>
<P>
There were two explosions of such type in Sylhet in the 1950s
and in Chittagong in the 1960s respectively, but the fires caused
by these blasts were not as big as the present one.

<HEADLINE> Former Sri Lankan Minister Detained under Security Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former minister of the previous
United National Party (UNP) regime of Sri Lanka Sirisena Cooray
was detained Monday on the orders of Defense Secretary Chandananda
de Silva, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said he is being held in a government building in
Colombo on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Cooray is also the head of a recently established controversial
R. Premadasa (former President of Sri Lanka) Center which has
planned major ceremonies in Colombo on June 29, the birth
anniversary of late president Premadasa who were assassinated on
May 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he was detained, the sources said the action is taken
under the Public Security Act.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the government is most likely to ban the
ceremony for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, Colombo police ordered Cooray to surrender a
personal weapon issued to him about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since May this year, he has been organizing the Premadasa
Center and prepared for the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Cooray was minister of housing and local government and
 confidant of assassinated president Ranasinghe Premadasa of the
 UNP.
</P>
<P>
 The UNP's 17 year reign ended in 1994 when the ruling
 People's Alliance won presidential and general elections.
</P>
<P>
 Cooray returned to the island country in April after a
lengthy stay
 abroad.

growing area of cocaine, which is mainly trafficked to Europe and
the U.S. by sea.
</P>
<P>
The total of all kinds of cannabis products seized in 1996
amounted to 807,633 kilos, less than the 1,278,321 kilos of 1995.
Many countries in the world are growing marijuana, which mainly
goes to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan route is a main passageway, through which, the
heroin seized in 1996 reached 4.8 tons, amounting to 48 percent of
the total heroin all over the world, the report says. About three
tons of heroin was seized in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is still one of the biggest illegal poppy straw growing
areas in the world, and Afghanistan is the biggest one in Western
Asia, the report says.
</P>
<P>
A disturbing trend is that the psychotropic substances for
medical use seized in customs increased sharply, far exceeding the
amount of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President to Attend Mercosur Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei is
to join the presidents of the four Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) countries at a summit in the Paraguayan capital
Asuncion on Thursday, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
said today.
</P>
<P>
The presidents, from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
will discuss a common proposal to form a Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA), Insulza told the press.
</P>
<P>
Although Chile is not a full member of Mercosur, it has
associate membership and in the past has only been invited to take
part in the final stages of summit forums.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina's vice president has previously stated that
Chile should take part in negotiations to form the FTAA on
Mercosur's side and this time, President Frei has been invited to
take part in the summit, Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's "complete alignment" with Mercosur vis-a-vis the FTAA
negotiations "has always been our policy and President Frei and I
have been extremely explicit about this," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with the current invitation for
President Frei to attend this summit together with the four
Mercosur presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in
the Asuncion meeting," said Insulza.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged To Dig Into Grassroots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are being urged to
pitch in at the grassroots level with practical help for the rural
poor.
</P>
<P>
Scientific research centers across China are to step up the
dissemination of up-to-date farming techniques in poverty-stricken
areas, focusing on skills necessary to improve the planting,
breeding and processing of agricultural and animal products --
down-to-earth work.
</P>
<P>
And regional scientific centers are to send experts to poor
areas to conduct in-depth research on local natural resources and
work out regional scientific development plans and upgrade pillar
industries.
</P>
<P>
The country's scientists were called on to do more to help the
nation's poverty-alleviation program in a document released Monday
by the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Association for Science
and Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to technologies for increasing the
production of grain, cotton, edible oil, animal husbandry, aquatic
products and forestry, the document detailed.
</P>
<P>
Based on local natural resources, impoverished areas have
developed industries over the past few years which have helped
many farmers rise above the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
But product-quality is relatively poor because of outdated
technologies.
</P>
<P>
An average of 6,000 scientific research findings have been made
annually during the past few years. Only a few are applicable to
areas with harsh eco-systems and difficult geographic
environments, said Zhang Jingan, an official at the Technology
Development Center for Rural Areas under the SSTC.

MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government posted a
fiscal surplus of 4.9 billion pesos (187 million U.S. dollars)
during the first five months this year, a 61-percent decline from
the year-ago level, the local newspaper Business World said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a government report on the national cash budget
performance, the paper said the level was also
lower-than-expected.
</P>
<P>
The government, which recorded a surplus of 12.6 billion pesos
(481 million dollars) for the same period last year, had expected
a surplus of 11.3 billion pesos (431 million dollars) for the
first five months this year.
</P>
<P>
For the entire year, the government has targeted a surplus of
13 billion pesos (496 million dollars) with revenues projected at
483 billion pesos (18.4 billion dollars) and expenditures at 470
billion pesos (17.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The paper said the drop in the fiscal surplus was a result of
decreased revenues registered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue
and the Bureau of Customs during the period.

city's environment has seen some improvement.
</P>
<P>
The city increased spending on pollution controls, putting
78.15 million yuan into it during the 1991-1995 period. Ten
chemical enterprises that discharged 70 percent of the city's
industrial waste water have all improved their pollution controls
and the city's industrial waste water discharge is 20 percent
less than the average for the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Some factories have also increased their capacity to recycle
waste. The city got a total of 19.7 million yuan from recycling

bicycle by Tamil rebels was set off Monday in Vavuniya town in
Northern province of Sri Lanka.

MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin said here that Hong Kong's return to China was the
accomplishment achieved under the policies carried out by its
leaders, and a "historic victory for justice."
</P>
<P>
Karasin made the remarks when interviewed jointly by
correspondents from Xinhua and the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said the process itself of Hong
Kong's return to China was unique. Though it had been very
complicated settling the Hong Kong issue, and it had taken a
fairly long time, generally-speaking, the transition had been
smooth and without upheaval, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the transition had been solved successfully, and
the interests of all sides had been attended to in the
process. The principles of international norms had been observed,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said Deng Xiaoping, the general architect of China's
reform and opening up, adopted creative attitudes, and found the
solution to this complicated issue. His "one country, two systems"
concept had provided all sides concerned with the solution to Hong
Kong's smooth transition to its motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that what was important was that the "one country, two
systems" principle would be implemented in Hong Kong, China's
Special Administrative Region, from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said he believed Hong Kong would remain an active
participant in Russian-Chinese economic cooperation after July 1,
1997.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Preparations in Ecuador in Face of "El Nino" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran authorities will undertake
this week an emergency disaster program to prevent the arrival of
the "el nino" weather phenomenon which will cause floods,
mudslides and epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Ministry is preparing a campaign to assist
all those who could be affected by the natural disaster, the "El
Telegrafo" newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Social Welfare Minister Gonzalo Baquero Paret said that
flyers and videos will be used to disseminate the program.
</P>
<P>
El nino, which appears cyclically, warms the waters off the
Pacific coast of Ecuador which later dumps enormous amounts of
rain on the American continent which causes flooding.
</P>
<P>
The National Council for the Control of Narcotic and
Psychotropic Substances (CONSEP, its acronym in Spanish) will
provide two vehicles to be used as mobile hospitals and another
two for transporting food.
</P>
<P>
Social Welfare Ministry authorities are considering a special
program to look after about 4,000 victims in each of the provinces
of Guayas, El Oro and Los Rios.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the situations presented by El Nino
in 1982 and 1992 in Ecuador were taken into consideration for
designing this emergency program.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Minister Asdrubal de la Torre Moran will sign
an agreement with World Bank representatives to initiate an
emergency program and to prevent the outbreak of epidemics caused
by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition entitled Hong
Kong's History and Its Evolution opened here today, a couple of
weeks before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over the
region on July 1 to end Britain's 150-year colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, co-organized by the Chinese Embassy with the
Belgian Kingdom and the Belgium-China Cultural center, is composed
of four parts -- Hong Kong's history, its ties with the inland
areas, the process of transfer of power and today's Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 dignitaries attended the opening ceremony, at
which the Chinese Ambassador to the Belgian Kingdom, Song
Mingjiang, and Vice-President of the Belgium-China Cultural center
Bernard Dewit delivered speeches.
</P>
<P>
Song said the Chinese government could not only guarantee a
peaceful and smooth transfer of power over Hong Kong but also
could ensure the territory's long-term stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful resolution of the Hong Kong issue had set a new
example for resolving international disputes of the same nature,
particularly issues which had been left over historically between
countries.
</P>
<P>
Dewit said he was convinced the Chinese government would
respect the Fundamental Law, which stipulated that the Special
Administrative Region of Hong Kong would enjoy an elevated degree
of autonomy and that both its systems and living style would
remain unchanged over the next 50 years.

ZHENGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The shooting of a 20-episode TV
series featuring the history of the Yandi and Huangdi period has
started in central China's Henan Province, one of the origins of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
By employing the research results of this period of history and
the numerous relics and historical documents, the TV series
successfully portrays the achievements of the ancestors of the
Chinese nation 5,000-7,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During this semi-legendary historical period, the Chinese
ancients already developed farm production and the manufacture of
bronze and copper; the dragon totem already took shape.
</P>
<P>
The program produces a large amount of facts to illustrate the
distribution and development of the descendants of Yandi and
Huangdi and substantiate the fact that Yandi and Huangdi are
the common ancestors of the people of all nationalities of the
Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica To Defend Its Banana Quotas With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will defend the banana
quota it negotiated with the European Union (EU) through the
framework agreement signed on March 28, 1994, foreign trade
authorities said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the banana agreement signed among the EU and Costa Rica,
Colombia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, the EU granted Costa Rican
banana growers 23.4 percent of Latin American imports, according
to local press report today.
</P>
<P>
On September 27, 1995, the United States, Mexico, Honduras and
Guatemala denounced the EU'S fruit import system as discriminatory
before the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
To defend this Central American country's quota, Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Manuel Salazar will visit European countries this
coming July.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said that Costa Rica is permanently in movement to
defend the framework agreement it signed with the EU.
</P>
<P>
For this year at least, there will be no changes in the banana
trade with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Bananas are Costa Rica's principal export product and the
second largest generator of hard currency after tourism. In
1996 revenues from overseas banana sales totaled 611.4 million
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
says he will consider extending a national apology to black
Americans for slavery, but not compensation for their ancestors'
suffering.
</P>
<P>
"It's been so long and we're so many generations removed," he
says in a radio interview aired Monday.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an apology came from a white Ohio lawmaker who
introduced apology legislation in Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the apology proposal caught him off guard. He said
he would think about it because "there's still some unfinished
business out there among black and white Americans."
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to be dealt with," Clinton told the American
Urban Radio Network. "I think this would be a helpful debate."
</P>
<P>
Slavery was a central theme in the consultations that Clinton
made with activists, scholars and other experts in drafting his
plan for a national dialogue on race. Their advice was that
Clinton first address the lingering wounds of slavery, then try to
resolve the array of racial problems that stem from it.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton "really hasn't
taken a position" on a slavery apology. "But he will look at it in
due course."
</P>
<P>
John Hope Franklin, the historian heading Clinton's advisory
board on race, told reporters over the weekend that Americans need
to expunge "the ideological underpinnings of slavery" that
fostered a belief that black people are "physiologically and
intellectually and ethically inferior."

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for World Attention to Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations marked the World
Day to Combat Desertification today by calling on the
international community to make further efforts to stop land
degradation and to improve food security in the African Sahel and
in other dryland regions.
</P>
<P>
Land degradation is the leading cause of poverty in the
world's most arid regions, according to a UN press release. Over
250 million people are directly affected by desertification, and
some one billion more are at risk.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa alone, 400 million people live in the dryland
zones," Executive Secretary of the Interim Secretariat for the
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Arba Diallo
points out. "They need international support so that they can
adopt sustainable agriculture and land management. It is difficult
for people struggling for their daily bread to make such a major
transition alone."
</P>
<P>
Some 65 percent of Africa's total land area consists of
drylands, with one third of that hyper-arid desert and the rest
arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid land. These drylands experience
recurrent droughts -- and with each drought cycle, desertification
increases. As a result, 36 countries in Africa are affected by
drought or by some degree of degradation.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen many positive trends in Africa over the last 20
years," Diallo notes. "Combating land degradation and the poverty
and food insecurity that goes with it is probably the best tool
the world community has to promote political stability, strengthen
civil society, and eliminate conflict and violence in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Africa is not the only continent afflicted by dryland
degradation, the press release warns. Of the world's 1.9 billion
hectares affected by soil degradation, 850 million are in the
densely populated Asia and Pacific region, of which 86 million
hectares are drylands. Parts of Italy, Spain, and other European
countries also suffer, while the continent with the largest area
of damaged drylands is North America.
</P>
<P>
The first conference of the parties to the UN Convention to
Combat Desertification, and other interested countries is
scheduled from September 29 to October 10 in Rome.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Negotiated Solutions to Falkland Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN Special Committee on
Decolonization Monday asked Argentina and the United Kingdom to
resume negotiations, as soon as possible, towards a peaceful
resolution to the sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
Approving by consensus a draft resolution on the islands,
sponsored by Bolivia, Chile, Papua New Guinea and Venezuela, the
Special Committee reiterated that a peaceful and negotiated
settlement was the way to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
It also reiterated its firm support for the mission of good
offices of the Secretary-General to assist the parties to comply
with the General Assembly resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Guido Di Tella,
said in cases of contested sovereignty, territorial disputes
should be resolved first, with the applicability for the
self-determination principle being addressed at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the new British Government would enter into
dialogue. There was now a new opportunity for two friends to
resolve a colonial anachronism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The position of the United Kingdom is presented in the working
paper on the question of the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the 1996 session of the Assembly, the British
Secretary of State said his government had no doubt about
Britain's sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and the other
British territories in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he hoped the increasing cooperation between
Argentina and the United Kingdom would be further developed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Shootings in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today condemns the "callous murder" by the Irish Republican Army
of two British policemen in the British province of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said he condemns the "brutal
act of terrorism in the strongest possible terms," adding, "there
can be no reason, no excuse for these vicious crimes."
</P>
<P>
The policemen were shot as they walked yards from a police
station in Lurgan, south-west of Belfast. They were seriously
wounded and later died.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing patriotic or heroic about these killings. The
overwhelming majority of the people of Ireland, North and South
join me in repudiating violence and murder," Clinton affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Irish people know that a lasting peace "is
only possible through painful dialogue and negotiation," and
further violence "can only play into the hands of those
responsible for the vicious murders."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will continue to do all he can to support the
efforts of the Irish people and their political leaders who are
participating in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the killing, Clinton's Press Secretary Michael
McCurry also called on pro-British Loyalist guerrillas, who have
maintained a shaky truce since October 1994, not to retaliate for
the killings.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government of course will continue to call
on them to honor their own ceasefire and to avoid acts of
retaliation because that sends you into the downward spiral that
is all too familiar to the people of Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the contacts that we believe are helpful to
the process, but sooner or later it becomes clear who is willing
to help the process and who is not," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA ended its 18-month-long ceasefire with a bombing in
London in February 1996.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks End Record-Breaking Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks fell slightly
today, halting a six-day streak of record-breaking gains as
investors tried to hold onto their profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.95 points to close at
7,772.09. At one point, the blue-chip barometer hit a high of
7,795.16, but in the end, it failed to keep up with its blistering
recent pace.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has gained more than 20 percent this year, ending last
week with its sixth consecutive record finish.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers by a narrow
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 412.28
million shares as against 566.95 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list
rose 0.20 to close at a record 893.47. The Nasdaq composite index,
which has lagged other indicators, rose 8.97 to a record 1,432.00.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.16 to 465.01. The American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.93 to 628.17.
</P>
<P>
Investors pushed prices higher Friday after getting yet another
encouraging report that the economy is not overheating.
</P>
<P>
The string of six straight record closes for the Dow is
impressive but not near the record of 12, set in January 1987,
nine months before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes to Dispatch New Middle East Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan proposed today to dispatch Kieran Prendergast of Britain as
his Special Envoy to the Middle East, said a statement by the
spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
Kieran, born in 1942, has been serving as Under-Secretary-
General for Political Affairs since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Letters on the mission had been exchanged between the
Secretary-General and the Government of Israel, and a number of
consultations had been held between the Charge d'Affairs of Israel
and Mr. Kieran on the scope of the proposed mission, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the Government of Israel imposed
restrictions on the scope of the mission, which were unacceptable
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, it now appeared the mission would not take place
since the Secretary-General needed to report to the General
Assembly by 25 June, added the statement.

<HEADLINE> US Major Computer Makers to Introduce NetPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- At pre-view of the annual PC Expo
trade show here today, 11 big makers of personal computer,
including Compaq, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Dell displayed an
office-friendly model that is called low-cost alternative to
traditional personal computer.
</P>
<P>
Called the NetPC, the new machine has a hard disk drive, memory
and an Intel chip, but it is missing floppy and compact disk
drives to add software and has no expansion slots to add hardware
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
The NetPC is a response to the network computer, or NC, which
has been championed by Sun Microsystem, Oracle Corporation and
I.B.M. The NetPC, which runs Mirosoft's Windows, requires no
investment in new software, unlike the NC. It also has the added
attraction to Sun, Oracle and I.B.M. of being able to use a
variety of microprocessors and operating system software, thereby
challenging the Intel-Microsoft duopoly.
</P>
<P>
Corporate buyers have long complained about the high costs
associated with managing large numbers of personal computers.
expensive staffs are needed to answer questions, untangle hardware
and software conflicts introduced by enterprising employees, and
even do such simple tasks as adding new software.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts maintain that it is not likely that the NetPC
will emerge as much of a threat to the traditional PC. They
estimate that there will be about seven million NetPC's and NC's
sold in the year 2000, compared with more than 100 million
personal computers.

<HEADLINE> Study: Immigrant Children More Successful in Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Children of immigrants in the
United States have better grades and lower dropout rates in public
schools than those who were born in the United States, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Michigan State and Princeton
universities and reported in the Los Angeles Times today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers followed 5,000 children in San Diego and Miami
starting in 1991, choosing a sample that represented the immigrant
population in terms of national origin. The children had at least
one foreign-born parent.
</P>
<P>
The grade-point averages (GPAs) of the children were higher
than the district's 133,000 students as a whole. While 29 percent
of all ninth-graders in the district had GPAs higher than 3.0, 44
percent of immigrant children did so. In the 12th grade, 46
percent of all students had at least a "B" average, while 50
percent of immigrant children performed that well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only 5.7 percent of the immigrants' children
dropped out, compared with 16.2 percent districtwide.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that immigrant youths placed a high value
on schooling, with more than 90 percent agreeing that a good
education is essential to upward mobility. As high as 63 percent
of Asians and 52 percent of non-Mexican Hispanics said they would
like to earn an advanced degree.
</P>
<P>
Immigrant youths prefer to identify themselves with their
nation of origin are increasing, the study found. In 1992, 43
percent of them chose a hyphenated identity (such as
"Chinese-American") while 32 percent preferred a national origin
label ("Chinese") and 16 percent chose "pan-ethnic" labels
(Asian," "Hispanic"). Only 3 percent chose the plain American
identity.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the percentage preferring to call themselves merely
Americans in San Diego dropped by half to 1.6 percent by 1995,
while those favoring hyphenated labels dropped by a quarter, to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Perception, experiences and expectations of racial
discrimination also increased between 1992 and 1995. By 1995, the
percentage saying they expect to be discriminated against--despite
their educational level--grew from 36 percent to 40 percent.

LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Europe's major stock
