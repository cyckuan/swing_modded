<HEADLINE> Music Sales Growth Forecast in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The music industry is poised for
dramatic sales growth in Latin American and Eastern European
countries over the next decade, according to report of a market
research company.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the Market Tracking International, said
that the music sales are expected to increase by 167 percent in
Latin America and by 322 percent in Eastern Europe by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Asia has been one of the music industry's most fertile new
music markets of the 1990s, reflecting the region's buoyancy and
reforms of inward investment controls, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report predicted that Latin America and Eastern
Europe are set to show equally aggressive growth over the next few
years, as economic conditions improve and record companies step up
efforts to curb piracy.
</P>
<P>
Music sales rose sharply in Latin America last year
particularly in Brazil, where some 1.39 billion dollars worth of
recordings were sold, 33 percent up on the previous year, the
report said. Some 483 million albums with a retail value of 6.7
billion U.S. dollars would be sold in the region during 2005.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe, which is set for even stronger growth, will see
349 million albums with a retail value of 2.7 billion dollars sold
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The report expected particularly aggressive growth in the
Balkan and former Soviet republics, with Russia tipped to become
Eastern Europe's largest market, selling 1.4 billion dollars worth
of recordings in 2005.

<HEADLINE> East Asia, Pacific to Lead World in Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The East Asia and Pacific region is
set to become the world's biggest regional supplier of travelers,
according to a report of the World Tourism Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The number of trips taken by people living in the East Asia and
Pacific region outstripped those taken by North America for the
first time last year, the WTO report said.
</P>
<P>
Travel from East Asia and the Pacific grew by 8 percent, much
higher than from any other part of the world, to 94 million trips
last year, the report said. North Americans made 92 million trips
abroad over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the emerging economies of China, South
Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are producing most
of the region's new international travelers.
</P>
<P>
"More than 5 million Chinese traveled abroad in 1996; their
strong desire to travel, coupled with steady economic growth,
could soon make China the dominant player in the region's
tourism," a WTO official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travel to East Asia and the Pacific grew by 9.3
percent to 87 million visits last year, but the report warned that
the region's tourism could be held back by airport congestion.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from international tourism increased by 9.8 percent to
81 billion U.S. dollars, the report said. Receipts from Hong Kong
and China's inland areas totaled 21 billion dollars last year,
making it the fifth biggest tourism earner after the United States,
Spain, France and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Inter Milan Beats Sing Tao in HK Soccer International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer giants Inter
Milan trounced Hong Kong's first division side of Sing Tao 8-0 in
the China-HK Telelink Cup International Football Tournament here
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The tournament at the Hong Kong Stadium today was one of the
major sporting events before Hong Kong's handover at midnight on
June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic move for the local sports fans, the 13-time
Italian league champions readily brought their sensational
full-strength line-up to Asia for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Among the big names on the team are Ivan Zamorano from Chile,
Aron Winter from the Netherlands, Paul Ince from England, Youri
Djorkaeff and Jocelyn Angloma from France, and Nicola Berti,
Salvatore Fresi and Gianluca Pagliuca from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao has been very successful this season, with victories
in the Viceroy Cup, Regional Council Cup and F.A. President Cup
sevens. In the F.A. Cup, the other major Cup tournament of the
local sport, Sing Tao finished runners-up to Instant Dict.
</P>
<P>
Although the local side was reinforced today by such guest
players as Mark Wright, the former England captain and current
captain of Liverpool, and John Barnes, also from England, the
Italians were too much for the Sing Tao team.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan led the first half 3-0, with all the goals scored
by right winger Maurizio Ganz.
</P>
<P>
The Italians went on with their fast and well-coordinated
offensives in the second half. After a goal by Zamorano only three
minutes after the break, the Italians found the net four more
times in the last 20 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan will continue their Asian tour on Friday, when they
leave here for Bangkok, for Thailand's Premier Cup.

<HEADLINE> Quebec to Seek More French-Speaking Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Quebec government is planning
to increase the number of French-speaking immigrants to the
province, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed increasing the number of
independent immigrants from 82,169 in 1995-97 to a maximum of
93,400 over the next three years and making knowledge of French a
major criterion.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-97 period, the Quebec provincial government
selected only one of every two immigrants, while the other was
chosen by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-2000 period, Quebec will use an immigration
agreement with the federal government to select 57 percent of the
total number of immigrants and make knowledge of French an even
more important selection criteria.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be able to see these people integrate to the Quebec
society and participate and work and give, as they want to do, to
the Quebec society," Andre Boisclair, Quebec's minister of
immigration, was quoted by the Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 13 percent of immigrants to Canada
choose to live in Quebec, which has less than a quarter of the
Canadian population.
</P>
<P>
The province complained that the federal government is slow to
clarify the status of refugees in the province and the federal
tariffs on immigrants cost twice as much for an immigrant to come
to Quebec than to provinces without control of immigrant
selection.
</P>
<P>
It denied the suggestion that immigrants turn down Quebec
because of the debate over the province's political future.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent government survey, 52 percent of
respondents supported maintaining the current level of immigrants
to Quebec, while 10 percent supported increasing the number.

<HEADLINE> Canada Develops New Technique to Keep Donor Hearts Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A simple treatment developed at
Canada's Toronto Hospital more than doubles the time a donor heart
can be kept healthy before transplant, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christopher Feindel, surgical director of the hospital's
heart-transplant program, has found that keeping blood coursing
through the heart protects its cells for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
This will make it possible to transport a donor heart over a
long distance and will make transplants easier and safer.
</P>
<P>
The current practice is for a heart removed from a donor to be
placed on ice for transport. While cooling slows the deterioration
of cells, within four hours, the organ is no longer usable for
transplant.
</P>
<P>
The new technique is a variation of a procedure known as
perfusion. Three liters of blood taken from the body of the donor
during removal of the heart are filtered to remove any clots and
are placed in blood bags.
</P>
<P>
From there, the blood is then slowly run back into the heart
through a small tube during transport. Only plastic bags and
standard blood transfusion equipment are required.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely simple idea. It hasn't been done before
because people always looked at complicated technology," Dr.
Feindel was quoted by the Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea by asking: `Why not eliminate the
equipment and just use the blood that would otherwise be lost from
the donor? Any hospital has the facilities to do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He has tested the technique on animal heart in the laboratory,
and results showed transplanted hearts had better recovery with
the transfusion technique than they did with the standard method.
</P>
<P>
The finding was reported today in the Journal of Heart and Lung
Transportation.

<HEADLINE> Convention Urges to Protect Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The parties to the ongoing 10th
Conference of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) in Harare urged to protect bears.
</P>
<P>
The CITES conference drafted a resolution saying that
immediate action should be taken to ''demonstrably'' reduce
illegal trade in bear parts and derivatives to avoid possible
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Noting that long-term solution to conserve bears required
substantive and measurable actions, the conference said this
should be done before the next biennial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so could result in extinction of certain bear
populations or species, says the draft resolution made available
during the 12-day conference, which began on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The bear could be saved from extinction by improving national
legislation to control imports and exports of bear parts and products
through harsh penalties to deter illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution also called for ''new national efforts'' in
key producer and consumer countries to identify and eliminate illegal
markets notwithstanding the need to exchange techniques and
intelligence. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Africa Fails to Re-open Rhino Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today narrowly lost its
bid to lift restrictions on trade in rhino horn and other derivatives
of the southern white rhino.
</P>
<P>
The proposal put forward by South Africa to the ongoing 10th
conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) in Harare was for the amendment of annotation 503 to
allow commercial trade in rhino horn subject to imposition of a zero
export quota between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Voting was done by show of hands with South Africa getting 60
votes in its favour and 32 against, narrowly missing the
required two-third majority.
</P>
<P>
The CITES deliberations have been delayed because of lengthy
interventions by parties on such controversial issues as the
elephant, the whale and the rhino.
</P>
<P>
It was the contention of those who opposed South Africa's
proposal that reopening trade in rhino horn even without export
quotas would send the wrong message to illegal traders.
</P>
<P>
India said most rhino horn consuming countries, which used the
horn in traditional medicines, were making progress in finding
alternatives to the product and these efforts would be derailed if
trade was reopened. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hk to Be Real Democratic after Handover: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed said here Wednesday that real democracy and freedom will
be obtained in Hong Kong only after the Chinese government resumes
the exercise of sovereignty over it.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from a Xinhua journalist at a news
conference this afternoon, Mahathir pointed out that during more
than 100 years of Britain's colonial rule, "the British have never
given Hong Kong any freedom at all" and only after the handover
Hong Kong will become free and democratic.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, the prime
minister said that for a long time the British exercised colonial
rule there and have never given Hong Kong any freedom at
all. "There was no elections that could suggest free will," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon Hong Kong will be under the sovereignty of
China. Only at that time it will certainly become democratic,"
Mahathir added.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader believed that Hong Kong will be a "real
democracy" because only "100 days ago it was given to Hong Kong a
free choice to decide who should be its chief executive (after
July 1)."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir left here Wednesday afternoon, widing up the first
official visit to Lebanon by a Malaysian head of government.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan announced here today that he had submitted his
resignation to President Suleyman Demirel and would hand over power
to his junior partner center-right True Path Party (DYP)
Chairwoman Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Following two and a half hours of talks today with Ciller and
Grand Unity Party (BBP) leader Mushin Yazicioglu, Erbakan told
reporters that he had agreed to step down as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Islamic Welfare Party (RP), DYP and BBP now
hold a majority in the parliament and a new coalition government
would be formed with the support of BBP.
</P>
<P>
On his part, BBP leader Yazicioglu said it is possible that the
DYP and RP will form a new coalition government, adding that his
party will support the new government from outside.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, also the Welfare Party leader, believed that Ciller
will head the new government in cooperation with the Islamists and
get a vote of confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, skeptics said this is impossible and the military will
never allow the RP to be in the government and Ciller to be the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who is deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has
said that she will ask the president to assign her with the task
of forming a new government, which she will lead until early
elections, whose date is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Four DYP ministers resigned in less than two months to
pressure Ciller to end the alliance with Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The RP and DYP formed the coalition government in June, 1996
and signed a power-sharing protocol which stipulated that Erbakan
would head the government for the first two years and then turn it
over to Ciller for the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
After one year in power, the government faced growing
impatience with Erbakan's inclination to inch the country toward
an Islamic entity and his reluctance to curb the fundamentalist
force in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The military and opposition regarded Erbakan's policies as a
most dangerous threat to Turkey's secularism enshrined in its
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Ciller and her party issued an ultimatum to
Erbakan, asking him to hand out power before June 18 or to face a
collapse of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Following several rounds of talks, both Erbakan and Ciller said
that a new RP-DYP coalition will be formed with the help of the
(BBP), which has eight deputies in the parliament, and will
definitely obtain a vote of confidence to govern.

Erbakan said here today that President Suleyman Demirel had
approved his resignation.
</P>
<P>
This sealed the end of the 54th government of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, leader of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), made the

the service of Erbakan during his 54th coalition government and
asked him to continue his duty until a new government is
formed.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan decided to step down after 2.5-hour-long talks with his
junior partner center-right True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu
Ciller and Grand Unity Party (BBP) Chairman Mushin Yazicioglu

<HEADLINE> UN Holds Meeting on Land-Locked, Transit Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of land-locked
and transit developing countries and their development partners
began here today.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the three-day meeting, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) had prepared an
issues paper as well as a series of background documents which
highlight specific progress at the regional, subregional and
international levels towards improvements of transit transport
efficiency. A number of international institutions had also
prepared background documents outlining their activities on half
of the land-locked and transit developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD reported that though a number of improvements have
been made in recent years, transit costs for land-locked
developing countries remain far higher in most cases than those
facing coastal countries, and higher still when compared with the
similar costs facing developed countries. For example, land-locked
countries have a freight-to-import ratio of 17.4 percent, compared
to 8.1 percent for other countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At its 50th session in 1995, the General Assembly, as part of
the preparations for the present meeting, called for subregional
consultative meetings between land-locked and transit developing
countries to agree on priority areas for future action.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the UNCTAD and the United Nations Development
Program, the first of such meetings concerning the northeast Asian
subregion was held in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, on May 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Ulan Bator meeting was a Memorandum of
Understanding between China, Mongolia and the Russian Federation,
which outlines proposals for a future program of action to improve
transit transport arrangements in the subregion. The memorandum
constituted a major breakthrough in cooperative arrangements
between those countries, the UNCTAD reported.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 land-locked developing countries and 27 transit
developing countries. In addition, two developed countries, South
Africa and the Russian Federation, serve as transit neighbors to
land-locked developing countries.

<HEADLINE> US Considers Mix of Nuclear Warhead Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
considering altering the mix of nuclear warheads on submarines,
bombers and missiles to lower the cost of the arsenal, the
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior U.S. officials as saying that one
option under review by the Joint Chiefs of Staff would cut the
number of deployed high-cost ballistic missile submarines and
increase the number of warheads based on cheaper but more
vulnerable land-based missiles and strategic bombers.
</P>
<P>
If the plan was implemented, the cost of maintaining a total
strategic stockpile of more than 10,000 nuclear warheads, of which
6,000 are currently deployed, would be cut by some 10 billion U.S.
dollars between 1998 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government wants to maintain the present size of the
nuclear arsenal to keep pressure on the Russian legislature for
ratification of the 1993 START II treaty, which sets a ceiling of
3,500 nuclear warheads. But it hopes to reduce the cost.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Embassy Denies Participation in Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli embassy stressed here
today that there is no Israeli participation in the Turkish
military exercises, nor Israel has violated the sovereignty of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A written statement released here by the Embassy of Israel
said "there is no Israeli participation whatsoever in the
Turkish exercises, which, as reported by the media, are
currently being held in the Eastern Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued following the Cypriot government's
protest against the fresh violations of its territorial waters
and airspace by Turkish navy vessels and military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Ministry confirmed here Tuesday that nine
Turkish navy vessels, namely two frigates, two destroyers, two
missile boats and three submarines, docked Monday in the ports
of Turkish-controlled Kyrenia, on the island's northern coast, and
Famagusta, on the eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The vessels were taking part in the Turkish seaborne
military exercise "Sea Wolf '97".
</P>
<P>
The press reports have also said another five Turkish navy
vessels taking part in the same exercise sailed on Monday to
Haifa, Israel, where they will stay for four days.
</P>
<P>
But the Cyprus government did not mention whether Israel
has violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy statement reiterated that "Israel is not
violating the Flight Information Region (FIR) of Nicosia,
neither the territorial waters, nor the sovereignty of Cyprus."

<HEADLINE> Porsche, Harley-Dividson to Co-Produce Engines in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Stuttgart-based German sports car
manufacturer Porsche today announced its plan to co-produce
motorcycle engines in the United States with the US motorcycle
manufacturer Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
Under their signed agreement, each side would put 10 million US
dollars in the joint venture. The firm said the move was part of
its corporate strategy to seek growth through cooperation with
other companies.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that the joint engine plant would be built
in 1999 in Kansas City -- a step of Harley-Davidson's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Porsche has been designing engines for Harley for some years,
it was noted.
</P>
<P>
Porsche is projected to boost revenues in the current 1996-97
year ending July 31 by around 25 percent to some 3.5 billion marks
(2.1 billion US dollars) on car sales expected to exceed 30,000.
</P>
<P>
Harley-Davidson reported 1.53 billion dollars in revenues last
year, with profits at 166 million dollars on sales of 118,800
motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Posts Close Up to  S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Swazi Customs official today
denied a report that five posts on the South African border
would be closed to all traffic, saying only commercial traffic would
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Japhta Dlamini, Deputy Commissioner for Customs and Excise said the
five posts would be closed only to commercial traffic. The reason for
this was that they were not manned by Customs officers on the South
African side.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to restrict commercial traffic became necessary as
South Africa will soon introduce value added tax (VAT) collection at
all their borders to enable South African businesses to claim VAT
refunds for goods exported to Swaziland," Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
"But they can man only six of the 11 border posts, so five have to
be down-scaled for commercial travellers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six remaining border posts reportedly would
introduce VAT administration this year, and the other three next
year.
</P>
<P>
South African Customs spokesman Christo Henning, who earlier
announced the complete closure of the five border posts, confirmed
only commercial travellers would be affected.
</P>
<P>
Henning also cited security concerns including rampant crime and
the influx of smuggled and fake goods as reasons for restricting
commercial exit points.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the source of almost 90 percent of Swaziland's
imports, including foods. enditem

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives UAE for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 18(Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived here this afternoon on an official visit to the
Emirates in an effort to rally support for Palestine in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates is the second leg of his Gulf tour
which has taken him to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Eastern diplomats here said that Arafat was hoping the UAE and
other Gulf countries would use their influence on Washington to
stop the implementation of a U.S. House of Representatives vote on
recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's "undivided" capital.
</P>
<P>
Gulf countries have voice criticism over the U.S. resolution
which was passed Tuesday and a decision setting aside 100 million
dollars to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats also said during his tour in the region, Arafat
will request aid from some members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
which groups Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and
Oman.
</P>
<P>
Arafat began his tour as Israeli troops shot and wounded
dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank city of Hebron. Four
consecutive days of violence reflected a further setback in the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace talks came to a standstill after Israel
approved the construction of a controversial settlement building
in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to be the capital of
their future state.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Ivory Trade Still Rampant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ivory is still traded on black
market internally despite a 1989 ban on international trade in
the elephant product, animal rights organisation traffic said
here today.
</P>
<P>
It said the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) provides a very weak institutional mechanism to aid
the vital task of assessing the continuing illicit ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
To fill the information void, however, traffic had developed the
Bad Ivory Database System (BIDS). Preliminary BIDS investigations
had now revealed that the scale of illegal trade in ivory was cause
for concern.
</P>
<P>
It said, "seizures of ivory are ongoing and widespread,
especially in Africa, Europe and United States and parts of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, at least 69 tonnes of ivory and ivory
products had been confiscated worldwide since 1989, said traffic,
adding, "with recent additions to the database, the figure is now
closer to 100 tonnes.''
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 cases of major ivory seizures recorded for which final
destinations could be determined, 80 percent of the ivory was being
exported to Asian markets. Another 14 percent was seized
in Europe without a declared onward destination, with nearly half of
the volume originating in former Zaire and being exported to Spain, a
non-ivory consumer, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., India and Ivory Cost accounted for the remaining six
percent of the ivory seized, it said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic said the smuggling techniques included painting ivory
blocks black or brown to resemble wood.
</P>
<P>
Traffic urged tightening of the bad ivory data collection system,
and was now seeking the assistance of the cites secretariat and the
parties themselves to improve data collection. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S, Bolivia Fail to List Mahogany as Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Bolivia today lost their
bid to enforce control on trade in the big-leafed mahogany species
at the ongoing conference of Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to get the required two thirds
majority in secret ballot, with 67 votes in their favor and 45
against them.
</P>
<P>
Presenting its proposal, Bolivia said listing the big-leafed
mahogany under appendix ii would make it possible for producer and
consumer countries to come up with conservation methods that would
ensure its survival.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which is the largest consumer of big-leafed mahogany
timber, said while a number of the species' range states were engaged
in conservation programs, there was still need to list the species
in order to encourage these efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, countries like Malaysia, Brazil and Cameroon who made
interventions against the proposal said the international convention
was in danger of losing its relevance by resorting to listing all
species in fear of extinction. enditem

<HEADLINE> UN: Sustainable Goods, Services Mean Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A UN report launched here
today shows that there are real economic, social and environmental
benefits for developing country producers who target their
increasing demand for more sustainable produced goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
Titled Unlocking Trade Opportunities, the report was prepared
by the International Institute for Environment and Development for
the UN Department of Policy Co-ordination and Sustainable
Development.
</P>
<P>
The report presented 10 case studies where developing country
producers have gained export success from worldwide move towards
more sustainable consumption and production patterns.
</P>
<P>
Among the case studies, Century Textiles in India, which moved
quickly to phase out hazardous dyes, won a 10-15 percent price
premium and a growth in sales of 15 in the first year; Fridge
Master in Swaziland became Africa's first fridge maker to phase
out ozone depleting CFCs and increased sales threefold in South
Africa; and tourism initiatives in Jamaica and Senegal profile new
approaches that contribute community and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
Development assistance agencies, non-governmental organizations
and business customers of developing country producers can play
crucial roles in supporting their transition to production of more
sustainable goods and services by providing financial and
technical support to build their capacity, assisting in the
certification process, offering credit facilities and developing
long-term relationships with producers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Governments could greatly increase the potential for increased
export of environmentally and socially preferable products by
eliminating regulations, subsidies and trade barriers which
currently hinder market access, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Development of clear guidelines for transparency, consultation
and phasing in of proposed environmental regulations by developed
country governments would greatly assist developing country
exporters, the report stressed.

WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The suspect in the 1993
terrorist attack outside CIA headquarters, Mir Aimal Kansi, has
been ordered held without bond at an arraignment in Fairfax County
court, some 40 kilometers west of Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
Kansi, a Pakistani native who was captured and returned to the
United States Tuesday night, was arraigned on two counts of
capital murder, three counts of maiming, and five counts of using
a firearm in the commission of a felony.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Kansi could be sentenced to death. He was accused

<HEADLINE> Iran to Turn Border Area into Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities announced here
today that they want to turn the Sarakhs special trade area
bordering Turkmenistan into a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the announcement
was made by the High Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones
headed by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that a proposal in this regard has been presented to
the government and, if approved, Sarakhs will be a welcome
addition to the three existing free trade zones -- Kish Island,
Qeshm Island and Chabahar.
</P>
<P>
The three free trade zones are all situated off the southern
coast of the country near the strategically important strait of
Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the council also decided to declare other four areas
as special economic zones -- the Imam Khomeini industrial complex
at the port of the same name on the Persian Gulf, the Amir-Abad
port on the Caspian Sea, Jolfa in East Azarbaijan province near
the Armenian border, and the area which contains the historic
Ark-e-Bam Citadel in Kerman province, southeastern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of special economic areas is aimed at promoting
investments and non-oil exports, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to accelerate development in the free trade zones, the
Central Bank of Iran (CBI) announced last month that private
interests are allowed to partner up with the public sector to set
up banks there.
</P>
<P>
CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh said "Foreign banks are also
allowed to open branches at the free trade zones and the domestic
banks are entitled to perform external operations there."
</P>
<P>
Iran has formulated a series of regulations and rules regarding
investment, customs, import and export business, monetary and
banking operations, and utilization of land and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Despite strenuous efforts by the government, including its
pledge to guarantee security of foreign investments, Iran has made
little progress in luring capital from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Premier Resigns But Political dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan's resignation today put an end to the one-year-old
coalition government but Turkey's political dilemma continues.
</P>
<P>
Following his one-hour meeting with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel this evening, the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) leader
Erbakan said at a press conference that he had presented his
resignation to Demirel and asked the president to approve the
handover of his post to his partner center-right True Path Party
(DYP) leader Tansu Ciller to form the 55th government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the decision for the resignation after his
three-hour talks with Ciller and Grand Unity Party (BBP) Chairman
Mushin Yazicioglu this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The three party leaders reached an agreement to form a new
government with the premiership of Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Yazicioglu said that his party would support the new coalition
government outside.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the RP parliamentary group meeting Tuesday,
Erbakan said that with the support of the Grand Unity Party
(BBP), his RP and the True Path Party (DYP) would enjoy a
majority in the parliament and could form a new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that transferring the premiership to the DYP was a
predetermined issue in the coalition government ptotocol, noting
that an early election would be held as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that the exact date for the early elections
would be announced within the first two weeks of this month
and report would be submitted to the parliament for approval
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Ciller announced that she would take over
the premiership from Erbakan in the second half of this month,
a year ahead of the schedule set in the power-sharing
protocol.
</P>
<P>
The RP and DYP signed the bipartite protocol in June
1996 which stipulated that Erbakan would head the government for
the first two years and then turn it over to Ciller for
the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
During one year in power, the coalition saw a growing
impatience with Erbakan's Islamic tendency, regarded by the
military and opposition as a serious threat to Turkey's
secularism enshrined in its Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Ciller was forced to take over power
from her coalition partner RP because of the increasing pressure
within her own party.
</P>
<P>
Some DYP parliamentary deputies dissatisfied with Ciller's weak
attitude toward the RP, had threatened to pull out of the party,
posing a direct threat to the RP-DYP parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly voicing their grave concern over the expanding
fundamentalism in Turkey, the General Staff of the Turkish
Armed Forces had been exerting pressure on the RP-led coalition
government, causing even military coup rumors in the capital of
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
At a February National Security Council meeting, the generals
led by Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi demanded the
coalition government to take tougher measures against the fast
increasing fundamentalist force in this secular republic but they
were frustrated with the reluctance of Erbakan to curb the
Islamic radicals.
</P>
<P>
The constitution Court is now investigating the anti-secularism
activities of several RP deputies well-known for their Islamic
tendency, increasing the speculation about the closure of the
RP.
</P>
<P>
Although Erbakan was forced to step down under pressure both
from the military and the coalition, political situation still
remains unstable as the military and public opinion are not for
the new coalition government to be formed by the DYP and RP with the
support of the BBP.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today affirmed that it would
not move its Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalam, a city
in dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told a regular
news briefing today that Turkey would not move its embassy until
the Middle East Peace Process succeeds and an agreement acceptable
to two sides is in place.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question about the recent U.S. Congress resolution
approving the transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, Akbel
said Turkey's view concerning the city of Jerusalem is well-known,
adding the Turkish embassy is in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's press conference, the Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman Sermet Atacanli failed to comment on the U.S Congress
move, but he said that whatever will be agreed between Israel and
the Palestinians would be acceptable to Turkey as well.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress decision on embassy transfer has triggered
strong protests from the Palestinians and other Arab

<HEADLINE> Calmness Returns After Feirce Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 18 (Xinhua)-- Calmness has returned in the
Southern port town of Kismaio today after experiencing three
consecutive days of fierce fighting between the opposing
militiamen of Marehan and Majerten clans over the control of the
strategic port town.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen have reopened their commercial centers inside the
town and civilian vehicles were once again seen in the streets as
the fighting seemed to have spontaneously stopped and no bullets
were being beard in the hostile city.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the rival militiamen of both clans have remained
in their defensive positions outside Kismaio. The reason for the
abrupt halt of the fighting is not yet disclosed as there has
been no peace initiatives made by any of the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 people have died and as many as 65 others were
wounded since the armed clashes began between the two Darod
subclans in Kismaio four days ago. The Majerten fighters loyal to
General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan are now in full control of the
town while the Marehan clansmen still remain at Luglow village
about 15 KM North of the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five people were killed and six others were wounded
when armed militiamen have indiscriminately fired upon two
transport lorries near Alolwein village, about 70 Km North of
Mogadishu early this morning. According to eyewitnesses on the
ground, the militiamen have been manning an illegal checkpoint
where they have been extorting money from the lorries.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the lorry drivers have tried to defy the
orders of the militiamen as the armed men have immediately
changed their mind from asking for extortion money to a total
looting on the vehicles. As a result all passengers on board the
lorries were forced to get down and were looted to their heels
except 11 of them who are still missing. The lorries left Haji
Ali village on their way to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were later evacuated to the ICRC run Keysaney
hospital of North Mogadishu for treatment. North Mogadishu
authorities have sent a security militia servicemen from the
Islamic courts headquarters to the sandy road along the coast to
find the culprits and clear the road from the illegal roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, five people were killed in Jilib town
of Middle Jubba region when two rival clan militiamen fought in
the town yesterday. According to the report the fighting has
sparked off after militiamen from Sheikhal clans have hijacked a
Suleman clan owned vehicle. The fighting has subsided when elders
from the two clans have intervened in the situation to contain
the hostility, however the fate of the looted vehicle is not yet
known.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Have No Differences on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece have no
differences of views, positions or tactic on Cyprus problem
since there is excellent cooperation between the two governments,
a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said the Greek government will be kept
informed on the course of the forthcoming direct talks between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot community leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored face-to-face talks between Glafcos Clerides
and Rauf Denktash will take place on July 9, near New York, to
break the deadlock on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Christofides has announced that President Clerides will travel
to Athens on July 2 for talks with the Greek government, prior to
his departure for New York for the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Cypriot government has
decided a moratorium on public statements that might reveal the
Greek Cypriot side's positions and tactics during the forthcoming
U.N.-sponsored direct talks.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the countdown to the start of the direct
talks, we consider it wise not reply to questions which might
lead to a revelation of positions, argumentation or tactics at
the talks," Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the session of the National Council, top
political advisory body to the President on handling the Cyprus
issue, scheduled for June 23, Christofides said it is expected
to set out a clear picture of the limits in which the
Greek Cypriot side will move.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops occupied the
northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
had two informal meetings in Nicosia in October 1994, which
ended in a deadlock. The two men have not met since.

<HEADLINE> France Sceptic About Return to NATO Military Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said today that he is sceptic about the return of France
to the integrated military structure of NATO in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I am rather sceptic but I don't want to predict because there
has been really no precise discussion between the president of the
republic and the government on this subject," said Vedrine during
an interview with Radio Info.
</P>
<P>
France has asked the replacement of an American commander by a
European at the Naplese-based NATO Southern Command as a
prediction for its return to the integrated military structure of
the trans-Atlantic military alliance, from which it withdrew in
1966.
</P>
<P>
The United States has rejected the request, citing "vital
interests" for America in the whole Mediterranean area.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that it is up to President Jacques Chirac to
decide whether France would return to the integrated military
structure either at the NATO Madrid summit in July or before that,
because it was Chirac who first suggested returning to the
integrated military structure of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It is for him to decide if he estimates to have received, in
terms of reform of NATO and in terms of the place of France (in
NATO), sufficient elements for France to go along this process or
no," he said.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said last week that the
progress made in the renovation of NATO remains insufficient for
France to immediately return to its integrated military structure.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, which came to power in the legislative
elections, said in its program that it "refuses France's
reintegration into the military structure of NATO" and that "the
security of Europe is above all the affair of Europeans and cannot
be separated from other aspects of the European construction."
</P>
<P>
After becoming president in May 1995, President Chirac launched
the process of a full return by France to NATO, in which it now
only retains a simple membership.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Approves Pension Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The German government today approved
a plan to overhaul the country's pension system in a bid to
prevent it from plunging into a deep funding crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, which still needs parliament approval,
the government wants to gradually cut the pension of an average
wage-earner from the present 70 percent of the net income in his
final working years to 64 percent by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to stem the rise in pension contributions
and help bridge the widening gap between what is paid into the
nation's state-run pension system and what is being drawn out.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's current system, pension contributions paid by
an employee are not put aside for his own use in the future, but
are used to pay the needs of those now retiring.
</P>
<P>
Like other Western countries, Germany has increasingly found
that its generous pension scheme is being squeezed by falling
birth rates and consequently the declining labor force on the one
hand and an aging population that is extending its claim on
pension benefits on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
According to German media reports, every pensioner in Germany
is currently paid for by 2.2 employers. This ratio is expected to
fall to 1.6 by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, architect of the
government pension reform plan, warned recently that without a
resolution of the country's present pension problems, there could
be a feud between generations.
</P>
<P>
However, before carrying out the much-needed reform, the
government will have to strike a compromise with the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) which has strongly
rejected cuts in pension benefits, arguing that it will turn a
large number of pensioners into social welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
The government needs the support of the SPD for it controls a
majority in the Bundestag, the upper house of parliament. The
first parliament reading of the government plan is scheduled for
next week.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Raps U.S. Congress for Resolution (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed said here today that the U.S. congress, which voted last
week to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, "is not
contributing anything" to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before his departure this
afternoon, Mahathir said the U.S. congress "is totally insensitive
to what is happening here" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On June 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly the resolution recognizing Jerusalem as the
"undivided and permanent" capital of Israel, and set aside 100
million dollars to move the U.S. embassy to the city from
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his three-day official visit in Lebanon,
Mahathir attacked the U.S. congressmen for only seeing "with a
blinked view of this region."
</P>
<P>
They only make the situation "more difficult because these
people are not sensitive and they don't understand the complexity
in this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia premier reiterated his country's "full" support
for U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, and urged
the world community to force Israel to comply with U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We think the world should provide pressure, and the big
powers should live up to their promise that they will help
to enforce whatever the resolutions passed by the United
Nations," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Petroleum Price to Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian petroleum
enterprise today said there will not be any increase in the price
of petroleum and derivatives as a result of the recent decision
by Ethiopia to import refined petroleum.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement by the enterprise, the
Assab oil refinery of Eritrea will stop operating as on August 1,
this year because the imported refined petroleum is cheaper than
using the refinery.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise said today that all the necessary arrangements
have been made to ensure the reliable flow of petroleum into the
market and there will not be any shortage due to the shift.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise further assured the public that they would even
get better service under the new scheme and any fear of
disruption of flow and shortage is unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia needs about 830,000 metric tonnes of kerosene and
benzine and 4,700 metric tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas
annually.

Short of naming the U.S., Mahathir blamed some countries'
reluctance to exert pressure upon Israel "even they have the
capability to do so."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we found in some cases there seems to be a
reluctance on the part of those who are capable of enforcing these
resolutions" which, for them, are against their protege or their

</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity to rally the world opinion against
Israel's attitude of rejecting to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral issues, Mahathir expressed optimism over the
prospect of economic cooperations between Lebanon and Malaysia,
noting that his country is interested in investing in the sectors
of road construction, industry and agriculture in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Lebanon is a good place for investment. I think
in many areas including the industry, Lebanon should be able to
attract foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir announced that during their bilateral talks, the
Malaysian side proposed the establishment of a "joint commission
between the two countries on the ministerial level" and the
formation of a "business council" by Lebanese and Malaysian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems we are facing is a lack of information of
this country," Mahathir said. To overcome this, Malaysia has
suggested that journalists be exchanged to increase their coverage
of each other's affairs and facilitate the flow of information.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian First Lady Stresses Reducing Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The first lady, Mama Anna
Mkapa said today that no effort to fight poverty can succeed if
it does not address the poverty that affiliated women and
children in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 1997 Huma Development Report (HDR) at the
national level in Dar es Salaam, the first lady said women's
contribution to the poverty eradication initiatives was
neccessary.
</P>
<P>
She said at the Kilimanjaro Hotel here that since women
constitute more than 51 percent of the world's population, their
participation in the fight against poverty was of paramount
importance.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the report which was prepared by the UN Development
Program (UNDP) was launched simultaneously last Thursday in Bonn,
Germany and Cape Town in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"There is now increased awareness of women issues in current
government thinking and policy formulation, but that is only the
beginning of a long process towards reducing poverty among women
and children," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the first lady said affirmative action
towards eradicating poverty would be useless if the economy was not
growing.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is not growing, or if our countries have to
spend more money on debt-servicing than on health and education,
the ones who suffer most are women and children," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was therefore, important for governments and
international aid organisations and the donor community to relate
the well-being of women and children to economic trends within
countries and internationally.
</P>
<P>
The first lady also said poverty could be fought if
governments jack up the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
On peace, she said, African countries, including Tanzania,
needed to get rid of causes of refugees if it wanted to eradicate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, the UNDP Resident
Representative and the UN Resident Co-ordinator, J. Victor Angelo
said good governance was crucial for poverty eradication
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The launching ceremony was also attended by members of the
diplomatic corps, the donor community and government officials.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Share in Uganda's Exports to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Coffee share in Uganda's exports
will fall below 50 percent level by the year 2002, reported the
local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
An International Financing Review report was quoted as saying
that in 1996, coffee accounted for 65 percent of Uganda's 528
million U.S. Dollars export bill while in 1988 when the country
started to diversify the economy as part of a broad economic
reform package, the coffee share in the country's exports was 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
This growing trend, the report said, is due to the
diversification away from coffee production to "fishing, cotton
growing and more sophisticated agricultural products such as
roses, vanilla and spice crops".
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been biggest foreign exchange earner in Uganda's
economy. It is reported that Uganda which exported 4.2 million
bags (60 kilos per bag) in 1995/96 season was the largest coffee
exporter in Africa.

</P>
<P>
The confirmation of the agreement was made during the 13th
technical session of the Chad-Cameroun export pipeline project
held in Yaounde from June 2 to June 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The parties involved include the Republic of Cameroun, the

</P>
<P>
The convention of establishment will be tabled before the
national assembly of Cameroun for adoption during its next
session.
</P>
<P>
A public information program and the mission on the survey of
the pipeline route are expected to be completed in Cameroun by
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chad-Cameroun export pipeline project is initiated by the
two country's governments. Oil explorations in Chad yielded very
encouraging results, the deposition is very rich, standing at 200
million tons. But oil could not be exported without a special
pipeline. The Chad-Cameroun export pipeline project is designed
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will start from the south part of Chad to the
southeast coast of Cameroun. The total length of the pipeline
will be 1050 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls For Solidarity with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates(UAE)
today called for Arab countries to work out a "concrete stand" to
support Palestinian people, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat,
UAE's Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed al Nahyan
stressed the Arab world should continue support to the
Palestinians until they could enjoy their legal rights.
</P>
<P>
Such a stand demands supports from all Arabs and the
international community to bring the stalled Middle East peace
process back on track, the UAE official said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Palestinians' struggle against Israel, saying
his country will continue to support Palestinians in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the U.S. House of Representatives resolution
Tuesday declaring Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will harm the peace process and will
exacerbating the situation in the Middle East region, he said,
warning "it is likely to lead (the peace process) to a collapse."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Arafat briefed the UAE deputy prime minister on
the latest developments in the Middle East peace process and
pointed to major difficulties in realizing a just and
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties were caused by Israeli government's hardline
policies, particularly the occupation of Arab lands, the
construction of settlements and efforts to turn Jerusalem a
Israeli Jerusalem, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here this afternoon on an official visit to the
Emirates, the second leg of his multi-nation Gulf tour to seek
support for the Palestinians in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tour, which had taken him to Saudi Arabia, began as
violence resumed in the occupied Arab lands and Israeli troops
shot and wounded dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank city of
Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Warns to Shut Off Water to Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In a move mainly targeted at
the rich, Tehran authorities today announced that starting June
22, they will shut off the water supply to families who use more
than 750 liters of water per person per day.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper Ettela'at reported that the provincial
committee on water crisis has identified those who use too
much water.
</P>
<P>
"These people will first be warned in written forms and then
their water will be shut off if they do not comply," Mohsen
Nariman, Director General of Tehran Province Water and Sewage,
was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the water-shut-off program targets
the rich and well-off people, mostly residing in northern
Tehran, who use drinking water for watering their large gardens
and filling their swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
Iran's capital of Tehran has a population of 10 million
and they are supplied with water from two reservoirs -- one
in the northwest and the other in northeast. The water level
is low this year.
</P>
<P>
"The water shortage is serious this year. We ask the
people to reduce their water consumption before we have to cut
off their water," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consumption limit for each family is
50 cubic meters and the investigation has shown that a
number of families are using twice as much as this amount.
</P>
<P>
The official called on people to report those who use too
much water to the Public Relations Office of the Organization
of Water and Sewage.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's water reserves are dangerously low this year because
of the less rainfall and snow last autumn and winter. The
authorities have been warning the people by showing short
films on Iranian TV and by publishing warnings in the papers.
</P>
<P>
The Water Crisis Committee has also been formed to prevent,
or deal with, problems arising from water shortage.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists
coming to Zanzibar rose to 95,464 during 1996/97 financial year
from 56,415 in the previous year, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Information, Tourism, Culture and Youth, Issa
Mohammed told the House of Representatives in the town of
Zanzibar when answering a question concerned that the government
earned 1.1 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 1.83 million US
Dollars) from various taxes charged on the tourists and hotels.
</P>
<P>
He said the earlier projections during the period, which stood
at about 70,000 visitors, had been surpassed by 25,000 tourists
more.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the influx of tourists to vigorous
campaign by the government and people to publicize Zanzibar as a
tourist paradise.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of Zanzibar's gross domestic product (GDP)
was generated by the tourism sector last fiscal year.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Industries
and Trade of Tanzania today said that the US Congress was yet to
approve the extension of the US Generalized System of Preference
(GSP) to Tanzania, which expired on May 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry here said Tanzanian
exporters would have to pay duties on their merchandise upon
entry or release in the United States until the congress
reauthorized the GSP extension.
</P>
<P>
Initially, according to the statement, Tanzania exporters were
benefiting from the facility in terms of preferential or zero
duty entry.
</P>
<P>
GSP is a preferential arrangement through which products of
export from preference benefit countries enter the markets of
preference giving countries at benefits beyond most favored
nation (MFN) status.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not give the reason, but advised Tanzanian
exporters to state on their commercial invoice that their
products originated from a GSP entitled country.

LUSAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Over two million Zambian children
will be vaccinated in a nation-wide polio immunization next
month, Deputy Health Minister Nkandu Luo said here today.
</P>
<P>
While officially launching the Polio Immunization Days, she
said that 2.3 billion Kwacha (about 1.77 million U.S. Dollars) is
needed for the whole exercise and the money is supposed to be

<P>
She urged Zambian media and business circles to be in the
forefront to eradicate polio by disseminating information about
polio and investing in health.
</P>
<P>
There is a serious financial shortage to meet the campaign
needs and the material and human resources are also inadequate,
said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
This year is the second year of a three-year anti-polio
program. 1.55 million children were vaccinated last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea on Wednesday pressed his country's case for membership in
an expanded NATO to Vice President Al Gore when they met at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea told reporters after his meeting with Gore that Romania
would "fight to the very end" to be included in the first round of
new members to be invited to enter the enlarged NATO at next
month's NATO summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Bill Clinton announced that the United
States would support inviting just three new members -- Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic -- into NATO when its leaders meet
in Madrid, thus dashing Romania's hope to be invited as first
round of NATO new members.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, disappointed by Clinton's announcement, said: "The
Romanian people and the Romanian government are the most eager of
all people of all countries in the zone to belong to the
Euro-Atlantic structures."
</P>
<P>
According to the Romanian prime minister, Gore assured him
"if Romania continues its reforms, it will be included in the
second wave."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Warns of Planned Killing of Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has warned against planned killing of political
rivals by some ill-willed individuals prior to Liberia's historic
polls next month.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quotes ECOMOG force
commander, Major-General Victor Malu, as saying: "ECOMOG
intelligence forces have identified these individuals, and are
closely monitoring them."
</P>
<P>
Malu, however, declined to provide the names or details of the
plots.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to state categorically that in the event of any such
elimination attempt, ECOMOG will hit the individuals involved so
hard that they will be completely crushed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malu's warning came in the wake of numerous press reports
alleging former warlord and presidential candidate Charles Taylor
has hired and brought into Liberia mercenaries from South
Africa's Inkatha Movement to eliminate opponents during the
campaign period which kicked off in the capital Monrovia on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor and his supporters have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Malu urged Liberian political
aspirants to avoid the use of "vexing" issues during their
political campaign as they could further re-open the wounds of
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to advise political aspirants to concentrate their
campaign talks, discussions and efforts on issues and specific
plans and programs they have to bring improvement to the lives of
the Liberian citizens who have been most tormented by the
disturbances," he said in a broadcast on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The force commander reiterated that ECOMOG will provide
adequate security to all the parties and their aspirants at all
campaign venues and that threats to peace in any part of the
country will be decisively neutralized.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for July 19, the presidential and legislative polls
are set to crown a peace process outlined in a revised accord
signed last August to end the seven-year civil war ignited by
Taylor in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people died in the war while more others were
left homeless.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns Shortage of Global Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- If current trends continue,
two-thirds of humanity will suffer "moderate to severe water
stress" within 30 years, according to a UN report.
</P>
<P>
The report released here today said that there is clear and
convincing evidence that the world faces a worsening series of
local and regional water quantity and quality problems, largely as
a result of poor water allocation, wasteful use of the resource
and lack of adequate management resources.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater
Resources of the World," is part of a series of UN studies
prepared for the Commission on Sustainable Development for the
Special Session of the General Assembly next week.
</P>
<P>
A third of the world's population already suffers from what the
report calls "moderate to high" stress as a result of over-demand
and pollution of water supplies. The report said that by 2025, if
all humanity is to have access to safe drinking water and
sanitation, the needs to an additional 5 billion people will have
to be met.
</P>
<P>
Current levels of water shortages and pollution are causing
"widespread public health problems, limiting economic and
agricultural development and harming a wide range of ecosystems,"
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"They may put global food supplies in jeopardy and lead to
economic stagnation in many areas of the world," triggering "a
series of local and regional water crises with global
implications," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial that there be an international consensus on the
potential severity fo the crisis, the report stressed. Governments
must give water resources a high priority in their national
planning, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also urged that efforts to deal with water crises be
made in tandem with an international drive to move toward global
food security.

NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc., a communication
giant in the United States, confirmed Tuesday that it planned to
build a 12.9 billion US dollar global satellite network to provide
voice, data and video communications to telephone companies,
businesses and telecommuters.
</P>
<P>
The venture, called Celestri, is Motorola's biggest satellite
plan aiming at corporate world. Global satellite systems are
intended to provide such services as video conferencing and
high-speed internet access. And Celestri may be the first such
system to use both satellites orbiting at low altitudes and
satellites that operate at high altitudes and retain a fixed
location in relation to the Earth, according to a report of the
New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Celestri, the company also has plans for two
other satellite networks. It has already started a 5 billion
dollar satellite system for wireless calls. It has also proposed a
project called M-Star, a 6.1 billion dollar venture that will use
72 satellites.
</P>
<P>
Motorola's Celestri announcement came less than two months
after the Boeing Company was picked as the lead contractor for a
9 billion dollar project to build a satellite network, which
offers services similar to those planned by Celestri.

<HEADLINE> US Software Giant to Set Up Research Lab in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation, one of
the software giants in the United States, has announced that it
would spend 80 million US dollars to set up a research laboratory
in Cambridge, England, in collaboration with Cambridge University,
the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move is considered a "significant step" Microsoft took in
the direction to build a world-class research team.
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge venture is Micrfosoft's first overseas research
lab. The move is prompted by the comapny's realization that even
the millionaire-making prospect of Microsoft shares have not been
sufficient in luring leading computer scientists. "Going to Europe
gives us a way to hire people who bring new talents and new
perspectives to our work that we couldn't get any other way,"
Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The research community views Microsoft's venture as another
sign that the software giant is exceptional in an era of deficit
reduction and corporate belt-tightening--a time when the Federal
Government and most companies are curbing their spending on basic
research.

BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today hailed the deals on European Union (EU)'s single currency
and the bloc's eastward expansion reached at the two-day European
Union (EU) summit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kinkel said that EU leaders at the meeting had
cleared the way for the EU to expand to eastern Europe by agreeing
to start negotiations on taking in new members at the beginning of
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said this agreement confirmed that the EU would not lose its
capability to act even with 20 or more members.
</P>
<P>
He said the message from Amsterdam, including a budget
stability pact, assured that the planned single currency, Euro,
will be launched punctually on January 1, 1999 with adherence to
the qualification criteria, and that Euro would remain stable in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
The treaty of Amsterdam marked the start of a great European
project comparable with the past milestones of the EU, including
the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the creation of the single European
market in 1992 and the Maastricht treaty on the creation of a
Economic and Monetary Union, Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Shoots Up by 7.8 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. foreign trade deficit
climbed up by 7.8 percent in April after dropping to a four-month
low in March by record exports, according to a report from the
Commerce Department here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the deficit in goods and services totaled
8.4 billion U.S. dollars, mainly due to the record high imports
for such consumer goods as clothing, toys and pharmaceutical
products. The monthly figure is up from a revised 7.8 billion
dollars in March. The March imbalance, initially estimated at 8.5
billion dollars, narrowed with the help of surging sales of
commercial aircraft to China.
</P>
<P>
Exports in April continued to rise, edging up 0.2 percent to an
all-time high of 78.4 billion dollars. However, imports rose even
more, up 0.9 percent to 86.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In April, the biggest deficit as usual was with Japan, up 5.1
percent to 4.8 billion dollars, the highest since 4.9 billion
dollars last October. The deficit rose even further in May, based
on figures released earlier this week by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The country continued to have trade deficits with its North
American Free Trade Agreement partners, although at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance with Canada ebbed 26.3 percent to 970 million
dollars, lowest since 900 million dollars in March 1995. Exports
of 13.3 billion dollars and imports of 14.3 billion dollars were
the highest on record with any country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade gap with the southern neighbor Mexico fell
5 percent to 1.4 billion dollars, led by a record 5.7 billion
dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foreign oil imports rose 3.3 percent to 5.6 billion
dollars, despite the lowest price in more than a year. Crude oil
prices dropped to 17.17 dollars a barrel, the third straight
decline, but were offset by a 6.8 percent jump in volume to 250
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the country's trade gap has been running at a
112.4 billion dollar annual rate, even wider than the revised 111
billion dollars in 1996 and worst since 115.8 billion dollars in
1988. The largest gap of 152.9 billion dollars was recorded in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants to Resolve All Issues With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is committed to finding
solutions to all outstanding issues with India including the core
issue of Kashmir through dialogue, a senior Pakistani diplomat
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to the Kashmir problem is indispensable for
durable peace and for diverting the energies to the development
and poverty alleviation in the region," said Shamshad Ahmed,
Pakistan's foreign secretary, in an interview with the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad made the remarks on the eve of a new round of foreign
secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We think structured and synchronized discussions are a must
for achieving real progress on all issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are no "quick fixes" to resolve the issues between the
two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said Pakistan would convey its concern to India during
the forthcoming talks over the reported deployment of medium-range
ballistic Prithvi missiles by India near its border with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
genuinely believes that economic development in the region would
be possible only if all outstanding issues were resolved through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The new round of foreign secretary-level talks will begin here
on Friday and is expected to conclude next Monday. The decision
to continue the dialogue was made by the prime ministers of India
and Pakistan at their meeting in the Maldives last month on the
sidelines of a regional summit.
</P>
<P>
The previous round of the talks was held in New Delhi in March
after a gap of three years.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Iraqi Trade Not to Be Affected: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz reiterated here today that the Jordanian-Iraqi trade ties
would not be affected by any factors.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks at a meeting with Jordan's Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali this morning.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's statement seems intended to ease the anxieties of
Jordanian businessmen who fear of losing business opportunities
with Iraq. The sanction-impaled country submitted a request
today to the U.N. for the approval of its import of food and
medicine through Abu Al-Shamat, a Syrian-Iraqi border crossing.
</P>
<P>
The border point has been closed since Iraq severed diplomatic
relations with Syria for its siding with Iran in the Iran-Iraq War
in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade ties between Iraq and Syria were resumed
only recently.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Syrian-Iraqi border crossing will
certainly impact Jordan's exports to Iraq, which has been Jordan's
largest trade partner for years, local newspaper Jordan Times
today quoted Mohammad Dalabieh, head of Ports Corporation of
Jordan, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian export of goods and services to Iraq totaled 220
million U.S. dollars in value in 1996. The figure even hit 400
million dollars in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen also feared that Jordan would make less
money from transit trade bound for Iraq if the Iraqi request can
be approved by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Iraq now import goods mainly through its borders with Jordan
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
If the request is approved, global exporters, especially the
European ones, could first transport goods to Syria's
Mediterranean ports of Tartoos and Laziqiyeh and then carry the
goods by trucks into Iraq through Abu Al-Shamat border point,
local paper said.
</P>
<P>
This is a short and low-cost transportation route to Iraq in
comparison with the one that passes the Egyptian Suez Canal,
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba and finally the Jordanian-Iraqi
border.
</P>
<P>
Along this route, Iraq imported civilian goods and military
equipment during the Iraq-Iran war and Jordan made more than one
billion dollars every year from entrepot trade through Aqaba port
bound for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's businessmen were concerned that the reopening of the
border point might also affect a trade protocol signed by Jordan
and Iraq at the beginning of this year. The protocol worth 255
million dollars is exempt from the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, some Jordanian officials insisted that the
Jordanian-Iraqi trade will not be affected by the reopening of the
Syrian-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, the trade protocol will be honored and in
fact, parts of it have already been materialized, said a Jordanian
official who prefers not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Civil Engineering for HK New Airport Railway Nearly Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of civil
engineering work for the Airport Railway has been finished, with
the focus shifted to interior decoration and equipment
installation.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Railway is being built to provide special service
for the new international airport of Hong Kong, which will replace
the overloaded Kai Tak Airport.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which is designed to be 34 kilometers long and
will also provide mass transit commuter service, is believed to be
the first of its kind across the world.
</P>
<P>
The two different services have been named "Airport Express"
and "Tung Chung Line," respectively.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, which
was designated by the Hong Kong government as the railway's
builder, said today that 70 percent of the railway track has been
laid, and that trains for the Tung Chung Line have started test
run.
</P>
<P>
"At the current construction speed, the railway will go into
operation before June in 1998," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Express and the Tung Chung Line are the fourth and
fifth railways to be built and operated by the Mass Transit
Railway Corporation, following the MTR Island Line, MTR Tsuen Wan
and MTR Kwun Tong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong new airport is scheduled to open in April, 1998,
and the Airport Railway will start operation two months later.
</P>
<P>
It will take 23 minutes for a train to run through the railway,
which will have eight kilometers of tunnels and six kilometers of
elevated line.

<HEADLINE> HK Return Boosts Macao People's Confidence in Future: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said here
today that Hong Kong's return to the motherland will help boost
Macao people's confidence in future.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told about 20 representatives of Macao youth organizations, which
last month formed a preparatory committee for the celebration of
Hong Kong's handover, that Hong Kong's return is "inspiring and
serves as a model" for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'one country, two systems' will become reality
in Hong Kong in 12 days," he noted, after listening to briefings
by members of the committee here. "People around the world are
convinced that Hong Kong will remain prosperous under that
policy."
</P>
<P>
"The success of Hong Kong in implementing the policy will help
boost the confidence of Macao residents in carrying out the policy
in Macao in 1999 after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over Macao," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kou Hoi In, executive chairman of the preparatory committee,
briefed Wang on the preparations for celebrations, which, among
others, include a symposium and a gala.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the preparatory committee is aimed at
enabling all Macao youths to share the happiness of Hong Kong's
return (to the motherland)," Kou said. "It also helps us get
united and do our best for a smooth return of Macao."

<HEADLINE> Germany Sure to Qualify for Euro, Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany is set to miss the budgetary
target for joining the planned single European currency -- Euro,
but this will not prevent it from qualifying, a German economic
institute predicted today.
</P>
<P>
IFO (Institute for Economic Studies) President Karl Heinrich
Oppenlaender said in Munich that Germany's national budget deficit
for 1997 would be 120 billion marks (70 billion U.S. dollars), or
3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), higher than the 3
percent required by Euro standards.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that even with such a deficit, Germany would
not be denied entry to the single currency, thanks to a softening
of the Euro terms which seems increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that if Euro was to be launched punctually on
January 1, 1999, though on a softer footing, the German mark and
other European currencies would be put under remarkable pressure
to depreciate, which in turn would encourage European central
banks to raise interests rates. The overall effect would be
unfavorable for the German economy.
</P>
<P>
In case of a delay in launching Euro, European countries could
then shift their attention to more active employment policy and
ease up on budgetary restraint.
</P>
<P>
The result would almost certainly be a surge in the German
mark's value, which would threaten the country's exports and its
chances of reducing double-digit unemployment, Oppenlaender said.
</P>
<P>
The best way leading to Euro would be to pursue a credible
consolidation strategy of budget, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IFO institute also predicted that Germany could expect a
GDP growth of between 2 and 2.5 percent for 1997 and a growth of
up to 2.75 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment figure would increase to 4.3 million in
1997, IFO said.

<HEADLINE> Executive Council Members Confident in HK's future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the Executive
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to
be established on July 1 expressed their full confidence in Hong
Kong's future in a forum held with the media here today.
</P>
<P>
The three members, former Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang,
Chung Shui-Ming, and Raymond K.F. Ch'ien, met overseas journalists
who came to cover the handover of Hong Kong in a forum held by the
Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The forum was chaired by Nellie Fong Kut-man, an Executive
Council member and chairman of the Executive Committee of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's realities and post-handover prospects,
the members shared the view that in accordance with the "one
country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong will maintain the
stability of its social and economic systems as a special
administration region of China, noting that there is no need to
worry about drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
Sir Ti Liang Yang said that Hong Kong's present legal system
has been tested and developed over a long period of time, and as a
result has been accepted by the public.
</P>
<P>
"The legal system has been included in the Basic Law and will
continue to be implemented after July 1," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in the independence of Hong Kong's
legal system, the integrity of its judges and the professional
quality of its lawyers after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Chung said he is optimistic that Hong Kong will continue to
retain its status as an international financial center after July
1, while an increasingly open inland area will provide more
development opportunities for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ch'ien, who is also a member of Hong Kong's present Executive
Council, said that China's administrative departments are becoming
increasingly open, modern and democratic.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong people will feel quite at ease as
residents of a region that is part of a country which enjoys a
bright future and is advancing toward modernization.

<HEADLINE> EU to Set Out Strategies for Training Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to set
out five strategies to develop apprenticeship in member states so
as to improve young people's chances of finding jobs, media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative has been proposed to the European Council for
approval by Edith Cresson, EU Commissioner for Research, Education
and Training, and Padraig Flynn, Commissioner for Employment and
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The five strategies include extending and developing
apprenticeship, enhancing the quality of training, encouraging the
mobility of apprentices, involving the social partners in
apprenticeship training and defining and implementing truly
European apprenticeship strategies.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that apprenticeship is a faster route to a job
provided that it is of high quality, meets the needs of companies
and provides sufficiently flexible training to allow life-long
adaptation to industrial changes.
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, the unemployment rate for former apprentices is 16
percent while the national youth jobless rate is 20 percent. In
Ireland, the placement rate for apprentices is between 95 and 100
percent.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "One Country, Two Systems" Policy Practical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's smooth return to China
on July 1 proves that Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems" was practical, two Macao celebrities have said.
</P>
<P>
Both Edmundo Ho Hau-Wah, president of the Macao Bankers'
Association and member of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People Congress, and Ng Fok, a well-known businessman and
member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made
these remarks in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return, as a major event in the history of Chinese
nation, is an important beginning in the course of China's
peaceful reunification," Ho said. "A pioneering undertaking, the
concept of 'one country, two systems' will help promote the
peaceful reunification with Taiwan as well."
</P>
<P>
He said that Macao can learn from Hong Kong's experience in
the implementation of the policy, although Macao is different from
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's success is very important to Macao as Macao will
also return to the motherland in 1999 when the policy of 'one
country, two systems' will be implemented," he said. "Macao's
transition will enter into a new stage after Hong Kong's return."
</P>
<P>
He urged people in Macao to support Hong Kong for the success
of the policy, saying it is vital not only to Hong Kong and Macao,
but also to the Chinese nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
When a nation resumes its exercise of sovereignty over a piece
of land occupied by other nations, Ho noted, there are always war
and blood. But the policy of "one country, two systems" has for
the first time in the world history resolved that issue in a
peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
"Although there were ups and downs during the past 13 years,
Hong Kong remains basically prosperous and stable if viewing the
whole transition process," he said. "That should first be
attributed to the concept of 'one country, two systems.'"
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financier said that Hong Kong's successful
transition should also be a result of China's political stability
and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ng Fok, a leading entrepreneur in the territory,
said Hong Kong's return marks the coming of a new historic epoch,
as Hong Kong will be governed by Hong Kong people and China makes
the first step in the peaceful reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's success proves that Deng Xiaoping's concept
of 'one country, two systems' is a feasible way in the peaceful
reunification of the motherland," he said. "It is also a good idea
in handling disputes left over from history between different
nations."
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur urged other businessmen to invest in Macao
and help contribute to a successful transition.
</P>
<P>
"We should take the return of Hong Kong as an encouragement,"
he said. "We should help cultivate a stable transition in Macao
through more investment to promote local economy."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The skyline and streets of Hong
Kong Island and Kowloon have been decked out with lights, lanterns
and other decorative objects featuring Hong Kong's return to its
motherland since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of "greeting Hong Kong's return to China with
bright lights" put forward by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
has received active responses from all social sectors in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Numerous high-rises and hotels along the Victoria Harbor,
including Shun Tak Center, City Plaza and the Harbor View Holiday
Inn, have been decorated with colorful lights and neon designs to
welcome Hong Kong's return to the motherland, greatly adding to
the festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Services Department has allocated 14 million US
dollars to beautify the city with lights and lanterns to give the
city an atmosphere of jubilation for the handover.
</P>
<P>
Wong Kian Shan, the manager of a local lights and design
company, said his company has received a huge number of orders
from prestigious hotels and companies since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of customers requested designs of the white
dolphin, the mascot of Hong Kong, dragons, giant pandas,
fireworks, bauhinia and the slogan of "Celebrate the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland" in Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The building of the China Insurance Company bears the design of
a bauhinia and a map of China made up of lights, five red stars
sparkling amid the design.
</P>
<P>
A local resident said, "Hong Kong these days is brighter than
it is during Chinese new year and Christmas holidays."
</P>
<P>
Outside the Eaton Hotel Hong Kong in Kowloon is a behemoth of
lights and patterns forming a white dolphin and the regional
emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The design
is so big that people can view it from across the harbor on Hong
Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
A 3.5-km-long dragon bearing two million light bulbs is being
installed on Nathan Road, Kowloon. The dragon's head faces the
Victoria Harbor at Tsim Sha Tsui and its tail reaches the end of
the road. In length, the dragon can well claim a place in the
Guinness record book. The dragon is scheduled to be lighted at
the end of this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A Xiamen-Taiwan trade promotion
center, the first of its kind in China, was set up today in the
coastal city of Xiamen, a special economic zone in southeast China.
</P>
<P>
The center is aimed at carrying out the central government's
policies toward Taiwan, enhancing economic and trading exchanges
across the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and organizing the
annual Xiamen-Taiwan export commodity fair.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will hold professional training courses in
economic and trading fields for both sides, conduct studies on
trade with Taiwan, and help businesses in the inland areas to
expand trade with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years, Xiamen has become one of the inland
area's major ports to trade with Taiwan, and is the area which has
the most investment by Taiwanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
A city official said in early April that Xiamen had approved
nearly 1,400 Taiwanese-funded projects which involved a
contractual investment of about 2.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the city's geographical advantage, nearly 1.3 billion US
dollars worth of goods were exported to Taiwan via Xiamen in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Concerned with UNSCOM Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has expressed concern over
the U.N. delay in forwarding the findings in the examination of
remnants of its destroyed missile engines, according to the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) today.
</P>
<P>
The concern of the Iraqi government was voiced by Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz in a letter Wednesday to Rolf Ekeus, executive
chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz argued that some preliminary results of the examination
should be submitted to Iraq within weeks and that the final
results should be ready by August 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 100 proscribed missile engines of Iraq were transported
to the United States and France in early March for analysis, in
order to determine whether they are from the Soviet-made Scud
missiles or the locally-made "useless" ones.
</P>
<P>
This move was taken in accordance with a joint statement
reached late in February by Ekeus and Aziz, which said the
U.N. commission will inform the Iraqi government of the findings
in the analysis when they are available.
</P>
<P>
The delay is "unobjective, costly and is meant to delay the
closing of (Iraq's) weapons files indefinitely," said Aziz,
pointing out its consequence is "the continuation of the
(U.N.-imposed) embargo (on Iraq) and the sufferings" of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is not allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,
including missiles with ranges beyond 150 kilometers, after its
troops were defeated by the U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991
Gulf War triggered by its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM in charge of scrapping the weapons suspects Iraq
still possesses a considerable number of the missiles. However,
Baghdad denies concealing any such weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Makes 13-Billion-Bytes-Per-Second Super Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a new super
computer called the "Yinhe-3," capable of performing 13 billion
calculations per second, marking a breakthrough for the country in
developing large-scale computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art design by the Computer Institute under the
National Defense Science and Technology University passed State
appraisal here today.
</P>
<P>
The computer is able to calculate at a speed of up to 13
billion bytes per second and is more than 10 times more powerful
than its predecessor, the "Yinhe-2," developed in 1992. But the
size of the "Yinhe-3" is only one-sixth of the "Yinhe-2".
</P>
<P>
The super computer adopts the latest international standards,
allowing all its processors to operate simultaneously, and the
system can be expanded with additional parts.
</P>
<P>
Its overall functions, efficiency and powerful network design
are up to the world advanced level, claimed the appraisal
committee, which was composed of academicians from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering and other
prestigious scholars in this field.
</P>
<P>
But what stands out most about this system is its
flexibility: it can be easily altered into a smaller version able
to "think" at a speed of several hundred million bytes per second,
or into an even bigger and more powerful setup than its original
capacity, depending on the needs of users, according to the
experts.
</P>
<P>
They believe that such a breakthrough in the hi-tech field will
greatly promote the country's economic development, defense
building, and science and technology progress.
</P>
<P>
The computer developer, the National Defense Science and
Technology University, has also created software for weather
forecasts, earthquake research and others fields of scientific
study.

<HEADLINE> Fast Developing Exhibition Industry in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center has, for years, been the symbol of local fast
developing exhibition industry, though it has become a media focus
for its newly completed extension project, the venue of the grand
ceremonies of Hong Kong's historic handover.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's prime locations for conventions and
exhibitions, Hong Kong last year hosted more than 700
international conferences, over 60 major international business
and trade exhibitions, fairs, auctions and other business
activities.
</P>
<P>
The utilization rate of the center's exhibition hall is the
highest in the world and the reservation for exhibition
facilities in the center has run through 1998, according to a
senior manager in charge of exhibitions at the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council.
</P>
<P>
The history of Hong Kong's exhibition dated back to the late
1970s when its textile industry took off. The fast development of
its toy and timepiece manufacturing, and electronic industries
subsequently created conditions for the holding of comprehensive
exhibitions in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
By 1991, the then area of the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center began to fall short of demand. And it is
expected that the expanded Center with a total area of 60,000 sq.
m. will only be able to cope with the demand before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that Hong Kong's exhibition industry has
drawn much of its vitality from its unique advantages in Asia --
the easy accesses provided by its transport and communications,
preferential customs tariffs on imports and exports, and free flow
of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a top venue worldwide for specialized exhibitions
such as those of gifts and presents, timepieces, jewelry,
garments, and furs.

All bags will be examined when spectators enter the grounds and
all vehicles will be checked in addition to the usage of closed

concourse.
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope that the championships, which are expected to
attract around 400,000 visitors over the two weeks, would not
repeat what happened in April's Grand National steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
A bomb scare caused the race to be postponed for two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba stressed here today that political independence in Africa
will never become a reality if African countries continue to be
economically dependent.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks while he received the credentials from
the newly-appointed Philippine ambassador to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the African governments to stand on their own
in the development of the continent if they are to manage their
independence.
</P>
<P>
Also earlier today while receiving the credentials from the new
Ethiopian ambassador to Zambia, President Chiluba urged countries
that have launched political and economic reforms to allow the
ordinary citizens to participate in the implementation of those
programs in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that people should be allowed to play a part in the
running of their economies if the reforms are to succeed.

BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A new type of ceremonial cannon
will be put into use after July 1 as part of formal welcoming
activities to greet state and government leaders of foreign
countries to visit China, according to sources with China's armed
police.
</P>
<P>
The "86"-style cannons have been used for ceremonial purposes

version is more sleekly designed and has a rich thundering sound
which can be heard from far away.

<P>
In March, 1984, China resumed the firing of cannons during

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An envoy sent by Iranian
government to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein arrived here today on
a week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ali Reza Marandi, Iranian Health Minister, was believed to
be the first Iranian ranking official to come to Baghdad over the
past several year.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency didn't give any details about
the envoy's mission here. But observers believe this visit is a
friendly gesture aimed at improving relations between the two
countries under new circumstances of the Middle East political
arena.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the visit came after Mohammad Khatami,
said to be a moderate clergy, was elected Iran's new president
with a landslide victory in the elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran, long-term foes in the Gulf region, fought an
eight-year war from 1980-88 with neither coming out the winner.
However, their diplomatic ties were resumed in 1990 at the height
of the Gulf crisis, which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The two are embroiled in disputes over two pending issues: the
exchange of POWs of their protracted war and the return of Iraq's
planes which flew to Iran during the Gulf War to avoid the attack
of the U.S.-led allies.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Macao Can Learn From HK's Smooth Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Macao can learn a lot from Hong
Kong's smooth transition, a leading Macao businessman said here
in Macao recently.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, said
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua that Hong Kong's smooth
transition serves both as an encouragement and a model for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Hong Kong is tomorrow's Macao," he said. "Hong Kong's
smooth return to the motherland will influence Macao
positively. Macao can learn a lot from Hong Kong's experience."
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Macao should quicken its pace in the
localization of the middle and senior ranking civil service to
pave the way for the top civil service to "stride over" the
handover to the motherland in 1999, since top civil servants of
non-Chinese nationality in Macao are not allowed to stay on after
the return.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, nearly all the top civil service will retain
their jobs after the return on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Very few positions of the middle and senior civil service in
Macao are now held by local Chinese people. The Chinese side has
repeatedly urged the Portuguese side to step up the localization
process.
</P>
<P>
Having lived in Macao since 1941, Ma said he is very happy that
 Hong Kong returns to the motherland. He attributed that to an
increasingly stronger motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a dream of all Chinese
people throughout the world," he said. "July 1 will be the most
glorious day as the humiliation China has suffered from over the
past century will be removed."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return in a peaceful way demonstrates that China
has become stronger and stronger over the past decades," added Ma,
who will be a member of the central delegation to attend the
handover ceremony in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ma, 78, a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
believes that Hong Kong would have a bright future after returning.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong enjoys favorable conditions in its port, traffic and
climate, and has laid a good foundation for further development,"
he said. "With support from the motherland and with the
implementation of the 'one country, two systems' policy and the
Basic Law, Hong Kong will continue its economic boom."
</P>
<P>
Ma highly praised the concept of "one country, two systems",
saying it is an pioneering idea in handling bilateral issues left
over from history, and is "pragmatic and scientific."
</P>
<P>
"It takes the interests of most citizens in Hong Kong and Macao
 into account, thus contributing to a continuous prosperity and
stability in both places," he said, adding that "I believe the
strategic idea will also be important in handling the Taiwan
issue."

Policy Bureau of Japan's Defense Agency, that Sino-Japanese
relations have reached an important juncture which will allow them
to connect the past with the future.

cooperation guidelines.

arrangement formed during Cold War times.
</P>
<P>
with the collapse of Cold War structure and under a relatively
stable situation in the Asia-Pacific region, He went on to say,
Japan and the US should adopt a prudent attitude toward their
cooperation in the military realm, and their military cooperation
should stay within the bilateral framework, so that no
complications will be added to the regional security situation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that Japan will learn from its history in a
realistic and sincere way, and stay on the path of peaceful
development.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Advocates Agreement on Animal Trapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An international agreement to ban
the worst "leg-hold" traps and enforce humane standards on the
rest will do much more for animal welfare than a mere ban on fur
imports, a European Union (EU) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, made the remark as EU
ministers are preparing for a decision Thursday and Friday on the
question of curbing the use of animal traps.
</P>
<P>
He said that a mere import ban might have instant appeal, but
it could prove unenforceable, and would send the fur business in
search of lucrative markets elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever international trapping standard, negotiated by
the EU with Canada and Russia, will be aimed at cutting cruelty to
wild animals by forcing Canada, Russia and the EU to abolish the
worst forms of trapping.
</P>
<P>
EU officials note that trappers in the remotest corners of
Siberia and the Yukon are unlikely to change their age-old ways
unless they are obliged to do so by their own governments, and
helped in the process.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that trapping can be a cruel
business, and that Europe has a duty to improve animal welfare,"
Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers are facing two options -- either to ban all
imports of fur into Europe from countries where "leg-hold" traps
are used until trapping methods are changed, or to approve a set
of rules that would force all trappers to use only the most humane
methods, and face penalties if they do not.

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Up in First Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Macao foreign trade grew vigorously
in the first four months of the year, with both imports and
exports increasing remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that between January and April, Macao exported 4.7
billion patacas (about 595 million US dollars) worth of goods, up
16.4 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports for the period reached 5.1 billion patacas (about
645.6 million US dollars), up 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a trade deficit of 468 million patacas (about 59.2
million US dollars) was recorded. That was an increase of 37.7
percent from the deficit in the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exports, textile and garment products accounted
for 83.8 percent, while the proportion of non-textile products,
including machinery and equipment, footwear and concrete,
continued to shrink.
</P>
<P>
About three-fourth of Macao exports went to the United States
and the European Union, while the source of Macao's imported goods
concentrated on the Asian-Pacific region, mostly, the Chinese
inland areas, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The imports of capital goods rose 19.3 percent, raw materials
and semi-finished goods 10.1 percent, and fuel and lubricating oil
7.1 percent, but the imports of consumption goods dropped 0.04
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the foreign trade growth has indicated that
the local economy is recovering after a two-year-long slowdown.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has adopted a proposal for a
five-year action program on the prevention of diseases which are
caused, provoked and aggravated by environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner
for employment and social affairs, and Ritt Bjerregaard,
commissioner for environment, nuclear safety and civil protection,
says a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one in three Europeans suffer from an
allergy, with a recent study indicating that the situation is
worsening at an "alarming" rate -- one in two people are predicted
to be affected soon.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has identified a three-pronged strategy to
prevent pollution-related diseases -- the reduction of pollutants
by taking action at their source, action to limit people's
exposure to pollutants and mitigation of adverse health effects on
individuals exposed to pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The proposed program will be reportedly subject to the
co-decision procedure of the European Parliament and the Council
of Ministers, and it will run from 1999 to 2003.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court sentenced a
manager of a private company to death on charge of swindling,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the death sentence was given by the 11th branch of
the Islamic Revolution's Court to Hussein Dowlatkhah Wednesday,
who beguiled 7,000 depositors of their capitals.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not give his background.
</P>
<P>
It said that the court found him guilty of embezzlement
and corruption and on this account sentenced him to life
sentence, flagging and fine.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Dowlatkhah's debts to depositors were
assessed to be over 88.2 billion rials (29.4 million U.S. dollars)
by March 20, 1997 because the criminal set up a swindling bank,
plundered people's properties, beguiled people, issued thousands
of bounced cheque.
</P>
<P>
The firm started collecting citizen's capitals since 1983 and
was banned seven years later after 7,000 depositors lodged
complaints against it. Part of the swindled money was transferred
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Investigation into the firm's conduct lasted for five years,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Australians Live Longer, Marry Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Australians are living longer,
marrying later, having fewer children and becoming healthier while
the gap between the rich and poor is growing, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
More women are marrying younger men and one-parent families and
families with no children are increasing.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's Australian Social Trends 1997 collated information
on virtually all aspects of the life of the 18 million
Australians, including work and income, family structure,
immigration and crime.
</P>
<P>
Australians' median age in 1996 was 34, up from 31 a decade
earlier. The proportion of people aged 65 and over was 12 percent,
up from 10.5 percent, and is projected to hit 23 percent in 2051.
</P>
<P>
Children aged up to 14 made up 21 percent of the population,
down from 23 percent in 1986, and are expected to fall to 17
percent by the middle of the next century. They increased by 1
percent between 1975 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the number of older Australians went up by 78 percent in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
The median age of new mothers was 28.6 years in 1995. Almost 14
percent of all births were to women over 35, up from 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
More babies were born out of wedlock, rising from 15.5 percent
of all births in 1985 to 26.6 percent in 1995, and most now have
the father's name on the birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
One-parent families are approaching 20 percent of all families,
with two-thirds of single parents divorced, separated or widowed.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, men married at a median age of 27.3 years and women at
25.3 years. The median age rose rapidly in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Families with children are now likely to have two incomes, but
the proportion with neither parent working has also increased.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that more people were born overseas, from
21 percent in 1986 to 23 percent in 1996, and people from Asian
countries represent a growing segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland remain the major source of Australia's
immigrants, although their proportion of all migrants dropped from
41 percent in 1976 to 29 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They are Followed by New Zealand, Italy, the former Yugoslav
republics, Vietnam, Greece, Germany, China, Hong Kong, the
Netherlands, Malaysia and the Philippines. The only Asian nation
on this list 20 years ago was India.

<HEADLINE> Film on Opium War Popular in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- "Opium War," a movie that began
showing in Hong Kong on June 14, took in 926,000 Hong Kong dollars
in box office receipt in the first three days of screening, local
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The movie, which was produced by an independent film studio
based in southwest China's Sichuan Province, tells the story of
the Anglo-Chinese Opium War in the early 1840s. One direct result
of the war is the 156-year British occupation of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The movie earned 170,000 Hong Kong dollars on the first day of
screening, and its box office receipt jumped to 300,000 Hong Kong
dollars the next day.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Zhang Junsheng,
deputy-director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, and Rita
Fan Hsu Lai Tai, chairwoman of the HKSAR Provisional Legislative
Council, attended the movie's premiere in the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the movie has a special significance at this historic
moment when Hong Kong is going to return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The movie has won favorable comments from local movie critics,
who praise it for "successfully depicting a historical event from
a modern perspective while preserving the tradition of historical
movies produced in China's interior areas."
</P>
<P>
"The movie reproduces history, and denounces the decadence of
China's feudal dynasty and the invasion against China by British
imperialists," a local moviegoer commented. "I appreciate the
expertise of the director."
</P>
<P>
"Opium War" was directed by Xie Jin, a veteran film director in
Shanghai who enjoys worldwide reputation.
</P>
<P>
With the date of Hong Kong's handover approaching, movies and
TV shows on related subjects produced by local and mainland
studios have frequently appeared in local movie houses and on
local television.
</P>
<P>
TVB, a major local TV station, is now airing in prime time "The
Story of Hong Kong," a TV series on Hong Kong's vicissitudes over
the past century, which was produced in China's interior area.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "One Country, Two Systems" Practicable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's smooth return to China
on July 1 proves that Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems" is practicable, two Macao celebrities said.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Ho Hau-Wah, president of the Macao Bankers' Association
and a member of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress, and Ng Fok, a well-known businessman and a
member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made these remarks in a recent
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return, as a major event in the history of the
Chinese nation, marks an important beginning in the course of
China's peaceful reunification," Ho said. "A pioneering
undertaking, the concept of 'one country, two systems' will help
promote the peaceful reunification with Taiwan as well."
</P>
<P>
He said Macao can learn from Hong Kong's experience in the
implementation of the policy, although Macao is different from
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's success is very important to Macao as Macao will
also return to China in 1999 when the policy of 'one country, two
systems' will be implemented," he said. "Macao's transition will
enter into a new stage after Hong Kong's return."
</P>
<P>
He urged Macao people to support Hong Kong in ensuring the
success of the policy, saying it is vital not only to Hong Kong
and Macao, but also to the Chinese nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
When a nation recovers a piece of land occupied by other
nations, Ho noted, there are always war and blood. But the policy
of "one country, two systems" has for the first time in the world
history resolved the issue in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
"Although there were ups and downs during the past 13 years,
Hong Kong remains basically prosperous and stable if viewing the
whole transition process," he said. "That should first be
attributed to the concept of 'one country, two systems.'"
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financier said, China's political stability
and economic growth is also credited with Hong Kong's successful
transition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ng Fok, a leading entrepreneur in the territory,
said Hong Kong's return marks the advent of a new historic epoch,
as Hong Kong will be governed by Hong Kong people themselves and
China takes its first step in the cause of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's success proves that Deng Xiaoping's concept of
'one country, two systems' is a practicable way in the peaceful
reunification of the motherland," he said. "It is also a good idea
in handling disputes left over from history between nations."
</P>
<P>
He urged other businessmen to invest in Macao and help
contribute to a successful transition.
</P>
<P>
"We should take the return of Hong Kong as an encouragement,"
he said. "We should help cultivate a smooth transition in Macao
through more investment to promote the local economy."

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Enters Second Round of World Youth Soccer Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay have virtually booked
a place in the second round after defeating host Malaysia 3-1 in a
Group A match of the World Youth Cup Finals at the Shah Alam
Stadium near here today.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay defeated belgium 3-0 in its first group match and now
collected 6 points with two wins, topping the four-team group
standings.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia opened the scoring in the 10th minute through Nik
Fadly, but Zalayeta of Uruguay used his height to equalize with a
powerful header in the 24th minute.
</P>
<P>
In the 37th minute, Malaysia conceded an own goal when Haled
Masron tapped in Nicolas Olivera's grounder. In the 75th minute
of the match, Lopez Mora of Uruguay added another goal.
</P>
<P>
Despite the second defeat, Malaysia, who lost to Morocco 1-3 in
their first match, still have a slim chance of making the second
round, provided that they beat Belgium in the last match.
</P>
<P>
In the France-South Korea group B match at Kuching, France
scored twice in the first two minutes to wrap up a comfortable 4-2
victory over South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Captain Thierry Henry scored a first-minute goal and David
Trezequet made it 2-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Thierry added another goal in the 10th minute and Trezequet
also scored his second goal in the 52nd minute to give France a
commanding 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans fought back through goals by Park Jin-Sup in
the 54th and 69th minutes.
</P>
<P>
In a group C match at Alor Setar, Ghana came from behind to
hold China to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
China went into the lead when Li Jinyu scored the team's lone
goal two minutes before half-time.
</P>
<P>
But the Ghanaians, 2-1 victors over Ireland on Tuesday,
dominated the Chinese defence after the break and were rewarded
by Stephen Appiah's equaliser in the 74th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ghana have four points and China one in group C. Ireland take
on the United States later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 24 teams will bow out after the preliminary league
as the top two and four best third-pace finishers from the six
groups advance to the last 16. The final will be played on July 5.

<HEADLINE> China's Vice-Premier on "One Country, Two Systems" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading national newspaper, today published an article by Chinese
vice-premier and foreign minister Qian Qichen, entitled "Adhering
to the Principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' in the Long Term."
</P>
<P>
Following are excerpts from the article, which is Qian's
speech Wednesday at a meeting to discuss Deng Xiaoping's theory on
"peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems". Qian is
also the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Qian reviewed that it was with Deng Xiaoping's great concept of
"one country, two systems," that the Hong Kong question has been
finally perfectly resolved. "The Chinese government has upheld the
concept and has made great efforts for the establishment of SAR in
steps during the 13-year-long transitional period," Qian
said, adding that "Practices in the past years have proven the
truthfulness of Deng's unique thoughts."
</P>
<P>
The issue following Hong Kong's return to the motherland
is to unswervingly safeguard the long-term prosperity and
stability of the SAR, which can be considered both "a strategic
task for China and an issue concerning the international
community," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The key to the issue is to keep the principle of "one country,
two systems" unchanged in the long run. "The Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR has clearly
promulgated that the principle is to remain 'unchanged for 50
years," which means unchanged for a long period of time.

<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank (ADB) today approved loans totaling 107.1 million U.S.
dollars to Bangladesh and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a news release that the loan to Bangladesh will
help finance a livestock development project in which
beneficiaries, non-governmental organizations and government play
key roles.
</P>
<P>
The project will give more than 350,000 households,
particularly poor and landless women, in northwest and
north-central Bangladesh an opportunity to earn money by rearing
chickens, cattle and goats.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loans, 87.4 million dollars will go to Indonesia
for a communicable diseases control project to intensify efforts
to reduce the diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 17 million people will benefit from the project which
will improve the delivery of health services in the country, the
bank said.

<HEADLINE> China's Vice-Premier on "One Country, Two Systems" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qian gave five reasons for adhering to the principle:
</P>
<P>
First, he considered it a decision made for the long-term good
of China. China has set a goal to quadruple its gross domestic
product to 1,000-1,200 billion US dollars before the year
2000. Accordingly, guaranteeing the prosperity of Hong Kong, a
nexus for the country to the international market, is necessary
for China's best interests.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, the eventual target is to reunite China by
peaceful means. The solution of the Hong Kong question is
considered a giant leap towards the reunification of the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return, China will solve the Macao problem,
and finally realize the reunification across the Taiwan Strait with
the principle of "peaceful reunification based on one country, two
systems'," Qian said. This is not a choice based on emotion, but
rather a practical consideration of both Hong Kong's history and
current situation.
</P>
<P>
Third, the bottom line is that the policy must not be changed
by either side. "This means that the inland area will not alter
its socialist system and Hong Kong retains its capitalist
system. The two systems co-exist in one country," Qian noted. "The
condition for keeping Hong Kong's capitalism is that the inland
area sticks to socialism."
</P>
<P>
The fourth reason for carrying out the principle is that it
lets Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong. "The mentality of old
colonialists considered Chinese people incapable of governing
Hong Kong well. However, the prosperity of Hong Kong should be
attributed to Hong Kong people, of which the Chinese form the
majority," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the principle requires a high degree of autonomy in
the SAR, which ultimately will lead to China's reunification. "In
that context, the operation of the capitalist system in a small
region is beneficial for the development of socialism as a whole,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian concluded by summing up two fundamental characteristics of
the principle: it is the outcome of the Chinese Communist Party's
practice to "seek truth from facts," and it can be used to solve
other controversial issues in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"It was an idea born in China, but it can be used to tackle
certain international problems," Qian pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft "Spirit of Hong Kong 97" Arrives in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, first chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, today
attended a welcome ceremony for the "Spirit of Hong Kong 97", a
specially painted Cathay Pacific Boeing 747-200 commemorating the
return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
The short ceremony was also attended by Cathay Pacific Deputy
Chairman Patrick Tsai.
The aircraft was welcome with a lion dance.
</P>
<P>
The design on the aircraft fuselage is based on the airline's
"Heart of Asia" print advertisements, with brushstroke depictions
of prominent buildings on the Hong Kong Island skyline, and the
Chinese Character "Jia", meaning "home".
</P>
<P>
The design was chosen because it is the spirit of Hong Kong
that drives the extraordinary success of Cathay Pacific's home,
and Hong Kong's skyline represents the aspirations and
achievements of its people, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
It took 27 days to complete the repainting of the aircraft at
the Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company facility in Xiamen, east
China.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific's B747-200s serve the airline's regional and
Middle East routes, so the "Spirit of Hong Kong 97" will be seen
in various cities in the Asia region. It is envisaged that the
design will remain on the aircraft for at least one year.

<HEADLINE> D-8 Not to Be Affected by Turkish PM's Resignation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The group of eight Muslim
developing countries, or D-8, would continue with its founding
objectives despite the resignation of Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan who mooted the idea to form the grouping,
Malaysia said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stressed that Erbakan's
resignation yesterday will not affect D-8, the brainchild of
Erbakan, as those involved are not Erbakan but eight countries --
Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he is aware that other Turkish leaders also
regard D-8 as an important forum for Turkey as well as for other
member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of D-8 in forging close cooperation is
well-received by all parties including the Turkish government," he
told reporters after a social function here.
</P>
<P>
D-8 aims to enhance economic ties among member countries to
ensure a strong and effective grouping irrespective of their
political ideology.
</P>
<P>
The grouping held its inaugural summit in Istanbul, Turkey, on
Sunday and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is
abroad for a long vacation, was among several leaders of the D-8
member countries to attend the summit.

service sector to get more than 50 percent of its energy to be
clean. Two large steel plants are moving out of the city proper as
part of this.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the city will spend more heavily on
building a sewage treatment plant with a 1.2-million-ton daily
capacity along the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Dam, and make
sure that drainage into the Yangtze River by all industrial
enterprises is clean enough.

"We are doing all we can to develop the economy and improve the
environment simultaneously, and I believe we will do a better job
in environmental protection as our city grows stronger
economically," the mayor concluded.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Ends Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 18 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat left here today after a two-day official visit as part of
his Gulf tour to seek support for the Palestinians in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates was the second leg of his trip which
has taken him to Saudi Arabia. He will visit other Gulf
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Arafat met with some UAE top officials,
including UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan and
discussed with them the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here noted that Arafat hoped the UAE
and other Gulf countries would use their influence in Washington
to stop the implementation of a U.S. House of Representatives
resolution on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
Gulf countries have criticized the U.S. resolution which was
passed last week and set aside 100 million U.S. dollars to move the
U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats also said that during his tour in the region,
Arafat will request aid from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain,
Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Arafat began his tour as Israeli troops shot and wounded
dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. Four
consecutive days of violence between the Israelis and
Palestinians reflect a further crack in the stalled Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace talks were set in deadlock after Israel
began the construction of a new settlement in East
Jerusalem in March.

<TEXT>

<P>
Hong Kong, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The first high-speed direct
Internet backbone connection between Hong Kong and Guangzhou was
inaugurated today, it was learned here.
</P>
<P>
Also launched were two new data communications services that
employ Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Frame Relay
technology.
</P>
<P>
The projects launched by Hong Kong Telecom and the Guangdong
Posts and Telecommunications Administration are believed to
provide customers of the two places with more choices of
cost-effective, fast and reliable data network solutions, sources
of HK Telecom said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Telecom's Netplus is the first and only Internet
backbone provider in the Asian region to have 512 Kbps direct
connection to China's Internet backbone, ChinaNet. Apart from the
new high-speed backbone, there are already direct links to Beijing
and Shanghai at present.
</P>
<P>
The new link further reinforces the position Hong Kong Telecom
as the Internet hub in Asia and a gateway to other parts of China,
Hong Kong Telecom experts claimed.
</P>
<P>
With the direct link, which will be upgraded to full T1 (1.5
Mbps) by the end of this year, customers can conduct business with
their mainland counterparts over the Internet in a much faster,
more reliable and secure environment and to generate more Internet
based business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, customers can also use the Internet roaming services
already available in Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou and
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The ISDN services enable customers to transmit voice, fax, video
images and computer data simultaneously to several destinations at
high speed from 64Kbps to 384Kbps. Besides Guangzhou, the service
is also available in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Frame Relay service also allows for simultaneous
communications with multiple destinations via a single access
line.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Successfully Cultivate Plants With Saltwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully cultivated plants with saltwater in the Taklimakan
desert, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The moving desert has a severe environment, with sharp
temperature differences between day and night and massive storms
of sand and dust, that prevents the Tarim oil field from being
further developed.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters for the Tarim oil field exploration and the
Lanzhou Desert Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences began to jointly conduct pilot experiments for
afforestation at the heart of the desert in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Experiments have also been conducted for cultivating vegetables
and grasses in the desert, and techniques have been developed for
making use of the local desert and underground saltwater resources
to cultivate vegetables and other plants.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists found that obnoxious substances of the sandy
soil and saltwater will be wiped out when they are put together,
and the mixture can be turned into a kind of useful land and water
resource.
</P>
<P>
"The harmful substance in the salty water can be quickly
dissolved in the sandy soil, and the soil has the characteristics
of not absorbing salt, which is suitable for planting crops," said
Gao Qianzhao, a leading scentist of the research project.
</P>
<P>
Research has found that the plants cultivated by bitter
saltwater are growing better than the one cultivated by fresh
water, which is attributed to the sharp temperature difference in
the Tarim desert. The difference has enabled the sandy soil to
better condense the moisture content in the saltwater.
</P>
<P>
The experimental zone in the desert, where nothing used to
grow, has developed an 0.3 ha of greenhouse vegetable garden, 1.6
ha of forest, and a shelter tree belt of 120 meters in length,
setting up an entire saltwater irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 kinds of vegetables and crops have been
cultivated, with some hitting the country's record of per-ha
production, such as 75,000 kg of tomatoes per ha, and 56,000 kg of
rapeseed per ha.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out the successful cultivation of plants
by bitter saltwater has not only found ways to solve the living
problems of workers of the Tarim oil field, but also provided
valuable experiences for China to further develop desert areas.

<HEADLINE> Election of SAR Chief Executive Marks a New Era in HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 31 people applied before the deadline set by the
Preparatory Committee (PC). The PC Executive Council, upon
examination of their qualifications, determined that eight of them
were qualified as contenders for candidacy.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, 1996, the Selection Committee held its first
plenary session in Hong Kong to select formal candidates for the
Chief Executive. The session was open to the public. Out of the
eight contenders for candidacy, Tung Chee Hwa, Yang Ti-Liang and
Woo Kwong-ching received, respectively, 206, 82 and 54 votes, to
become formal candidates for the first Chief Executive. The other
five were now out of the race.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, the Selection Committee heard policy speeches
of the three candidates at its second plenary session in Hong
Kong. Woo Kwong-ching, Tung Chee-Hwa and Yang Ti-liang outlined,
in the order chosen by lots, laid out their blueprints for the
administration of Hong Kong. They said they were competing for the
post out of a sense of a historical mission.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, they attended four question-and-answer sessions
attended by various social sectors in Hong Kong. This provided a
basis for
vote-casting by members of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, in a solemn atmosphere, the 400 Selection
Committee members, representing more than six million Hong Kong
people, cast their votes for the first Chief Executive of the
HKSAR by secret ballot.
The event was covered by more than 300 Chinese and overseas
reporters and televised live to let all people in Hong Kong
witness the proceedings. The whole process was conducted under
supervisors designated by the PC Executive Council.
Tung Chee-Hwa, 59, won the election by winning 320 votes to
become the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, Hong Kong residents made their
own decision in choosing the highest-ranking official of the
region.
</P>
<P>
After the election, Tung said, "I will not underestimate
difficulties and challenges ahead. However, I have complete
confidence in the future of Hong Kong. I promise I would do my
utmost to create a better Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
On December 16, Chinese Premier Li Peng signed a State Council
order appointing Tung Chee-Hwa first Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Election of the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR was
conducted under democratic, fair and open principles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 19 (Xinhua)--Xinhua News Agency today published a
commentary on the importance of China's resuming of the exercises
of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the giant clock in the countdown board is
ticking to the last second when China will resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the 1.2 billion Chinese people will
fulfill their dream. It could be imagined that millions of Chinese
all over the world will also hail the great day's arrival.
</P>
<P>
People all over the world who advocate justice and oppose
aggression, who have suffered servitude, humiliation and misery
from imperialism and colonialism will celebrate any event that
represents a new development in establishing an international
relationship marked with peace, stability, justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
Through negotiations with Britain and with the adoption of the
"one country, two systems" principle, China resolved the
historical problem, resulting from imperialism and colonialism,
that was acceptable to all parties. China's resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong sets an example for solving
nation-to-nation conflicts through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of China's major contributions to world peace,
progress and development," said the commentary.

<HEADLINE> HK's Status as Global Shipping Center More Stable: Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All measures guarantee that Hong Kong's stance as international
shipping center will not be weakened but further stablized, Huang
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong last year handled 13.4 million containers, and ranked
as the world's leader for five years in a row. The hub is now also
an important entrepot for inland areas. Of the total container
transport volume, some 70 percent are related to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The sound economic growth in inland areas is expected to
further boost the container transport to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international harbors in the inland areas handled a
combined eight million containers last year. "The growth rate in
the first five months this year kept at 25 percent, ensuring the
steady flow of containers to Hong Kong," Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Huang believed that the improving transport conditions in
inland areas, in particular in south China's Pearl River delta,
will further boost Hong Kong's shipping industry. "Guangdong now
has China's longest expressway network. The completion of certain
key projects, such as Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway,
Shenzhen-Shantou Expressway and other river harbors along the
Pearl River will give full play to Hong Kong's handling capacity,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang revealed that his ministry has been in discussion with
relevant Hong Kong-based units on certain big transport
facilities, which, he believed, will be "mutual beneficial for
both inland areas and Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
As of the relationship between Shanghai, an emerging shipping
center, and Hong Kong, Huang said that "Shanghai is still in a
take-off period." The port handled 1.97 million containers last
year and the figure may hit 2.5 million this year, a rise of about
25 percent. "Even so, anyone can see it will take time and effort
for Shanghai to build up its strength and image," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the two centers are "compatible" for the two
have different service targets. "The targets of Hong Kong
concentrate on Pearl River Delta while Shanghai aims to provide
services for the whole Yangtze River valley," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides the title of communication minister, Huang also takes
the post of chairman of the board of China Merchants Steam
Navigation Company, one of the four major corporations funded by
the inland areas in Hong Kong. However, the company "seeks no
privileges or market dominance after Hong Kong's return to the
motherland," he said. "The role the company wants to play is to
contribute to the prosperity of Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> HK's Status as Global Shipping Center More Stable: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- "We will seriously deal with all
matters related to communications between the inland areas and
Hong Kong, an acknowledged international free port and shipping
center," Huang Zhendong, Chinese minister of communications told
Xinhua reporters in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the development of the transport industry, in
particular the oceanic shipping industry, is of vital importance
for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after it
returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that after the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland, the navigation routes between the inland areas, the
main body of the country, and Hong Kong, China's separate customs
territory, will be treated as "special regional routes,"
equivalent to foreign trade transport.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the Basic Law, and empowered by the central
government, the SAR government can independently maintain and
develop shipping ties with other countries or regions in the name
of 'Hong Kong, China'," Huang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will also be authorized to sign and
implement multi-lateral or bi-lateral navigation accords, and
establish official or semi-official navigation organs for handling
related matters.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will take effective measures to protect the
interests of Hong Kong in bi-lateral and multi-lateral navigation
problems after "thorough consultation with the SAR government or
relevant authorities" he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our ministry, however, will not interfere with SAR government
to settle navigation-related matters and will not set up organs
with administrative functions in Hong Kong after its return,"
Huang said.

<HEADLINE> China's Grassroots Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhengzhou, June 19 (Xinhua) -- When the 3,000-plus deputies to
the National People's Congress gathered in Beijing in early April,
some 30 farmers in a small village in Henan Province, central
China, were busy debting issues surrounding the well-being of the
community.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were "people's representatives" directly elected by
the village's 370 households. Every ten families can choose one
for the villagers representative meeting that in turn elects the
village committee. They meet five to eight times a year to discuss
issues that touch everyone in the village.
</P>
<P>
The system is in use in different parts of rural China. In
Hunan Province's Xuchang City, for example, 1,892 villages out of
a total of 1,900 have set up representative meetings.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the trend indicates that Chinese farmers
begin to develop a sense of democracy, or political participation
when they have gained economic autonomy under the household
contract system adopted during the reform process.
</P>
<P>
One official explains: "The mandatory methods of collective
farming no longer work. There is the need for political reform."
Conflicts arose when farmers were not satisfied with decisions
made by village heads appointed by superiors, and in some places,
would try every way to give a hard time to village heads they
didn't like.
</P>
<P>
"All these years we have tried every way to meet farmers'
growing need for democratic participation," said an official in
Xuchang City.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, Chinese legislature, passed a village committee law in
1987, the essence of which is giving farmers the right to manage
their own affairs in accordance with certain laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
"The village representative meeting is the result of the
implementation of the law," the official noted. "Through the
directly elected representatives, farmers participate in the
decision-making process and have a very real sense of being their
own masters."
</P>
<P>
Zhaozhai Village made a lot of money by running several pig
farms, and when village heads thought the money should be used to
build an office building, their motion was voted down by 40
village representatives who insisted on using the money for a
school building.
</P>
<P>
Village representative meetings supervise village budgets but
they also put a check on village officials. Last year
representatives in one village in Xuchang City voted an official
out of office.
</P>
<P>
Xuchang has become an example in "villagers governing village
affairs", and people from other places have visited the villages
to learn from them.
</P>
<P>
This political participation by farmers, according to a senior
official, has led the government to open more avenues for
political participation for a broader segment of the rural
population.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Municipality To Balance Economy and Environment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Long known as the smog city,
Chongqing, China's fourth municipality -- after Beijing, Shanghai,
and Tianjin -- is taking steps to balance its ambitious long-range
economic development goals with environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The southwest China city, reportedly the world's largest,
with an area of 82,000 sq km and more than 30 million people,
plans to quadruple its 1995 GDP by the year 2010, but faces
challenges in environment protection as its economy grows.
</P>
<P>
Pollution prevention has been put high on the agenda. The
municipal government is to spend seven billion yuan on 82
environment projects by the end of the century and will increase
that input to account for more than one percent of the GDP after
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have adopted policies to make sure that environmental
protection goes together with economic development, and that
pollution is brought under strict control by readjusting the
industrial structure, improving the energy structure, and
providing more facilities," the newly-elected Chongqing Mayor Pu
Haiqing says.
</P>
<P>
The city was raised to municipal status, which puts it directly
under the State Council, in March. It lies in a valley in Sichuan
province that is surrounded by hills. It had 0.34 mg of dioxide
sulphur per cu.m. of air in 1995, the second highest for China's
72 major cities.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Hong Kong to Prosper After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali has said that the prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong is guaranteed after its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Wednesday, Wali dismissed as
"absurd predictions" some Western media reports that Hong Kong's
future development will be enfeebled by the transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic reform has achieved sound success. This will
guarantee continuous prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the
future," said Wali, who doubles as Minister of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the flesh-and-blood ties between Hong Kong and
its motherland are inseparable despite the alternative political
and economic systems Hong Kong inherits from the
one-century-and-half British rule.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hong Kong will continue to serve as a major bridge for
China to associate and communicate with the outside world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong, which is an important step toward
China's reunification, will give a strong boost to the
revitalization of the nation," Wali said.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed his congratulations to the Chinese people on
being able to wipe out their humiliations as the colonial rule
ends in Hong Kong at midnight on June 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese law expert, Wu Jianfan,
urges his countrymen to increase their awareness of the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Wu, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that it is
incorrect to think that the Basic Law is only implemented in Hong
Kong and has nothing to do with the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
"Many aspects stipulated by the law are the concerns of the
whole nation and relate to every citizen," said the expert, who
lectured on the Basic Law to president Jiang Zemin and other
Chinese leaders early this year.
</P>
<P>
"Some stipulations, like the capitalist system, can only suit
the situation in Hong Kong," Wu said. "But as rules prescribed by
the law, they must be observed and respected by the nation as a
whole, so that the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong can be
guaranteed in a real sense."
</P>
<P>
Wu, lecturing at the academy, said that attention should be
paid to several issues to ensure the implementation of the Basic
Law, including correctly handling the relations between the
central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
and the preservation of the region's old laws.

and India today held their first conversation on a restored
telephone hotline.

Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral contacted Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the hotline as a goodwill gesture
at the start of a new round of the foreign secretary-level talks
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the Foreign
Office, Gujral wished the talks a success.

Sharif reiterated Pakistan's commitment to working for the
resolution of all outstanding issues, including the core issue of
Kashmir, between the two countries, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to restore the hotline, which had remained dormant
soon after it was set up in 1989, was taken by the two prime
ministers at their meeting in Male, the Maldives, in May.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider will arrive here this
evening to begin tomorrow the new round of foreign secretary-level
talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Shamshad Ahmed, which is
scheduled to conclude on June 23.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Pakistan will raise the reported deployment
of medium-range ballistic Prithvi missiles by India near its
border with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has taken strong exception to the reported deployment
while India denies the report.
</P>

possibility of forming working groups on all outstanding issues as
agreed upon by the prime ministers of the two countries at the

ABU DHABI, June 19 (Xinhua)-- Thirty warplanes and over 1,000
airmen of U.S. air forces began to leave Qatar for home today
after completing their task of supporting U.N. sanctions over
Iraq, the Qatari news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes and airmen are from the fourth wing of the

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Account for 9 Percent of German Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The German Federal Statistics Office
said today that the number of foreigners living in the country has
increased to 7.3 million by the end of 1996, accounting for 8.9
percent of the total population of about 82 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics office based in Wiesbaden, the
latest foreigner figures represented a 1.6 percent increase from
the level of 1991 when there were about 5.9 million foreign
residents living in the country, or a share of 7.3 percent in the
whole population.
</P>
<P>
More than a fourth of the foreign population have lived in
Germany for 20 years or more but have not acquired German
citizenship. About half of the foreigners have lived in the
country for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign population, two million are Turks, followed
by 1.8 million migrating from other European Union countries, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing foreign population has aroused many debates
about Germany's current citizenship law, rooted in a 1913 imperial
decree that based nationality on German ancestry.
</P>
<P>
Many Germans have come to believe that the law is badly
outdated and there is an urgent need to integrate foreigners who
have settled in the country for dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Until 1993, foreigners were obliged to wait 15 years and spend
thousands of dollars in fees to apply for German citizenship, and
there were no guarantees even after that.
</P>
<P>
Now an applicant must have only eight years' residency,
reasonable fluency in German and prove he can support a family
without state assistance. But there still remains daunting
obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Election of SAR Chief Executive Marks a New Era in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Election of the First Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
is an event of historic significance in the history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It marks the beginning of a new era when Hong Kong is governed
by Hong Kong people themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the HKSAR and relevant decisions
of the National People's Congress, the First Chief Executive
should be elected by a Selection Committee made up of 400 members
who are all permanent Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is to be composed of 100 members from
each of the following four sectors: industrial, commercial and
financial sectors; the professions; labor, social services,
religious and other sectors; and former political figures, Hong
Kong deputies to the National People's Congress and
representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
When specific methods for forming the Selection Committee had
been worked out, members of the Preparatory Committee (PC) for the
HKSAR each produced a namelist of recommended people from the
5,749 applicants who met qualification requirements. Then, at a
meeting, the Executive Council of the PC chose 409 candidates
strictly in accordance with the number of recommendations the
applicants had received from the PC members.
</P>
<P>
At its sixth plenary session held on November 2, 1996, the PC
elected 340 out of the 409 candidates as members of the Selection
Committee. Meanwhile, another 34 Selection Committee members were
chosen, through consultations, from among Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the CPPCC. The 26 Hong Kong deputies to the
National People's Congress became Selection Committee members
automatically in accordance with methods of formation. The
400-member Selection Committee was thus formed.
</P>
<P>
While forming the Selection Committee, the PC accelerated the
pace of working out methods for electing the First Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The PC decided on qualification requirements for the first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR: he or she must be a Chinese
citizen of not less than 40 years of age who is a permanent
resident of the Region with no right of abode in any foreign
country and has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous
period of not less than 20 years. And he or she must support the
Basic Law of the HKSAR and pledge allegiance to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The PC members agreed that the choice of candidates for the
first Chief Executive should be through election out of people
nominated on the basis of broad consultations in Hong Kong. A
namelist of nominated contenders would be distributed in Hong Kong
to invite opinions from all social strata.
</P>
<P>
After the method for selecting the Chief Executive was
announced, selection of the first Chief Executive entered an
operational stage.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant stipulations, applicants should first
express their intention to enter the race and fill in an
application form. Applicants would become contenders for candidacy
when the PC Executive Council determines that they meet
qualification requirements. The next step: those who obtain at
least 50 votes from members of the Selection Committee would
become formal candidates for the HKSAR Chief Executive.

suggestions at least one leading US institution had re-rated the
Australian market overnight.
</P>
<P>
"From what I can gather it was overseas buying that came into
our market due to an overnight re-rating by some of the leading US
institution positive towards the Australian market," one broker
said.

Reynolds &AMP; Co's Peter Struk said investors were chasing
high-yield, top quality stocks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar continued
to falter today under the pressure of speculation that the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) still has a bias toward lowering official
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 74.8 U.S. cents from 75.14.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has weakened on the back of actual and
expected movements in interest rate differentials, reaching a
10-month low on the trade weighted index of 56.6," said Citibank
economist Annette Beacher.
</P>
<P>
The gap between interest rates here and in the United States
closed on May 23 when the RBA lowered rates to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its overnight indicator rate
on March 25 and may do so again when its policy-making committee
meets on July 1 to 2.
</P>
<P>
This would make U.S. securities more attractive to global
investors than Australian securities because of the higher U.S.
interest rates on offer.
</P>
<P>
Beacher said the Australian currency remains supported in the
long term, forecasting that it will be nearer to 79 U.S. cents
than 73 by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar closed lower.
</P>

The local unit was at 84.81 Japanese yen, down from 85.31

<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here today for Paris to meet with his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac on their mediation efforts to rescue the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president was accompanied by a top-notch delegation,
including his political advisor Osama el-Baz. Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, who has embarked on a three-nation European tour
since Wednesday, will join the delegation later today.
</P>
<P>
With the recent Mideast developments on the agenda of
Mubarak's visit, the two presidents will also discuss bilateral
ties and the outcome of the recent European Union summit.
</P>
<P>
In a statement adopted at the Amsterdam summit Wednesday, the
EU leaders urged Israel for the first time to consider allowing
the creation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed its opposition to Jewish settlements and
support for Arab-Israeli security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador to France All Maher said Wednesday that
France stresses support for Egypt and for Mubarak's efforts
aimed at salvaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been seeking a stronger role in the Mideast
peacemaking and sent its special envoy to the region several
times in a bid to break the current crisis due to Israel's
construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Egypt managed to broker a meeting between Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators on June 8, but gap between the sides remained.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters in Rome, Italy Wednesday that Egypt has
decided to temporarily put on hold the shuttle tours of Baz, its
envoy, between the Palestinian National Authority and Israel as
their crying rifts have rendered his mission futile.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to new substantive talks is the disagreement
over Israeli settlement activity, especially in Arab East
Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want to establish their future
capital.

<P>
Hong Kong, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's has expressed
its optimism about Hong Kong's economic and credit strength after
its return to China.
</P>
<P>
A report released Wednesday by the well-known risk and credit
rating agency noted that "the closer union of a high-income,
international financial center with the world's emerging economic
giant has relatively little commercial downside.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with its optimism about the economic future of Hong
Kong and the rest of China, Standard &AMP; Poor's recently upgraded
the ratings of the Chinese mainland to triple-B-plus from
triple-B, and Hong Kong to single-A-plus from single-A.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China is accompanied by a good deal
of optimism about Hong Kong's continued economic success, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
This confidence is reflected in firm property values, a leap in
share prices on the stock exchange, and a surge in "sell-out" new
listings by mainland-related companies, it said.

Intergovernmental Conference ended at early hours on Wednesday in a

of the policy of the United States toward Africa.

a job conference in September, Jospin is expected to refrain from
announcing any big decision concerning public budget spending.
</P>
<P>
The government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said that the

Prime Minister Alain Juppe.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Defense Secretary's Hostile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian spokesman attacked
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen for his "poisonous
propaganda" against Iran with an aim to "create anxiety in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
noted that the increased presence of foreign forces in the
Persian Gulf and the unchecked sales of weapons to the region are
the main obstacles on the way of establishment of security.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, quoted by the official news agency IRNA today,
was making comments on Cohen's recent Gulf tour, during which the
U.S. official told Arab leaders that Iran is a threat to the
regional security.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi added that Iran places a great importance on the
security of the Persian Gulf and considers security and
cooperation among the countries in the Persian Gulf region as a
must to this end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, today's English daily Iran News published an
editorial entitled "Regional countries should not allow Cohen to
cast shadow on new trends in ties."
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that the U.S. defense secretary has adopted
"bullying tactics" against Iran to create the impression in the
sheikhdoms that there is a definite risk of another war in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged the regional countries to be wise enough
not to allow Cohen to cast a shadow on the newly-fashioned trend
in regional relations.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has never adopted an aggressive posture toward its
neighbors in the southern Persian Gulf, and (President-elect
Mohammad) Khatami's election has helped allay most of the
imaginary fears of the region rulers regarding Tehran's future
policies," it said.

Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh formally accepted

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Receives Message from Syrian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has received a message from his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad, denouncing U.S.-Israeli moves to destabilize the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam who paid a one-day visit here Wednesday, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani and the Syrian vice-president held talks on their
stances toward the latest development in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the incursion of Turkish troops into northern Iraq and
Ankara's military cooperation with Israel, Khaddam said that "by
trying to create tension among Israel's neighboring countries,
Israel and the United States are preparing ground for their
intervention and illegitimate presence in the region."
</P>
<P>
He termed as another U.S.-Israeli plot the recent vote of the
U.S. House of Representatives to move the U.S. embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said that Syria is ready to hold frequent and top-level
consultations with Iran and other frontline states opposed to
Israel in order to pursue a coordinated common policy against such
a plot.
</P>
<P>
He said that al-Assad will participate in the summit of
heads of state of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) to be held in Tehran in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral relations, the Syrian vice-president
said that Iran and Syria enjoy good relations due to historical
and religious commonalities, and the ties are growing day by day.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bilateral relations should be further
deepened in order to prevent what he called the expansionist and
domineering alien powers from exercising control over the region.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was quoted by the IRNA as saying that Iran fully
supports Muslim countries to oppose the sinister greed of alien
powers. He said that the United States and Israel are trying to
sow the seeds of discord by creating crises in the region in order
to justify their presence and domination there.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the U.S. Congress' resolution to recognize
Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, Rafsanjani termed
it as a proof of Washington's disregard for the rights of millions
of Palestinian refugees and the demands of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has clearly demonstrated that its claim of being
impartial in the Arab-Israeli negotiations is but an empty one,
Rafsanjani noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also expressed his concern over the
developments in northern Iraq, saying that Iran, Syria and all
other Islamic countries should take the responsibility to resolve
the crises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam left here for home Wednesday at the end of his official
visit and was seen off at the airport by his Iranian counterpart
Hassan Habibi.

<P>
Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said at the cabinet meeting
that the proposal to establish a dedicated roads agency has been
put forward after extensive studies on home and foreign
experiences.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, road building and maintenance in South Africa
will be placed on a commercial footing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus sets up the need for the management of road as a national
resource, to be carried out with efficiency, accountability and
transparency, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
"The national roads, which are the key to economic growth in
South Africa, have been deteriorating due to decreasing funding,"
Maharaj noted.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation With Hong Kong in Cleaning South China River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The border city of Shenzhen and
Hong Kong are cooperating in a large river-control project on the
37-km-long Shenzhen River, between the two cities, to clean it up
and make it more suitable for transportation.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, 1995, after 13 years of negotiations, local
governments began the first phase of a joint project on the
waterway which had caused environmental problems on both its banks
as it became narrower and dirtier day by day.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was completed a month ahead of schedule, and
the second phase started recently, while feasibility studies for
the third and fourth phases have been done.
</P>
<P>
The first phase treatment, which cost 279 million HK dollars,
has improved the river environment substantially.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed in seven or eight years, the
river is expected to be widened to increase its flood-discharge
capacity to 2,100 cu.m. per second, from the present 600, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
By then, vessels of up to 500 tons will be able to use the
river, and it is likely to become another tourist site.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Concerned over Latest Situation in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) today expressed concern over the latest
situation in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, hoping it will not jeopardize
Cambodia's entry into the regional grouping next month.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is
chairman of the ASEAN standing committee, said today at the
moment there was no threat to Cambodia's entry into the presently
seven-member grouping.
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked by the report and will ask for accurate feedback
from the Malaysian ambassador to Cambodia. I prefer not to
speculate things and will wait for the report from Phnom Penh," he
told reporters after a social function here.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while commenting on the
reportedly intense 90-minute gun battle between body-guard units
of Cambodia's co-prime ministers in Phnom Penh on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he read a newspaper report today quoting a
Malaysian in Cambodia describing the situation there as not as bad
as the media had made it out to be.
</P>
<P>
"And now the situation is back to normal. I really want to know
what is happening and I will get our ambassador (in Cambodia)
Kamal Ismaun to submit a report," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The political situation in Cambodia is fluid by the hour, by
the day and anything can happen. There is no speculation in this
matter. We can only hope for the best," he said.
</P>
<P>
On whether there was a need for Malaysia, as ASEAN current
chairman, to be the mediator in mending the rift between Ranariddh
and the other co-premier Hun Sen, Abdullah said it was unnecessary
as it was "an internal problem".
</P>
<P>
During his separate meetings with Ranariddh and Hun Sen in
Phnom Penh 10 days ago, Abdullah said he had conveyed to them both
ASEAN's concern over the political situation in that country and
the co-premiers assured him that the "situation was improving"
and that cooperation between them was crucial to Cambodia's
future.
</P>
<P>
"I accepted what they told me and hoped nothing would happen."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said ASEAN was hopeful for a peaceful Cambodia and
wanted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to continue working towards resolving
their differences.
</P>
<P>
During their one-day special meeting here last May 31, the
ASEAN foreign ministers agreed to admit Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar
into the regional grouping now comprising Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar are scheduled for admission into
ASEAN at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting here on July 24-25.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Reserve Up Impressively by May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign exchange reserve
shot up impressively to over seven billion U.S. dollars in May
from 5.9 billion dollars at the end of March, gaining 1.1 billion
dollars in two months.
</P>
<P>
The latest reserve position means Nigeria's rating in the
international economic community has improved since the country
has enough to pay for several more months of imports, local
newspaper This Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Ministry sources as saying that the
position of the reserve should give some measure of confidence to
the opeators in the foreign exchange market as government now has
almost an elastic capacity to meet any level of demand for
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the paper, a number of analysts contend
that the reserve are going up because the government is not
meeting its local and international financial commitments.
</P>
<P>
Higer forein currency reserves are believed to work in favor
of a country, especially as it helps keep its currency strong.
But the increase of reserve has not yet been helpful for curbing
the depreciation of the local currency due to the shortage of
foreign exchange supply. The market rate changed from one U.S.
dollar to about 80 Naira at the beginning of this year to present
87 Naira or so.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the Nigerian government, instead of using the
reserve to meet exchange demand, might have put substantial part
of the accumulated reserve to increase funding for upstream
(exploration) and downstream (refining) oil sector which are said
to be at the verge of collapse due to inadequate funding.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Former Zairean Refugees Register for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 refugees from
former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have
registered for voluntary repatriation after staying in Tanzania
for seven months, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The World Vision Communication Co-ordinator, Steven Kiruswa,
said in Arusha, Northern Tanzania on Wednesday that 4,000
refugees were from the Nyarugusu camp while 1,000 were from the
Lugufu camp. Both camps are in Kigoma Region, Western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kiruswa, who has just returned from a visit in Kigoma, said
that the refugees want to go back home after Laurent Kabila and
his allies successfully ousted Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
in a seven-month civil war.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees who registered themselves for voluntary
repatriation were among 100,000 Zaireans who fled their country
into Tanzania since the outbreak of the civil strife late last
October.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees who wanted to go home is small because
the majority feared fresh fighting might erupt in the new Congo,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10,000 refugees from Burundi flocked into
Kigoma Region between May 15 and June 5 because of fresh fighting
in Burundi, he said.

LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Manufacturers are urged to
consider exploiting the large market of the Democratic Republic
of Congo for their exports.
</P>
<P>
There is need for Zambian manufacturers to look into the
possibility of exploiting the Conglolese market as it is opening
up for various goods, said Jennifer Kaunda, managing director of

"The Congolese market has the potential to become a large
market for Zambia, and local businessmen should take advantage of
the situation," Kaunda added.

poultry products, beef and other foodstuff, detergents, and

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Offers Wider Areas for Investment from Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Years of construction
have made Zhuhai, one of China's first special economic zones,
an investment spot popular among businesspeople from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai will take full advantage of the return of Hong
Kong, China's international financial center, to attract more
capital from around the globe, says Zhong Jinlai, director of the
Municipal Commission for Foreign Trade and Economic Relations.
</P>
<P>
Completion of a large number of infrastructure facilities in
the city, including the airport, deep-water port and highway
networks, together with flexible policies and measures granted by
the government, has provided Zhuhai with a wider range of
investment options for Hong Kong, according to Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai now boasts six functional districts, such as the free
trade zone, an aviation industrial town, and a high-tech
development zone.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's investment in Zhuhai has grown rapidly over the
past few years. Industries that produce computer discs and
software, auto parts and textiles have achieved advanced
production levels.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Zhuhai had drawn 1.57 billion US
dollars of investment from Hong Kong, over half of all capital
absorbed from other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The completion of major bridges and passages to connect Zhuhai
and Hong Kong will further accelerate the economic cooperation
between the two zones, says Zhong.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Number of Highrises in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 19 (Xinhua)-- Although the 20th century is
an age of skyscrapers, China got off to a slow start, says Zhou
Bingzhang, an expert on highrise architecture, but it has built
8,000 buildings of more than 20 storys each since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Previously, high-rises could only be seen in Beijing and
Shanghai, the country's leading industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Construction work has picked up momentum since the late 1970s
because the country needed to accommodate its ever growing urban
population on a limited amount of space. Concrete with greater
strength, prestressed, and with steel reinforcing is now widely
used in China's highrises, bringing them closer to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, highrises with steel structures are still
fairly new in China, with the shortest being a 14-storey mansion,
and the highest being the 88-story Pudong Financial Building in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Workers have completed 80 storeys of the building, which will
be China's tallest. The building will be 420 meters tall and will
be completed in August of 1998.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Copa America hosts Bolivia beat
Uruguay 1-0 Wednesday to complete their group matches with maximum
points and without conceding a goal.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia finished top of group B to join second-placed Peru, who
earlier beat Venezuela 2-0, in the quarter-finals. Defending
champions Uruguay were third with three points and will have to
wait until Thursday's final group C matches to know if they go
through as one of the two best of the three third-placed teams.
</P>
<P>
The result also qualified Paraguay, who finished third in group
A with four points, one more than Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Baldivieso scored the only goal in the 30th minute
when the Uruguayan defence left him unmarked at a corner, giving
him time to trap the ball on his chest, dribble past goalkeeper
and fire the ball into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia will meet the second best third-placed team in their
semi-final in La Paz on Saturday while Peru face Argentina, who
finished second in group A, in Sucre the same day.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia's win averted a crisis which could have hit the
competition if they had finished second in the group.
</P>
<P>
Argentina threatened to pull out over an alteration in the
rules made on Tuesday when the Copa America organisers announced
that if Bolivia finished second, their quarter-final against the
second-placed group A team -- which turned out to be Argentina --
would be moved to La Paz, which stands 3,600 meters high above sea
level.

DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has threatened to launch a countrywide
oust-government campaign next week if the administration does not
withdraw some proposals in the proposed budget for 1997-98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The BNP denounced as "anti-people" the proposed budget
presented to parliament a week ago, and demanded withdrawal of the
hiked price of fertiliser, news taxes and surcharge from the
budget to be put into effect on July 1.
</P>
<P>
As part of a "warm-up" program, the opposition will stage
protest rallies and demonstrations in all district headquarters
and all counties in the capital Dhaka tomorrow.

The BNP will also hold protest rallies in all county
headquarters and wards in Dhaka on Sunday and would announce a
countrywide "greater action program" to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
"The new budget is designed to kill the people. There will be
no way to live in the country if the budget is adopted, so there
is no alternative to a mass movement against the government," BNP
General Secretary Mannan Bhuiyan told a public meeting on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Bangladesh would turn into a market of India completely
if the budget is passed. He demanded the government immediately

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The third plenum of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) closed here
Wednesday after approving two resolutions.
</P>
<P>
A press communique released by Vietnam News Agency Wednesday
night said the plenum, which was opened on June 9, discussed and
approved two important resolutions, namely "promoting the people's
authority and continuing the construction of a strong and pure
state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam" and "strategy for
human resources in the period of national industrialization and
modernization."
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the plenum made deep analysis and
assessment of the renovation process in state building and
personnel training over the past ten years, affirming the major
achievements made in these fields.
</P>
<P>
It also reviewed the overall situation, pointing out "mistakes
and shortcomings which require urgent resolution, especially
corruption, wastefulness, bureaucratic style, and violations of
the people's authority by several levels of authorities and
economic organisations, by officials, eroding the people's
confidence and holding back the country's progress."
</P>
<P>
The conference unanimously approved the orientation and tasks,
and worked out major solutions to continue promoting the people's
authority, strengthening the state, building a contingent of
officials who are qualified morally and proficiently to meet
requirements of the country in the period of industrialization and
modernization, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
In his opening and closing speeches, CPV's General Secretary
Muoi stressed that the most important is to attract people,
especially workers, farmers, intellectuals and the armed forces,
to join in state management and exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
The building up of the contingent of cadres and the personnel
work must be based on "maintaining and strengthening nature of the
working class of the party," implementing a policy of solidarity
to bring together all cadres and put talented persons in important
positions, the party leader said.
</P>
<P>
He added that educating, training and managing the staff is the
most important measure to protect the party, the regime, and the
revolutionary cause.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary noted that in implementing the
market-oriented economy and broadening external exchanges, the
party must "pay attention to educating and fostering the quality,
virtues and healthy lifestyle of the cadres, upholding solidarity,
protecting internal political security and fighting against
embezzlement and bureaucracy, corruption, smuggling, bribery and
other social evils."

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Dwellers Becoming Interested In Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese city
dwellers are becoming interested in developing agriculture, having
found it profitable to invest in the sector.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Anhui province, there are nearly 10,000
enterprises and individually-run firms engaged in agriculture. One
of these people, Yang Shouchang, an associate professor at Anhui
University, paid 12,000 to 18,000 yuan per-ha to lease 80 ha of
wasteland in Wuhe county to grow fruit trees in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He has made enough to pay 210,000 yuan in taxes in the past few
years, and says, "Investing in farming is becoming popular again,
because it pays back fairly quickly." He declined, however, to
discuss his income.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tian, a lecturer at Anhui Agricultural University, has
gone to Lujiang county to develop some 13-ha of agro-science pilot
fields. "I want to put my knowledge in agriculture to practice,
and try to bring local farmers some prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's Shengquan Brewery spent 6.3 million yuan last year
raising 2,600 head of pigs as a sideline, and is expected to have
25,000 head of pigs this year. And more than 1,000 enterprises and
individually-operated firms in Bengbu city have spent over 200
million yuan on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and individuals in the rest of China are now doing
the same thing. In southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, Chen Zuojun and some associates gave up their city jobs,
came to the Dayao mountain area, and got a 50-year contract to
manage 4,000 ha of hillsides, paying five million yuan for it.
</P>
<P>
"Rural areas and agriculture provide many prospects for the
educated to start new careers," said Chen, a graduate of Beijing's
Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Lan Shengli, former mayor of Lichuan city in central China's
Hubei Province, is another example. He resigned from his job as
mayor and became a farmer and is reportedly doing well cultivating
wasteland in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Sanlu Dairy Group in north China's Hebei province has spent
20 million yuan in 24 counties helping 20,000 households raise
cattle. It in turn purchases all the products of the dairy farms.
</P>
<P>
Participation in agriculture by enterprises and townspeople not
only injects capital into China's agriculture sector, but more
importantly, brings new management expertise and new concepts to
rural areas, greatly helping China's modernization, agronomists
say.

<HEADLINE> Long Distance Oil Pipeline to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China has started work on a
4,200-km crude oil pipeline from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in the northwest to central and southwestern parts.
</P>
<P>
It starts at Korla, a transshipment center on the northern rim
of the Taklimakan Desert, home of the vast Tarim Oil Field. Along
the way it connects with a number of smaller oilfields in Xinjiang
and neighboring Qinghai province before reaching Lanzhou, the
capital of Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
At Lanzhou, the pipeline splits, with one branch going to
Luoyang in Henan province where there is a large petrochemical
plant, and the other going to Pengzhou in Sichuan province to fuel
another refinery there.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is expected to cost 20 billion yuan. By the end of
May, the 480-km first-phase from Korla to Shanshan in Xinjiang was
completed, and work on the rest will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that when it is completed the pipeline will be the
trunk line for moving crude oil from the West, meaning Shaanxi,
Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang
regions, to the East.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 billion tons of proven oil reserves in
the West, or about a third of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, China has developed a few
fields here with proven reserves of 3 billion tons. In 1996, they
yielded nearly 20 million tons of crude. Output there is expected
to reach 28 to 30 million tons by the end of the century, or a
fifth of the nation's total.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Power Production Increases in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's power sector achieved a
growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1996-97 fiscal year ending March
over the previous year, according to the latest official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity for electric power by the state-owned
Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE) was 1,030 megawatts in
the fiscal year, up from 982 megawatts in the previous year,
accounting for 74 percent of the total capacity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE generated 4.256 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity
in 1996-97, 200 million kilowatt-hours more than the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
In order to generate enough electricity for new enterprises,
heavy industries, towns and villages, Myanmar has built six power
stations since 1988 -- three hydro-power stations -- Sedawgyi,
Beluchaung and Zawgyi -- and three natural gas power stations --
Ahlone, Hlawga and Thakayta.
</P>
<P>
Of the installed capacity in the country, hydro-power shares 32
percent, while natural gas represents 51 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE also extended power transmission and distribution
lines to 21,054 kilometers in 1996-97, bringing electricity to 320
towns and 1,087 villages.
</P>
<P>
Electricity is in great demand as Myanmar's economy is now in a
stage of development with growing involvement of the private
sector and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the power shortage, Myanmar is planning to build
six more large hydro-power plants.
</P>
<P>
The 280-megawatt Paunglaung project is being undertaken by
Japan's Kajima Corporation under a contract reached in May last
year, and the 200-megawtt Namkok project in the eastern Shan state
is still under a feasibility survey by a developer group of
Marubeni (Japan), MDX (Thailand) and Italian-Thai Development
Public Co. under an agreement reached last September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an oil group of UNOCAL (US), TOTAL (France) and
Mitsui (Japan) reached a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar
in April last year to build a 200-megawatt natural gas power
station in Yangon to consume gas from Myanmar's Yadana Field.
</P>
<P>
China's Hunan group will also conduct a feasibility study for
the 90-megawatt Kun Hydropower Plant Project in Phyu, Bago
division, under an MOU signed with Myanmar last year.
</P>
<P>
A local private company reached an MOU in May with the Energy
Authorities to build the Nang Mai Sai hydro-power station in Shan
state's Tachilek area bordering Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has set a planned target of 6.4 percent growth for its
GDP in the next fiscal year (1997-98), during which the power
sector is projected to grow by 11.2 per cent with output of 4.475
billion kilowatt-hours.

FUZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Quanzhou in Fujian province has
inspected several thousand ceramics factories in a move to check
pollution.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Quanzhou city government began efforts to curb
ceramics pollution, stopping new ceramic projects which would
cause severe pollution and introducing advanced technology for old
factories.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 chimneys in the four counties have been demolished,
and dust and smoke pollution has been put under control.
</P>
<P>
The environment protection department in Quanzhou has enhanced
efforts in this regard, penalizing ceramic factories that do not
follow regulations.
</P>
<P>
Many ceramic factories in the counties of Cizhao, Leikeng,
Guanqiao, and Shuitou along the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway had been

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Gem Industry Loses Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's gem industry has lost
billions of rupees of potential earnings from Geuda (a kind of
gem) during the past five years due to lack of expertise.
</P>
<P>
According to the Director General of the National Gem and
Jewelry Authority (NGJA) P.G.R. Dharmaratne, these earnings
represent 37 million carats of Geuda taken to Thailand for 43.1
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said this money could have been earned by Sri Lanka if Sri
Lankans had been trained in Geuda Treatment Technology and
popularized it widely.
</P>
<P>
Thai buyers have purchased 8.6 million US dollars worth of
Geudas from Sri Lanka in 1996 and increased their value by 100
percent by using heat treatment technology.
</P>
<P>
20,000 persons employed in Thailand were mainly dependent on
the Sri Lankan Geuda, according to the Director.
</P>
<P>
He said if the gem industry is significantly developed in Sri
Lanka it would generate a significant amount of foreign exchange
for the country while Sri Lanka's unemployment problem can be
reduced to a great extent by improving the gem industry.

ZHENGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investors have been
playing an important role in the social and economic growth of
Zhengzhou, the capital of central China's Henan Province, with 400
million US dollars in investment already spent.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou is a land-locked city with sustained economic growth
in recent years thanks to Hong Kong investment, which is nearly
half the city's total, focusing on electronics, food, light
industries, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businessmen have had 1,036 projects in the city in
the past few years, and most joint ventures funded by Hong Kong
businessmen are showing profits, with residential construction
having been brisk in recent years.
</P>
<P>
An electronics joint venture, "Huawei", exported 16 million US
dollars worth of products last year, raking first among local
foreign-funded enterprises. And Hongrun Textile Co., Ltd, jointly
built by a local state-owned textile enterprise and Hong Kong
investors, exported about 90 percent of its products last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investors provided about half of the investment in
real estate development in Zhengzhou, and are very active in local
service industries, a Chinese official says

ROME, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Every effort must be made to "restart
the dialogue" between Israel and Palestinians in the stalled
Middle East peace process, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Problems are easily hidden when the dialogue is interrupted,
and the principal concern now is to restart the dialogue even if
nobody knows the magic formula," Dini said at a meeting with
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who will continue his European trip to France and
Britain, praised the role Italy and the European Union have played
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's visit to Europe was considered important because it
came at the difficult time of continuous disorder in the Middle
East, especially in Hebron after the Israeli government decided to
build new housing in eastern Jerusalem for Jews.
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged the contribution of the United States
despite concerns about the recent decision by the U.S. congress to
recognize Jerusalem as Israel's "indivisible capital," sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Italy agreed that the stalled peace process
represents "a great risk for the region and for the people, and
demonstrates the need for initiatives, even from Europe to resume
the contacts between the two sides."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Has Bright Future, Says Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will have a bright future
after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, Hong Kong's Permanent Representative to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Harbinson, in an interview with Xinhua, said:"Although
Hong Kong's return to China is only 12 days away, it is an event
for which there has been plenty of time for preparation because
the future of Hong Kong is very clearly set out in the blue book
(the Sino-British joint declaration signed in 1984).
</P>
<P>
"I do have great confidence in the future of Hong Kong. I
believe, owing to the strong quality of people in Hong Kong and
the sound legal framework for our future in terms of the basic
law, passed by China's National People's Congress after extensive
consultations with people in Hong Kong, that Hong Kong will have a
very bright future," Harbinson stressed.
</P>
<P>
Harbinson criticized the Western media for its biased reporting
of Hong Kong's return to China. "Unfortunately, the Western media
tends to concentrate too much on some of the negative aspects,"
said 49-year-old Harbinson, who is of British origin, but has
lived in Hong Kong since 1978.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone travels to Hong Kong today from the west, I think
that they just need to be there for about 10 minutes to realize
that life is normal in Hong Kong, and that people are behaving
normally, and that the great majority of them are confident of the
future."
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is very clear that for practical purposes on the
side of economy, the transfer has already taken place. Businessmen
are very confident about the future of Hong Kong and the economy
is doing extremely well.
</P>
<P>
"So I think everything is looking favorable for the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact the return of Hong Kong to its motherland is in some
ways, from a commercial point of view, an improvement for the
future and provides new challenges and opportunities for our
businessmen."
</P>
<P>
In early June, Hong Kong notified members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) that it would change its name to "Hong Kong,
China" from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Harbinson, Hong Kong's permanent representative to WTO since
September, 1994, said Hong Kong would continue to be a separate
customs territory, as set out in the 1984 Sino-British joint
declaration and the basic law passed by China's National People's
Congress after extensive consultations with people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Explaining Hong Kong's future role in world trade, Harbinson
said: "We can continue to participate in relevant international
organizations such as WTO, using the name 'Hong Kong,
China'. We'll continue to do that and we'll continue to reflect
Hong Kong's own trade policies which are based on the promotion of
free trade and the strengthening of the multi-lateral trading
system."
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's accession to WTO, Harbinson said: "This
is very clearly in our own interest, and also in the interest of
the world trading system. It is in our interest because China is
our biggest trading partner. And therefore it is very important
that China should be part of the multi-lateral trading system."
</P>
<P>
Harbinson continued: "It is important for WTO itself because
the WTO cannot truly be a world organization or a global
organization unless it includes enormous countries like China. We
do hope very much that China will be able to join WTO as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Harbinson hoped that the relationship between China and other
trade partners like the United States would be improved and
regulated by international rules. He believed that a trade dispute
between China and the U.S. would make Hong Kong suffer, and a more
stable relationship would be to the benefit of Hong Kong.

BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today adopted a
communication to its member states, aiming to end public support
for short-term export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
The EC said in a press release that the primary purpose of the
communication was to remove distortions of competition due to
state aid to the export credit insurance. In the business there is
competition between public or publicly supported export credit
insurers and private export credit insurers.
</P>
<P>
The communication requests EU members to end, within one year
from its publication, the granting of state aid to public or
publicly supported export credit insurers in respect of export
credit insurance for which there is a commercial market.
</P>
<P>
However, in certain countries insurance cover for such export
credit risks may be temporarily unavailable on the commercial
market, the EU noted.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, these risks might, following
notification to the EC, be taken by public or publicly supported
export credit insurers operating for the account of or with the
guarantee of the state, the EC said.
</P>
<P>
Also existing complementary state reinsurance arrangements
remain permissible for an interim period, according to the press
release.

and its economic development ever since it was founded on May 27,
1985.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 13 years of land disposal, a total of 2,972
hectares of new plots were granted with the approval by the
Sino-British Land Commission, averaging 248 hectares annually. The
figure far exceeded the limits of 50 hectares as specified in
Annex Three of the Sino-British Joint Declaration for each year.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the actual needs from economic and social
development in Hong Kong, The Chinese side has granted rationally
and appropriately the amount of land supply each year in an effort

The Land Fund operates under the prerequisite of preserving the
principal sum and not affecting the monetary stability in Hong
Kong. It has made diversified investments on 14 leading financial
markets in the world with low risks but high returns.

acute market competitions over the past 11 years, the Land Fund
has been very successful. The net value of its total assets was

July 1, the date when the Hong Kong SAR is founded, the trustees
of the Land Funds will turn over 170 billion HK dollars to the
Hong Kong SAR Government. And then the Land Fund will be managed
by the HKSAR Government.

operation is a vivid expression of the efforts of the Chinese
Government to protect the well-being of the six million Hong Kong
residents in the transitional period. It also give an eloquent
proof to the correctness for the decision of establishing the Land
Fund. And it is a good deed the central government has done for
the Hong Kong compatriots, and has won high praise from all social
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Expert Urges Stiffer Sentences for AIDS Offences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- AIDS sufferers who intentionally
infect others with the virus should be jailed for the maximum
limit of 25 years, a Costa Rican official said today.
</P>
<P>
The President of College of Physicians Marco Antonio Batalla
was giving evidence before a congressional committee working on a
new bill on the prevention, treatment and study of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said that provisions in the bill regarding punishment for
intentionally infecting people with the AIDS virus were too
lenient and should be increased to the country's maximum permitted
jail sentence of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes that those who donate blood, semen, breast
milk, tissues or organs when they know they are infected should be
punished with a three to eight-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
HIV carriers who maintain sexual relations with others without
telling them they are infected should face a similar sentence, the
bill proposes.
</P>
<P>
Batalla also recommended that funds set aside for AIDS should be
used on prevention and not treatment of sufferers, as the
medication is expensive and doesn't cure the disease.

<HEADLINE> Former British Ambassador Confident of Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Former British Ambassador to China
Sir Robin McLaren said today he was confident that Hong Kong would
remain stable and prosperous after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over the region on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in the people who were selected and
appointed to run Hong Kong and I know most of these people very
well," McLaren told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the transfer of power was very carefully prepared and
he had no doubt Hong Kong "will continue to be successful in the
coming years."
</P>
<P>
McLaren, 63, has been involved in Hong Kong affairs and in
Britain's relations with China for more than 35 years. He was
Political Adviser to the Hong Kong government from 1981 to 1985
and Senior Representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
from 1987 to 1989. Two years later, he was promoted as British
ambassador to China until 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes Hong Kong will have a bright future
"because all the elements that have enabled it to enjoy such
spectacular success in the past are there and guaranteed in the
Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
"It is in everyone's interest that Hong Kong should succeed in the
future and in no one's interest it should not. It is in China's
interest, in the international community's interest and above all it
is in the interests of the people of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said both Britain and China are handling the handover
well. "Confidence is high, the economy is in good shape, the
financial reserves are very strong indeed," so everything points
to a bright future in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The veteran diplomat said that although there were disputes
between Britain and China on Hong Kong affairs in the past, he
believes there should be no such problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, because of British responsibilities toward Hong Kong
and because of different approaches to Hong Kong, there have been
some disputes and I think that is natural and perhaps
unavoidable."
</P>
<P>
But provided the Joint Declaration and Basic Law remain the
guiding text for Hong Kong and are honored by everybody concerned,
then there won't be problems on that issue. "I am sure the
relationship between Britain and China will flourish as never
before," he said confidently.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Britain and China will cooperate well in Hong
Kong affairs in the future since the two countries share the same
interest -- to maintain a continued success in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British relations after the handover on July 1,
McLaren said the British government "wants to pursue positive
and constructive relations" with China.
</P>
<P>
"The new Labor government, like the Conservative government,
will seek to support business in Hong Kong as well as in
China... We want to see contacts increasing in every area and we
want to see mutually beneficial trade increase. We also want Hong
Hong to play a positive part in that process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after June 30, Hong Kong's role in bilateral
relations will change. In the past, Hong Kong has been a major
element in Sino-British relations and no other Western government
has had this kind of factor in its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"At midnight on the 30th of June, Britain will cease to be
responsible for Hong Kong, no longer have those
responsibilities. Of course we will continue to preserve an
interest under the Joint Declaration," the former ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Hong Kong had played a very important role
in the modernization of China. He believed that role has not
finished yet and it will continue to play a huge and important
role after the handover.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Adopts New Technology for Coffee Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 coffee
plants in Colombia have adopted a new processing technology which
would reduce water consumption and pollution, Colombia's National
Coffee Research Center (Cenicafe) said today.
</P>
<P>
With this new method, known as Ecological Coffee Processing,
the water consumption in processing one kilogram of coffee was
reduced from 40 to 0.67 liters, Cenicafe Director Gabriel Cadena
said.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was achieved by recycling water, and the new
method also helped improve the quality of coffee, Cadena said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers has promised
to provide subsidies of up to 50 percent of the investment needed
for processors to acquire the new technology.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Australian Diplomat on Hong Kong's Future by Shi Xiaofan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's diplomatic envoy in
Hong Kong said today that Hong Kong's return to China is an event
of great significance which the Asia-Pacific region and the whole
world are looking at with great interest and great hopes that it
will be successful.
</P>
<P>
"The 'one country, two systems' formula, the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law provide for a special system of
administration designed to ensure Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree
of autonomy and to retain the essential features of its existing
economic and social systems so that its stability and prosperity
will continue after the handover," observed Geoffrey Walsh, Consul
General of Australia in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the 44-year-old career
diplomat said that Australian government is among the first group
of foreign countries promising free-visa access to the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region passport-holders, illustrating the
Australian government's support to and confidence in Hong Kong's
future.
</P>
<P>
As two important economic powerhouses in the Asia-Pacific
region, Australia and Hong Kong traditionally share important and
strong economic and trade relations. In 1996, Hong Kong was
Australia's fourth largest source and the sixth largest
destination of foreign investment, and the twelfth largest export
market. Meanwhile Australia was Hong Kong's eleventh largest
export market and the thirteenth largest source of imports.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 350 major Australian companies
operating in Hong Kong, plus smaller presence of other 1,000
Australian companies.
</P>
<P>
In a survey done last year, Australian business people in Hong
Kong overwhelmingly expressed the view that Hong Kong will
continue to be a good place to do business with and from.
</P>
<P>
"This shows the sentiment of the Australian business community
here is basically optimistic", noted Walsh, who has been working
in Hong Kong for two years.
</P>
<P>
"All the economic fundamentals of Hong Kong have been pointing
to the good outlook of Hong Kong," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Education and immigration are also two important fields for
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the second largest overseas destination only after
the United States for Hong Kong students seeking studies, with new
enrollment of about 4,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 100,000 Hong Kongers settling down
in Australia, composing an important force of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the consul general, while education exchanges have
remained strong, the applications for immigrating to Australia has
been declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the movement of people will remain as smooth as
before and this will be conducive to the economic and trade
exchanges," Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who has been to China at regular intervals with
high-ranking Australian government delegations since 1984, said he
has been deeply impressed by the "dramatic changes taking place in
China".
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Australian relationship has been strengthened by our
Prime Minister John Howard's recent visit to China and by Chinese
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to our country," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as an international business center, has always been
a link between Australia and the broad interior areas of China.
The handover will surely enhance the already strong
Sino-Australian bilateral relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting and challenging to work in Hong Kong at this
period of time. With the number of Australians visiting Hong Kong
on constant rise, the work of the Consulate has been very busy,"
Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> Beilun Port Now No. 3 In China In Cargo-Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo City's Beilun Port, in
Zhejiang Province, handled 76 million tons of goods, making it
third in China and one of the best in the country due to its
deep-water docks.
</P>
<P>
Beilun has 22 docks, which can accommodate 10,000-DWT vessels,
including one designed to handle 200,000-DWT mineral vessels and a
dock that can handle 250,000-DWT oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
The port has been designed for cooperation with neighboring big
harbors, mainly Shanghai. And, iron ore imports from Brazil,
Australia, and South Africa have been shipped to Beilun by
international carriers and then trans-shipped to industrial cities
along the Yangtze River, lowering transport cost.
</P>
<P>
To do all this, the port authorities have spent on
technological renovations to keep up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The port can now handle the latest model containers, with an
annual capacity of 800,000 TEU. By the end of the century, the
capacity is expected to top 100 million TEU.

today to discuss the Afghan situation and ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers believed it is of great importance

parties in Afghanistan should cease fire immediately and start
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks should be held with the mediation of the United
Nations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Sugar Cane Output to Drop in Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugar cane yield for
the current season totaled 56 million tons, according to a Thai
Industry Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
However, the source warned that the cane production is likely
to fall by about 10 percent to 52 million tons for the 1997-98
season on last year's level of 57 million tons, for lack of
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
A Thai industry analyst predicted that world sugar prices would
briefly decline when supplies from Australia and Thailand, the
second and third sugar producers, came on the market in July and
December.
</P>
<P>
World sugar production this year is estimated to total 123.4
million tons, up by 2 percent on last year's, while consumption is
put at 122 million tons.
</P>
<P>
World sugar prices are currently promising and some analysts
believe that they could stay so next year.

<HEADLINE> River Transport In Southwest China Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Before 1949, there was only one
large motorized ship in land-locked, mountainous Yunnan Province
in the southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Now, the province has 1,324 km of navigable channels, 50 ports,
more than 760 transport vessels, over 1,100 ferry-boats, and
nearly 10,000 people to man them. In 1996, its water-transport
sector handled 1.58 million tons of goods and 1.58 million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The great changes have mostly taken place since the '80s, when
the country launched its ambitious reform and opening drive. Since
then, Yunnan has used financial assistance from the central
government and local resources to develop river shipping by
clearing waterways, building or renovating ports, and
manufacturing or purchasing vessels. A provincial shipping
administration was also established.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, local shipping companies began to cooperate with
neighboring countries in exploring the possibility of using the
Lancang-Mekong River for international shipping. After this proved
feasible, it resulted in the operation of 50 Yunnan-based vessels
that cover a 430-km stretch of the Lancang-Mekong in China, Laos,
Myanmar and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Yunnan and Myanmar are drawing up plans for water
transport along the Irrawaddy River and making it a major part of
a water-land transport line between Kunming, the capital of
Yunnan, and Yangon, the capital of Myanmar.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine could change its stand as a
non-aligned nation and may join a military organization or a
military political union, a senior government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, Secretary of the Ukrainian State Committee
on Security and Defense, told reporters "the door remains open for
Ukraine to join a military organization or a military political
union, which conforms to Ukraine's constitution."
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine's friendship treaty with Russia, signed on May
31, would not block the way for the country to join such a body.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin signed a friendship treaty to shape long-term
economic and political cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the eastward expansion plans of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to take in countries of
the former Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ukraine has highlighted its status as a
non-aligned country and said it would not join the western
military alliance, but only establish a special partnership with
it.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said Ukraine had held talks with the United States and
NATO after signing an accord with Russia on the division of the
former Soviet Union Black Sea Fleet at the end of May. They agreed
that the accord had not added any extraordinary responsibilities
or obligations on Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine maintains its right to act freely," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Ukraine and Russia are still negotiating on
some small differences over the division of the Fleet, an issue
concerning the establishment of special partnership relations with
the NATO.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Ushers In New Tide of Kong Kong Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone is experiencing a new tide of Hong Kong investment, with big
financial groups from Hong Kong as the main players.
</P>
<P>
This indicates the full confidence of Hong Kong businesses in
the bright prospects for the economic cooperation between Hong
Kong and Shenzhen after the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the city utilized 1.14
billion US dollars of overseas investment, a 57.6 percent
year-on-year rise. Of that sum, about 70 percent came from Hong
Kong, a local government official said.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Hong Kong financial groups are focusing on the
city's infrastructure, real estate and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Several Hong Kong financial groups have decided to spend six
billion yuan (about 720 million US dollars) building residential
buildings in the new city area of Shenzhen. They believe that,
being a city next to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has great potential in
its real estate development.
</P>
<P>
The designed sea-bridge linking Shenzhen's Shekou development
zone with Hong Kong's Yuen Long is also attractive to Hong Kong
businessmen. Board chairmen of two financial groups have recently
visited Shenzhen, showing their interest in the project.
</P>
<P>
In Dapeng Bay, Li Ka Shing's corporation is engaged in the
second-phase construction of the Yantian Port, which is designed
to become the most important international transit port in
southern China.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a feasibility study has been made for the
building of a science and technology park by Shenzhen and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has also begun to train software developers for Hong
Kong factories and companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Hong Kong investment in Shenzhen totaled
7.63 billion dollars from 1979 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tang Ying-yen, Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries, said in Shenzhen recently that Shenzhen has become a
necessary production base and support center for Hong Kong's
industry.

<P>
At a press conference, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Emilio

aims to offer his support for those Nicaraguans who are living in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who will accompany Aleman to the United

confrontation between the United States and the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Nicaraguan president will also give
information about his government's policy on the property
confiscated in his country from U.S. citizens.

Before going to Washington, Aleman will attend a U.N. General
Assembly meeting in New York to make a speech on the environmental
problem next Monday.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Nicaraguan president will meet his Argentine
counterpart Carlos Menem and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
"who is very interested in knowing about the democratic process in
Nicaragua and its economic development program."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Expert: World's Environment Worsened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Five year after the 1992 earth
summit in Rio de Janeiro, conditions of the environment across the
globe have deteriorated, an Indonesian expert said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Emil Salim, a former population and environment minister
and currently chairman of a private organization dedicated to
bio-diversity, said here Wednesday that in the years since the Rio
de Janeiro summit, the world progressed in economic but not in
environmental terms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a discussion to welcome a special United Nations
session in New York next June 23-27 to review implementation of
the earth summit's agenda-21, Salim said the volume of green house
emissions which cause global warming was increasing and so were
the global rates of gas, solid and liquid wastes.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the discussion today quoted Salim as saying that
rivers and seas were increasingly becoming polluted, stocks of
fish were declining and bio-diversity was undergoing heavy
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Of late, global warming and the impacts of climate changes were
increasingly felt as reflected in seasonal changes in the
agricultural production patterns and production failures.
</P>
<P>
Salim also mentioned the relationship between environmental
degradation on a global scale and the emergence of new diseases
such as AIDS and other infectious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
He said new environment-friendly methods to exploit natural
resources must be devised.
</P>
<P>
Salim hoped the special U.N. meeting to evaluate the results of
the earth summit, would help renew and strengthen the commitments
made by the world's countries five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wetlands Home To Pere David's Deer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- David's deer have been multiplying
in a nature reserve on the middle reaches of China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
This year, 30 head of deer have been born in a wetland area at
Shishou City in the Yangtze River Valley in Central China's Hubei
Province, bringing the total number of such deer to 138 in the
nature reserve established three years ago.
</P>
<P>
David's deer has the antlers of a deer, the head of a horse,
and the body of a cow. It was native to China until the early
years of the 20th century, when western imperialists invaded China
and took the remaining deer away from an imperial park.
</P>
<P>
David's deer came back to China when the Marquess of Tavistock
of England sent 20 of the rare animals to Beijing in 1985, thanks
to cooperation between the Chinese and British governments.
</P>
<P>
Pere David was a French Catholic priest and a naturalist who
first made a record of the unique deer in China in 1865.
</P>
<P>
The deer is now being raised in Beijing, and in Jiangsu and
Hainan provinces as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 19 (Xinhua) -- "During the past dozen years of
Hong Kong's transitional period, no member of the Indian business
community in Hong Kong has left because we're firm believers of
'one country, two systems'," said Raj Sital, chairman of the
Indian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sital, who is 36 and in the second
consecutive term as the chairman, claimed that he and his fellow
businessmen have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong after
its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and there are a lot of
people like me in our community. For us, Hong Kong is our home,"
said Sital, who speaks fluent Cantonese and a little Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
With a history of over 150 years, the Indian community in Hong
Kong now has more than 25,000 people. Indian business people run
nearly 1,000 companies in Hong Kong, which are mostly engaged in
import and export trade.
</P>
<P>
"Each year we handle some 8 percent of Hong Kong's total
foreign trade volume," said Sital proudly.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Indian Chamber of Commerce, which was founded in
1952 and now has approximately 500 members, is one of the oldest
foreign chambers of commerce here.
</P>
<P>
Sital noted that the majority of the business for Indian
merchants in Hong Kong has involved the re-export of goods
produced in the interior area of China.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to Hong Kong's return to China, for we
believe that our business with the Chinese interior area will
become more smooth and can be done better after that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trade between Hong Kong and India has been
growing steadily over the past decade. In 1996, the volume of
trade between India and Hong Kong surpassed 21.1 billion Hong Kong
dollars (about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars), and India became the
15th largest supplier and 28th largest market for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sital said, the total volume of trade between India
and China last year reached 1.406 billion U.S. dollars, up 20.9
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
"India has become China's largest trade partner in South Asia
for two years in succession," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that there is still a lot of room for
development in the Sino-Indian trade, for both China and India are
"very large countries with a lot to offer".
</P>
<P>
"A lot of goods produced in China and India are complementary
to each other, such as light industrial products of China and
pharmaceuticals and raw materials of India," he added.
</P>
<P>
Being the gateway to China, he said, Hong Kong will play a very
important role in promoting the trade relationship between India
and China.
</P>
<P>
"Many members of our chamber have set up businesses in China,
and I believe that this trend will continue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Court Lifts Foschi Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- American swimmer Jessica Foschi
had her two-year suspension for steroid use cut by the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Wednesday, clearing the way for her
immediate return to international competitions.
</P>
<P>
FINA, international swimming's governing body, who had banned
Foschi after she tested positive for the metabolic steroid
nesteroton at the 1995 U.S. national championships and who later
turned down an appeal, were ordered to pay the American teenager
15,000 Swiss francs to cover her court costs.
</P>
<P>
The CAS reduced the suspension from two years to six months,
from August 4 1995 to February 3 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ends a rollercoaster saga of bans and appeals that
stretches back to August 4 1995 when the then 15-year-old American
first tested positive.
</P>
<P>
Foschi was originally placed on two years' probation last June
by the U.S. Swimming National Board of Review but a subsequent
appeal to the American Arbitration Association reversed all
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Under growing pressure to clean up the sport, FINA took up the
case and conducted their own investigation suspending the swimmer
for two years on August 3 1996.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Prepares Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has conducted more than a week of rescue drills to get ready for
the flood season, which is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
This is just one part of the coastal province's annual measures
against floods. Last year, the province and much of the rest of
South China suffered losses measured at 220 billion yuan due to
floods caused by typhoon.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up flood-control headquarters in various
government offices, and has the local army ready to add thousands
of troups to join in the flood control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is hit by rainstorms, windstorms and typhoons every
year. It plans to have all dykes, dams and reservoirs repaired
before the flood season sets in in July.
</P>
<P>
The province's measures are being met with enthusiastic support
by local people. Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and other cities are
building sea dykes according to high standards. Wenzhou, which was
badly hit by typhoons in recent years, has built a 19-km long dyke
that could withstand the worst floods in 50 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An 82-cm-long Chinese sturgeon has
been found in north China's Bohai Bay, according to "China
Environmental News".
</P>
<P>
The rare fish, weighing about three kg., was caught earlier
this month by Zhu Shaobo, a fisherman, who set it free three days
later.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Chinese sturgeon found in Bohai Bay. The
first one, weighing 200 kilograms, was found there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon, known as a "living fossil", is thought to
have been in existence in the Yangtze River for more than 140
million years. The fish has top state protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Why the fish has found itself in Bohai Bay remains a mystery,
according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Schuster Moves into Coaching with Cologne Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Former German international Bernd
Schuster began a career as a coach on Wednesday when he took
charge of second division side Fortuna Cologne.
</P>
<P>
The former Barcelona midfielder, who has been involved in
controversy at almost all his previous clubs, left Mexican side
UNAM in April and has been back in Germany studying for a coaching
qualification.
</P>
<P>
Schuster, who won 21 caps for West Germany before quitting the
national side over a dispute with his team-mates, said Fortuna had
approached him at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Schuster, nicknamed the "blond angel" by the German press,

<HEADLINE> South China Province Intensifies Protection of Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong province
has succeeded in checking the reduction of farmland, thanks to its
package of effective measures.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land used for non-agricultural purposes was
14,000 hectares in 1996, a quarter less than in the previous
year. The amount of farmland used for such purposes was 6,100
hectares, more than 20 percent less than in the previous year. At
the same time, the province reclaimed an additional 12,000
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The real estate development and development zone fever at the
beginning of the 1990s caused a big reduction of farmland in the
province and many people abandoned their land to take up
businesses, causing a large amount of farmland to lie idle.
</P>
<P>
To arrest the trend, the provincial government issued 13 sets
of regulations and over 20 administrative decrees on land
administration and protection. In 1994, the province designated 2
million hectares of basic farmland for priority protection that
are not allowed to be used for purposes other than farming. In
addition, the province has appropriated a large sum of money for
restoring the farmland that has been lying idle. Last year, the
province decided not to supply land for building high grade
buildings and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these measures, grain production of the province has
increased for three consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Australian, South African Nickel Giants Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A 1.72 billion US dollar nickel
mining and refining giant was created in Australia Wednesday with
the announcement of a merger of South African minerals
conglomerate Gencor's nickel assets with Australia's dominant
refiner, Queensland Nickel.
</P>
<P>
The merged group will account for more than seven percent of
the international production and will be one of the four biggest
nickel producers in the world, the Australian Financial Review
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The group will also account for about eight percent of the
world cobalt production.
</P>
<P>
The merger coincides with some good news for nickel price, with
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
predicting this week that world nickel consumption may exceed
production for the first time in several years.
</P>
<P>
If the deal is approved by shareholders and regulators, control
of Queensland Nickel (QNI) will effectively pass to Gencor, which
will end up with 55 percent of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
The merged group will remain headquartered in Australia under
the banner of QNI, a refiner producing nickel metal from ore
imported from New Caledonia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, which is expected to be completed by
mid-August, the group will have refining and production assets
spanning South America, Australia and Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Admits Germany Might Overshoot Euro Debt Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
admitted today that Germany may slightly overshoot the debt
requirement for joining the planned single European currency --
the Euro, but stressed that other criteria would be strictly
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel
told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left
over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national
debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states
to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP,
Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be
softened.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999
launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU
countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost
certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would
threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is due to be introduced from January 1, 1999.
Countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on
full economic data of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But there remains widespread doubts about the future of the
Euro because both Germany and France, the two country at the heart
of the project, are struggling to meet the qualification criteria,
mainly due to their sluggish economic growth and the cost for
financing benefits for record high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
France has openly asked for a softening in the interpretation
of the qualification terms of the Euro but Germany has so far
insisted on strict adherence.

Hattestad with outstanding javelin performances on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Backley stunned the competiton at the Helsinki international

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researcher Views Hong Kong's Credit as Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China has powerful economic
incentives to respect the autonomy underpinning Hong Kong's credit
stability, the Standard &AMP; Poor's, a famous rating company of the
U.S., said here in a series of reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports evaluated the impact Hong Kong's transfer of power
will have on sovereign, financial institution, structured finance,
and real estate credit quality.
</P>
<P>
One of the reports said that the transfer of sovereignty is
accompanied by a good deal of optimism about Hong Kong's continued
economic success. This confidence is reflected in firm property
values, a leap in share prices on the stock exchange, and a surge
in "sell-out" new listings by mainland-related companies.
</P>
<P>
In May, Standard &AMP; Poor's raised its rating on Hong Kong one
notch to single 'A'-plus.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong'continued prosperity is also a key to the success of
China's "one country, two systems" policy, said the Standard &AMP;
Poor's director Lacey Gallagher. "Hong Kong is the model for the
system that China hopes to eventually put in place in Taiwan,
whose recovery is one of China's important, long-term policy
goals," she added.
</P>
<P>
She also said that Hong Kong has had a very stable and
conservative set of financial policies for decades, which might
help stablize the region's financial system.
</P>
<P>
One of its reports said that demand for property, particularly
residential property, in Hong Kong will continue to be very strong
relative to supply after the transfer of sovereignty. The local
property prices will be kept high relative to global standards.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong banks are sensitive to the property sector's
performance due to their loan portfolios' exposure to real estate.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the health of the property sector
has an enormous impact on Hong Kong's economy particularly the
corporate, bank and government sectors.

CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian news papers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The government threatened yesterday to dump the
Constitutional Convention or scrap voters' rights to elect its
members after the Senate rejected the Coalition's plans for
deciding on a republic.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government's plans for a Constitutional
Convention on the republic were thrown into disarray yesterday
when the Senate insisted on a full compulsory ballot to elect half
of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Industrial strife in Victoria's public hospitals worsened
yesterday with a campaign by non-medical staff spreading to 35
hospitals. More than 400 beds stayed closed as the nurses' dispute
dragged on.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Japan is turning its back on Australia as a place to invest
while its investments across the rest of the world are booming.
New figures show that Japanese foreign direct investment in
Australia slumped to 750 million US dollars in the 12 months to
March 1997, its lowest level in a decade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar recouped from a
drop caused by a surging Japanese trade surplus to end higher
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to an intraday low of 112.90 yen in early
dealings before recovering to settle in New York at 113.65 yen, up
from 113.31 Tuesday. The dollar settled at 1.7333 marks, up from
1.7308. The pound remained unchanged at 1.6388 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's finance ministry reported overnight that the Japanese
trade surplus in May totaled 738.27 billion yen, tripling the
level of a year earlier. The surplus with the United States nearly
doubled to 322.87 billion yen, the eighth consecutive monthly
increase.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials' reaction to the data was viewed in the
foreign-exchange market as tame, which helped the dollar
strengthen.
</P>
<P>
Against European currencies, the dollar's strength reflected
further indications that the European Union will have to loosen
the strict criteria on deficit reduction designed to keep the euro
strong when it debuts in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.4478 Swiss francs, up from 1.4447; 5.8490 French francs, up from
5.8365; 1,696.25 Italian lire, up from 1,693.75; 1.3923 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3864.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank: Upturn in German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy now is out of
stagnation and on the upswing, said the Bundesbank in a monthly
report released today, noting a seasonally-adjusted 2.75 percent
growth in the first quarter over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The economic upturn occurred despite continued depressed
domestic market and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In its report for June, the central bank also pointed out that
German industry had resumed its competitiveness on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bundesbank, strong exports remained the most
important factor to boost economy. Foreign orders rose by 12
percent in the first four months this year compared to a year
earlier, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the strong exports on rationalization
measures, a favorable agreed wage increase of around 1.5 percent
and the lower German Mark rate, which so "largely corresponds to
economic fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
Mark's value against the world's other 18 key currencies now is
lower than at the start of 1995, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank also urged in the report quick political
decisions on reforms in order to improve the framework conditions
for corporate investments.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks led a second
day of declines on Wall Street today as investors backed off the
record-breaking gains of the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline, following a drop in Tuesday's Dow,
marked the predictable end of a record-breaking streak that raised
the blue chip index more than 300 points in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 42.07 points to
7,718.71.
</P>
<P>
Decliners narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume totaled 491.68 million shares as against
542.97 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list fell 5.72 to close at 888.71,
snapping an eight-session streak of record highs. The NYSE
composite index was down 1.68 to 463.41. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 10.60 to 1,432.51, ending three consecutive sessions of
record-breaking closes.
</P>
<P>
But the American Stock Exchange composite index edged up 0.11
to 625.97.
</P>
<P>
The share price of computer hard disk-drive maker Seagate
Technology led the decline, which carried over to tech stocks like
chip maker Intel and software giant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market is already convinced that the Federal
Reserve will not raise interest rates when it meets July 1-2.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today called for an immediate end to Israel-Palestinian
clashes in Hebron, said a statement by the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Palestinians have been shot and wounded by Israeli
troops in the West Bank town of Hebron during the past four days
of violent protests.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is following with concern recent
developments in Hebron and calls for an immediate end to the
violence and appeals for maximum restraints," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic events of the past few days underline the urgent
needs for confidence to be restored, for all sides to restrain
from provocative acts and for conditions to be created in which
the Peace Process can be resumed," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Israel-Palestinian peace talks have been deadlocked since the
Israeli Government decided in March to go ahead with a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians say the settlement breaks international law
and preempts the talks on the final status of Jerusalem and the
Palestinian territories. Israel refuses to stop building
settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The 9th Plenary Session of the
Black Sea Economic Cooperation's Parliamentary Assembly (PABSEC)
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his opening speech, Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos stressed that the Black Sea had always been "a
vital crossroads between Asia and Europe" and "a meeting place" of
different cultures, religions and nationalities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the promotion of economic cooperation in the
greater area of the black sea was an element for the progress of
the countries in the region and for peace and security in a region
which had from time to time suffered from great tension.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the inauguration of the Black Sea
Economic Cooperation (BSEC) bank in the northern Greek port city
of Thessaloniki would usher in a new important period of
cooperation among the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece would continue its efforts with undiminished interest
because this cooperation indeed contributed considerably to the
construction of the new Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary assembly today unanimously approved
Bulgaria's accession to the forum.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members from all ten member-states, Greece,
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Russia,
Turkey and Ukraine, are participating in the two-day meeting which
focuses on a number of economic, political and social issues.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Bulgarian parliament has also been invited
to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also attending as observers are representatives of Egypt,
Israel and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
PABSEC, created in 1993, is the parliamentary wing of the Black
Sea Economic Cooperation organization, which aims to facilitate
cooperation among Black Sea countries and turn the region into a
zone of stability, prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece is holding the rotating presidency of PABSEC.
