<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Manufacturing Sector to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- zimbabwe's key manufacturing
sector is slowly coming out of the doldrums after having been
depressed for most of 1994 and 1995 due to the effects of
drought-induced recession.
</P>
<P>
Chief Economist of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
(CZI) Farai Zizhou today said latest results of a business
opinion survey carried out by CZI showed that manufacturing has
so far registered a modest recovery in output although some
sub-sectors are still suffering.
</P>
<P>
''We have seen some recovery but not to the extent that we had
expected. On one hand, we might say manufacturing is recovering,
but on the other hand, things are not as bright as they should
be,'' Zizhou said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which contributes about 25 percent
to annual GDP growth, is this year expected to grow by between
four and 4.5 percent, compared with about three percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zizhou said companies producing mainly for the export market
seem to be doing well, while those in the transport, timber and
clothing sector are also benefiting from an upturn in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
He said the major worry among industrialists is the lack of
decision-making in the government as characterized by the delayed
publication of new tariffs, and conclusion to talks to renew a
new trade agreement with South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Contribute 5,000 Troops to New Bosnia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) announced here this afternoon that Britain was to contribute
a 5,000-strong force next year to a new NATO-led peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo said that that the
British force, which would be equipped with tanks, artillery and
armored fighting vehicles, would be part of a 31,000-strong
"follow-on" peace force.
</P>
<P>
This new peacekeeping mission is designed to replace the
current NATO-led Implementation Force, whose mandate would expire
at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
These British ground troops would be backed up in the air by
Harrier, Tornado and Jaguar combat planes, which would be ready to
move to Bosnia at short notice from their bases in Britain and
Germany, a MoD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of sending British troops to Bosnia was to make sure
that the former warring parties adhere to the military aspects of
the Dayton peace agreement, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has earlier pledged to send 8,500 troops to
Bosnia for another 18 months, with a further 4,500 troops to be
deployed to the region as possible reinforcements in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the British government is to host an
international conference in London on December 4-5 to discuss
reconstruction of the Bosnian economy, creation of Bosnian police
force and other urgent issues.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade in Ivory to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Trade in ivory products in
Zimbabwe will continue even during the forthcoming Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a senior
government official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the wildlife society, acting Director
of National Parks Willis Makombe said ivory carvers and traders
are bracing up for anticipated high demand during the CITES to be
held next June in Harare.
</P>
<P>
''Today Zimbabwe trades locally in ivory that is why we have
ivory articles in the shops and each time there is an
international conference business is brisk,'' said Makombe.
</P>
<P>
He said however, the government is going to put up signs in
the shops dealing in ivory to warn foreign buyers that it is
possible the ivory articles could be confiscated in their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
''we want the delegates to check with their countries first
before they buy the ivory articles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
ivory trade, especially in southern Africa is embroiled in
controversy as the international community insists that elephants
should remain listed on appendix i, banning utilization and
trade.
</P>
<P>
Southern African countries in Maseru, Lesotho, in August
unanimously agreed to press for the down-listing of the elephant
from appendix i to ii which would allow sustainable utilization.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in other African countries where the elephant
population is threatened with extinction due to poaching
activities and mismanagement of wildlife resources, a huge
population has accrued in most of southern African countries,
resulting in animal-human conflict.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Zimbabwe has a herd of at least 60,000 while its
carrying capacity is about 30,000 elephants.
</P>
<P>
There are fears the down-listing would trigger illegal trade
and poaching would resurface.

PYONGYANG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressman Bill
Richardson left here today after a three-day visit to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Richardson held negotiations with senior DPRK
officials including Kang Sok Ju, first vice-minister of foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions covered implementation of a future
DPRK-U.S. agreement, the release of American citizen Carl Hunziker
and pending problems in DPRK-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Hunziker was detained by the DPRK on August 24
on charges of illegal entry into the country and spying for South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The United States, South Korea and Hunziker's family all denied
the charges. They said he accidentally strayed into the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tokyo, Japan, said Hunziker arrived there today
with Richardson on a U.S. Air Force plane.

<HEADLINE> Report: White House May Ask to Soften Welfare Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (xinhua) -- The White House may ask
Congress to restore about 13 billion dollars in welfare spending
that was cut in a bill signed by President Bill Clinton last year
to reform the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-led Congress passed welfare legislation designed
to save about 54.6 billion dollars over six years. A preliminary
White House proposal, which has not been approved by Clinton,
would restore about one-fourth of that cut, The New York Times
quoted administration officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were drafting proposals to revise the law
as part of the balanced-budget plan the Clinton is to submit to
Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has indicated his general policy but has not decided on
details, officials said.
</P>
<P>
When he signed the bill Clinton promised to mend provisions
that he said were unfair or too harsh on the nation's poor,
particularly children. Republicans vowed to block any Clinton
efforts to roll back their bill.
</P>
<P>
One proposal under consideration by White House staff would
restore food stamp eligibility for many legal immigrants who have
not become citizens. The new law denies food stamps to most
noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
Another idea would increase the number of food stamps given to
families with high housing costs, a proposal that would mostly
effect families with children.
</P>
<P>
A third proposal would relax the tough work requirements for
able-bodied adults who have no dependents. The new law allows such
adults to receive food stamps for only three months in any
36-month period unless they are working or participating in a work
program. The Congressional Budget Office says 800,000 to one
million people could lose food stamps under this provision.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at 2 Percent Rate in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased
at a modest 2 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter,
slower than previously estimated, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase, lower than the original 2.2 percent estimate
released about a month ago, was far below the sizzling 4.7 percent
rate turned in during the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government attributed the downward revision to a
higher trade deficit than originally estimated and less production
going into business stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending, about two-thirds of
U.S. economic activity, rose by just 0.6 percent, the poorest
showing in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade deficit widened at an annual rate of 24.7 billion
dollars in the quarter, worse than the original estimate of 17.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Business inventories were being built up at a rate of 25.7
billion dollars, a smaller figure than previously estimated,
helping reduce the growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Among other key categories, business equipment investment, a
star performer in the current recovery, advanced at a 20.3 percent
rate in the third quarter, reflecting heavy demand for computers.
But residential spending fell at a 5.9 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP),
after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of 6.926 trillion
dollars in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report said that inflation index tied to the GDP showed
moderation as growth slowed, rising at a rate of just 1.9 percent.
That was down from a 2.2 percent rate of increase in the second
quarter and the best performance for this measure of inflation in
three years.
</P>
<P>
But in a report accompanying the GDP today, the U.S. government
said that after-tax profits of U.S. corporations were down by 2.6
percent in the third quarter, the weakest showing since a 5.8
percent drop in the first quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest report shows that the U.S. economy is slowing down
at a quick pace without the change of short-term interest rate.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Cut Diplomatic Ties With Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa had decided
to cut off diplomatic relations with Taiwan and establish full
diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, President
Nelson Mandela announced today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told a short press conference here that diplomatic
relations with Taiwan would be severed by the end of December in
1997, but other ties with the island would remain intact.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement issued by the foreign ministry,
Mandela explained that South Africa has become an active
participant within the ambit of the Organization of African Unity
and the Non-aligned Movement, as well as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"A permanent continuation of diplomatic recognition of the
Republic of China on Taiwan is inconsistent with South Africa's
role in international affairs," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had opportunity to meet with representatives
of China and Taiwan yesterday and expressed the hope that within
the next 12 months it would be possible to achieve a transition.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Plans to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority
(ZTA) is embarking on an aggressive marketing campaign in Europe
and Asia to promote the country as a premier tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Newly appointed Chief Executive Joseph Chigwedere said today
that the ZTA now has a clear mandate from the government to
ensure the country gets its share of world tourism, which is
growing in leaps and bounds every year.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed promotional campaign will be concentrated
in identified niche market areas, and will highlight Zimbabwe's
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The major market focus will be on Germany, whose nationals are
known worldwide for their passion for travel, the United States
and Australia, which the ZTA predicted will be the fastest
growing sources of tourists for Zimbabwe by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The marketing campaign will also be carried out in Britain,
still a major source of tourists for Zimbabwe, as well as the Far
East, with particular attention being paid to Hong Kong, Malaysia
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to develop the regional and domestic market.
South Africa, because of its proximity, is still a significant
market for us but we have to be selective and identify markets
which are high-yielding but low volume," said Chigwedere.
</P>
<P>
The ZTA will also provide assistance to indigenous Zimbabweans
wanting to enter the tourism industry, currently the fastest
growing in Zimbabwe, with annual earnings exceeding 100 million
U. S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than one million visitors came to Zimbabwe,
mostly from Germany, the USA, Britain, South Africa and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable Goods Orders Up 0.1 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods increased by 0.1 percent in October, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three years and more, totaled a seasonally
adjusted 174.2 billion dollars in October, up by 258 million from
September.
</P>
<P>
The increase was resulted in a surge in demand for electronic
equipment which helped to offset weakness in transportation
orders.
</P>
<P>
The report said that transportation orders in October fall by
7.9 percent. But this decline was offset by a 17.3 percent jump in
orders for electronic equipment, the biggest one-month advance on
record.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable goods,
were up 2.9 percent in October, the biggest increase since January
1995.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods decreased by 1.2 percent in October,
the first decline since last June.
</P>
<P>
The report said that total U.S. factory orders in the first 10
months of this year are 6 percent higher than during the same
period a year ago. And the shipments in the same period are up by
4.4 percent above the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In a good sign for future production, the backlog of unfilled
orders was up 1.1 percent in October to 486.6 billion dollars.
This followed a 0.7 percent rise in unfilled orders in September
and represented the fifth increase in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Male Infertility Rate High in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- About 17 percent of Greek
couples are unable to have children and it is estimated that
nation has more than 150,000 sterile men, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports were based on surveys conducted by the Greek
Andrology Society, which is organizing the Second Panhellenic
Andrology Congress at Salonika University from December 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said one of the main reasons for infertility among
couples was sexual impotence and low sperm count among males.
</P>
<P>
They blamed smoking, atmospheric pollution, bad nutrition and
radiation from electronic equipment (TV, computers, radio etc.) for
the problem, which has been increasing dramatically in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
"Some parameters that define the quality of sperm have been
decreasing, such as the amount of sperm and number of
spermatozoids," George Papadimas, chairman of the Andrology
Society was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Papadimas said that despite the increased infertility
rate in Greece, the majority of childless couples can use assisted
conception technicques such as micro-fertilization.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 900 babies have been conceived in Greece thanks to
this technique.

WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is expected to make a formal announcement accepting a Canadian
proposal for the establishment of a humanitarian relief
headquarters in Uganda to assist starving refugees in eastern
Zaire, an administration official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, set forth by Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd jxworthy, calls for air drops to the refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said that Canada could not do it alone and "need to
have the cooperation of other countries."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters while en
route to Italy on Wednesday that about 400 U.S. troops already
positioned in the region would be prepared to assist a
Canadian-led mission.
</P>
<P>
Perry said once the Canadians are able to determine that the
refugees in the region need supplies, and are able to obtain
permission from nations such as Uganda, Zaire, and even Rwanda,
"we could certainly be there as a full participant."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last night in an
interview on PBS's "Lehrer News Hour" that the United States would
not be prepared to take part in a multinational force "unless
there was a clearly defined doable mission, one that could be
accomplished safely and for humanitarian purposes."

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Fish production has kept
increasing in Ethiopia's Lake Tana in the last three months, a
report here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Lake Tana Fishermen's Association
is catching 29 tons of fish monthly since September with the
figure surpassing those caught last year by more than four tons.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Abate Belew attributed the rise in
fish output to the initiative of fishermen and the repair of
boats following the transfer of accounts from the now defunct
Lake Tana Fish Resources Development Project to the association.
</P>
<P>
He said the fish products marketing enterprise has good
relations with the association in purchasing fish and disclosed

86.

beginning December this year.

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Spending in UK up 28 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Consumers in Britain spent 7.5
billion pounds (12.5 billion US dollars) last month on credit and
debit cards, an increase of 28 percent compared with October 1995,
according to the latest figures from the Credit Card Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
Credit card spending grew to 4.2 billion pounds (7 billion US
dollars) in October, up 24 percent, while debit card spending rose
34 percent to 3.3 billion pounds (5.5 billion US dollars), the
research group said.
</P>
<P>
Most was spent on food and drink, which accounted for 1.9
billion last month, 19 percent more than in the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
There were also big increases in spending on clothing, which
rose 34 percent in the year to October, and on household goods
which rose 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment accounted for about 423 million pounds (706
million US dollars), an increase of 31 percent on last October.
</P>
<P>
However, the biggest increase was on services, a rise of 47
percent over the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the sharp increase fit in with the present
buoyant picture of the economy with growth led by consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
With rising house prices, lower unemployment, higher personal
incomes and lower interest rates, consumers are now more prepared
to spend on services and on high street goods and to take on
greater debt to pay for higher spending, the group said.

KHARTOUM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today categorically
denied having offered assistance to Ugandan opposition elements.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Sudan news agency, Sudanese
Minister of Information Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohammed Khier
described as completely unfounded the accusation leveled by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president had accused Sudan of assisting Ugandan
rebels who were fighting against the Ugandan government across
the border with Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister said that this accusation was not based
on facts or logic. He said that events which have taken place in
Uganda were Ugandan internal affairs and Sudan was
extremely interested in seeing the situation in Uganda calm.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sudan was committed to the agreement to
normalize relations between the two countries, which was signed
in Khartoum in October.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995, after accusing Khartoum of supporting rebels in the north
of the country. Sudan, for its part, accused Uganda of backing
rebel groups in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hails Iraq's Acceptance of UN Oil-for-Food Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today hailed Iraq's
acceptance of the U.N. conditions that had held up the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet extraordinary session, the Council of Ministers
stressed that implementing the deal would secure the humanitarian
aid and medical supplies for the Iraqi people suffering under
U.N. tough sanctions, Kuwaiti state minister for cabinet affairs
Abdul Aziz Dekhil Al-Dekhil said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was signed by Iraq and UN in May this year to
allow Baghdad to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in six
months to relax the difficult living conditions faced by the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
But the implementation of the resolution was delayed by the
recent Gulf crisis induced by the Iraqi troops military
operation in northern Iraq last August to support one Kurdish
faction against another.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations agreed Monday to the terms of the
long-delayed oil-for-food deal, and Iraq said it could start
pumping oil as early as December although a pricing formula must
still be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
At the news of a breakthrough in the oil-for-food talks
between Iraq the United Nations, Kuwaiti Crown Price and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said Tuesday at
a parliamentary session that he welcomed "without hesitation" an
accord for the Iraqis "who are suffering from lack of medicine,
from lack of food, form lack of everything they need."
</P>
<P>
He also said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government still
"has evil intentions" towards Kuwait, adding that "we should
follow his steps and try to find out what his intentions are."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has consistently made a distinction between the Iraqi
regime which it blames for the seven-month occupation that ended
in February 1991 and the Iraqi people suffering under sanctions
imposed since the invasion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also stressed on the necessity of Iraq's compliance
with all Security Council resolutions related to its aggression
against Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Kuwait supports the oil-for-food deal also
because it could help pay for disarming Iraq, which Kuwait and
other Gulf states are being asked to bail out for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The chief of U.N. Special Commission on Dismantling All Mass
Destruction Weapons in Iraq Rold Ekeus is currently on a tour of
the Gulf Arab countries to brief the Gulf leaders on the strained
financial status of his commission and try to gain pledges from
them for financial support.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kuwait promised to provide some funds to support the
U.N. mission in Iraq when Ekeus was in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, while most of the new Iraqi oil
money will pay for food and medicine for its sanction-hit people,
as well as compensation for claimants who were in Kuwait during
Baghdad's occupation, a large part of it would pay for the defray
costs of U.N. missions in Iraq.

BELGRADE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- In the first 10 months of
1996, the industrial production in Yugoslavia rose by 6.5 percent
compared with the same period last year, according to an analysis
published by the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce Wednesday.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A four-member British
delegation of petroleum experts arrived here today for discussions
with Iraqi officials on the implementation of
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The visit closely follows Iraq's Monday acceptance of all
conditions set by the U.N. to the deal reached last May.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency said another international team of oil
experts will be here next week to supervise the reoperation of the
oil pumping station in northern Iraq from which a total of 450,000
barrels of oil is expected to flow to the world market under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is still waiting for the approval of the U.N. on the oil
pricing mechanism for its export. It has said that everything is
ready for an immediate oil export.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. oil pact allows Iraq to sell oil worth 2 billion
dollars every six months to finance the purchase of urgently
needed food and medicine for the Iraqi people who are living a
hard life under the U.N. crippling U.N. sanctions imposed
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990.

<HEADLINE> US Endorses Canadian Proposal on Relief in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
endorsed a Canadian proposal for the establishment of a
humanitarian relief headquarters in Uganda to speed delivery of
assistance to Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire and to encourage
their return to their homeland, the State Department announced.
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns gave no indication of the size of the U.S. commitment. But
he said the United States had already sent about 400 troops to the
region, mainly in Uganda and Kenya, to provide airlift, air
control and other support services for the relief mission.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian proposal, the key of which calls for air drops to
the refugees in Zaire, was made by Canadian Foreign Affair
Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do this alone," Axworthy said. "We need to have the
cooperation of other countries." He said he hoped other donor
countries would respond to the proposal by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the air drops proposal, Burns said the United
States would work with Canada to ensure the activity was carried
out with the maximum safety.
</P>
<P>
The air drops should take place in such a way as to encourage
the refugees to return back to Rwanda, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy estimated the number of refugees, mostly Rwandan, in
Zaire at 200,000, but other estimates run several times that
figure. About 600,000 Rwandan refugees are believed to have
returned to their homeland over the past 12 days.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Boycotts Regional Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bahraini official
reiterated today that Bahrain will not participate in the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit due to be held on December 7-9
in the Qatari capital city of Doha.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh
Mohammed Bin Mubarak al-Khalifa as attributing his country's
stance to the Qatar's "unfraternal and uncordial" attitude
towards Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the recent visit to Bahrain by Omani
Foreign Minister Yussef Ben Alawi, also chairman of the current
session of the GCC Ministerial Council, no progress has been made
in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bahraini foreign minister said Bahrain is still
expecting member states of the GCC to make Qatar change its
attitude towards Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain announced last October that it will not take part in
the Doha summit on account of Qatar's rejection to withdraw the
case of the Bahrain-Qatar border dispute from the International
Court of Justice (ICJ).
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar disputed over a chain of islands and shoals,
territorial water boundaries and the Zubara land strip in Qatar,
where Bahrain's ruling family lived 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Both parties had in the past sought Saudi mediation, but Qatar
unilaterally took the case to the ICJ five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has rejected the court's jurisdiction and boycotted
its sessions, calling on solving the dispute through direct
talks or Saudi mediation.
</P>
<P>
The six-member GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has decided to cancel
the deal for the purchase of 10 Super Cobra helicopters from the
United States because of the delay in their provision, Turkish
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Turkey is planning to lease assault
helicopters from other countries, including France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has a 3 billion U.S. dollars project to produce assault
and reconnaissance helicopters locally in cooperation with a
foreign firm after the choice of the model in 1997, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that before the co-production starts, Turkey will
lease the helicopters from the contracting firm to meet the
country's short-term requirements.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been making increasing use of helicopter gunships
in its fight against the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish workers'
Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old separatist war for
autonomy which has claimed over 21,000 lives in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli
told reporters that Turkey's decision had been communicated
through military and diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Loses in Slander Case Against Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish civil court today
ordered Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller to
pay 4 billion Turkey liras (40,000 dollars) to Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan for insulting him.
</P>
<P>
Ciller reportedly called the prime minister a heroin smuggler
before the general election on December 24, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's lawyers said that Ciller had also defamed the
Islamist Welfare Party (RP) leader through TV statements, accusing
him of embezzling the funds collected for the Bosnian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
After the inconclusive elections, Ciller first entered a
coalition with the rival center-right Mother Land Party (ANAP),
but terminated the partnership three months later when ANAP leader
Mesut Yilmaz endorsed the corruption probes tabled against Ciller
by Erbakan's RP.
</P>
<P>
She then surprised the nation by making a U-turn to bury her
hostility against the Islamists and set up a coalition with
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamists in return backed Ciller against corruption
charges they themselves initiated, but Erbakan did not withdraw
the suit he filed against his government partner.

BUDAPEST, November 28 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton is persuading Hungary to participate in the establishment
a Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI).
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter, addressed Wednesday to Hungarian Prime
Minister Horn Gyula, is published today in Hungarian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President says that an active response from Hungary to
the proposal of setting up the SECI can encourage the
participation of the neighboring countries to the south of Hungary
in the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's action could also greatly strengthen the efforts to
build peace and security in southeast Europe, which was the
objective in establishing the SECI, added the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised that Hungary's participation in the
establishment of the SECI would not harm the country's bid for
NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Washington invited a number of southeast European countries
including Hungary to consult on the establishment of the SECI in
Geneva, on December 5-6. But some countries have resisted the
invitation.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Thwarts Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri's new government, in its first showdown with opponents,
thwarted here today demonstration attempts of labor unions
supported by opposition politicians and students.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the protest actions failed to assemble together
small groups of demonstrators who were kept apart by army troops
and security forces in several corners of the capital city.
No major confrontation has taken place.
</P>
<P>
In the Museum Square in central Beirut where some 100
demonstrators coming from the eastern part of the city tried to
march along the Mazraa street toward the government building but
was intercepted by a blockade of the army at the Barbir Bridge.
</P>
<P>
After failing to stage the demonstrations, the powerful
Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU) called on its cadres and
prominent supporters to hold a meeting in its headquarters at
4:00 p.m. (14:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The organizers had said that marches toward the government
building would start at 11:00 a.m. (09:00 GMT) despite the heavy
army presence on the streets and government's warnings that
unauthorized street rallies would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
All roads leading to the Museum Square and the Verdun
district, the second gathering point of demonstrations, had been
sealed off since 6:00 a.m..
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were automatically dismissed just after the
midday, and the roads were reopened in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But armored personal carriers are still seen squatting
on roadsides with soldiers in helmets and combat uniforms
sitting behind heavy machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Mobile patrols of the army and interior security forces are
rolling along the main streets and policemen have not loosen
checks of identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand army troops and thousands of policemen were sent
to streets in Beirut and other major cities Wednesday afternoon
to pre-empt the demonstrations, which were regarded as the first
challenge facing Hariri's newly-formed government.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the CTU's call for a nation-wide strike, small
shops, schools, universities and some public institutions were
shut down since this morning.
</P>
<P>
But workers in big super markets, trade companies and
enterprises as well as government departments went to work,
ignoring the strike call.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The protests were called for
in a bid to show the people's grievance over the deteriorating
socio-economic conditions and to force the government to annul a
broadcast media law, which orders a close of up to 150 private
radio and television stations by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr stressed today that the
government is "serious" in treating the socio-economic problems
and in guaranteeing the popular freedom "without pressures and
exaggerations."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in his office that the government is "open
for any dialogue on these issues."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the security situation in Beirut in light of
the demonstration call, the interior minister said that the
security forces and the army must take the measures in order to
"safeguard the public security."
</P>
<P>
"These forces have shown that they do not allow any breach of
the security and proved their ability to prevent violation
against the stability desired by the Lebanese," said the
interior minister, who is also the deputy prime minister in
Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the citizens had not respond to the strike call
and only less than 10 percent of shops and institutions all over
Lebanon participated in the strike.
</P>
<P>
Just some 10 hours before the labor unions and opposition
groups went down the street, Hariri's third government won a
overwhelming vote of confidence from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the vote of confidence just before the midnight, 102 of
the 121 deputies who attended the final of six successive
parliamentary sessions voted for the government, and 19 voted
against it.

months.

<HEADLINE> CMC Vice Chairmen Meet Model Cadets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior military leader
Liu Huaqing met today with a group of model cadets who are
currently lecturing in Beijing, praising them for setting a good
example for all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Liu is member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
and also vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by Zhang Zhen and Zhang Wannian, who are
also vice chairmen of the CMC.
</P>
<P>
The model cadets come from the No.4 Medical University of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), which is located in Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In July 1982, the university gained nationwide prominence when
one of its students, Zhang Hua, gave his life to save an old
farmer who had fallen into a fertilizer pit.
</P>
<P>
Since then, students from the university have tried to emulate
Zhang through humanitarian service or contributions to the country
and people.
</P>
<P>
Some of the students have volunteered to work in Tibet and
other remote areas, despite the harsh conditions, while others
achieved outstanding results in the field of medical research.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of their efforts, the CMC decided to form a
lecture group comprised of six model cadets selected from the
department where Zhang Hua studied.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhang Zhen said that the model cadets and
their fellow students "have displayed to the Party and the people
the firm political beliefs, lofty ideals, sincere patriotic
enthusiasm, and pioneering spirit possessed by today's military
cadets."
</P>
<P>
He added that it is of great significance to widely publicize
the exemplary deeds of the students from the No.4 Medical
University, which will have a positive influence on the country's
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA should lead the whole society in carrying out the
Party's decision to promote socialist ethical and cultural
progress," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese JLG Spokesman on British Amendment to Crimes Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Senior
Chinese Representative Office of the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) said here today that the British side's amendment to
Hong Kong's Crimes Ordinance violated the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
On November 26, the British side announced that it will submit
the draft amendment of the ordinance to the Hong Kong Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the act represents major changes to one
of Hong Kong's existing laws and infringes upon the legislative
power of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side is deeply concerned with this act of
the British side without prior consultation.
</P>
<P>
In July 1995, the British side put forward its suggestion on
the acclimatization of the Crimes Ordinance and in July this year,
it raised specific suggestions on amending the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
After careful study, the Chinese side already made clear its
stance on the question.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Article 23 of the Basic Law stipulates
that the HKSAR will formulate law in this regard. This is a matter
to be handled by the HKSAR and there is no need for help from the
British side. Otherwise, that will amount to restricting and
infringing upon the legislative power of the Special Region, thus
violating the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the British side's amendment to the
Crimes Ordinance in fact means major changes to the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stance of the Chinese side on the question of
major changes to Hong Kong laws is clear-cut and consistent and
the British side is quite familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the British side has over the years refused
to discuss with the Chinese side the question of amending Hong
Kong's existing laws.
</P>
<P>
The latest act of the British side not only goes against the
principle laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration that
"the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically
unchanged", but also runs counter to its commitment to consulting
the Chinese side on the major questions in the transition period,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Chinese side expects the British
side to match its word by deed and refrain from creating new
troubles in the final phase of Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
He warned the British side not to act willfully or take
unilateral action before a consensus is reached through
consultation between the two sides. Otherwise, cooperation
between the two sides will be affected and the British side shall
bear all the consequences arising from it, he added.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Colleges Urged to Serve Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agricultural and
forestry colleges and universities should better serve the
country's 900 million farmers by providing easier access to talent
and new technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education
Commission, said here today at a three-day national conference on
exchanging experiences in education of agricultural and forestry,
that colleges and universities specializing in these areas should
be dedicated to serving the country's agricultural development,
rural areas and farmers.
</P>
<P>
These schools should try to meet the demands of local economic
construction when conducting research and training high-level
personnel, Zhu said at the meeting, attended by the college and
university presidents.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth such conference held since New China was
founded in 1949. The last meeting was held in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, participants discussed how to better
combine classroom theory with practical application.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 34 agricultural colleges and
universities, including China Agricultural University, have
created 180 billion yuan (about 21.6 billion U.S. dollars) of
economic returns during the past decade by applying scientific
research to rural production.
</P>
<P>
China now has 71 colleges and universities that specialize in
agriculture and forestry. More than 720,000 graduates from these
schools have become agri-technicians or administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
Hong Fuzeng, vice-minister of Agriculture, said at today's
meeting that switching from extensive farming to intensive farming
can be guaranteed by the progress in science and technology, and
the improved quality of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Higher education institutions of agriculture and forestry could
benefit from training larger groups of professionals in the field
and strengthening agri-scientific study, Hong said.

<HEADLINE> French Unions Warn Against Police Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The French unions today warned
the government against resorting to police intervention in the
dispute in which striking truckers continued to block roads and
gas supply centers across the country today.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations broke down Wednesday night between the truckers
and their bosses over pay rises and shorter work hours, despite an
earlier agreement on early retirement.
</P>
<P>
Louis Viannet, General Secretary of the Confederation Generale
du Travail (CGT), said this morning that he had learned that the
government was likely to use force to stop the road blockades, as
it did in 1992 against striking truckers.
</P>
<P>
"If this takes place, we will not leave the truckers alone in
the field. And if the government tries to play the card of
repression, it should not think about using it here," said Viannet.
</P>
<P>
The Force Ouvriere (FO) and the Marseille Transportation Union
RTM today sent an ultimatum to the local government, warning it
against any use of force to stop the blockade of gas storage
centers by the truckers.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the FO, Marc Blondel, suggested that the
bosses, whose offer of a one percent pay rise was rejected by the
truckers, resume talks with the workers.
</P>
<P>
The National Center of Trucking Information said about 240
blocks were still on the roads across France this morning, almost
the same amount counted last night.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Bernard Pons was reported to be meeting
Prime Minister Alain Juppe on new measures by the government to
intervene in the 11-day conflict, comparable in scale to the
strike by transportation workers at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Mediation by the government over the past week resulted in a
semi-failure, as its mediator Robert Cros declared his mission
closed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Pons said the government might issue a decree ordering the
bosses to yield to part of the demand by the workers on higher pay
and a shorter work week, if the two conflicting sides failed to
stop confrontation.

<HEADLINE> France Agrees to Air Drop Over Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it has
agreed to join a mission for air dropping aid materials to Rwandan
refugees stuck in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The mission was proposed by Canada and is supported by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We examined the suggested option yesterday on the air dropping
of aid, and we immediately assured the Canadian government that we
are disposed to participating in an international operation of
this type," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zaire said it was totally and categorically opposed
to the air drop. It would not authorize planes flying over its
territory for such a mission, which Kinshasa described as
"insulting."
</P>
<P>
"It is better to do nothing than to regard the refugees and the
displaced people as dogs," Agence France Press quoted Zairian
government spokesman Boguo Makeli as saying today.
</P>
<P>
France also expressed its regret over the failure by Western
powers to apply the United Nations Security Council Resolution
1080, which calls for the sending of a multinational force to
eastern Zaire to help rescue hundreds of thousands of Rwandan
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Hearings on Petitions Against Dissolution of NA to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court
decided to hold preliminary hearings of two petitions against the
dissolution of the National Assembly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two constitutional petitions were filed by former Speaker
Yousaf Gilani and deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
respectively after President Farooq Leghari dissolved the National
Assembly on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The court sources told local press here today that at first
stage it would determine the maintainability of the petitions,
examining them from technical point of view instead of going into
their merit.
</P>
<P>
A three-member bench has already been constituted to hear the
petitions. Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Sajjad Ali Shah will
head the bench.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Sajjad said today the Supreme Court would
decide the dissolution of National Assembly case "strictly
according to law and on merit".
</P>
<P>
"We would listen to all the arguments from both sides and
decide according to existing laws", he said while talking to
newsmen in the southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the decision of the court would depend on
the relevance of the arguments," according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Justice said, "we would try to give verdict in the
shortest possible time, however, it would depend on the length of
arguments."
</P>
<P>
He said due to increased number of political cases in higher
courts, there is shortage of judges and the normal litigation
cases are suffering.
</P>
<P>
"We are increasing the number of judges to decide public
cases."

<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Commander to Lay Down Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Rizvon Sodirov, an influential
field commander and former commander-in-chief of the Tajik
opposition's forces, said today that he is ready to give up armed
struggle and cooperate with the Tajik government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he made this decision "for the purpose of
achieving national accord and civil peace as soon as possible,"
say reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Sodirov, who arrived in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe from
Afghanistan on Wednesday, has already had several meetings with
high-ranking Tajik officials, including Commander of the National
Presidential Guard General Gafar Mirzoyev.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, he declared his intention to stop the
armed struggle against the government of Tajikistan, to help
promote national reconciliation and to end the military
confrontation in the former Soviet republic, Tajik presidential
spokesman Zafar Saidov confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"The nation is tired of war and armed confrontation, and it is
necessary to do all we can for bringing peace to our land as
quickly as possible," said Sodirov.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the real influence he has on
armed opposition groups and about the forces he represents,
Sodirov said he was acting on his own, but he had many supporters
in opposition units, deployed in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Although Sodirov was removed in 1995 from the post of
commander-in-chief of the opposition troops, he continued to be
one of the key figures of the armed opposition, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Fishery Processing Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (xinhua) -- China plans to increase its
fishery processing level by a substantial margin to boost the
growth of the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan set by the Ministry of Agriculture, the
output of processed aquatic products will reach 6.4 million tons
by the year 2000. Meanwhile, the quality and the standardized
system of the processed products will be also improved.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry noted that China's fishery
processing industry has been developing rapidly. Statistics show
that by 1995, more than 4,000 fishery processing companies had
been set up, with an annual production capacity reaching six
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The output of processed aquatic products was 4.15 million tons
last year.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that the fishery processing industry
still lags behind market demand and the development of the fishery
industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said the processing level of inland fish and low-valued sea
fish is not satisfactory. Low-quality processed aquatic products
still appear on the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged processing companies to pay more attention to the
processing of inland fish, low-valued sea fish, shellfish and
seaweed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to help raise the quality of the processing
products, the ministry is planning to establish a commission to
supervise the quality of fishery products.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Overcharge Passengers </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A circular issued by the
Ministry of Communications has reenforced the prohibition of extra
fees imposed on passengers.
</P>
<P>
A similar circular issued a few years ago had clearly
stipulated that no extra feeds should be charged in addition to
the ticket price. However, there has been passengers complaining
that some railways, highways and water transportation routes
overcharge tourists by various means, while some airlines ask for
extra insurance premiums for baggage consignment.
</P>
<P>
The circular claims that the current ticket price contains the
accident insurance premium, and in the event that passengers are
injured, they should receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
Transportation departments are forbidden to force people to buy
additional, unwanted insurance policies, the circular adds.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that tickets and insurance policies should
not be sold at the same window.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive inspection is expected to be carried out across
the country, and the violators will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications also stressed in the circular
that the extra accident insurance policy should not be sold
together with tickets when units book train or plane
reservations.

</P>
<P>
Both India and China enjoy time-honored civilizations and both

combining to account for more than two-fifths of the world's total
population.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the two countries have a great
potential to tap and can learn from each other by swapping
experience.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should make joint efforts to cooperate in bilateral,
regional as well as international affairs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China pays great attention to parliamentary
exchanges between the two countries. He hoped the Chinese and
Indian parliaments will maintain their contacts at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The Indian house speaker said that it will be a great
contribution to the mankind for India and China to develop
themselves, enhance cooperation and play significant roles in
international affairs in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Sangma said that Jiang's visit will promote bilateral relations
in politics, trade, economy and culture and that the visit is thus
of great significance.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived today from Manila, where he
attended the Fourth Informal Leadership Conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and paid a two-day state
visit to the Philippines.

Hashiomoto approves it, according to the National Public Safety
Commission. The commission is responsible for supervising the
nation's police force.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Inoue would be succeeded on, December 3, by
Kenji Maeda, director of the Secretariat of the National Police
Agency (NPA).
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by Home Affairs Minister Katsuhiko
Shirakawa, also took disciplinary action against five senior MPD
officials for negligence.
</P>
<P>
The police sergeant who allegedly confessed in May to shooting
Takaji Kunimatsu, commissioner general of the NPA, belonged to the
Aum Shinrikyo religious sect.
</P>
<P>
But the MPD failed to start a thorough investigation to verify
the confession for five months. And the policeman's story was
revealed to only a few high ranking officials in the organization,
with no report made to the NPA.
</P>
<P>
The confession was made public only after it was leaked to the
press.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place in March last year, 10 days after the
sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway system that killed 11 people
and injured more than 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The doomsday cult, accused of the subway attack, is also
suspected of involvement in the shooting. Kunimatsu was seriously
injured but returned to duty after being hospitalized for months.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Inoue is designed to impress the public with
the NPA's determination to resolve the Kunimatsu case in time for
the opening of a Diet session Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the NPA sacked Masaru Sakurai, head of the MPD
public Safety Department and chief investigator of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Inoue will be the first MPD chief to resign over mismanagement
since 1978 when the then MPD superintendent general, Kuniyasu
Tsuchida, stepped down following the murder of a female college
student by a policeman in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> China to Join Global Maritime Distress and Safety System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China is to join the Global
Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), under the terms of a
ground radio equipment import contract signed today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is valued at more than 10 million US
dollars, was signed between the China Transport Telecommunication
Center under the Ministry of Communications, and the Japan Radio
Company Ltd. from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The imported equipment will be installed in 18 radio stations
in Chinese coastal cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and
Tianjin, to form the country's own Maritime Distress and Safety
System.
</P>
<P>
"The system will start operation in 1998, and formally open to
domestic and foreign ships on February 1, 1999," said Li Shiwen,
an official with the Transport Telecommunication Center.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the help of the system, which adopts
advanced digital and VHF communications to replace traditional
analog communications, people can more easily receive maritime
distress signals and organize rescues more quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
"The sub-system in the Shanghai coast radio can cover the vast
area from the Bering Strait to Singapore, while other sub-systems
will merely cover areas within 100 nautical miles from the coast,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by the International Maritime Organization
and the International Telecommunications Union, the GMDSS aims to
reduce maritime distress, provide timely rescues, and minimize
losses.
</P>
<P>
It consists of a search-and-rescue sub-system, which contains a
maritime satellite and a position indicator on oceangoing ships, a
ground station for the maritime satellite, and a sub-system for
land radio analysis.
</P>
<P>
All member countries of the International Maritime Organization
are obliged to finish installing the GMDSS, and put it into
operation before February 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China has built a satellite ground station in Beijing, and
started to connect radio systems on all oceangoing ships, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Emigration Wave Reduces Bulgarian Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A continued wave of emigration
has significantly reduced the size of the Bulgarian population and
is threatening the existence of the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, during the 1989-1995
period, 580,000 Bulgarians went abroad, mostly for better life,
reducing the nation's population to 8.47 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 alone, 218,000 Turkish Bulgarians left the country, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, only about 1,000 Bulgarians returned home
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian population has been dropping by an annual average
of 53,000 people over the past ten years. If the trend continues,
the existence of the Bulgarian nation will be threatened, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has set up an agency for Bulgarians in
foreign countries and the agency is working with the housing
department on programs to attract and resettle Bulgarians returned
from foreign land.

ANKARA, November 28 (Xinhua)-- Turkey's Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan said here today that the Turkish government
hopes to reopen the Iraqi crude oil pipeline through Turkey as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the remarks at a cabinet meeting this
morning. Erbakan said that Turkey wants Iraqi petroleum to flow
soon and to eradicate terrorist groups by improving trade
relations within this region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that studies were underway to
improve trade at border points and to facilitate the travel of
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iraq's Ambassador to U.N. Nizar Hamdoon said that
Baghdad had dropped all its previous objections to U.S.-drafted
U.N. conditions that had made the opening of the
Kerkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline impossible.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said: "All the aspects of the memorandum of
understanding have been discussed and they have been agreed
upon," adding that this included the issue of U.N. observers
as well.
</P>
<P>
The initial agreement for the implementation was hammered out by
the U.N. in May, but the projected pumping of 800,000 barrels of
crude oil through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline was delayed due to
Iraqi objection.

<HEADLINE> Four New Issues Floated at Shenzhen Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Companies from Tianjin,
Chongqing, Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province, and Zibo in Shandong
Province were listed today at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of
China's two bourses, marking the first time that four new issues
were floated on a single day at the South China bourse.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has accelerated its pace of expansion. This year,
83 new companies have been listed at the bourse, according to
local observers.
</P>
<P>
Of this year's total, 71 new-listed firms have gathered 10.7
billion yuan of funds. The 12 other companies are now permitted to
sell their public-held shares at the bourse.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, local governments and central government departments
in charge of certain industries recommended a number of successful
companies for listing at the bourse. This has laid a solid
foundation for the Shenzhen exchange to list shares from more
industries, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, stocks from automotive manufacturers,
oil-drillers, non-ferrous metal industries and expressway
construction companies have been listed at the bourse for the
first time this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the trading volume at the exchange has
continued to swell. To date, the figure has surpassed one trillion
yuan, compared with 514.8 billion yuan -- the entire trading
volume at the bourse between 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
The huge influx of funds has tripled the current share prices
above the figure at the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Largest Maker of Down Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China has become a major
supplier of down products after its down industry began to take
off in the mid-1980s, scoring annual domestic sales of eight
billion yuan, according to a newly-published book on the country's
feather-filled products.
</P>
<P>
According to "A Galaxy of China's Down Products," China's
annual exports of the fluffy goods, including quilts and clothing,
make up a trade volume of 865 million US dollars, half of the
world total trade of down products.
</P>
<P>
The new book was edited by the Down Products Special Committee
under the China Garment Association.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country exports 23,300 tons of down and 26,200 tons
of down quilts every year, and the export volume of down clothing
stands at 18 million items.
</P>
<P>
China's down products are sold in more than 100 countries and
regions. The leading buyers include the United States, Japan,
Germany, Italy, Britain and other European nations.
</P>
<P>
At the book's publication ceremony held today, Sheng Caiqing,
vice president of China Garment Corporation, said that the new
work serves as a useful reference for both the Chinese and foreign
down industrialists, and will promote the cooperation and exchange
among them.

<HEADLINE> Russia Designs New 'Workhorse' Space Booster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian plans to launch manned
spacecraft not only from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, but also from the
Plesetsk in its northern part in the near future with the help of a
new booster rocket, experts here said today.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the flight tests of the Rus (Sojuz-2), a new
Russian space rocket, are scheduled for the next year.
</P>
<P>
They believe that in the near future it will be possible to
launch manned spacecraft from the Plesetsk space-launch complex
with the help of the Rus.
</P>
<P>
The Rus is a new version of the Sojuz rockets, which have been
used for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage Sojuz rockets were originally intended for
launching unmanned spacecrafts. Later, however, all the manned
spaceships were launched with their help.
</P>
<P>
Now, Sojuz booster rockets are the main "workhorse" of the
Russian space exploration program. They make space flights more
often than any other Russian or foreign rockets.
</P>
<P>
During the past 30 years of operation the rocket was modernized
several times. More up-to-date modification, Sojuz-U (unified),
has been used since 1973 for putting into orbit manned spacecraft,
transport spacecraft and biological space vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The main characteristic features of the Rus rocket are a
computation complex it has on board and an original design of the
third stage with a new engine. This is expected to increase its
carrying capacity by 800 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the Russian Military Space Forces,
two rhesus monkeys are to be launched on a 14-day space mission in
a Bio-11 ship on December 10 to examine effects of exposure to
weightlessness on the vestibular and locomotor function and
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
The two four-year-old monkeys on board the Bio-11 will be
launched on a Soyuz-y booster rocket from the Lesetsk space port.
</P>
<P>
The launch will be the sixth monkey experiment in the history
of the Russian space research. Biological studies in space were
started in 1957, when the dog, Laika, was launched on the second
Soviet satellite.
</P>
<P>
The successful space mission of the dogs Belka and Strelka in
August 1960 and of other two dogs in March of 1961 preceded the
decision to launch the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space.

friendly and cooperative ties in economy and trade between Hessen
and Chinese provinces, as well as Chinese enterprises will keep
developing smoothly.

with China, and that the enterpreneurs in his delegation are
deeply interested in the Chinese market. They wish to find new or
increased opportunities for cooperation with their Chinese
counterparts, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ukrainian Vice-Foreign Ministers Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese diplomat, in
meeting with a Ukrainian counterpart today, expressed the hope
that Ukraine should remain vigilant against the Taiwan authorities'
"dollar diplomacy" or attempt to create "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei made the remarks in
a meeting with Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Konstantin
Grishchenko here today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Ukraine can understand the sensitivity and
importance of the Taiwan question, stick to the principle of 'one
China', maintain a high level of vigilance against the Taiwan
authorities' 'dollar diplomacy' and their attempt to create 'two
Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan,' so as not to allow the Taiwan
issue to disturb the development of Sino-Ukrainian relations,"
Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have developed smoothly since the two countries
forged diplomatic relations five years ago, Tian noted, saying
that their leaders have maintained frequent high-level contacts,
and bilateral cooperation has been expanding in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to its relations
with Ukraine, he said, adding he expected the two sides to make
continued efforts in pushing for a sound and steady advancement of
such ties.
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko said that the development of relations with China
has been a top priority in Ukraine's Asia-Pacific policy.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Ukraine will continue to adhere to the "one
China" stance, and abide by the communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries and the principles
on the Taiwan question as set in the political documents signed by
leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will not have official contacts of any nature with
Taiwan, and it opposes Taiwan's "return" to the United Nations and
other international organizations, a Chinese source quoted the
Ukrainian diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko arrived here on November 27 as guest of China's
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang held
consultations with Grishchenko on bilateral relations and
international issues.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official: Israeli Threat to Reoccupy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
Secretary of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee, has described Israel's threat to reoccupy
the Palestinian self-rule territories as nonsense, emphasizing
that this would never happen.
</P>
<P>
This came in an exclusive interview published in Tunisian
newspaper "Asherouq" today.
</P>
<P>
"The recent statements made by (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, together with Israel's threat to resort to reoccupying
the territories controlled by the Palestinian National Authority,
have caused the tense situation," Abu Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis are still violating the two Oslo agreements by
persisting in expanding the Jewish settlements and setting up new
ones, which does undoubtedly have negatives effects on the
continuity of the peace process and jeopardizes it," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Such a threat is obsolete, because those territories have
ultimately restored their original and genuine identity, and no
one is now entitled to talk about them, because peace is not only
a Palestinian concern but also an Israeli and a global interest,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the world is ready to surrender the
practical steps which have been made by it in this connection,"
Abu Mazen argued.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao on Fostering High-Quality Sci-Tech Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior Party leader Hu
Jintao today stressed the necessity to foster a team of
high-quality science and technology personnel as part of China's
current drive to seek economic prosperity and create a contingent
of qualified cadres.
</P>
<P>
Hu made these remarks in Beijing at a forum attended by 29
noted sci-tech experts who are also members of the Communist Party
of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Hu is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and also a member of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that science and technology play a significant
role in the country's attempt to achieve two fundamental changes
in economic structure and mode of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Sci-tech personnel, especially those who are also Party
members, should serve as pioneers and models in invigorating China
with science and education, and seeking sustainable development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"They should also contribute to the promotion of socialist
ethical and cultural progress, by spreading scientific spirit,
combating feudal superstitions, and promoting a lifestyle that is
scientific, civilized, and healthy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that while preparing political cadres for the
Party and the government, and managerial cadres for enterprises,
equal attention should be given to accelerating the training of
cadres in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"A qualified team of sci-tech cadres and personnel must stick
to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong thoughts, and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"They should also be patriotic and truth-seeking, and full of
creativity and team spirit," he added.
</P>
<P>
All experts attending today's forum are also students in a
class of theoretical research, which was convened by the
Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Candidates Attend Inquiry Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Two question-and-answer
sessions were held here today for the three candidates for the
first Chief Executive of the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Selection Committee for the First Government
of the HKSAR, Peter K.C. Woo, Tung Chee Hwa and Ti Liang Yang
answered questions raised by members of the professional sector
and the labor, grass-roots and religious sector of the Selection
Committee respectively in the morning and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Topics at the two sessions covered the implementation of the
Basic Law as well as the law system of the HKSAR, Hong Kong's
contacts with international communities, industry policy,
readjustment of the educational, health and medical systems,
employment and housing policies and public security.
</P>
<P>
Ti Liang Yang said that the Basic Law is the constitution of
the HKSAR and the laws of the HKSAR must agree with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years, the Hong Kong government has
changed some laws apparently running counter to the Basic
Law. These laws must be rectified according to the Basic Law after
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the gap between the rich and the poor in Hong Kong,
Peter K. C. Woo said that the best solution to the problem is to
develop the economy and increase citizens' income.
</P>
<P>
He noted the Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong's existing
free economy system and low-tax system will remain unchanged. This
will ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and promote Hong Kong's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa called on various political organizations to play
an active role in Hong Kong affairs and seek common ground on
major issues while reserving differences on minor ones.
</P>
<P>
He also explained his views on Hong Kong's trade and economic
ties with international communities and spoke of the need of
solving housing problems.
</P>
<P>
All the three candidates stressed enhancing ethic education
among students in Hong Kong and improving the sense of the Chinese
nation among the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping and Zhou Nan, vice chairmen of the Preparatory
Committee for the HKSAR, respectively presided over the two
sessions with the presence of three other vice chairmen of the
Preparatory Committee Ann Tse-kai, Henry Fok Ying-tung and Leung
Chun-ying.
</P>
<P>
The two question-and-answer sessions were televised live on the
close circuit.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, the three candidates answered questions
from the business sector members of the Selection Committee. And
Friday morning, they will meet with Selection Committee members
from the political sector and take their questions.

<HEADLINE> Largest Integrated Circuit Project Launched in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China kicked off its largest
development project for integrated circuits (IC) today in the
Pudong New Area of Shanghai, signaling the beginning of the
country's ambitious plan to become a world leader in electronics.
</P>
<P>
This morning's opening ceremony for "Project 909" was attended
by Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Wu Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
Boasting an investment of more than 10 billion yuan, the
project is the most wide-ranging ever launched in China's
electronics sector. It will build a high-capacity production line
to monthly turn out 20,000 chips that are each 0.5 microns thick
and eight inches long.
</P>
<P>
China's IC industry now suffers from low productivity and
inadequate design capabilities. The annual output of the entire
industry can meet only 20 per cent of the country's market demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China has to import more than 10 billion
yuan-worth of IC chips annually, and lost its control of 95 per
cent of the domestic markets for program-controlled switches.
</P>
<P>
So far, the thickness of the domestic-made IC chips is one
micron, and the length is less than four to five inches, compared
with the 0.35-micron, eight-inch standard of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The central government estimates that China's IC demand will
stand at four billion chips with a combined value of 60 to 80
billion yuan by the end of the century. The increasing gap between
production capacity and market demand has forced the country to
focus greater attention on the fledgling IC industry.
</P>
<P>
Project 909 will help China raise the annual output of
integrated circuits to between one and 1.5 billion chips by the
year 2000, and to increase the sales volume to 10 billion yuan,
accounting for 30 per cent of the home markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the production line in Shanghai, the project
also includes the launching of several IC design companies and a
line for eight-inch single-crystal silicon.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country will implement a structure readjustment
in five major IC plants over the next five years, and will
establish four or five IC assembling factories each with an annual
manufacturing capacity of 200-300 million chips.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Industrial Master Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today unveiled
its Second Industrial Master Plan (IMP2) for 1996-2005 to propel
the country into the next phase of economic development in the
21st century to ensure the realization of "Vision 2020" of a fully
industrialized nation by that year.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 10-year plan here, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Malaysia is industrializing because the government
believes that only through industrialization can the government
ensure increasing wealth and sophistication for Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that it will help reduce the economic
imbalance between the various races who are citizens of this
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is not industrializing just because the
government wants to change the landscape from rice fields, rubber
and oil palm estates to one that will mirror the developed and
industrialized nations that Malaysia aspires to be.
</P>
<P>
"There is a political dimension to the IMP2 as has always been
with all Malaysian plans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the IMP2 stresses continued economic growth,
enhanced exports and raising the value for goods produced and
exported, a move which would boost the country's global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has decided to go into engineering, in particular
automotive engineering, telecommunications and information
technology industries, as well as focus on small and medium-scale
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the strategy under the IMP2 is the setting up
of a new large automotive city with the capacity to produce 1
million cars a year, as well as clusters of supporting industries
manufacturing components and parts supplying the principal car
manufacturer, other industries and exports.
</P>
<P>
He said the principal thrust for the telecommunication industry
would be in the Multimedia Super Corridor, where information
technology industries would be centered and operating from, thus
giving a strong push for the manufacture of telecommunications
equipment, electronics and Malaysian-branded household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Eight special areas have been identified under the IMP2,
including telemedicine, smart schools, research and development
clusters, application of multi-purpose cards and electronic
government to promote the development of the latest
information-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir urged the industrial sector to make efforts to adopt
information and knowledge-driven processes in manufacturing and
other related activities, in particular the application of
information technology for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said that in supporting the development of the country's
competitive cluster industries, the government would continue to
ensure adequate provision of quality infrastructure and other
support facilities to facilitate their development including human
resource development, research and development, indigenous
technology development, improving incentives and administration
delivery mechanism, as well as quality support services such as
ports, business services, transport and packaging.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also highlighted the need for the domestic sector to
generate more investments compared with their foreign
counterparts, but said the latter would still be needed especially
in the latest high technology sector.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to support foreign direct investments, but we
will also give local investors a helping hand," he said, adding
that with all sectors pulling together, ultimately Malaysia would
hopefully be a fully industrialized nation by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia successfully completed its First Industrial Master
Plan for 1986-1995, which saw the manufacturing sector growing by
an average of 13.5 percent from 1986 to 1995 and the economy
performing well in terms of macro-economics variables as well as
undergoing a significant structural change.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been transformed into an economy driven by
manufacturing exports from one that was commodity-based.

The governor said on Wednesday that the government is
determined to take resolute measures to fight the increasing
organized crimes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Give Free Rentals to High-Tech Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will give free
rentals to foreign high-tech firms which build plants in
government-run industrial parks in the country, the Ministry of
Finance and Economy said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the government decided last August to extend
free rentals for a maximum of 20 years to the foreign high-tech
firms in government-managed industrial parks, to encourage their
business in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
So high-tech foreign firms, willing to establish plants in
South Korea, would have access to rent-free leases for plant
sites, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
However, besides bringing high-tech, these foreign firms would
be required to bring employment, value-added work and a large
amount of investment into the country to qualify for the free
leases.
</P>
<P>
The investment of the foreign firms would have to be a minimum
of 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
He explained that such standards had to be used to avoid undue
discrimination against domestic firms.

<HEADLINE> Lower Wool Production Predicted In Australia </HEADLINE>

CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Wool
Production Forecasting Committee today lowered its estimate for
1996-97 shorn wool production to 639.2 million kilograms (mkg)
from its June forecast of 641 mkg.
</P>
<P>
The lower forecast represents a 2.4 percent decline from
1995-96, the committee said in a statement after meeting in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"The lower forecast cut per head in 1996-97 reflects the
changing flock structure with a higher proportion of ewes and
lambs making up the 1996-97 opening numbers".
</P>
<P>
It said the 1996-97 forecast was based on an opening flock of
126.3 million head, with an estimated 143.2 million sheep and
lambs expected to be shorn in the 1996-97 session.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the latest estimate for the 1995-96
production totaled 654.8 mkg, a decline of four percent on

<HEADLINE> Yuan Will Remain Stable After Current-Account Convertibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency will
remain stable in value after becoming convertible under the
current account next month, financial experts here have predicted.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1, China will undertake the obligations set
forth in the No.2, No.3 and No.4 clauses of Article Eight of the
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, and thereby make the
yuan convertible under the current account, Dai Xianglong,
governor of the People's Bank of China, said in a letter to the
IMF Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes four years ahead of China's original
self-imposed deadline of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The yuan's convertibility under the current account, which
includes trade, labor and tourism as well as normal short-term
banking and credit facilities, is a reflection and a result of the
smooth operation of the new foreign exchange system introduced in
January 1994, said Tao Liming, deputy director of the
International Finance Research Institute of the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
It is not expected to produce a great impact on the domestic
foreign exchange market, Tao told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The chances of wild fluctuations in the local currency's
exchange rate are very remote," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World Bank's resident mission in
China, said that the yuan's current-account convertibility will
not destabilize its exchange rate, as China has large reserves of
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Dai revealed earlier this month that China's foreign exchange
reserves were valued at more than 100 billion US dollars by the
end of October, up from 21.2 billion US dollars at the start of
1994 and 73.56 billion US dollars at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the remaining restrictions on
transactions under the capital account, which includes direct
investment, international loans and security trading, will be an
important factor for the yuan's stability.
</P>

<HEADLINE> General Strike Cripples Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Workers of public services,
transport and other industries launched a 24-hour nationwide
strike today, in protest of the government's new taxes and
austerity policy in its 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage, involving both the public and private
sectors, crippled the operation of public utilities, transports,
civil services, banks, municipal offices, industrial companies and
other businesses firms.
</P>
<P>
The general strike was called by the Confederation of Workers
of Greece and the Civil Servants' Supreme Administrative Council.
</P>
<P>
The strike also shot down most schools and courts, while
hospitals were operated with skeleton staff.
</P>
<P>
In the transport sector, the stoppage caused delays in flights
since Olympic Airways, the national carrier, staged a three-hour
stoppage from 09:00 a.m. to noon.
</P>
<P>
Ports were shut down throughout the country as seamen joined
the 24-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
Reports from local provinces said farmers blocked national road
junctures across the country, asking for higher prices for produce.
</P>
<P>
One of the main demands of the unions is that the government
index-link tax brackets to inflation. Union leaders said that
failure to do so would result in a drop in real income in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Judicial Cooperation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here today that judicial cooperation is a
major part of Sino-Russian relations, and that he hopes this
cooperation will develop further.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a meeting with Russian Minister of
Justice Valentin Alexeyevich Kovalyov. He said that China and
Russia have a long history of friendly exchanges, and that
improving the neighborly friendship is the desire of the two
peoples and is conducive to peace and stability in Asia and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people respect the path
of national development that the Russian people have chosen, and
sincerely hope for national stability, economic development, and
improvements in people's lives in that country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the legal system, Li said that a country's legal
system is closely related to its economic standard and cultural
traditions. However, he noted, managing the state affairs
according to law has become a consensus among peoples.
</P>
<P>
"It is the major aspect of our work to enforce legal system and
boost ideological and moral progress among the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reforms and opening up began, China has made
considerable progress in developing the law, and people's sense of
the law has improved.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, due to a poor foundation and a late start,
work in this area still leaves behind national economic
development. He pointed out that while a great deal of attention
is being paid to enforcing the law, China should also learn from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov said that smooth development of a nation's economic
reforms needs judicial reforms, and that the agreement he signed
during this visit with his Chinese counterpart Xiao Yang shows
many possibilities for judicial cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It sets a good foundation for future cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov arrived in Beijing on Nov. 22 at the invitation of the
Ministry of Justice. He left here for Moscow this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> China, India Face Task of Improving Livelihood: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Both China and India are now
facing the task of developing the economy and improving the
livelihood of their people, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin
upon arrival here on a four-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released at the airport, Jiang said: "As
two most populous developing countries in the world, both have on
our shoulders the heavy task."
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first ever by a Chinese head of state to the
country since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in 1950, is aimed at enhancing understanding, deepening
friendship, increasing trust and promoting cooperation, said the
president who came by special plane.
</P>
<P>
"China and India are close neighbors and our two peoples enjoy
a profound traditional friendship," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he expected to meet with and discuss issues of
common concern with Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and
Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president praised India as a great country and its
people as an industrious and talented people who are creators of a
time-honored civilization and splendid culture.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian people have worked new wonders in building up their
nation after winning independence," he added.
</P>
<P>
To establish and develop a long-term and stable relationship
between the two countries, mutually-beneficial cooperation is
necessary, the Chinese president said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation should be carried out on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and
India in 1954.
</P>
<P>
The principles not only serve the fundamental interests and
common wishes of the two peoples, but contribute to peace,
stability and development of Asia and the entire world as well,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The five principles are mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression; non-interference in
each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful coexistence
</P>
<P>
At the airport to welcome the Chinese president and his
entourage were Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda and Minister of
External Affairs I.K. Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Members of Jiang Zemin's entourage include Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong,
Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering, Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, Special Assistant Wang Weicheng,
Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Gyaincain Norbu and
Chinese Ambassador to India Pei Yuanying.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president flew in from Manila where he attended the
Fourth Informal Leadership Conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) and paid a two-day state visit to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
His current visit will also take him to Pakistan and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Before departure from Manila, Philippine President Fidel Ramos
went to Jiang's hotel to see him off.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that good neighborliness, trust and
cooperation will be the guidelines for developing
21st-century-oriented bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Ramos agreed with Jiang while congratulating the Chinese
president on his "successful" state visit, the first by a Chinese
head of state.

<HEADLINE> Macao Transition Should Be Handled According to Basic Law: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official stationed
in Macao said that Macao transitional affairs should be handled
according to the principles of the Basic Law of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said that the transitional affairs of Macao should be conducted
according to the principles of the law so as to narrow the
differences between the current operation and that of the future
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
While meeting with some executives of the Macao Basic Law
Promotion Association (MBLPA) on Wednesday, the director compared
the handling of transitional affairs to the joint of two sections
of rails, saying the law serves as the norms on how the rails
should be connected.
</P>
<P>
"If the two sections of rails have two much differences in its
size and width, their connection will be hard," he
said. "Consequently, it will cause major vibration."
</P>
<P>
Macao's basic law, which was promulgated in 1993, will serve as
the constitutional law after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999. The law has been
widely publicized by the MBLPA in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang pledged a continuous support for the MBLPA in its
promotion campaign, saying that what the association has done is
in the general interests of Macao residents.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firms Crackdown Computer Games Piracy in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leading Japanese computer
games manufacturers have taken the largest civil actions in Hong
Kong so far against distributors and retailers for selling illegal
copies of their software products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43 writs had been served to the distributors and
retailers involved earlier this week, it was announced at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese companies joined in the action are Sega
Enterprises Ltd., Koei Co. Ltd. and Sony Computer Entertainment
Inc. (SCEI).
</P>
<P>
Retailers at seven arcades in Hong Kong were found selling
illegal software published by Koei and for use in the Sega Saturn
games machines and software published by Koei, SCEI and other
companies for use in Sony's Play station video games machines.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the use of civil action and the serving of
writs seeking injunctions on such a large scale is unprecedented
in Hong Kong law enforcement against games software theft.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first action to be taken by Sega, Koei and
SCEI in Hong Kong against retailers alleged to be infringing
their software.
</P>
<P>
The companies claimed that pirated products are taking more
than 90 percent of Hong Kong's computer games market, causing
enormous financial lost on the legal software manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The latest civil actions cover many of Hong Kong's computer
shopping outlets in an effort to thwart attempts by retailers to
move or focus on their operations elsewhere to avoid law
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning of the united actions we are to
take and we want to show that we are not sleeping," said Kichi
Nishikura, General Counsel for Sega.

All economic sectors, except the stocks, scored positive growth

partially to extra working days in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption grew by one percent in the third quarter
over the second quarter, while consumption of manufactured
products went up by 2.7 percent, mainly due to a 13.6 percent
boost in car buyings, which was stimulated by a bonus offer for
car buyers by Prime Minister Alain Juppe.

<P>
Investment in enterprises increased by 3.4 percent, while
production of manufactured goods rose by 1.7 percent in that

The spokesman, Cui Tiankai, told a press conference that China
also hopes that the two sides can at the same time reach an
agreement on not targeting each other with strategic nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Only by doing so can it effectively make a contribution to the
security both of China and the US, and to stability in the world
as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cui's remarks came in response to a question about why China
disagrees with a US proposal, which was similar to a Sino-Russian
accord, on not targeting each other with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that China's and Russia's leaders issued a joint
statement in September 1994, pledging not to use force against
each other, and especially not to be the first to use nuclear
weapons, and that they would take steps to ensure that their
strategic nuclear weapons are not targeted at each other.
</P>
<P>
"What should be stressed here is that when China and Russia
promised not to target each other with their nuclear weapons, they
were attempting to avoid the use of force, and especially to avoid
the first use of nuclear weapons against each other," Cui
explained.

<HEADLINE> Army, Police Sent to Beirut's Streets To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government took
tight security measures this morning in a bid to prevent labor
unions and opposition parties from staging demonstrations
despite an ongoing nation-wide strike today.
</P>
<P>
All roads leading to Verdun district in west Beirut, and the
Museum Square in central Beirut, where marches toward the
governmental building were planned to start, have been sealed off
since the early morning, and citizens have been warned against
gathering in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Military helicopters are hovering over the capital city and
armored personnel carriers have been installed on roadsides with
soldiers in helmets and combat uniforms sitting behind heavy
machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Check points have been set up at crossroads and policemen of
the interior security forces are checking identity cards of
pedestrians and drivers.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 army soldiers and thousands of policemen were
sent to streets in Beirut and other major cities Wednesday
afternoon to pre-empt the demonstrations, which were regarded as
the first challenge for the newly-formed government of Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
After winning a confidence of the parliament late Wednesday
night, the government agreed to suspend the implementation of a
controversial broadcast media law which orders a shut-down of up
to 150 private radio and television stations by the end of this
week.
</P>
<P>
However, organizers of the anti-government protests said they
would still press ahead with a one-day strike and street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders called on their supporters to stage
peaceful demonstrations and avoid confrontation with security
forces.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the threat, the government reiterated its
determination to reinforce a three-year-old ban on street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The protests were called for in a bid to show the people's
grievance over the deteriorating socio-economic conditions and to
force the government to annul the broadcast media law, which is
allegedly aimed at suppressing the popular freedom and will lead
to an unemployment of 3,000 workers in the media circle.
</P>
<P>
As 128 parliamentary members were discussing whether to give
a confidence to Hariri's third government, hundreds of workers
in private radio and television stations staged a candlelight
vigil in front of the parliament building in the past three
days.
</P>
<P>
In the vote of confidence just before the midnight, 102 of the
121 deputies who attended the final session voted for the
government, and 19 voted against it.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, House Speaker Berri initiated a debate on a
proposal drafted earlier this month by 10 opposition deputies
demanding a five-month extension to the deadline of shutting down
scores of private radio and TV stations.
</P>
<P>
The debate, which began after 11:00 p.m. (21:00 GMT), was
closed to the press. Just over an hour later came the unexpected
news of the temporary reprieve for the radio and TV stations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economic growth
slowed down in the third quarter of this year, at an annuallized
rate of 6.4 percent, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for the July-September period, down 0.4 percent
from that of the previous quarter, was the lowest quarterly
advance since the second quarter of 1993 when the rate was
4.9-percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate for the first nine months of this year
was seven percent. It is likely to fall to 6.8 percent for the
entire year if it levels off at 6.4 percent in the final quarter,
the bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports due to worsening trade terms and slowing
private consumption was blamed for the slow-down, a bank official
said.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 8.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in the
third quarter, compared with a 14.1 percent expansion in the
previous quarter. But exports fell 6 percent from a year earlier
as a result of falling international prices of major export items.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private consumption also saw its growth rate fall
from 7.1 percent in the second quarter to 6 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea's economic growth rate was 9 percent,
one of the highest in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Cabinet Reshuffle May Take Place Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A cabinet reshuffle of the
current Jordanian government headed by Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti could take place in next April or May, according to
English weekly The Star published here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Higher Education Abdullah
 Ensour said that the reshuffle would allow ministers in the
government who are also deputies in the Lower House of Parliament
to step down in preparation for the parliamentary elections due
to be held late next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, any candidate holding a government post must
resign at least one month prior to the registration date for
the elections.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein set the precedent in May 1993 when he made a
cabinet reshuffle before elections.
</P>
<P>
This was "to prevent any candidate from making use of his
ministerial post in the campaign," Ensour said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the same policy will be adopted this time, and
I don't expect a reshuffle to take place later than April or
May next year," added the minister, who himself was also a
deputy.
</P>
<P>
Ensour confirmed that the planned cabinet reshuffle would cover
only 15 posts, hinting that not all of the 22 ministers would run
for re-election in the November 1997 elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that when the king called for a review
of the relationship between the constitutional authorities in a
speech last week, he meant to enhance the relationship between
the executive and legislative authorities.
</P>
<P>
Observers take the King's remarks as a signal for the
government to work on the issue of preventing deputies from
becoming ministers.
</P>
<P>
Others argue that it is the post of Prime Minister that
should be excluded from the separation of power procedures.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Kabariti would lead the interim government
which would supervise the next parliamentary elections
after a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Kabariti will remain in his post after
the elections.

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges to Build Shanghai Into Shipping Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The construction of Shanghai
International Navigation Center is in line with the need to build
Shanghai into an international economic, trade and navigational
center.
</P>
<P>
It is also in line with the efforts to develop and open up
Pudong New Area and to bring up the development of Yangtze River
Delta Area and provinces along the river as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made these remarks during an inspection tour of
the country's largest metropolis from November 26 to 28. The
premier praised the local officials for their remarkable
achievements in the past year and urged them to exert greater
efforts to speed up the pace of building the shipping center.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Li visited the Shanghai Navigation
Exchange, the Pudong Banking Trade Zone, and Shanghai First Yaohan
Mall.
</P>
<P>
At the navigation exchange, where modern means are used to
regulate the navigational transport market in Shanghai, Li Peng
asked the exchange to serve both domestic and international
customers under the principles of equality, openness and
righteousness.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Navigation Exchange is an important part of the
Shanghai International Navigation Center and a result of the
reform and development of the country's shipping industry under a
socialist market economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that a larger Shanghai Harbor can be built in
spite of geographic limitations to avoid overlapping port
construction and to make better use of the existing port
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He urged Shanghai Port authorities and those of neighboring
ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to expand their capacity
to meet economic development needs.
</P>
<P>
Li also visited the Shanghai Huahong Microelectronics Company
where a large compact-circuit production line, the largest
electronics industry project ever in China, is under construction.
</P>
<P>
The premier encouraged the company to explore a good way to
develop the country's compact-circuit industry by using a modern
enterprise system from the very start and competing on both the
domestic and international markets.

<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China said today that it
welcomes South African President Nelson Mandela's statement on
normalizing relations with China, calling them "positive".
</P>
<P>
China's first reaction came in a remark by Foreign Ministry

respectively in Asia and Africa, Cui said that normalization of
relations between the two countries at the earliest possible date,
in accordance with international practices, conforms to the
fundamental interests of their people.
</P>
<P>
"It will mean the broad prospects for friendly cooperation
between the two countries in all areas, and will benefit
consultations and cooperation in international affairs," Cui
said.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Talks Continue Amid Reports of Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian
talks on Hebron continued today amid reports of a possible
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After the intensive negotiations overnight, Israeli sources
reported progress in reducing the differences. Reports said that
Israel has softened its stand on the issue of "hot pursuit,"
which is the central dispute blocking an agreement on Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman was once again
actively involved in arranging a summit between Netanyahu and
Arafat in order to finalize the long-delayed Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has cancel a planned visit to the Gulf states,
although Palestinian officials denied a link between the move
and a possible meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Arye Shumer, director-general of the President's Office, has
held meetings with Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and
Yasser Abed Rabbo on arranging a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Shumer took part in the negotiations held
in Jerusalem between Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and
prime minister's diplomatic advisers Dore Gold and Yitzhak Molcho
on the one hand and Erekat and Rabbo on the other.
</P>
<P>
Shumer was optimistic about holding a Netanyahu-Arafat
meeting. "They are still sitting. There is no decision now, but
perhaps there'll be good news (this morning)," he was quoted by
The Jerusalem Post as saying today.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian sources close to Arafat said the reported
progress made in the talks had not been sufficiently developed
to make a summit possible. They said that new ideas were raised
in recent talks, but no more progress had been made to satisfy
their demand.
</P>
<P>
The progress that has reportedly been made is that Israel has
retreated from a former demand for its troop's right of hot
pursuit in Hebron. Instead, it only asks for making a separate
understanding on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Palestinian side agreed to extend a buffer
zone between the Jewish quarter and the Arab sector in Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Plan to Ease Shenzhen-Hong Kong Traffic Jam (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stretching from Shenzhen Bay to Hong Kong, the bridge will
serve as a link between the Shenzhen-Guangzhou Super Highway and
the 107 National Road. It will become part of the highway network
in the Pearl River Delta, as well as Hong Kong's projected No. 3
trunk road, serving also the new Hong Kong Airport, and several
major container terminals.
</P>
<P>
Another proposed project will be a passenger passage between
Shenzhen's Huanggang and Hong Kong's Luomazhou. The passage will be
linked by a new railway in Hong Kong and a subway in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The construction, including a 4.9-kilometer subway, a subway
station, and passenger terminal, is expected to remarkably ease
the congestion on Luohu Port.
</P>
<P>
The third scheme is a 21-km-long deep-water navigation channel,
stretching from Lingdingyang at the mouth of the Pearl River. The
waterway, designed to allow ships from Hong Kong to avoid the
crowded Mawan navigation route, will cost 680 million yuan to
build.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, highway, sea, railway and air ports in Shenzhen
handled 56.7 million passenger entries and exits, accounting for
50 percent of China's total; 8.5 million motor vehicles, 75
percent of the country's total; and 41.44 million tons of import
and export cargoes, 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in 2000, the passenger flow between
Shenzhen and Hong Kong will top 73 million people, with cargo flow
exceeding 70 million tons, and vehicles reaching 70,000.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese New Government Wins Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The new Lebanese government
led by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri won an overwhelming vote of
confidence in parliament late Wednesday night despite scathing
attacks by some deputies for alleged corruption in the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The final session, which ended just before midnight, was
attended by 121 members of the 128-seat house. Of those present,
102 gave the government their confidence and 19 voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place following three days of debate on the
cabinet's policy statement and a rebuttal by the billionaire
prime minister to 65 members of parliament who had addressed the
house in six sessions before the vote.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Hariri's failure to curb rampant corruption and
improve socio-economic conditions in his previous term of office
was a main topic in the debate, but most interlocutors promised
they would give a positive vote.
</P>
<P>
Among the deputies who announced their intention to vote
against the government were all the nine representatives of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite
fundamentalist group which has been a chronical headache to the
government.
</P>
<P>
When debating the economic situation in the country, Hariri
said he agreed that the social problems were great, but said "they
are being exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
In the government's policy statement released last week,
Hariri for the first time switched the focus to raising the
people's living standards from the post-war reconstruction
programs.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a Lebanese who does not want to see a
well-being of his nation and a stability prevailing his
country," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a real and objective judgment on the
performance of the government could only be made by a comparison
between the present situation and that four years ago when the
government first came to power.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that during his four years in office neither
regional politics nor the legacies of the civil war had slowed
down his reconstruction and development programs.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the confidence of parliament, Hariri could
hardly have a joyful time for celebration because of an announced
 nation-wide strike and demonstrations Thursday.

WUHAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Tourists heading to the Three
Gorges on the Yangtze River will get a better service in a
campaign to drive out profit-motivated activities.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists swarming to the Three Gorges before some of its

suffered substandard service and overpricing as a result of
malpractice by profiteers in the travel industry.

overloading of pleasure-boats, scrapping of contracts, hard
selling, erratic bookings, and disordered pricing structures.

bureau has worked out a series of rules and regulations concerning
the booking of tickets, the management of travel agencies, and
requirements on the service quality of the Three Gorges tourism
market.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Jordan Industrial Park Soon To Be Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A joint Israeli-Jordanian
company is nearing completion of preparing for the establishment
of an industrial and commercial park which is to be located five
kilometers south of the northern crossing point between the two
neighbors, on the Jordanian side.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the bi-weekly Israel Business Today,
the park, at a later stage, will extend to the Israeli side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
The project has already been approved by the governments of
both countries, and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
has said that assistance will be offered to Israeli
entrepreneurs interested in establishing facilities in the park,
by reducing the amount of red tape they will need to negotiate
in joining the park.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Jordan has allocated land for the first phase
of the park and has agreed to invest in linking the site to the
Jordanian national power infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The joint project is being executed by the Jordan Valley Free
Zone Industrial Park which was established by the Israeli Middle
East Industrial Project and Amman Resources from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The park will cover an area of 1,280 dunam (about 126
hectares) and will cost a total of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will involve the preparation of
531 dunam (about 52 hectares) at a cost of 70 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The park will employ a total of 20,000 employees, and the
development phase of the park's infrastructure is due for
completion in April next year. The first storage facilities will
be ready by the beginning of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebel Leader Rejects Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sources said the LTTE leader, in a speech broadcast on
"Voice of Tigers" radio Wednesday, once again said, "The LTTE is
not against procedures to find peace through negotiations, but
what we want is a real peace."
</P>
<P>
"We will keep on fighting. We will pay our blood as the price
and we'll fight until we achieve our liberation," he said on the
radio monitored in northern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The leader added, "Our Tamils must be able to live freely and
with dignity and must be able to decide their political rights."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamils -- the two major ethnic groups in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state since 1983 and
more than 55,000 people have been reportedly killed in the civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has combined military offensives
against the LTTE with a peace plan which devolves wide-ranging
powers to Tamils through a constitutional revision.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga earlier renewed the call for
peace talks with the LTTE and added that she was open to the idea
of third party mediation to end the conflict on condition that the
LTTE lay down arms before beginning negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government troops and police in Colombo, the
capital, and throughout the island country were put on full alert
because the LTTE has traditionally marked their "Heroes Week" with
attacks on military installations and remote border villages.

Qilu is one of the leading petrochemical enterprises in the

<P>
So far, over 600 cities and 2,000 county seats have taken
measures to monitor urban construction projects, covering urban
planning, the use of greenery, municipal administration, public
facilities, maintenance of a city's appearance, general sanitation
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China is speeding up its urbanization process, and management
of cities and towns has become a major problem. Since 1986, the
central government has issued a series of regulations aimed at
improving the the level of urban management.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, has curbed
the momentum of rampant construction by launching 16 campaigns to
demolish illegally-built facilities.
</P>
<P>
Other cities have intensified crackdowns on the destruction of
highways, water and gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Various urban construction supervision departments have
developed programs to create a cleaner environment. Thanks to the
efforts of a 900-member team, Chengdu has become the first "clean
city" among all provincial and regional capitals in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Plan to Ease Shenzhen-Hong Kong Traffic Jam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million dollar road
bridge linking booming neighbors Shenzhen and Hong Kong is to be
built.
</P>
<P>
With traffic between the two areas already congested, the
situation is expected to become even more critical when Hong Kong
reverts to China next summer.
</P>
<P>
The cross-sea bridge, over five kilometers long, is among major
projects designed to ease the heavy traffic flow between Shenzhen
and Hong Kong, officials in Shenzhen have revealed.
</P>
<P>
With fast growing economic exchanges between Shenzhen, China's
first special economic zone, and Hong Kong, one of the world's
most prosperous cities, the present four road links, one railway,
and seven sea ports, are unable to cope with the traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
During rush hours, vehicles in both directions have to queue up
for three to four hours before passing, losing precious time and
money.
</P>
<P>
"The situation must be urgently dealt with, since passenger and
cargo flows are expected to grow at an even faster pace after Hong
Kong returns to China on July 1, 1997," a Shenzhen official said.
</P>
<P>
The city has already mapped out plans for the construction of
several major projects at the crossing point between Shenzhen and
Hong Kong, and three of them are expected to start construction in
the coming four years, the official disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The projected cross-sea highway bridge, which will be 5.34
kilometers long and 22 meters high, will be jointly funded by
Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Investment from Shenzhen is estimated at
1.58 billion yuan (190.36 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Set Up Emergency Communication Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- An emergency communication
center will be set up at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
with a grant of some 70,000 U.S. Dollars provided by the Belgian
government, the "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used to instal communication equipment which
will also be served as the regional communication center, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
After signing the grant agreement yesterday, Kenyan Minister
for Finance Musalia Mudavadi said that with last week's fatal
hijacking of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, which crashed in the
Comoros, the center will become even more timely.
</P>
<P>
Pressure is likely to mount on African countries to be more
vigilant in screening passengers following the hijacking, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kenya had also become a center for regional
relief efforts and the equipment would help in coordinating the
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The center will handle any air emergencies which may happen in
the East African region, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment in S. Korea Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in
South Korea in the first 10 months of this year amounted to 2.05
billion U.S. dollars, up 32.5 percent from the same period last
year, the Finance and Economy Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1962 that South Korea saw inbound
direct investment surpassing two billion U.S. dollars in a single
year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacture industry accounted for 53 percent of the total
foreign direct investment during the 10-month period, in contrast
to 49 percent during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The recent surge in foreign direct investment resulted from
government efforts to attract foreign hi-tech firms and improve
the overall investment climate, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The official expects inward direct investment to surge further
next year as South Korea plans to introduce a legislation aimed at
promoting foreign investment and scrapping the outdated Foreign
Capital Inducement Act.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, aggregate foreign direct investment in
South Korea had reached 16.52 billion U.S. dollars, of which 5.53
billion U.S. dollars came from Japan, followed by the United
States with 4.83 billion U.S. dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A young Namibian woman,
who was diagnosed HIV-positive in August this year, has gone
public and dedicated her life to creating awareness about AIDS
among other young people.
</P>
<P>
Emma Tuahepa-Kamapoha, 21, was the first Namibian woman to
disclose her AIDS status in a country where 108,000 out of the
1.6 million population are estimated to be infected with the
virus which causes AIDS, reported the South African Press

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Prevents Illegal Departures for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 28 (Xinhua) - Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet has ordered localities, ministries and offices to take
actions to prevent illegal departures to Hong Kong in an
instruction to check the on-going illegal immigration, Vietnamese
News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The VNA quoted the instruction as saying that 'the continuation
of illegal immigration into Hong Kong has affected the Vietnamese
government's endeavours to work together with the British
administration in Hong Kong and the UN Commissioner for Refugees
(HCR) for the return of more than 11,000 boat people remaining in
camps in Hong Kong.'
</P>
<P>
The primer minister's instruction said 'within the framework of
the comprehensive programme of action (cpa), the issue concerning
the repatriation of Vietnamese boat people denied refugee status,
has been basically solved in coordination with Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is striving hard to complete the return of the boat
people remaining in camps in Thailand and Hong Kong before July
1st, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the illegal immigrations of Vietnamese
people into Hong Kong has increased recently. From January to
October of 1996, 780 people have fled the country by boat to Hong
Kong and 32 others have illegally stayed on there after visiting
as tourists.
</P>
<P>
The instruction also outlines drastic measures to ensure the
effective prevention of illegal immigrations into Hong Kong,
including information on the hand-over of China by July 1997, the
HCR's decision to give no more financial supports to repatriation
as well as re-integration of illegal immigrants into Hong Kong
from February 14, 1994, and the increase in tight land border and
coastal patrols.

</P>
<P>
About 14 million U.S. Dollars will be spent over the next

</P>
<P>
After signing the agreements, Rod Pullen, deputy British high

<HEADLINE> Israel To Set Up Anti-Guerrilla Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) has decided to set up a new anti-guerrilla school to train
soldiers to be sent to Lebanon, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The training is to be run by the IDF Northern Command from a
base in Elikim and is to consolidate anti-guerrilla combat
techniques that until now were passed on to troops in a
haphazard way -- sometimes even after they were deployed along
the front.
</P>
<P>
Since Israeli troops intruded into Lebanon in 1982 and
occupied south Lebanon as a buffer zone, Lebanese Moslem
militants have carried out a protracted anti-Israeli guerrilla
war. Although Israel has repeatedly declared that it has no
terriorial claim against Lebanon, yet it refuses to withdraw
from its self-styled "security zone" in accordance with
U.N. Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
"The change will allow us to (calculate) the level of
combating guerrillas of the various units and will now enable us
to determine a certain threshold which all units must reach,"
Brigadier General Yair Naveh, chief of infantry and paratroops,
told the IDF weekly magazine Bamahane.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebrew weekly, the decision to set up the
new school was made to meet the changing demands of
border-security operations. Anti-guerrilla training now receives
precedence over other combat training.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the IDF has decided to introduce anti-guerrilla
tactics in its fight against the Lebanese Hezbollah forces shows
that Israel has begun to acknowledge it is fighting a guerrilla
war in the Lebanese territory. It used to call the Hezbollah
guerrillas "terrorists."

TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
decided to seek parliamentary approval of a legal step to backdate
the validity of music copyrights by 50 years to match an
international standard, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, taken at a meeting of vice ministers, is in line
with a recommendation made in September by a subcommittee of the
Copyright Council, an advisory body to the education minister, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The government will submit a bill to revise the 1970 Copyright
Law to a 20-day extraordinary Diet session to be convened Friday,
they said.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is approved by the Diet, copyrights on sound
recordings will be protected for 50 years retroactively to conform
to a standard set by the World Trade Organization (WTO), they said.
</P>
<P>
The existing law provides only for the protection of sound
recordings copyrighted in and after 1971, when it took effect.

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Convertible Under Current Account in Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's currency, the Renminbi
yuan, will be convertible under the current account as of December
1, according to the People's Bank of China today.
</P>
<P>
Starting December 1, China will undertake the obligations set
forth in the No.2, No.3 and No.4 clauses of Article Eight of an
agreement of the International Monetary Fund, Dai Xianglong, the
central bank governor, said in a letter to the IMF Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This move is four years ahead of China's original self-imposed
deadline of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The IMF welcomes China's move to make its currency convertible
under the under account, Michel Comdessus, managing director of the
IMF, said in a statement in response to Dai's letter.
</P>
<P>
Comdessus said that the yuan's convertibility under the current
account, which includes trade, labor and tourism as well as normal
short-term banking and credit facilities, represents yet another
milestone in China's effort to integrate itself into the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
The yuan's current-account convertibility will further boost
confidence in the bright prospects of China's reform and be
conducive to the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PBC said in a news release that making the yuan convertible
under the current account reflects China's increased macro-control
ability and indicates that the Chinese government is capable of
managing its international payments through indirect macro-control
means and of maintaining the stability of the yuan's value.
</P>
<P>
The yuan's current-account convertibility will help create a
favorable condition for China's foreign trade and foreign
investment in China, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It noted, however, the yuan is still not fully convertible
after removal of restrictions on transactions under the current
account.
</P>
<P>
It added that China will continue to maintain some restrictions
on payments under the capital account, which includes direct
investment, international loans and security trading.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World Bank's resident mission in
China has said that "It's important for China to maintain the
capacity to monitor and control capital flow to and from the
country."
</P>
<P>
Chinese individuals still can not buy or sell foreign exchange
freely in the country, nor can they pay in foreign exchange,
the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It will still take a fairly long time for China to make the
yuan freely convertible, which is the ultimate goal of China's
foreign exchange reform, the PBC said.

<HEADLINE> China's Statement On Britain's Revision Of HK Crimes Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of China's State Council today issued a statement
on the revision of the Crimes Ordinance by the British Hong Kong
government, saying that the action exceeds the limit of the
British side's power and is unacceptable to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
The statement contains a quote from Article 23 of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which
says: "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact
laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession,
sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or
theft of state secrets."
</P>
<P>
In view of that, the statement says, the enacting of related
laws is a matter for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
to attend to. "The British Hong Kong government is forcefully
revising the existing Crimes Ordinance before 1997 and claims that
it is for the purpose of enacting laws to implement Article 23 of
the Basic Law, but which is, in essence, an infringement of the
legislative power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
and a violation of the provisions of the Basic Law," the statement
says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side cannot accept such actions that exceed the
limit of the British side's power and meddle in the affairs of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the statement points
out. The Chinese side stated once again that every stipulation of
the Basic Law should be fully implemented, the statement says.

<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. deputy chief of mission
to Zimbabwe James Carragher on Wednesday said lack of
transparency could harm economic relations between southern
Africa and the west.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Bulawayo (the country's second largest city)
welfare society meeting, Carragher cited Zimbabwe as an example
for not following proper tender procedures in the awarding of
major contracts.
</P>
<P>
"Some recent projects awards frankly, simply do not meet
reasonable standards of fairness and transparency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carragher warned if the tender process was not strictly
observed, Zimbabwe would have made itself a partner in
substandard deals and damage its international reputation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe recently sold a 50 percent share in the huge Hwange
Thermal Power Station to YTL, a Malaysian firm, for a reported
600 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said American firms had been disadvantaged and
efforts to promote their business interests here would suffer as a
result.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- More than one in three
Australian households have at least one separate mobile phone and
a personal computer, according to official figures released here
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.4 million homes, about 36.1 percent of the total
households in Australia, have mobile phones, with the wealthiest
households six times as likely as their low-income counterparts to
have a mobile, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The richest households are also more likely to have two or more
separate telephone numbers -- 13.3 percent they have, compared to
2.3 percent of the low income earners.
</P>
<P>
In nearly one-third of households, at least one person
frequently used a computer at home and 83.8 percent of those
households also used a printer.
</P>
<P>
Just less than 15 percent of all households have CD-ROM
equipment, 7.8 percent a modem and 2.1 percent a character or

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Use Beetle to Eradicate Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
scheduled to start the biological eradication of the hyacinth
weed in Lake Victoria next month, according to a "Kenya Times"
report today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Director of the Kenya Agricultural
Research Institute (KARI), Cyrus Nderitu, as saying that KARI
will launch the biological eradication process through the use of
beetles and ducks for a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the beetles would be more efficient in
eradicating the weed than chemicals, which he said were not only
environmentally unfriendly, but also expensive and in lack of
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
However, the official pointed out that the local community
would not expect an overnight eradication as it would take at
least three years to get the weed under control.
</P>
<P>
Nderitu said that KARI would consider issuing the beetles to
most of the households around the lake in near future for rearing
so that they may multiply faster.
</P>
<P>
His institute had marshalled massive international efforts of
introducing beetles and ducks into the Lake, he said.
</P>
<P>
KARI has already received 37,000 U.S. Dollars from the World
Bank for the biological eradication project.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank agrees to allocate about 70 million U.S.
Dollars through the global environment facility to three east
African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for the Lake
Victoria Environmental Program to eradicate the weed.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the
world, is threatened with a number of ecological problems,
particularly the the fast-spreading weed of water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive report on the current status of the lake by
the Intermediate Technology Development Group revealed that the
lake's resources were being squandered and unless preventive
action was taken, the livelihood of close to 30 million people in
the region would hang in the balance.

At a meeting of senior officials at Keidanren and the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Keidanren Chairman

cabinet's sweeping reform agenda which also covers the financial
system, fiscal spending, social welfare and the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
MITI expects to release basic guidelines of the reform and
short-term reform objectives by the end of the year, while mapping
out medium-term objectives by next spring.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said today Malaysia is ready to buy technology that is
needed to make the country an advanced technological state.
</P>
<P>
While opening the 280-hectare Technology Park Malaysia (TPM)
near here,  Mahathir, who put forth the "Vision 2020" which aims
at turning Malaysia into a developed country by that year,
expressed his confidence that Malaysians can master the skills and
technological edge to catch up with the rest of the industrialized
world.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had to leap-frog into the electronics edge and
this would require people who are more intelligent and better
trained than the first industrialized edge in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Malaysians can master the skill. It is a matter of
applying yourself and if you keep trying and trying, you will
master the technology and knowledge that is required and that must
be acquired by us," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the prime minister visited the
exhibition put up by tenants of the park and the prototype center
in the park which is fully equipped with the latest technology
such as fiber optics, Internet communications and prototyping
facilities for its tenants.
</P>
<P>
The TPM which began construction in 1988 will serve as a nerve
center for research development and innovation in high technology
for the country.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the park costing 237 million ringgit (94.8
million US dollars) has been completed with focus on information
technology, software development, microelectronics,
telecommunications and aerospace technology.
</P>
<P>
The 226-million ringgit (90 million dollars) second phase is
expected to be ready in the year 2000 targeting to promote
research and development for biotechnology, medical and
environmental technology, agriculture, health, energy and

The ACFTU has called for efforts to promote the project,
proposing that within three years the project be a functioning
mutual-help system for Chinese workers to supplement the national
social security system.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU has allocated 9.5 million yuan (1.14 million US
dollars) in relief funds to help poor workers survive through this
winter.
</P>
<P>
The organization also plans to earmark an additional six million
yuan (722,000 US dollars) for local trade unions to use for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese economy undergoes market-oriented restructuring,
many Chinese enterprises are expected to suffer losses due to poor
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
However, an effective national social security network that
includes unemployment insurance as well as other welfare benefits,
has yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Chinese trade unions have helped 8,500
unprofitable enterprises, 3,000 of which were subsequently able to
reduce their losses and begin to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions have also opened more than 200 employment
agencies to help 150,000 laid-off workers find new jobs.

<P>
YANGON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Myanmar's State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and Prime Minister Than
Shwe left for Indonesia today for an informal meeting of heads of
state of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN gathering in Jakarta will be attended by heads of
state of the seven ASEAN member countries and leaders of Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar -- the three observer countries of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe is accompanied by the SLORC's First Secretary Khin
Nyunt, Minister for Information Aye Kyaw and Minister for Foreign
Affairs U Ohn Gyaw.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar obtained the observer status at the ASEAN foreign
ministers' meeting in Jakarta last July and formally applied for
full integration into ASEAN when Than Shwe visited Malaysia in
August.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is to host the Association's 30th anniversary
celebrations in July 1997 and has expressed full support for
Myanmar's entry into ASEAN next year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Ajit Singh, who visited Myanmar
early this month, said that Myanmar was almost ready for ASEAN
membership and had no difficulty in acceding to ASEAN agreements
and financial obligations, including joining the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting next July would make the decision on
Myanmar's ASEAN membership.
</P>
<P>
Singh also said that ASEAN would not interfere in Myanmar's
internal affairs in the integration process.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has
over 5,326 tariff lines, with 60 percent of them having zero- to
five-percent tariff rates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Governor Strives to Move Confederate Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. South Carolina Governor
David Beasley strove Wednesday to persuade leading politicians of
his state into agreement to move the Confederate battle flag
off the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
Beasley, a Republican, was gathering the bipartisan supports in
hopes of resolving a bitter feud over the flag, which many blacks
regard as a symbol of slavery and racism, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond said in a letter that the
flag, put atop the dome in 1962 to pay tribute to Civil War
soldiers, is now dividing the state's citizens. Thurmond said he
supports his fellow Republican's effort and acclaimed it as a way
"to continue to honor history while looking forward."
</P>
<P>
But opposition remains in the public and within Republican
ranks.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was to move it to a Confederate monument on the
Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Jim Clyburn, the state's lone black congressman, wants
the flag moved but suggested moving it to a prominent monument at
the foot of the Main Street.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very difficult undertaking for the governor. He's got a
great fight on his hands," said Republican House Speaker David
Wilkins, usually Beasley's stalwart supporter in the legislature.

<HEADLINE> Tallest Building in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Developers from the coastal
Chinese city of Tianjin and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have plans
to build a commercial building in Tianjin, the largest port in
north China, which will be taller than any existing building in
Tianjin or Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 51-story, 220-meter-high Tianjin-Inchon Building will be
funded by the Tianjin Municipal Development Zone Investment
Co. Ltd., the Municipal Government of ROK's Inchon City, and the
Daewoo Group. Total cost is estimated at 190 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The building will cover a 15,760-sq-m land area and will house
offices, apartments, exhibition halls, department stores, and
restaurants. The complex is scheduled for completion in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the ROK had invested in 5,800 ventures in
China, with a pledged investment worth six billion US
dollars. Tianjin is a major focus of the ROK investment, with the
giants Daewoo, Samsung, and Goldstar all active there.

<P>
DHAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina is expected to sign an agreement on sharing Ganges
water with India when she visits New Delhi next month, a
government spokesman said here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that the prime minister will visit India next
month, and the visit will take place for signing agreement," the
spokesman said after official talks between Bangladeshi Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad and visiting Chief Minister of India's
West Bengal Jyoti Basu.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the date of Hasina's visit would be
decided later and that officials of the two countries would meet
before the summit between Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart
Deve Gowda in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
During the talks on Wednesday, Azad and Basu mainly discussed
the crucial issue of apportioning the dry-month flow of the Ganges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was positive, both sides displayed positive
attitudes," the spokesman said, adding that "the discussion will
continue over the next few days."
</P>
<P>
The Ganges dispute has been a major irritant in relations
between the two countries ever since India built Farakka barrier
in West Bengal state near Bangladesh's northern border in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka says India diverts much of the river's water during the
dry season and releases excess water in the monsoon season,
causing extensive flooding in Bangladesh.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia opened its
Technology Park today in a bid to spearhead the country's
advancement in technology research and development.
</P>
<P>
The 280-hectare park, officially opened by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, is one of the key elements of "Vision 2020" of

and prototyping facilities. It has 32 tenants at present.
</P>
<P>
The TPM is located within Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor
south of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Its first phase, which was started in 1988 at a cost of 237
million ringgit (about 94.8 million U.S. dollars) and already
completed, focuses on information technology, software
development, microelectronics, telecommunications and aerospace
technology.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, being built a cost of 226 million ringgit
(about 90 million U.S. dollars), is expected to be ready in 2000
with an aim to promote the research and development of
biotechnology, medical and environmental technology, agriculture,
health, energy and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
According to TPM Managing Director Mohamad Salleh, the
infrastructural support facilities in the park will enable
Malaysian companies to penetrate into international markets.

<HEADLINE> Penholders Retain Grip of Table Tennis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Playing table tennis with a
penhold grip is never a dying art.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, a proud defender of the Chinese traditional
hitting style, swept the Olympic and World Cup titles,
rejuvenating what once had been branded as outdated as the wooden
tennis racket, the scissor-style high jump and bowling underarm in
cricket.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese predicted that the penhold style would
never join these quaint sporting bygones.
</P>
<P>
"It's improper to say that the penhold grip has headed for a
Darwinian-style extinction and the handshake style has triumphed
over penhold," said world runner-up Liu, who has just one trophy
away from the sport all-time great Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden, a
handshaker who has won Olympic, world and World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
The two styles play as their names suggest. A handshaker grips
the racket as of if he is shaking someone's hand and uses one side
of the racket for forehands and the other for backhands.
</P>
<P>
A traditional penholder uses only one side of the racket for
both strokes and grips the racket as if holding a pen.
</P>
<P>
The hanshake grip has advantages, and disavantages. The same
with the penhold.
</P>
<P>
The handshake style, or tennis grip, allows players to attack
easily with topspin or flat shots from both sides of the table.
But it leaves an opening in the middle of the table.
</P>
<P>
The penhold grip, on the other hand, is well suited for flat
forehands and defensive dropshots but is short on backhand power.
</P>
<P>
"You can never judge which hitting style is better. It's the
one who plays that style counts," said Zhuang Jiafu, a former
coach on the Chinese national team, as he commented on Liu's
latest two confrontations with his German foe Jorg Rosskopf.
</P>
<P>
In the British Open early this year, Liu was so nervous in the
deciding fifth game against the hanshaking Rosskopf as he dropped
the racket twice to the ground and only got five points.
</P>
<P>
A maturer Liu took a sweet revenge in the Atlanta Olympic Games
as he overwhelmed the German in four sets with ferocious forehands
and wickedly deceptive serves.
</P>
<P>
"The one who takes initiative in attacking and has strong
nerves can triumph," said Zhuang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister
Gyula Horn has urged President Arpad Goncz to sack Agriculture
Minister Laszlo Lakos, the Hungarian Telegraph Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Horn said Lakos' policies have failed to help Hungary in its
bid to join the European Union, Horn said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector in Hungary, which employs some nine
percent of the workforce, has been undergoing serious structural
problems during the country's transition to a Western-style market
economy.
</P>
<P>
If Lakos is sacked, he will be the eleventh minister to leave
the coalition government led by Horn since it was formed after the
general election in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
Many of those ministers have resigned. The labour minister
resigned in protest at the consequences of the government's
austerity program and the high-profile reformist finance minister
Lajos Bokros resigned in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's Minister of Commerce and Industry Tamas
Suchman was sacked in October after a privatization scandal.

<HEADLINE> Penholders Retain Grip of Table Tennis (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Penhold vs. handshake is virtually Asia against Europe.
</P>
<P>
The handshaking Europeans dominated the world championships
until the 1950s whereas the penhold grip was regarded ineffective
and handshake advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese turned the table for penholders in 1950s,
clinching a lion share of the world titles at stake.
</P>
<P>
China ruled the roost in the 1960s after sending to
international competitions mostly with pendolders who played an
aggressive attack-and-block game close to table.
</P>
<P>
Europeans pulled even with Asians in 1970s as they became to
play a game mixing Chinese fasting-attacking with Japanese
top-spin play.
</P>
<P>
Europeans honed their speed-and-spin play in the 1980s to
snatch three world men's singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Waldner won in 1989, compatriot Jorgen Persson clinched the
1991 championship and Frenchman Jean-Philippe Gatien won in 1993,
forcing these defenders of the penhold grip to improve on the
style.
</P>
<P>
At last, China produced a Liu Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the traditional penholders, Liu sticks rubber onto both
sides of the racket and plays top spin with backhand.
</P>
<P>
Jumping into fame as a 16-year-older after upsetting Waldner in
the 1992 China Open, Liu downed the Swede again in the 1995 world
championships and then the 1996 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
With nearly perfect footwork, Liu attacks from both flanks of
table. Once forced onto the defensive, he block, plays loop with
backhands or counterattack with forehands.
</P>
<P>
Liu's serve is so varied and deceptive that even Waldner, long

<HEADLINE> Technology Park Opened in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia opened its
Technology Park today in a bid to spearhead the country's
advancement in technology research and development.
</P>
<P>
The 280-hectare park, officially opened by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, is one of the key elements of "Vision 2020" of
the government, which strives to attain the status of a developed
country by that year.
</P>
<P>
The Technology Park Malaysia (TPM) is fully equipped with the
latest technology such as fiber optics, Internet communications
and prototyping facilities. It has 32 tenants at present.
</P>
<P>
The TPM is located within Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor
south of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Its first phase, which was started in 1988 at a cost of 237
million ringgit (about 94.8 million U.S. dollars) and already
completed, focuses on information technology, software
development, microelectronics, telecommunications and aerospace
technology.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, being built a cost of 226 million ringgit
(about 90 million U.S. dollars), is expected to be ready in 2000
with an aim to promote the research and development of
biotechnology, medical and environmental technology, agriculture,
health, energy and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
According to TPM Managing Director Mohamad Salleh, the
infrastructural support facilities in the park will enable
Malaysian companies to penetrate into international markets.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Summit Set to Compromise Over Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite a row between
industrialized and developing nations over a fund to protect the
ozone layer, the world Ozone Summit is expected to strike a deal
on the issue today.
</P>
<P>
But experts believe the amount of money on offer will barely be
enough to help developing countries implement projects to curb the
use of harmful gases.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit which ends today, is set to agree on a 500
million U.S.-dollar financing program to encourage the lower use
of substances harmful to the ozone layer and to boost production
of substitutes.
</P>
<P>
But that's some 300 million dollars lower than the 800 million
dollars developing countries claim they need to meet the targets
set by international accords on protecting the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the meeting, which drew 164 countries to Costa Rica,
was to replenish an international fund to accelerate the process of
reaching the goals set by the 1987 Montreal Protocol, Costa Rica's
Environment Minister Rene Castro said.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, ratified by at least 150 countries, called for
the gradual phasing out of ozone-depleting chemicals, and set up
the Multilateral Fund to help pay for a shift to substitutes.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's opening speech, Costa Rica's President Jose Maria
Figueres urged the industrialized countries to put up more money
to safeguard the ozone layer, which filters out harmful
ultraviolet rays believed to cause skin cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
He was representing the developing nations who don't have
enough money to implement costly control measures over the
destructive substances which include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
halons and methyl bromide.
</P>
<P>
CFCs are widely used in refrigerators and aerosols, halons are
used in fire extinguishers and methyl bromide is important in
making pesticide.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the Montreal Protocol, the industrialized
countries have reduced CFC production from 1 million tons a year
to 13,000 tons and restricted them to medical use.
</P>
<P>
But in the developing countries, CFC production has surged from
100,000 to 150,000 tons as alternatives to these products are
often too expensive to be accessible to small companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts say developing countries need additional funding to
speed up the process toward reaching the Montreal Protocol target
of eliminating CFCs in developing countries by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries of the Group of 77 and China estimated
that industrialized nations, major producers of the
ozone-destroying chemicals, should provide more than 800 million
dollars over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the rich nations, particularly the United States,
France, Japan and Australia, insisted they could only spend 510
million dollars to replenish the Multilateral Fund.

<P>
JAKARTA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Jakarta District
Court Wednesday sentenced 115 supporters of Megawati
Soekarnoputri, former leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI), to four months and three days in jail each for their
involvement in the July 27 riot in the city.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced one person to one month in jail and
freed eight others at five separate trials, the local press

Megawati's supporters and those of her opponent, government-backed
PDI Chairman Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi replaced Megawati as the party's leader after a
government-backed congress held in Medan in north Sumatra in June.

<P>
On July 27, hundreds of supporters of Soerjadi attacked and
tried to take over the PDI headquarters in central Jakarta which
was occupied by Megawati's supporters.

<P>
YINCHUAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region now has several large high-quality rice
production bases and has plans to export the rice in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, great efforts have been made by
the regional government to develop high-yield high-quality rice
production bases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that government departments have offered training
classes for farmers on planting techniques and to provide
technicians and pesticides for the production bases.
</P>
<P>
Yongning County has 2,200 ha of quality rice production bases
and 12 villages that have been listed as model rice zones.
</P>
<P>
In Qingtongxia City, a production line that can process 40,000
tons of rice has been completed, and the city's high-quality rice

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Fishermen Issue Shares for Ship-building Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- More than four billion yuan
(482 million US dollars) has been raised through a share-issuing
system in China's Zhejiang Province to build more than 4,000
deep-sea fishing vessels, to make the province's catch the biggest
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shares are being widely used in the fishing industry of the
coastal province, because large fishing vessels are too expensive
for individual fisherman to build.
</P>
<P>
"Now almost all fishing units in the province have been
established on a share-holding system, which will be further
applied to aquatic breeding and aquatic product processing,"
Governor Wan Xueyuan told a recent meeting on science and
technology in marine industries.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the province began its deep-sea fishing in
1985 to protect in-shore fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
"The number of vessels used in deep-sea fishing has risen from
29 in 1992 to more than 300 this year, and the area covered
includes the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean. The volume is
expected to hit 150,000 tons this year," Wan noted.
</P>
<P>
The province's Yuhuan County used to be a poverty-stricken
island, but its economic situation had a turn for the better when
the share system was used in its fishing industry in the early
1980s, causing the number of large fishing vessels to increase
rapidly to more than 200.
</P>
<P>
After that, share-issuing system was applied to other sectors
of the island, causing its economy to grow rapidly. It has been
listed as one of China's 100 counties with strongest economic
strength for two consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Brazil is Britain's Gateway to Latin America: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is Britain's biggest
market in Latin America and its gateway to Mercosur, the region's
biggest trade bloc, said British Minister of State of Industry and
Trade, Anthony Nelson, today.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who is on his second tour of the year to Brazil, said
in Sao Paulo that Britain had a special interest in investing in
the power generation and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said trade relations between Britain and Brazil should
develop strongly in the future. Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso's proposed visit to Britain in December 1997 will
be an important step in consolidating the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
Britain is also planning a conference in February 1997 on
business opportunities in Latin America to which Brazil will be
one of the countries invited.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is the largest trade bloc in Latin America. Its four
members, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, with a combined
population of 200 million and gross domestic product of 800
billion U.S. dollars, account more than one third of the region's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In the nine months to September 1996, bilateral trade amounted
to more than 2.2 billion dollars, with Brazil showing a small
trade surplus of about 100 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide strike of
public sector employees and workers in Venezuela entered its ninth
day today after the government failed to honor its promise to pay
overdue transport and food bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Freddy Iriarte, president of the Confederation of Venezuelan
Workers (CTV), said the government promised that it would pay the
bonuses to public workers today.
</P>
<P>
However, the money, though approved by parliament in the form
of an additional loan, has not reached the national treasury, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The union leader said he hopes the loan will be legalized soon
so that the government can give the order to pay, "thus putting an
end to union actions planned for the next few days."
</P>
<P>
The striking workers are also protesting against the mass
redundancies carried out in several ministries due to
restructuring and government reform.
</P>
<P>
These dismissals are in the Labor, Education, Health, Finance
and Development Ministries, according to CTV and the Federation of
National Union of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP).
</P>
<P>
Public sector employees and workers declared an indefinite
general strike on November 19 to press the government to pay the
transport and food bonuses which complement their salaries.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Ministers Meet on Production Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) met here
today to review the oil production following the return of Iraq to
the oil market.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to maintain the current ceiling of 25.03
million barrels a day, fixed at a ministerial meeting in June this
year.
</P>
<P>
The return of Iraq to the oil market would produce little
impact on the prices, they said, as they had already considered
every possible effect of resumption of Iraqi oil export for food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
An increased demand of world market could consume the limited
export of Iraq, and oil prices would not drop remarkably, the
ministers predicted.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling had been exceeded by 1 million barrels as a result
of the overproduction of most OPEC members, they said, but oil
prices were moving upward due to decreasing oil reserves and
increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iraq informed the United Nations it accepted U.N.
terms for monitoring an accord reached in May, which allows it to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over six months in return for
food and medicine. An embargo was imposed on Iraq after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting this afternoon, Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla
Salem El-Badri was elected new OPEC president, to replace Rakadh
Bin Salem Bin Hamed Bin Rakadh, oil secretary of the United Arab
Emirates. Oil Secretary of Quatar Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah
was elected vice president.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 40 percent of the world's oil output, OPEC's
proven reserves amount to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC, set up in September 1960, now groups Algeria,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, United Arabic Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> No Special Visas From Spain: Cuban Foreign Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Foreign Ministry denied
today that the Spanish consulate in Havana is to grant special
visas or process them at a faster rate for Cubans trying to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the announcement at the request of the
Spanish diplomatic mission in the capital in the wake of a row
between the two countries over comments made by Spanish diplomats
about the political situation in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"At the request of the kingdom of Spain, the Cuban Foreign
Ministry informed the people of Cuba that the Spanish embassy will
continue to offer services to the public as usual and without
change," said a ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people gathered around the embassy building on
Tuesday after rumors that special visas would be granted or issued
quickly by the Spanish embassy without having to go through the
normal procedures.
</P>
<P>
This followed comments made to a Spanish newspaper by Spain's
new ambassador to Cuba, Jose Coderch Planas, that his embassy's
door would be open to "dissidents" whom he would help in any way
he could.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has been angered by Coderch's comments and earlier this
week revoked its approval for the new ambassador to take up his
post in Havana. It accused him of interfering in its internal
affairs and breaching the 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations.

The row over Coderch's comments fueled a diplomatic spat that
started in early November after Spain's Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes said on Spanish television that his government's policy
was to lend support to what it called a "peaceful transition to
democracy in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has accused Spain of becoming a spearhead
for U.S. interests against the Caribbean nation. The U.S., which
has operated an international economic embargo against Cuba for
the last 36 years, tightened sanctions in March this year after
the downing of two civilian U.S. planes allegedly over Cuban
waters.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Pornography Campaign Goes Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An anti-pornography campaign
launched in Bialystok, Poland last August has been rolled out
across other major cities in the country including the capital
Warsaw, the Polish Telegraph Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Many non-governmental organizations and a few local governments
have joined in the fight to control and eradicate pornographic
material including newspapers, magazines and video tapes.
</P>
<P>
Anti-pornography campaigners are calling for a complete ban on
the sale of pornographic material in the country. They say they
will bring lawsuits against those who continue to sell such
products.
</P>
<P>
They are also appealing to parents, teachers and the national
media to support the crusade. The Polish Youth Association has
vowed to push the struggle until no pornographic products are on
sale.
</P>
<P>
The widening campaign comes as police in Poland start
investigating the biggest paedophile ring ever uncovered in the
country. A 44-year-old local government official and former army
officer is alleged to have been at the heart of the ring which
organized sex between under-age boys and men from Poland and other
European countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Willing to Negotiate Over Military Bases in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
expressed today its willingness to hold negotiations with Panama
over its military bases in this country.
</P>
<P>
Panama has reiterated that the only possible way for the United
States to reach an agreement on the bases would be through a
significant economic compensation.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the U.S. embassy said that "we will remain
prepared to initiate exploratory talks over the military bases
with the Panamanian government."
</P>
<P>
This initiative is being taken in spite of the fact that last
week Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares and Foreign
Minister Ricardo Arias said that the issue of the bases "is not on
the table" of negotiations because the United States had said
before that it would not pay Panama for letting them stay.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and his Panamanian counterpart
Perez Balladares agreed in September 1995 to initiate talks on the
continued presence of the U.S. military, and after that there have
been several informal contacts between the two governments.

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ion Diaconescu, chairman of
the leading Romanian National Peasant Party, was elected speaker
of the Chamber of Deputies, the parliament's lower house today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the chamber, Diaconescu, 78, asked lawmakers
to give up luxury cars, bodyguards and escorts and to adopt an
austerity regime.
</P>
<P>
"We, the parliament, have to be an example for the whole
country," said Diaconescu, who defeated Adrian Nastase, former
lower house speaker, with 207 votes against 114.
</P>
<P>
Born in Arges county, Romania, on August 25, 1917, Diaconescu
entered politics in 1936 as a member of the youth organization of
the National Peasant Party before graduating from Bucharest
Polytechnic Institute. He worked in the Romanian Economic Ministry
in 1942-1947 before being arrested and spending 17 years in jails
for political reasons. In May 1990, Diaconescu became a member of
the lower house and was elected chairman of the National Peasant
Party in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, former Prime Minister Petre Roman was elected
speaker of the Senate, the parliament's upper house, making him
the nation's second most powerful politician.
</P>
<P>
Under the Romanian constitution, the head of the Senate takes
over the president's duties if the latter is unable to

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Revenues From Ship Registrations Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Panama collected 31.3
million U.S. dollars between January-October of this year in ship
registrations, an increase of 1.8 percent over the same period in
1995, an official from the Ministry of Finance and Treasure said
today.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Sofer, the official in charge of ship affairs, said
Panama's ship registrations continue to exceed budget estimates,
according to statistics for October.
</P>
<P>
The number of vessels registered in Panama has risen by 475, or
3.6 percent, to 13,699 this year, with a deadweight of 103.5
million tons, up 10.5 million tons over last year.
</P>
<P>
Panama has been leading the world in the registration of
merchant vessels since June 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sofer attributed part of the reason to William O'Neil,
secretary general of the International Maritime Organization
(IMO), who has reinforced the organization's open registration
policy.

<HEADLINE> Doping Bans Should be Shorter, IOC Medical Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Shorter bans would replace the
current fixed-term sanctions against athletes who fail dope tests,
said Prince Alexandre de Merode, the medical chief of the
International Olympic Commission (IOC) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time for fixed suspensions is over. They will
always be questioned by the law courts," De Merode told a news
conference after a meeting of anti-doping experts.
</P>
<P>
"What is the point of an inapplicable sanction? Personally, I
think we should have shorter suspensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also had to adapt to the social evolution in
sports. As a result, I think we will try to find a solution that
is adequate for today's realities... Who does not evolve, dies."
</P>
<P>
De Merode suggested three proposals, starting with short,
flexible bans ranging from between one to six months.
</P>
<P>
A second measure would be to impose financial sanctions and the
third measure would be "educational" in nature, forcing an athlete
to remain under special surveillance for a period of up to one
year to prove his or her clean status.
</P>
<P>
"This would be a more modern solution. A fixed sanction is out
of date, it is no longer possible today," De Merode said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian State Suspends Blood Donation, HIV Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A state in eastern Ukraine
regarded as the country's main HIV carriers' base suspended blood
donations and HIV testing today after its last working blood
testing machine broke down.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Stepanets, a doctor at the only blood collecting
station in the Donetsk Oblast state, said funding from the
National AIDS Prevention committee failed to reach Donetsk in time
to fix the machines.
</P>
<P>
The break down has also forced the closure of the AIDS
Prevention committee, Stepanets said, leaving prostitutes, drug
addicts and homosexuals prone to the HIV virus which causes AIDS
without help.
</P>
<P>
He said that even with the blood collecting station operating
normally, the center could only treat 10 percent of the region's
estimated 30,000 HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
Donetsk Oblast is a major base for AIDS sufferers and HIV
carriers in Ukraine, which has become an important channel for
drug trafficking from Southeast Asia to Europe because of its
geographic location.
</P>
<P>
Drug use has been one of the main ways AIDS has spread through
the former Soviet republic, which now has about 500,000 registered
drug addicts. The number is expected to quadruple by 2000,
experts say.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian President Orders to Form Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko today ordered the formation of the House of
Representatives, or the lower house, of the parliament, and urged
it into its first session.
</P>
<P>
He announced the presidential decree in the parliament in
Minsk, Belarus capital, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution approved by the nationwide
referendum held last Sunday, the parliament should have two
chambers, the lower and the upper, and the lower one should have
110 deputies, while the upper 64 members, up to one-third of which
will be appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
While addressing 122 old-parliament deputies loyal to him,
Lukashenko said earlier today that most of them would become
members of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the remaining 12 lawmakers, who supported him but
did not become the lower house members, he said he would
personally take care of their "employment."
</P>
<P>
All the 122 pro-Lukashenko lawmakers passed a law terminating
the powers of the Supreme Soviet, or the previous
parliament. Under the country's law, a total of 100 votes, a
simple majority of the 199-seat parliament, is required to pass
any motions.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told the lawmakers that the first extraordinary
session of the new lower house scheduled for Thursday will have
just one item on its agenda: the election of its chairman and
deputies.
</P>
<P>
In a confrontation between Lukashenko and the previous
parliament over the constitutional amendments in Sunday's
referendum, over 70 parliament deputies headed by Speaker Semyon
Sharetsky called for impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko won a decisive victory in the referendum,
as 70.5 percent of the voters supported him, and the new
constitution extended his powers and his term of office.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Terje Roed Larsen, a
Norwegian minister in charge of state planning, announced his
resignation today under the pressure of public criticism for
speculation and corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister without portfolio denied doing anything
wrong at a press conference held in Oslo, saying his resignation
was for the good of the government.
</P>
<P>
It was recently disclosed that Larsen was involved and gained a
big profit in a stock investment in the Fideco shares in the
1980s. With this event, the opposition parties also expressed
anger over the government's allocating too much money to the
United Nations Office at Gaza, where Larsen once worked.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation in
Oslo which led to the 1993 historic peace agreement between the
two parties, had been the U.N. vice secretary-general for Middle
East affairs since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Most Arrangements for Iraqi Oil Export Ready: UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported that most of the arrangements for
implementation of the "oil-for-food" formula are in place already.
</P>
<P>
In an interim report to the Security Council available today,
Boutros-Ghali said that the important steps for implementation of
Security Council resolution 986 have been taken thanks to the
"full cooperation" of Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
The steps include: the four oil overseers have been appointed;
contracts have been signed with firms which will supply inspection
agents to monitor Iraqi export of oil and confirm the arrival of
humanitarian supplies in Iraq; the distribution plan has been
finalized and approved; a humanitarian coordinator has been
appointed to ensure equitable distribution of food and other
supplies; and the escrow account has been opened.
</P>
<P>
Though Iraq has raised several new issues, such as no
disruption of the implementation of resolution 986 once it has
begun, and receiving copies of the contracts signed by the U.N.
Secretariat with commercial firms related to the oil-for-food
formula, Boutros-Ghali believes that the Iraqi authorities will
abide by all their obligations under resolution 986 and the
memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq has provided assurances in this regard
through its permanent representative," he said.
</P>
<P>
On other requirements, the U.N. chief said, "I trust that I can
count on the government of Iraq to make every effort to facilitate
the work of the program as required by resolution 986 (1995) and
the memorandum of understanding, including the expeditious
issuance of visas, customs clearance of logistical equipment, such
as vehicles and communications facilities, and provision of office
space and accommodation."

ministers will meet in London earlier next month to discuss the
Northern Ireland peace process, according to reports from Dublin,
capital of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland and Prime Minister John
Major of Britain will review peace talks under way in Belfast as
the Irish leader tours European Union (EU) capitals ahead of an EU
summit in Dublin on December 13 and 14, the Irish government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Bruton's trip was announced one day after Major rejected
proposals by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), aimed at getting Sinn Fein invited to the peace talks
and restoring a broken 17-month IRA truce.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and Ireland refuse direct talks with Sinn Fein
because of the IRA guerrillas' return to war in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Major said Tuesday that Britain was not prepared to alter its
policy on Northern Ireland, asking the IRA to "call a cease-fire
and make it a credible cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said he did not believe
Major's response was a final or completely negative one.
Negotiations for a new cease-fire would continue, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Supports One-Year Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament
gave support today to a new multinational force in Bosnia for a
period of one year.
</P>
<P>
The new 31,000-strong Stabilization Force (SFOR) will replace
the current 60,000-strong Implementation Force (IFOR) after the
IFOR's one-year term expires on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb parliament took the view that activities of
the SFOR in Serb territory should be checked every six months to
make sure it was behaving in line with the Dayton peace accord,
the Tanjug news agency reported from Pale, the Serb administrative
center.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also approved a report by Serb President and
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Biljana Plavsic on the
reshuffle of the Serb army, and supported the decisions of the
Supreme Defense Council in this respect.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, the Supreme Defense Council appointed General
Pero Colic as chief of staff to replace General Ratko Mladic, who
was indicted by the international war crimes tribunal as a war
criminal. But Mladic and some of his closest aides, who were also
dismissed, are refusing to accept the decisions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb President Plavsic and Vice-President
Dragoljub Mirjanic held talks this evening in Pale with British
ambassador to Sarajevo Charles Crawford over preparations for a
London conference on the consolidation of peace in Bosnia
scheduled for December 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the conference program and the
implementation of the civilian provisions of the Dayton agreement,
Tanjug quoted the Serb presidential office's statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The London conference will focus on the implementation of
Dayton accords on the status of the international police force and
on arms control and on economic recovery and development in the
two entities in Bosnia, the human rights situation and the
repatriation of refugees.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Elimination of Coercive Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly adopted today a Libya-sponsored resolution, calling for
elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political
and economic compulsion.
</P>
<P>
In introducing the resolution, Mohamed A. Azwai of Libya
recalled that in 1996 the United States enacted laws punishing
non-American companies investing more than 40 million U.S.
dollars to develop petroleum resources in either Libya or Iran.
</P>
<P>
Those laws, he said, had caused "an international wave of
surprise." "They run counter to the principles of the Charter of
the United Nations, the principle of international law and the
Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five other member states joined in the call for
eliminating coercive economic measures as a means of political and
economic compulsion. Micronesia, Israel, the United States and
Uzbekistan voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Bohayevsky of Ukraine said that problems relating to that
situation were not only experienced by developing countries, but
also by new sovereign states experiencing the complication of
transition to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"Such politics had no prospects and threatened peace and
stability of relevant countries, as well as their region," he
said. "Ukraine calls for the unconditional and complete exclusion
of measures of economic compulsion from states' foreign policy
arsenals."

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Winston Lord will travel to Japan and Hong Kong Saturday for
meetings with Japanese officials about U.S. troops on the island
of Okinawa and for talks with Hong Kong officials, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Lord, who has just returned from a 12-day Asia tour with
President Bill Clinton, will "participate on Dec. 1-3 in the
meeting of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee," the so
called Two-plus-Two talks, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The participants include U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda and Fumio Kyuma, director general of Japan's
Defense Agency, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"The very important meeting" will review the final report of
the Special Action Committee on Okinawa, and after this session of
the Two-plus-Two, Lord will hold his own political and security
talks with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to keep a low profile in Okinawa by
cutting some troops there after the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl
by three U.S. servicemen in 1995 infuriated the residents who held
demonstrations protesting the American deployment on the island.
</P>
<P>
After his talks in Tokyo, Lord will travel to Hong Kong to hold
talks with Gov. Chris Patten and some other officials there.
</P>
<P>
Burns expressed the United States' support "for a smooth and
successful transition."

<HEADLINE> Lilic: Serbia Needs Internal Stability Above All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic said today that the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia needed
internal stability above all, taking into account the commitments
it would face upon reintegration in the international community.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to the press after casting his vote at
the third round of local elections held here today. Voters will
vote at 232 polling stations in 55 constituencies in 14
municipalities. The previous vote in these constituencies was
canceled under a court ruling for reason of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
President Lilic said Serbia especially needed a high sense of
responsibility of all its citizens, regardless of party
affiliation. After the third round of elections, Serbia will have
to undertake a great commitment, and will not need disagreements,
Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) boycotted today's
elections which it claimed victory in the second-round elections
on November 17. It has organized demonstrations and rallies in
Belgrade and some other major cities over the past week to protest
against the alleged election fraud of the government, causing high
tension between the opposition parties and the government.

WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An American, detained in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on spy charges,
was released and returned to home late this morning.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Evan Hunziker,
26, was "reunited with his parents and his siblings and friends
for Thanksgiving."
</P>
<P>
Hunziker's release, which was negotiated by Democrat
Representative Bill Richardson, could open a path for better

On arrival in Seattle to meet his relatives, Hunziker said that
the DPRK "treated me humanitarianly."

Hunziker was detained on August 24 when he entered the DPRK on
charges of espionage. But the United States denied the charges.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Important French Air Force Base Attacked by Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An important air force base of
the French troops in Corsica was attacked by a bomb early this
morning, said the French Mediterranean Air Force Region this
evening.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or injured in the bomb explosion, which
caused light damage to materials in the base in Solenzara, South
Corsica, said the air force region in a communique.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for French troops to be targeted by a
bomb attack on the Mediterranean island, which is engulfed in a
wave of attacks by Corsican separatists over the past several
months against government and paramilitary police targets.
</P>
<P>
Although so far no one has claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack, it was believed to be done by the separatists.
</P>
<P>
"On the Air Base 126 of Solenzara, at 03:55 (0155 GMT) on
November 27, an explosion caused damage on a house under repair
and which was not occupied. The damage, purely material, was of
slight importance," the communique said, adding that an inquiry
had been launched.
</P>
<P>
The air base, which was opened in 1960 on the eastern coast of
Corsica, is specialized in providing logistic support to French
troops stationed in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
It also serves as a reconnaissance center of the French troops
over the Mediterranean, and a shooting practice center for foreign
air force units trained by French troops.
</P>
<P>
French troops have reinforced patrols around the center, and
removed land mines from exterior areas of the base and replaced
them with electrified wires and anti-personnel radars.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Enforcement of Proposition to Dismantle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge today
blocked enforcement of a California initiative to dismantle
affirmative actions, saying civil rights groups have a "strong
probability" of proving it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson issued a temporary
restraining order barring Governor Pete Wilson and Attorney
General Dan Lungren from taking any action to enforce Proposition
209, at least until a hearing December 16, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ballot initiative, approved by nearly 55 percent of
California's voters on November 5, amends the state's constitution
to ban race and gender considerations in public hiring,
contracting and college admissions.
</P>
<P>
State lawyers argued that Proposition 209 cannot be
discriminatory because it requires equal treatment. But the civil
rights groups that filed the lawsuit claimed that despite its
neutral wording, it would eliminate only programs that benefit
women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
Henderson's order said the civil rights groups had
"demonstrated a strong probability of success."
</P>
<P>
"Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment,"
the judge wrote. "The relevant question is whether, in reality,
the burden imposed by a law necessarily falls on minorities and
women."
</P>
<P>
The restraining order does not apply directly to local agencies
or to the University of California, which already has taken steps
to notify new applicants that race and gender will no longer be
considered.
</P>
<P>
On December 16, Henderson will consider the civil rights
group's request for a preliminary injunction to prohibit
enforcement of the measure until the lawsuit goes to trial. Unlike
today's order, that injunction could be appealed to a higher
court.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say it could take a year or more before there is
a definitive ruling. That was the case with California's
Proposition 187, which would have denied most public services to
illegal immigrants. It was approved in 1994 but has been tied up
by court challenges ever since.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. National Guard F-16D
fighter plane crashed into a wooded hillside in southern Ohio
today, but the two crew members parachuted before the plane hit
the ground, a Defense Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The jet was flying a training exercise when the crash occurred
at about 11:15 a.m. local time, the spokesman said. The crew of
two were picked up by an Ohio sheriff and taken to hospital. No
one on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
The jet, a training version of the F-16, a high-performance
aircraft used widely by the Air Force and Navy, was assigned to
the 178th Fighter Wing of the Springfield Air National Guard, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The crash was at least the fifth in 1996 for the F-16. It was
also the second military plane crash in a week. Last Friday, an
Air Force HC-130 transport plane crashed into the ocean off
Northern California, killing 10 reservists.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 27 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks were mostly
lower today as investors moved to secure profits from this month's
rally as more contradictory economic data were issued.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.07 to 6,499.34.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with volume down to 377.11 million
shares, much fewer than 533.46 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.97 to 754.99, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.50 to 397.48.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.12 to 1,287.32, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.31 to 588.64.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were mostly lower, but the technology-rich
Nasdaq composite index closed at a record high for the third
straight session as bellwether computer-related shares bucked the
day's downward trend.
</P>
<P>
Oil shares were among the Dow's biggest decliners amid worries
that the potential return of Iraqi oil to the world supply will
hurt prices.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell from late Tuesday's
6.44 percent to nearly 6.38 percent before rising to 6.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that orders for big-ticket
manufactured goods unexpectedly edged up 0.1 percent in October.
Analysts had been expecting a decline of as much as 2 percent in
durable goods orders, following a huge 4.6 percent increase in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported today that the U.S.
economy was growing at a modest 2 percent annual rate in the third
quarter, slower than the 2.2 percent estimate released a month
ago, but not as low as many analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the number of Americans' first-time
claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged last week at
342,000.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States insisted
on its lone stand to oust U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and ruled out reviving its compromise offer that he
serve one more year.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said today, "The United
States has taken that offer off the table."
</P>
<P>
"Boutros-Ghali rejected that offer that Secretary (of State
Warren) Christopher made to him in their private discussions last
spring. And he has given no indication that he would be willing to
entertain such an offer now," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some European countries favored a limited
extension for Boutros-Ghali after his five-year term expires on
December 31.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States vetoed a proposal to
re-appoint Boutros-Ghali that was supported by all the other 14
members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
But in order that Africa should hold the post for a full 10
years, the United States has said it would give priority to other
African candidates.

The spokesman said it was "very encouraging" that Ethiopia was
reportedly to have urged other African states to come up with
alternative candidates from the continent.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Parliament Endorses Plan to Search for Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss parliament today
approved the government decision to create a commission of experts
to investigate into the whereabouts of both Nazi and Jewish wealth
held by Swiss banks during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The parliament approval means that Switzerland's strict laws on
banking secrecy will be eased and investigators will be able to
get access to all relevant bank files to try to find the lost or
stolen assets of victims of German Nazis as well as Nazi assets
brought into Switzerland during the war.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland enacted its famous bank secrecy laws in the 1930s
to draw deposits from Jews and others seeking a safe and neutral
haven to hide their assets from Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Bankers Association said in September last year that
it had found in a survey 775 accounts with 34.1 million U.S.
dollars that had lain dormant since 1945 that presumably belonged
to Holocaust victims. But Jewish organizations immediately
questioned the survey and said the actual figure might be
billions.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting international pressure, the Swiss government
recently agreed to take swift actions to clarify the issue in a
bid to restore the country's international prestige.

<HEADLINE> Preferential Treatment Found for US Officers at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Navy store in
Virginia routinely gave preferential treatment and inappropriate
discounts to senior officers and their families, a military
investigation report said.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation has confirmed that selected customers and/or
members of their families received preferential treatment in the
form of discounted merchandise, complimentary or discounted
services," said the report by a Navy's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
Admirals or their wives frequently were greeted at the door of
the Navy exchange by sales managers who escorted them while they
shopped, The Washington Post quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said this was contrary to a Naval policy of "equal
treatment-equal service" for all military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The report listed special deals, involving savings of up to 25
percent, extended to officers for such items as jewelry, alcoholic
beverages, Brooks Brothers suits, Christmas trees, crystal and
gift-wrapping services.
</P>
<P>
The Navy disclosed in September that some senior officers had
been admonished for their involvement in the case and had
reimbursed the Navy for the value of the discounts of up to 25
percent and special services received, which service spokesmen
said totaled less than 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. John T. Kavanaugh was the only name released by the
Navy. Kanaaugh ran the Navy Exchange Service Command. He's accused
of receiving a range of special services, from discount contact
lenses to converting home movies to videos.
</P>
<P>
The report by Naval Inspector General J.R. Fitzgerald also said
that exchange employees did carpentry work for officers at
discount prices and sometimes traveled around the state looking
for out-of-stock items requested by admirals.
</P>
<P>
The names of about two dozen other Navy and Marine officers,
most of them admirals, identified by the inspector general as
receiving favored treatment were deleted from reports prepared for
public release, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk exchange is one of 120 retail stores worldwide that
sell discounted goods to enlisted personnel and officers.

parliament tonight with a majority of deputies voting in favor of
a policy statement handed by the half-Moslem-half-Christian
government.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place following three days of debate on the
policy statement and a rebuttal by the billionaire prime minister
to 65 members of parliament who made their speeches since the
session opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Hariri's failure to curb rampant corruption and
improve socio-economic conditions in his four years in office was
a main tone in the debate, but most interlocutors said they would
give positive vote to the third government headed by Hariri.
</P>
<P>
In the government's policy statement released last week,
Hariri for the first time switched the focus to a promotion of
the people's living standards from the post-war reconstruction
programs.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the confidence of parliament, Hariri could
hardly have a joyful time for celebration because of a
nation-wide strike and demonstrations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition forces, led by the powerful Confederation of Trade
Unions, have called for the protests in support of popular and
press freedom for solution of the country's economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
Another immediate challenge the government is to face is how
to deal with the alleged scandals and corruptions in state
administration.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Loan for Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year loan for Madagascar under
the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), for an amount
equivalent to some 118 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The financing is provided to back the government's economic
reform program for 1996-99. The first annual loan, equivalent to
about 39 million dollars, is available in two equal semi-annual
installments.
</P>
<P>
Real per capita income in this eastern African country has
fallen over the past two decades by more than 40 percent. The
government's medium-term objectives are to restore confidence in
order to create conditions for a sustained recovery of private
investment, and to seek a reduction in poverty. Economic growth is
targeted to reach 4.5 percent by 1999 from 2 percent in 1996,
while annual inflation is expected to decline from 10 percent in
1996 to about 3 percent in 1999.
</P>

Under the medium-term framework, the 1996-97 program aims to
increase real GDP growth to 3.0 percent in 1997, to reduce
inflation to 7 percent by the end of 1997 and to contain the
external current account deficit at 7.2 percent of GDP in 1997.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls Israeli Settlement Policy Catastrophic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said today the Israeli government decision to expand settlements
in the occupied Arab territories is a "catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he previously agreed with late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin on not setting up any housing unit in any
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Israeli cabinet, however, announced this month
the establishment of three more settlements, most of them around
Jerusalem, Arafat said in an interview with Egyptian TV program
"Good Morning Egypt."
</P>
<P>
Hardline Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu vowed
Tuesday that he would continue expanding the settlements
regardless of the Palestinian outcry.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed his demand for the Palestinian-Israeli agreement
to be fully implemented, saying that Madrid peace talks were based
on land-for-peace principle to reach just and comprehensive
peace. "That's why it was called peace conference of the
courageous," he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council decided today to renew the mandate of the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for another period of
six months until May 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF was established by the Security Council in May 1974
to supervise cease-fire in the Israel-Syria sector.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution unanimously adopted this afternoon, the council
requested the U.N. secretary-general to submit, at the end of this
period, a report on the development in the situation and the
measures taken to implement Security Council resolution 338.
</P>
<P>
After adoption of the resolution, council president Nugroho
Wisnumurti of Indonesia issued a statement, which quoted the
secretary-general's latest report as saying that despite the
present quiet in the Israel-Syria sector, the situation in the
Middle East continues to be potentially dangerous and is likely to
remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement converting
all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached.
</P>
<P>
That statement of the secretary-general reflects the view of
the Security Council, the council president said.

<HEADLINE> French Government Adopts New Defense Service Draft Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
adopted a new defense service draft law which requires a five-day
compulsory defense education for each French citizen and
encourages voluntary service by the youths of the country.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon said that since France
is abolishing its 200-year-old universal conscription law before
2001, the country's youths will have fewer chances to strengthen
their sense of citizenship by serving in the army.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the five-day compulsory defense education, required
of all French youths from 18 to 25 years old, will help them build
a sense of citizenship, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac announced in February a drastic reform
of France's defense structure by abolishing the compulsory
conscription practised since the 1789 Revolution to build a purely
professionalized, more combat effective and smaller army.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed at a cabinet meeting today that the
traditional conscription responds "neither to the military needs
nor to the characteristic of our modern society" any longer.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory defense education, called "citizen's
rendez-vous," includes physical evaluation of the youths,
information on the institutions of the republic, building of
awareness about the fatal importance of defense for the nation,
and encouragement of youths to join voluntary service.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that the French society now calls for a social
cohesion because it is weakened by excessive individualism,
exclusiveness of different communities, social marginalization for
the poor, and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary service includes a nine to 24 month service by
the youths from 18 to 30 years old in the fields of defense,
security, international cooperation and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The new defense service will begin its experimental phase at
the beginning of 1997, and is expected to be adopted by the
National Assembly and the Senate at the same time.
